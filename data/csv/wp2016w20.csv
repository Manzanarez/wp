"[WP] Every person in the world has a television in their stomach, like the teletubbies. What the TV displays depends on the person's mood.",AeeeA,"Bill? Why is her screen blank?

At first I don't hear her, my beloved wife had regained her composure before I. 

Finally her words break through the barrier of confusion and despair, and I look up from the fuzzy screen on my daughters  tiny stomach. 

My wife rarely cries, the last time was when the doctors told us that we couldn't have kids. But we did, after four years of trying. The 9 months that followed were the best time we ever had together. 

She is crying now.

I look back down on my very alive baby daughter, and tears start to form in my eyes. Where are the comforting images of rainclouds? Why are there no autumn leaves slowly dwindling as they turn brown?

My eyes flutter between the two doctors in the room, but they offer no comfort. Their screens just as confused and frightened as mine.

The screens have always been there - some choose to hide them beneath clothes, and some not - but they have always been there. Some people are born with two screens, some even with tree. But the screens *always* shows something. It is a mean of silent communication, an anchor of sorts.

""It'll be okay"" I say and force a smile, but by the look in Bella's eyes, I can tell my screen tells a tale of its own. She tries to smile back at me, it is meaningless to me. 

I try to scream, but no sound escapes my dry throat. I fall down on my knees, ignoring the pain in my knee as I impact with the hard floor. I feel as though I have fallen through a crack in the surface of a frozen lake, which pulls me down into its depths.

"[WP] Write about a lovable character, then in the last line make me hate him.",Aocis,"He held out a nicely wrapped box with a perfect bow-tie on top. Kendra was surprised. An actual gift? The best anyone had ever done for her in the past was a verbal ""Happy birthday"" and a signed card. She looked up at him subtly confused. Red plaid shirt with yellow suspenders. Who was this guy? She hardly knew anything about him. After all, he's been here maybe a month, and now he's giving her a gift? Interesting.

""Thank you, um, sorry I don't know if we've formally been introduced,"" she said slightly embarrassed.

""Henry,"" He smiled.

""Henry. Thank you. How did you know it was my birthday?""

""Saw it on the calendar. We're on the same team. Figured I could get you a gift. To break the ice, i guess.""

She smiled back. ""I'll take a gift anytime. Thanks, Henry.""

She unwrapped the box. Two tickets to the hockey playoff game. *Wow*, she thought. 

""These are expensive. You shouldn't have,"" she protested.

""I was given them and I saw you had a hockey jersey hanging up in your office. I figured you would enjoy them more than me,"" he responded.

She stood up and hugged him. ""Thank you!""

""And you don't have to take me by any means. I don't even like hockey,"" he laughed.

""Seriously, perfect gift, Henry. Thanks again."" She was genuinely happy. She couldn't wait to tell her fiance. He loved hockey, too.

The day went on and Kendra plugged away at her work, but she couldn't help but notice nobody else was telling her happy birthday. Normally a random worker would pop in every so often and say ""Happy birthday"", but not today. It was nearly lunchtime and she had gotten only one ""Happy birthday"". From Henry. She tried her best to ignore it for the next hour, up until lunch, by focusing on her work.

The next hour was more of the same. People came in, but only to ask a question, or to give her paperwork. She bumped into her fiance in the break room and asked him if he would be free for lunch, but he said he promised a couple of his friends to meet already for lunch. She was pissed now. Not even her fiance told her ""Happy birthday"". She marched down to Henry's cubicle.

""Henry - wanna do lunch?"" Kendra had seen him several times eating by himself at his desk and in the breakroom. She thought he could use some company. She knew she could.

He was visibly excited. ""Sure!"" 

""Awesome! Let's go.""

Over lunch Kendra got to know Henry. What he was like, his hobbies, where he came from, etc. They got to talking about her and her fiance. She confessed how they had been shaky lately and now he was blowing her off on her birthday. She was nearly in tears, so Henry bought her a piece of devil's chocolate cake that came with a candle and had the restaurant staff sing to her.

She normally hated this type of thing, but today she didn't seem to mind. In fact, she enjoyed. She needed something like this. 

As the staff finished up singing she mouthed, ""Thank you"" to Henry and wiped clean her tears and escaping mascara.

In the parking lot on the way back to her office she stopped Henry short. ""Thank you for having lunch with me, Henry. I really needed this today."" She hugged him and kissed him on the cheek. He blushed.

""No problem. I wouldn't want to eat alone on my birthday, either!"" He said.

She nodded and they parted ways.

The rest of the day dragged on. More and more paperwork came in, but that was all that came in. No smiles. No cards. No gifts. The worst birthday she could have imagined. 

A call from Chris, her fiance, displayed on her phone. She ignored it. There was no way she was going to listen about him and his buddies AMAZING lunch today. She was feeling so livid she called down to Henry's desk phone.

""Hello?"" He answered.

""Yeah, I was thinking about those tickets you gave me.""

""Yeah?""

""I know you said you didn't like hockey, but would you wanna go with me? My fiance can't go,"" she lied. ""and was hoping you could.""

""I believe I'm free tonight. Sure. That'd be great.""

""Awesome. I'll pick you up at seven."" She hung up.

The day ended. She packed up her things and left the office without saying a word to anybody. If they couldn't even say the words ""Happy birthday"" then she wasn't going to be her normal chipper self and say ""bye"" to everyone, especially her fiance.

____________________________________________________________

Chris had tried Kendra again. For the third time. Her phone must be dead. He kept getting her voicemail. He decided to walk over to her office and hopefully see her there.

Her department was nearly deserted by now, save for a few strays. Kendra's light was off. *Damn*. Missed her. It was unlike her to not even say good-bye. *Hope she's alright*.

On his way out the company's whiteboard calendar caught his eye. *Better check on the upcoming week*. He scanned Monday through Friday of next week and made a few mental notes. He noticed a guy in yellow suspenders staring at him as he passed by out of the lobby.

He was about to leave when today, Friday, made him stop. A note had been erased. Not all the way, though. A remnant of red was still somewhat visible. Red was meant for somebody's birthday. He inspected it closer. *Oh no. But why?*. Somebody erased Kendra's birthday from the whiteboard.

"[WP] Write about a lovable character, then in the last line make me hate him.",Aocis,"A high school janitor stood in the hallway as classes were getting out on a Friday. Any other day and he’d have to stay a couple more hours and get the last of the cleaning done after the kids went home, but not Friday. Friday’s were bliss, they were God’s gift to the working man. On Friday, everyone from Principle Penis (no relation) to the hardest working, overachieving honors students ran home right at the last bell.

“Bye, Jimbo!” A scrawny, bespectacled student called from across the hall. It barely carried over the rabble of delighted voices catching up after class and making weekend plans.

“Have a good weekend, William,” the janitor smiled and waved.

The hum suddenly lowered noticeably, and Jimbo turned to see Principle Penis parting the crowded hallway like Moses with the Red Sea. Jimbo pushed off the wall and stood a little straighter.

“Excellent work this week, Jimbo,” the Principle said, stopping to shake the janitor’s hand on his way by. “I’ve never seen so much vomit in my life as when that Gershwin boy yuked up  his shrimp chowder the other day. We all owe you one for dealing with that.”

Jimbo laughed. “Just doing my job, sir,” he said humbly.

“I’ve always admired your humility, Jimbo,” the Principle clapped him on the back. “Enjoy your weekend. You’ve earned this one for sure.”

A few more students passed Jimbo on their way out. A line of tall boys in basketball jerseys jogged by, each high-fiving him as they passed him.

Finally, when everyone was gone, Jimbo locked the last of the school’s doors and made for his car. Just as he turned the ignition his wife called. She asked him to pick up some eggs on his way home.

“Will do, my love,” he said, a tender note in his tone. 

“You’re the sweetest,” his wife said. Two miles away, in their home, she smiled and bit her lip playfully.

They dawdled on the call, neither wanting to hang up first. After several minutes Jimbo said goodbye and told her he loved her. Twenty years of marriage and they’d managed to keep the spark alive.

Several minutes after that Jimbo pulled into the parking lot of a 7/11, his usual stop for small groceries on the way home from work.

“Howdy, Jimbo!” The cashier greeted him.  

“Heya, Ted,” Jim returned as he approached the counter with a carton of eggs. “How’s Darlene and the kids?”

“Could be richer,” the cashier joked. 

“Always room for that,” Jimbo chuckled. It was familiar banter for both men.
 
“Usual scratcher for ya, Jimbo?” Ted asked.

“Yes please, Ted. This is the one, I can feel it.”

Ted gave a tired smile; it carried the weight of the ten million times he’d heard that. Still, there was always hoping someday it would be the one. He handed the scratch card across the counter to Jimbo and watched him scratch away with a coin.

Suddenly Jimbo’s eyes lit up.

“What is it, Jimmy?” Ted asked, full of energy. “You win? What’d you get? What is it?”

“Woo!” Jumbo hollered. He danced in place for a second then handed the card back to to Ted.

“Ten grand?” Ted demanded. “Ten effin’ grand, Jimbo!?”

Jimbo pointed a finger to the ceiling. “Thank you, God!”

“Well I’ll be, Jimbo,” Ted was stunned. “I don’t think I know anyone who deserves this more than you. What’re you gonna do with it? Put down on a new home for the missus?”

Jimbo smiled wide at the cashier and said, “Oh no, my friend. This here is all going straight to Donald Trump’s presidential campaign! We’re go’n make ‘Merica great again!”",zarquon_himself
"[WP] Write about a lovable character, then in the last line make me hate him.",Aocis,"Norman had finished stacking the last of the boxes for the elderly Mr. Fritzgerald. He waved amiably to the grinning old man before setting off on his blue bicycle. As Norman bicycled to his destination, the people of Villiam County, USA, greeted him with cheerful smiles and open hearts.

The able-bodied young man had made a name for himself in this small town for being helpful and friendly. Norman worked at the post office delivering letters with a smile on his face. He was a reliable individual who always offered a shoulder to cry on and a open hand when you've fallen down. He would go out of his way to assist a stranger in need. He was a coward.

Norman arrived at the old stone bridge just as the sun was setting. The homely red and orange made for a very romantic scene. Juliet was not one of the prettiest girls in town, she was quite average. However she was kind to a fault and had a heart of gold. Norman strode up to her, full of confidence, and knelt down and presented a golden ring adorned with a diamond the size of a walnut. Juliet gasped, exclaimed an affirmative, and gripped Norman by the hand and sped off to plan their wedding. Norman was never happier in his life.

One thousand four hundred and fifteen miles away, a man screamed in a puddle of his own piss and shit. It was snowing outside, though the windows did nothing to keep the cold out. The man was eighty three, though in his mind he was still fourty. He screamed for the name of the son that abandoned him. When he realized he was never going to get an answer, his heart stopped, and he died alone.",Vaconius
"[WP] Write about a lovable character, then in the last line make me hate him.",Aocis,"""Dimitry!"" Dimitry turned, waving to the approaching form of Valentin. 

""Morning Valentin!"" Dimitry called back, voice muffled by his mask. 

""How's your daughter?"" Valentin asked. ""It was mail day yesterday, and you seemed excited.""

""Little Sasha said her first words yesterday!"" Dimitry said excitedly. ""She's turning one in just a week, and she's already talking!""

Valentin clapped his comrade on the shoulder. ""What'd she say?""

""She said 'Dimitry'!"" Dimitry was almost beside himself. ""She said my name!""

""That's great news!"" Valentin congratulated the exuberant father. ""We'll have a drink tonight to celebrate.""

Dimitry agreed, before Valentin said his farewells. He came across Krasimir, one of the gunners, who looked downcast.

""What's the matter big guy?"" Valentin asked, putting a hand on the giant man's shoulder.

""It's... Kalina's dead."" He replied, voice cracking in grief. ""Cave Ghouls came from one of the tunnels, dragged her off. They... they found the body...""

Valentin said nothing as Krasimir broke down, sobbing into his hands. He merely wrapped an arm around his friend's shoulders and stood there. Eventually, Krasimir looked up, eyes tinted-red beneath his goggles. 

""I... I don't think I can..."" He trailed off.

""I'll call in a couple favours, get someone else to handle your gun today."" Valentin said. ""Go rest, get a couple drinks.""

""Thanks, Valentin."" Krasimir said, standing. 

Valentin merely smiled and nodded, before walking towards his own gun. His ammo loader, Lana, was already loading the first shell. 

""We'll be ready to fire whenever, *komandant*."" She reported, saluting.

""Thanks, Lana. How's Lazar doing?"" Valentin asked.

She turned a crimson red, stuttering out a response.

""H-How d-did you..."" She trailed off as Valentin laughed.

""I knew it!"" He said, still laughing. ""Are you going to talk to him?"" 

""I... I..."" She couldn't form a coherent sentence. ""I... maybe...?""

""He loves *kolta* over every other drink."" Valentin offered, before looking to the sky. ""Hold that thought. It's time.""

He looked over to the other guns, where his unit was prepped and ready to the fire. They all gave him the go signal. He turned back to his own gun, grabbing the firing lever. 

""FIRING IN THREE... TWO... ONE..."" He pulled the lever at the same time as the others, the incendiary shell flying to the heavens before arcing back down to strike at the city below. 

He could hear the screams of the people inside as their homes were devoured by flames, and smiled. 

""Savages."" He pulled the lever again, as Vinnarra burned beneath him and ten thousand Pizarites died.

**(And they all lived happily ever after.)**

"[WP] Write about a lovable character, then in the last line make me hate him.",Aocis,"He was a natural blonde. God she loved that. The way the light danced around his hair made him seem angelic in contrast to the rest of the restaurant. His suit, his smile, the way he held the fork, all enchanted her like no other. 

And his voice. The words flowed from his mouth effortlessly like a silky river. Deep, yet still able to carry high tones. His speech was confident and assuring.

He was so sweet too. She couldn't believe that one person could find the time to do so much for others, and that he could care so much. This guy was perfect. Absolutely perfect.

He asked if she was done with her dinner, which took a second to compute. His eyes were so...

""Oh! Um, yes. I think so. How about you?""

He made a cute half-smile and said, ""Yeah. I think so too."" He then called over a waiter to get the check. Authoritative, yet still gentle. Sexy. She made an effort to snap out of her stupor and make conversation.

""So uh, how is working in a hospital?""

""It's quite wonderful. The people I help are truly in need, and it makes me glad to know that what I'm doing really helps them. Last week, a woman came in with her baby. They both had a severe infection in their throats. She kept telling me stories of little Sean's adventures as a baby through the night as I administered her medicine."" He sighed wonderfully looking lost in thought.

""The two were adorable together. Especially Sean. I started seriously thinking about having a family of my own someday."" Awh, a family. She felt about ready to settle down too. The prospect of having a baby frightened her years ago. Now, as she stared into his dreamy eyes, she had no problem with shoving a twelve pound human through her body.

He suddenly interjected himself. ""I'm sorry. I shouldn't be talking about the F-word on a first date."" She laughed, and he did too. Music. Sweet vocal music. 

The waiter dropped off the check. Both of them reached for it at the same time, their hands touched. He was so warm, and soft. It made her giggle. He smiled, and said ""No, I insist."" 

They both exited the restaurant. He said his home was a short walk away, so she followed him, just to keep him company. She could drive back later. 

He talked more about his job as a doctor, and she kept wanting to hear more. She didn't notice the alleyway they walked into.

He laughed at a small joke she made, then suddenly pinned her to a wall and pulled a small handgun on her.

[WP] You've just died... again.,Axing,"Last semester, as I descended into madness and a therapist diagnosed me with ""extreme academic anxiety"", I skipped all my midterms and didn't go to class for the rest of the year. December came around and there was no more hiding it. I told my parents that I had failed every class, and was expelled. Their disappointment drooped like a heavy fog over the air, and my shame created a black hole in my chest, threatening to consume myself and everything in existence. ""We can fight this,"" my mother said, looking at my father with determination. ""They can't kick her out after one bad semester"". And so we went through the process- the appeal, the notes from my therapist and my psychiatrist, the personal letter I wrote to the school. For the two month winter break my sagging flesh clung to the skeleton I called home, fingers weakly typing away and soul discarded into the wild. My rotting body was possessed by a demon that's been stalking me for years. All through private school, the weight of the wasted money pushing me down, curving my spine in unnatural ways. Here I was, fighting to spend more money at one of the most expensive private universities. My lungs had been long deflated, shriveled up and replaced by a dark cavity, when I got back in. The school was giving me one more chance.

So I came back, with makeup over the bruises and a wig to cover the hair that was falling out due to stress. Academic probation is when you get a semester to bring your grades up to a certain GPA - in my case, a 2.0. I had a 1.94, so all I had to do was pass. As winter became spring, my cheeks filled in and my eyes regained their shine. I was still deathly afraid of school, my ghost leaving my carcass during classes and lectures. Many nights I cried myself to sleep, softly weeping under the covers, trying to hide it from my roommate. The library actually became a comfort zone, a calm place where nobody can ask how I'm doing in classes. Where I can indulge in earthly pleasures without the fear of a degree dragging me back to hell. Over time, I stopped vomiting during tests. I started studying without crying. By the time April rolled around, I actually cared about passing. I wanted to continue going to school, I had fully reclaimed my body and was ready to fight to survive. I wanted to get a degree in journalism. Then my final grades came back.

I didn't make the cut. Somehow, after all I had done, after rebooting my heart and pumping fresh blood into my veins, after nurturing my body and coaxing my soul back to earth, I had failed. Eight years of private school, plus four semesters of private university. Wasted, on a failure like me. My skin was loose, ragged, and it wasn't hard to slip out of it. My muscles and organs saw daylight for the first time, and I let them sizzle underneath the summer sun. My tendons tightened until they snapped, my eyes burnt to a crisp, and my heart finally plopped out onto the hot pavement, melting into the sidewalk. I didn't even bother going home. I stayed there, on campus, rotting away. Ready to roam the halls and haunt the lectures. Weeping, softly weeping, in the middle of the night. Just like when I was alive.",idunno2018
[WP] You've just died... again.,Axing,"“Good to see you again.”

“Shut up, Lou.”

“That one really looked bad, the way you tried to hold in your intestines.”

“Yeah, I remember. I can still feel it.”

Lucifer opened his ledger to my page and moved his finger down the page as he tallied my account. 

“You sent five souls to me this time. That leaves twenty-eight you still owe me.”

“I’ll get them. Send me back,” I said.

“And that’ll be another six souls on your tab.”

That was the deal. I get another shot at life. Another shot to fix what I broke the first time around. But I have to send him six souls back for each chance I get, and those souls do not want to go back. They fight, and they kill me. They have killed me many times, and I have gotten deeper into the devil’s pocket. 

But I’m getting better at it. I’m sending more souls back to Hell these days before I go down. And one day soon, I will be free from the devil’s debt.

The sound of mediocrity is all around him as his coworkers hammer away at their keyboards, eager to finish their work load and impress their bosses. Someone in the break room is having a fight with the hissing coffee machine.

*Inane noise. All of it.* Jeff thinks rubbing his temples to try and concentrate. Teeheehee. Chink chink chink. Tap tap tap. The noise easily penetrates the quick and quiet meditation zone, he tried to build around himself. 

""No."" Jeff whispers to himself. ""Not today."" As he slowly takes a deep breath to try and calm his anger. Deep breath in. *One, two, three, four, five*. Deep breath out. *One, two, three, four, five.* Deep breath in. *one, two, three...*. CHINK CHINK CHINK. His meditation is interrupted again as a collection box is rattled in his face.

""Collecting for Dave's birthday."" One his sullen faced coworker offers. Jeff reaches into his pocket for his wallet trying to hide his disgust at the overpowering smell of sweat emanating from his coworker. He doesn't even like Dave but deposits a ten dollar bill into the tin to get rid of his colleague.

Closing his eyes, he starts again. Deep breath in. *One, two, three, four, five.* Deep breath out. *One, two, three, four, five.*. Deep breath in. *One, two...*.
TAP TAP TAP. CHINK CHINK CHINK. HISS HISS BANG BANG. TAP TAP TAP.

Angrily rushing to his feet, he is ready to shout at everyone to shut up. To tell them that he has had enough, that they can shove this job, shove their gossip around the water cooler and their faux friendships. That he quit. 

He never gets the chance as he is interrupted again. This time by a sudden crashing sound. Everyone in the room turns towards the source of the noise as a man smashes through the roof and onto the floor with a thunderous thud. Everyone stood, eyes wide, mouths agape as as a golden beam of light shone down through the newly created skylight and basked the man in a warm glow. 

No-one rushed to help as he groaned and struggled to stand. As he reached his feet everyone could see him properly and he was the most beautiful man any of them had ever seen. His thick golden hair was like a meadow blowing in a gentle breeze, undisturbed by the fall. Eyes like tropical blue seas, high cheek bones and a chiseled jawline gave him a dazzling smile that made both women and men swoon. The clothes he wore were immaculate, conforming tightly to his body, highlight his pecks, biceps and butt.

The beautiful man turns slowly on the spot. Taking his time to study each and every face before moving on to the next. Everyone who feels his gaze is unable to stop themselves from blushing as the feel butterflies fly around their stomach. 

Then his attention turns to Jeff and he feels it as well. His heart feels like it is beating a million miles a second, butterflies soar across his stomach. He feels like a magnet is pulling every part of his being towards this unknown man. Self consciously he wonders if he looks OK. Did he pick the right shirt and tie combination, is he wearing his new shoes and did he put clean underwear on this morning. 

""Finally!"" He says with a shocked smiled on his face breaking the silence and shattering Jeff's heart with joy at the same time. ""I've found you."" The man steps closer, over the rubble caused due to him crashing through the roof. ""You've no idea what I've been through all to look for you."" He said, patting Jeff on the shoulder in a friendly manner. 

Reaching into his inner jacket pocket he pulled out a piece of paper causing Jeff to flinch. ""Jeffery Donaldson. You are being served."" The man beings to read 

""Err, I'm Jeffery Donald...not Donaldson. Sorry"" Jeff said sheepishly.

“Daddy! Daddy, a man just fell through the roof! He looks hurt.” 

Igno- Wait. What? Lukas looked up from his computer screen, something he'd been trying very hard not to do for the past two hours, and glanced out the glass door of his home office. 

“Daddy! He's bleeding!” With a pained groan, Lukas pushed himself away from his desk and stood up, the cracks in his back loud enough to worry about. He paid no mind, and instead moved towards to the door, cracking it open and peaking out. 

What caught his attention were the twins standing over a man covered in dust and wood while the ceiling above them was completely broken, allowing anything outside to enter the house. The man, who two seconds ago looked like he was passed out, perked up and smiled when he caught sight of Lukas. 

“Finally! I've found you!” A sigh passed through Lukas’ lips. 

“Not again…” He groaned. The man, who Lukas knew was most definitely Michael, pushed himself up from the debris covered ground and brushed himself off. His hair was a perfect shade of brown while his eyes gleamed a bright jade color. He glanced down at the twins and grinned at them. 

“Nice to see you guys again, it's been awhile.” Nyla glanced at her brother in confusion while Zack just turned around and went back to his toys. Right now, Legos and giant monsters where the only things he really cared about. Lukas couldn't blame him. With gritted teeth, he turned his attention back to Michael. 

“Yes, you've found me. Again…” He said. It had taken a lot of work to move the kids to a new neighborhood and away from the insanity that use to be his life. Now, the source of all his grief in the past was once again standing in the middle of his living room. 

“Boy, it took me a while, too. The kids have grown up, it seems. Though they don't remember me anymore. That's a shame…” Michael seemed to be genuinely sad and Lukas had to rub his face not to fall for the trick. The damn bastard was sneaky. 

“It's a good thing. Remembering you would probably bring them more harm than good.” He growled. Michael looked taken aback. “That's rude, Luka. After all I did for you!” Lukas resisted to urge to punch the man in front of him and instead just clenched his fists.

 “You have no right to call me that. Only *he* can.” The words were rough and Michael only cocked his head to the side in thought. 

“Can't you see, Luka? I am James.” The man grinned widely, making Lukas shudder. “Shut up, no you're not. You're the one who took him away and used him. Leave now. Before I have to do it again. You didn't like it all that much when I did it the first time.” It was Lukas’ turn to grin. Michael shrugged. 

“You can't keep running, Lukas. No matter where you go, we’ll find you. It'll just be a matter of time before you finally realize we’re the only choice you have. If you join us again, you'll see him again.” Michael’s features shifted from the familiarity of James’ face to the stone hard and unnaturally beautiful looks all Angel’s seemed to have. Lukas let out a deep breath and steeled himself. 

“Never. I'll get him back myself, without your goddamn help.” And with this words, Michael left with a wink, having the decency to fix the hole in the roof as he disappeared with the sound of brilliant flapping wings. ",ScytheMeister7

"[WP] You have 3 wishes. Your first wish is ""I wish you would grant my wishes exactly how I mean them"". How would the genie still try to screw you over?",koghx,"Perfect. Now I was free of whatever games this genie wanted to play with my wishes. Sure, I only had two left, but they were going to be good ones. ""I wish to be the richest man in the world."" I waited. The gaseous face made no movement, no indication of...well anything. Floating there, unresponsive I had to ask, ""Well, are you going to grant my wish or not?""

Like a soft breeze, the misty form sighed, ""I need to hear your last wish first."" Odd, but whatever I thought. I already had this one planned out anyways. ""I wish for world peace!"" Surely, I was going to be the most famous man now as a result. Wealthy and the cause of world peace? Women and fame would be mine as mere byproducts of today. No need to wish for those at all, they would come naturally.

""Done."" Done? What? I certainly didn't feel richer, and nothing felt differently in the world. ""Are you sure?"" 

""Its a big world. How about you go and look for yourself."" Dismissing the genie back into the green glass liquor bottle I had earlier found under my bridge, I left my cardboard home and went into downtown Chicago. 

People were stumbling everywhere, screaming in pain and fright. I had no bank or anything to hold my newfound wealth and my riches were nowhere to be found. I rubbed my bottle again. ""WHAT HAVE YOU DONE!?!""

""I took your last two wishes and granted them as a mean."" 

""Uh...what? What does that even...what? This isn't what I wanted. I wanted to be rich and why is everyone screaming like they are dying?""

""I took everyone eyeballs. Not just their sight, the whole eyeball. Didn't need some doctors trying to cure it, and the whole world fighting for a cure. Without vision its really hard to fight. And I left yours, so now you are the richest man in the world.""

""But that's NOT WHAT I MEANT!""

""Ohhhhhh...you meant ""mean"" to be intentions. I thought you meant it as an average. So I took your two wishes and merged them together to get an average result. Honestly, averaging wishes isn't all that easy. You should have been more clear. Goodbye"" And with that, my whiskey-based friend drifted off to find a new bottle or something. Meanwhile, I quickly began to adjust. If a one-eyed man is king of the blind, I must truly be blessed to still have two.",graey_writing

""You shall have it, O Master.""

""I want to have ecstacy from now until the end of my life, and I want to die only after I cannot handle the ecstasy any longer.""

"[WP] You have 3 wishes. Your first wish is ""I wish you would grant my wishes exactly how I mean them"". How would the genie still try to screw you over?",koghx,"""I wish you would grant my wishes exactly how I mean them."" I smiled. I'd idly planned out what wishes I'd ask for if I found a genie a long time ago. This was just insurance; maybe I got a nice genie, but giving up a wish to be safe was worth it.

The genie frowned at me. ""And you're certain that's what you want for your first wish?"" Yeah, I expected that. Trying to subtly undermine my confidence in my own defenses so I reconsider them.

""Of course!"" I've put too much thought into this to fall for your mind games, genie.

He shrugs. The genie looks almost mundane, but there's an odd sense of serenity and transcendent unworldliness about him. Doesn't look human, though, something's tripping the uncanny valley. His whole shape looks almost too sculpted, and the way he shrugged just now was more fluid than a human body can be. ""So be it."" No snap of the fingers, no magic, no poof, no sparks. This was not nearly as exciting as Robin Williams led me to believe it would be.

""Genie! My second wish!"" Do I sound like Jafar? Maybe a bit. Whatever, someone has to make warping reality as *exciting* as it should be. ""I wish for immortality for myself and anyone I choose, conferred and revoked by my express intended verbal command!"" So no tricking me into revoking it, and the genie should also give me the whole 'all immortals are 20-something or however old they choose' part without me having to expressly say it because of the first wish.

He cocks an eyebrow at an inhumanly perfect curvature. ""Going straight for the big one, then. Again, are you certain that's what you want?""

""*Yes,* genie. I don't know what your game is, but I will not allow you to trick me into making wishes that end poorly for me.""

He snaps his fingers this time, and the noise it makes is loud, thunderously loud, shaking the whole house, and it's loud enough to blow all the years off me. Ah, to be twenty again. I take a minute to admire myself, where the wrinkles have unfolded, the muscle's come back, the extra weight's gone somewhere, and the grey's out of my hair.

""Have a third wish?"" The genie snaps me out of my reverie. I frown. So hurried to be back in the lamp.

""Yes. I want however much genie power you can give me, again, at my explicit spoken command, without imposing limitations on me like 'become a genie and live in a lamp.'"" So yeah, I admit I watched Aladdin one too many times preparing my genie wishes, but I think it helped me out.

""So be it."" He snaps his fingers again, and I feel power, so much power. It's amazing. I can see *everything.* I open my mouth to thank the genie, but he's already gone in a puff of smoke and a whirlwind. Well, so long to him. Odd that he didn't ruin me.

What this calls for is a celebratory dinner. I call my wife, and ask her to meet me downtown at the best restaurant I can think of, reservations at 6 o' clock sharp. She sounds surprised, but agrees. I tell her I love her, promise to see her then, and hang up.

""I wish I had a reservation for 6 o' clock,"" I mutter. I feel the whole universe shift to accommodate my wish. Hmm. That might have been slight overkill. Oh damn. Before I forget. ""Also, my wife is immortal too."" I'll break the news to her over dinner.

5 o' clock rolls around, and I consider just wishing myself to the restaurant, but decide not to rewrite all of reality for a minor convenience. I'll drive. I put on my nicest suit, and drive down to the end of the neighborhood. The light turns green, and I pull out just to notice a speeding car approaching from the right, and it's moving too fast to stop, *shit, ""I wish that car would - ""* but it's too late, I can't get the words out fast enough, and he slams into me, and that's the last thing I know before everything goes dark.

I wake up strapped to a bed. Voices nearby. Everything is fuzzy. I'm struggling to make out anything, but I focus hard on the voices. One is a man's. The other is my wife's. ""...miracle he survived at all. You just need to focus on that, ma'am.""

""But... the damage? ...won't ever... better?""

""Ma'am, his brain... lot of shrapnel. Seriously... overstate how lucky...at all.""

The fuzzy voices are getting closer. My wife and doctor enter the room.

""Oh! Jim! You're awake!"" she comes running over.

I try to ask what happened, but my mouth won't listen to me. All it does is moan and make incoherent noise.

""Mr. Henderson, sir. We weren't going to tell you yet, but I suppose you have to know. You were in an accident. Very serious. Lots of shrapnel. Some of it... pierced your brain. With the damage in these areas, we suspect you're paralyzed from the neck down and your speech centers may be irreparably damaged. To the best of our knowledge, you'll never move or speak again.""

Well, all I have to do is wish myself better. I wish I was healed, I think to myself. Nothing happens. I hear the genie's voice in my mind. ""Are you absolutely sure that's what you want?"" Oh damn. I said verbal confirmation, didn't I?

""Oh."" I tap my cheek, chuckling. ""Can't forget the most important ingredient.""

I usually like pumpkin or sunflower seeds--they add a satisfying *crunch* to any salad. Lately, though, I find myself cultivating a somewhat different taste. Call it a quirk of my profession, but I keep a bountiful garden outside, on my patio. I tend to a variety of plants, each bearing its own leaves, fruits, and seeds. The possibilities are as many as the colors, shapes, sizes, flavors, and textures which represent them.

Today, I bring my mortar and pestle. I select a small handful of seeds. They are a deep, sexy red, hard-shelled, with a small brownish-black cap at the narrower end. They are incredibly sweet, particularly when mixed with a bit of ground root or leaf. *It is called indian liquorice in some places, after all.*

""*Abrus precatorius*,"" I say as I shuffle the seeds about in my hand.

I get back to work in the kitchen, dutifully pulverizing the collected material, working it near to a fine powder--not too fine, of course, for fear of losing the crunch. Once reduced to a coarse meal, I add it to the vinaigrette and stir vigorously. I take a small spoonful to taste, shuddering at its intoxicating sweetness. *Intoxicating indeed.* It is ready, and I douse my salad liberally, tossing it enthusiastically to ensure an even distribution.

I package it in a plain tupperware container--I choose a red lid today to complement the secret ingredient.

My commute is uneventful, as usual. It isn't raining, but the sky is overcast, and it's around fifty outside. I have my warm black coat with the fleece interior, so I don't worry. I glance at least once a mile at the small container, my mouth watering with every hungry flick of my eyes. I find it more difficult than usual to wait--I should know better than to tease myself with little tastes.

*Buzz in, walk in, clock in. Another day.*

I stop by the break room to drop off the dish. Top shelf, furthest to the right, next to the tinfoil-wrapped tuna melt. *Rotten, if the smell tells you anything.* There are a few other meals about--ham and cheese sandwich, gyro from that new Greek joint downtown, some still-warm pot roast--*Tim's wife must be cooking for him again. Guess she finally forgave his philandering. That, or she threw out the last of her dignity*--and, naturally, someone ordered a pizza. *Someone. More like Jared, the poor slob.* It smells like double pepperoni with bacon.

More than enough dead animals to go around. ""This fridge could *clearly* use a salad,"" I remark. A smile tugs at my lips when I shut the door.

I remove my coat and slip off my driving gloves when I get to my desk. My fingers are a bit stiff from having worn them all morning, and I flex them gently two or three times. Office work can take a toll on the hands, even if you're not long committed to it.

The morning passes without incident, the buzz of the fluorescent lights and the *click click click* of my keyboard the only defenses against silence. I keep a keen eye on the clock all the while.

12:30 arrives, and Stewart steps out of his office. Passes my desk.

""Afternoon,"" he says.

""Good afternoon to you, too,"" I reply.

""Workin' hard, I hope?""

""Another productive morning, sir.""

""Feeling alright today?""

Me eyes flit up to meet his face. It's funny how a nice suit and handsome features can disguise such a plain piece of human garbage. ""Well, sir, I--""

""*Yeah*,"" he interjects, ""I've been feeling pretty good myself since I started this new diet and exercise routine. Gym every morning before the office, and every other evening after. Cut out all meat, if you can believe it."" He titters with conspiratorial laughter, leaning in close as if sharing a secret. ""Never thought I'd be able to give up steak, you know? But I can't argue with the results. Been drinking protein shakes to make up the loss. You should really try it, I'm sure it'd do wonders for you.""

""Yes, I think we talked a bit about it last week, sir.""

""Nothing like a friendly reminder, eh?"" He sucks in a deep breath, grinning wide as he exhales. ""Anyhow, all this talk about food has worked up the ol' appetite. You hungry?""

""Afraid not, sir. I had a large breakfast, so I'll probably stick around here for a few more hours. I've got quite a bit of work to do.""

His toothy grin widened further. ""*That's* what I like to hear. With that attitude, I really think you'll fit in well here. I'll be taking a long lunch today, so I'll see you later this afternoon.""

I nod, giving him a last look before turning back to my desktop. ""See you.""
_________________________________________________________________

A few minutes before five, I carefully pack my belongings. I shut off my workstation after that, then dress myself for the cool weather. My inbox is empty, my work done. *Better than you'd get from most on their last day.*

I stop by the break room on the way out. The trash can is full of packaging and half-eaten lunches. The crumbs of a ham and cheese, scraps of gyro meat, pot roast juice, and pizza crusts. Complete with folded plates and used napkins, no less.

In the sink, there's a small plastic container, a red lid discarded beside it. Moist salad residue coats the sides. I look around to make sure I'm alone.

For just a moment or two, I permit myself a satisfied smile.
_________________________________________________________________

I see Stewart out in the parking lot, bent low and squatting on a curb next to his Audi.

""Hey there,"" I say with a wave. ""Feeling alright today?""

He looks up, his face a shade paler than usual, beads of sweat all across his forehead. ""Oh, hey. Yeah, I'm fine. Just a little indigestion, I think. Maybe some backed-up gas.""

""Everything okay?""

""Yeah, yeah, just some stomach cramps. A little bit of..."" He looks away, licking his lips, finding the words. ""A little bathroom trouble. Nothing serious, though.""

*I'm clearly not the one you're trying to reassure.*

""Something you ate today?"" I force concern onto my face to suppress the sneer.

""Maybe. I haven't been on the diet too long. Heard your body has to adjust sometimes."" He tries to smile, but fails when his stomach gurgles disquietingly.

""Well, fluids and rest. You might try some ginger root to settle the stomach.""

""*Yeah*,"" he strains. ""Yeah, thanks.""

""Hey..."" he says as I turn to leave. His nerves are evident in his voice.

I look him dead in the eye. ""Yes?""

""I'll... see you tomorrow. Yeah?""

Rose stood, panting, in the disaster area that had, a half-hour ago, been a kitchen.  She had torn the place apart to find almonds to put on her salad.  They had been on the list, but she must have forgotten to actually buy them.  Gah!  This could ruin everything!

It had taken years for her to make a salad that she found palatable.  With the wedding coming up next week, she needed to be eating healthy so that the dress fit right, so salad it was.  However, without the damn almonds, she just couldn't do it.  Salad without almonds was like eating grass or leaves.  She just couldn't stomach it.

*Hey,* she thought, *maybe you have some almond extract left over from baking.  You can add it to the dressing, and that should work just as well!*

Rose looked at the clock.  Sure, she had a few minutes.  She took down her various extracts, and found what she was looking for: the last few drops of almond extract.  She added it to the dressing and tried a taste of the salad, but gagged.  It was better, but still not enough.

Rose took the spoon she had used to mix the dressing and started tapping it against her teeth.  As she usually did when thinking, she opened and closed her jaw as she tapped, to change the tapping into a simple melody.  The melody soured when she hit her false tooth.

*I don't know why I keep that thing,* Rose thought, *after all, almost all of the cyanide has leaked out, and I've built up enough immunity to what's left...*

Suddenly, Rose lit up.  *Almonds*, she thought: Cyanide was supposed to taste like bitter almonds.  Maybe there was enough left in the tooth...

Five minutes later, she tasted the dressing.  *Perfect.*

*****

Rose sat down at the lunch table, where a beaming Greg handed her a box that smelled like heaven.  Well, it smelled like bacon, anyway, and if heaven doesn't smell like bacon, then there's something wrong with heaven.

""I can't,""  she said weakly, the scent of bacon eating away at her will power.  ""The dress...""

""Don't worry about the dress,""  Greg insisted.  ""You'll look gorgeous - even if they need to do a couple of extra stitches.""  She started to protest again, to get up and go to the fridge to get her salad, but Greg took her hand gently and shook his head.  ""Besides, I got rid of your salad, to make sure you'd eat that.""  He pointed at the container, which had started to drip grease, lovely lovely grease, onto Rose's hand.

She relented.  ""Fine.  I'll eat it.""

Greg smirked at her triumphantly.  It was that smirk she had fallen in love with, and just seeing it was worth the hassle it would take to get the dress fixed.

*****

""Roza,"" the voice said, in a language she had all but forgotten, ""It's time to go.""

Rose knelt on the wedding gown that she would never get to wear.  White, the colour of purity.  White, the colour of Russian snow.

White, the colour of the foam on Greg's lips, as he lay dying at her feet.

Sanya grabbed at her hand --- forcefully, not gently like Greg did --- and dragged her to her feet.  ""Roza, come on!  We have a plane to catch""

Still weeping, Roza allowed herself to led away, her mission, her life, her dreams in tatters.  She had forgotten to pick up almonds at the grocery store, and she had ruined everything.",Nimelennar

"[WP] ""Do you remember the starry sky we created that night?""",Dae314,"She looked at the clouds, rare rays of sunshine running through her face. Then she turned to me and repeated: ""Remember?"" Well, how could I forget. I was playing around with the newest generation drone which could reach even outer space. I got tons of breathtaking pictures to use as desktop background and some extra.

In some pictures, you could see some satellites and space debris. If you look closely, you can see an UFO. That's my extra. At the moment, she's laying down besides me, playing with the grass and looking at the sky, as if searching for something. Maybe she's trying to see the space debris through the darker and darker clouds. Seems like it's going to rain soon.

She stopped me. Looking at me with her puppy eyes, she waited for my answer. I thought I said all this out loud, seems like I was wrong.

""Yeah, no one could forget that. Let's go back inside. It's probably gonna rain again.""

She still held my hand tightly and refused to move. 

""You humans keep being afraid of rain, even though it's just the same water as you drink, just falling from the sky.""

She never held any grudge against me for almost killing her accidentally. I keep loathing myself for destroying that drone, but then I see the reason to feel better right next to me.

When her spaceship was noticed, it was too late. My treasured drone crashed right into her. Both pieces of superior technology were shattered into bits, which reflected the light efficiently enough to look like tons of new stars, the only thing that would tell them apart would be the speed the debris were orbiting the Earth.

Rain started to fall. She let me go, I stood up, waiting for her. She sat up, looking at me with her constant puppy eyes.

""When can we see it again?""

You could feel the curiosity of a toddler in her magical voice. I'd hate to let her down, but the weather doesn't care about the wishes of some tiny life forms.

"[WP] ""Do you remember the starry sky we created that night?""",Dae314,"You dotted out the constellations and I laughed at you. It's apophenia, I said. People so desperate for meaning that they make up patterns where none exist. They'll look up at the stars and see a wolf, or a pair of lovers, or a bicycle - anything other than what you intended. 

It's all mathematics, I said, strewing stars across the cosmos. You can replicate a Pollock with a computer program and a pendulum filled with paint and instructions on how hard and at what angle to push. I splattered a galaxy into existence. It hung unbalanced, a sour note. We should be automating this, I said. Plug in an equation, and let the stars fall where they will.

You painted in the stars too faint to see, so far away that their light hadn't reached us yet. Negative space, you said, when I mocked you for it. There's a whole universe invisible to us, you said, beyond what we can see. The stars guide our gaze upwards, and then we imagine what lies beyond them. 

It's a lot of work for nothing, I said, and blotted out a handful of your precious distant stars in one uncaring stroke. See? No difference. 

We worked in silence after that, the stardust staining my fingers and prickling at my skin, making me eager to be done with it. 

I didn't look up at the night sky for a long time, not really. Just brief upward glances. Just the single solitary moon. It was a part of my past that I'd rather have forgotten. But I looked up at the stars tonight and thought of you, and realized that I couldn't tell your part from mine. I'd forgotten the names of all your constellations. I'd forgotten all the misplaced stars that used to irk me. The sky flowed together, a single unbroken canvas of stars across the night.

I tried to pick out your constellations, to find some meaning in what we'd made, but it'd been too long, too late. I had to make up my own patterns. I imagined a wolf, a bicycle, a pair of lovers. I imagined all the stars too far away for me to see.",sadoeuphemist

"Magic is Hereditary, but the child's powers is the sum of his parents. Fire Witch + Sand Wizard= Glass magic [WP]",Kmocha,"Through years of meticulous breeding and fastidiously arranged matches they had finally done it. Oh, it had taken centuries, centuries during which many questioned the worth of such an endeavor, but now here stood the end result, and it was glorious.

If those who came before could have seen it they surely would have felt their own lives all the more important for what they'd wrought. So many lives. So many unruly children and surly teens brought to heel for the greater good. How they had moaned and cursed and spat on their parents. Parents who had, to a one, been guilty of the same behavior in their own time. But they had all accepted their place in the end, and this was what their pain had been rewarded with.

The books were meticulously kept. Hundreds upon hundreds of names, and beside them descriptions of their powers and pairings as well as their children. There had been Melgor, lord of ice wed to Janai, the lady of flame. Together they had birthed Kremp the wet. Not a terribly inspiring form of magic, true. But vital.

That had been a simple one. There were so many who could command the forces of cold or heat. They were mundane powers and their combination was readily available. Others though... Well, they had been harder.

There had been Poloin the foul who's parents had been Engrio, speaker to animals and Carine who's touch was death. His marriage to Tees of the exceptionally small rocks had not been a happy one as a result of Poloin's stench, but their union had wrought Istia, the perpetually soiled who had commanded dirt, and who had produced Rago plant maker through her marriage to Ifron master of green.

Along the way there had been some unusual necessities. Mortock the barnbuilder, Izael who made the sour water, and Eckeltrone who's ability to run a profitable business was of dubious magical nature.

Then there had been those who's mere existence had advanced society as a whole by large margins. Yop the Aluminumsmith and his mother Umple the Bauxite witch, Petrus the trademarker, and Quintion the caffeinated.

But finally, finally, here was the end, the princess who was promised, the bringer of refreshment.

Tipp rose from her throne as the stewards drew back the curtains to the balcony. The roar of cheers was deafening. This was her moment. This was the culmination of centuries of work. The long walk seemed only to grow longer with every step and yet it seemed barely an instant and she was standing in the doorway blinded by the sun.

""They're waiting my lady."" said her butler. ""Are you ready?""

""I was born for this. Of course I'm ready. I will give them what they want. I will give them Coca-Cola.""",pyronius

----------------------

""But of course, please"". I patted the seat and he sat down. The servant brought him a teacup and refilled mine.

""So Miss Tendall"" he started.

""Call me Ella""

""Sorry, Ella, what brings you here tonight?""

I knew what he was asking. Coming to meeting for a group plotting to overthrow Glorica, everybody in this room must have had a personal reason to hate her. Those who don't usually love her. It was probably some kind of spell of hers, but it didn't bother me. Probably the spell.

I had prepared a cover story incase somebody asked. ""My Father. He... "" I stopped and held back some fake tears. ""He died in the recent bombings. None of this would have happened if not for her. That's when I knew we had to do something about her."" 

He didn't smile, but seemed satified. ""I am sorry for your loss, but glad to have you in our cause"". 

We continued talking for a few more minutes. Several more people filtered in. An old man in a ragged coat. A threesome of older ladies, and finally the last of my secondary targets. Lord Dewinter. As he entered, the doctor excused himself, and stood up to join the lord. The spoke quietly in the corner in excited voices.

The mustachioed man turned to the group and cleared his throat. ""Ladies and Gentlemen, I believe we can now start our meeting."" The room quieted, and I knew it was time for me to make my move.

The man began by explaining the situation ""The devilry that the witch in power isdoing will isolate the country and destroy our great nation""... blah blah blah. I stopped listening as I fiddled the pipe out of my sleeve.

And then I started playing.

The first few notes draw rats to guard and block the doorway, but their scurrying outside was covered by my playing. I could see the man had stopped talking and the whole room looked at me, not sure what to make of me.

And then rats poured out of the air vents. And tore up through the carpet, where sewer grates had been covered. A swarming mass of vermin.

Several of the old ladies screamed and the young man in the couple valiently grabbed up his love and stood on a table.

The doctor looked at me and growled. ""Traitor! We've been betrayed, get out at once!""

The mustachioed man grabbed the hand of Lady Yenneth, and tried to run for the doorway, but the biting and scrabbelling vermin were hard to push through, now covering the floor a foot deep.

The biggest danger to me, I knew, was the doctor. He had already reached into his pocket and pulled out a hand full of coins. They glowed in his hand. He might only have been first generation empowered, but his ability to heat things was still dangerous. He threw the coins my way, but a quick series of high notes on the pipes and some rats lept up and took the hits. Several of the coins fell straight to the floor, still glowing hot, which the rats instively avoided.

""Why are you doing this?"" He screamed ""Why do the work of the Witch, you know she controls you, she controls us all!""

I stopped playing and stood. Rats still poured into the vents and the door, which swung inwards, couldn't be opened, as the servant was finding out. So far, nobody had died.

""I do this, because I can Doctor Lassenger. We all gotta eat, and I get paid a lot for this."" I smiled at him.

""Do you think a few rats will stop us?"" He had started to melt off a section of a metal lamp standing in the corner, obviously aiming to make a club. I noticed the young lady, still in the mans arms, was crossing her fingers and muttering, causing winds to start to spiral around the pair. 

""A few rats might not kill you."" I smiled at the doctor, as I tucked up my skirts and pulled the small violin off my thigh. Snapping the bow out of the hiding place on my back I readied to play. ""However, this is worse than a few rats"".

And I began to play. Quick rythems to get the rats surging, high notes to excite them.... and then I brought in the low notes. The tones of the earth, of grass and growth, of roots and shoots.

The seeds I had fed to the rats earlier erupted, merging into the rodents and forming great, spiked abominations. These masses of rat and plant pulled themselves off the floor and started towards the people in the rooms centre.

I looked towards the doorway, still playing. The roots and taken hold and the door was now immobile. The unfortunate servant was impaled by the roots, merged into the door. 

Looking back to my abominations, I saw the professor scream, a blazing hot pole in his hands, before he threw it. 

It arced, not towards the abominations, but towards me. Ducking whilst wailing out a few manic cords, one of the abominations arms whipped out and caught the pole a foot before it reached me.

Swinging the pole around it took the couple straight through the waist, killing them instantly. I sighed and kept playing, weaving the magic I needed to keep the beasts whole. 

The rat beast still held the pole, which still glowed with heat. I hadn't had time to think about it. A hand made of wood and meat quickly caught fire, and soon the whole beast was blazing. It swung wildly, screaming in a thousand tiny rodent voices. The three old ladies died in the flailing crushed by flaming wooden feet.

And then I began coughing. Smoke hung in the air, we were running out of smoke free air, the ventilation system had broken when the rats came in. The door was blocked. There was no way out. Shit.

I couldn't see the professor any more, but urged the beast to keep wailing in his general direction. I needed to get out. 

The fireplace. I changed the tune. The second beast, the one still not on fire, dropped the body it held next to another. Lady Yenneth and Lord Dewinter. That was the secondary targets dealt with at least. I sent it the beast to the fireplace and had it sweep out the crackeling fire.

Dashing past it I let out a few simple commands on the violin ""Kill all but me, go wild, keep going"" and dropped the song. The magic should hold for a few minutes.

Poking my head into the chimney, the heat and smoke were terrible. I ripped the quick release off my skirts and pulled a pair of gloves out of one of the secret pockets. I could barely breath now the smoke was so thick from the abomination and... crap everything was on fire nearly, including the carpet. 

I set off up the chimney, not a hard climb, but climbing wasn't exactly my thing. After a few feet I could see stars.

Minutes later, I climbed out onto the buildings roof. The air was clear up here, but the building would soon start to catch fire.

*Phew*. I caught my breath. Well, two confirmed dead, and the Doctor most likely dealt with.

The elders tell us that, in ages long past, all the world was once like us. Magic formed part of every-day life for peoples across the globe, as they used it to shape their buildings, heat their homes, or grant them safe passage across the oceans. But as people started to explore they would come into contact with other cultures, and while there were many conflicts, soon wars turned to peace, and peace into harmony until eventually the lines between cultures were blurred so much that you could barely tell where one ended and another began. It was during this time of peace that they started to lose their identity, the very essence of their souls escaping them. Fire and water makes steam, but steam and water makes nothing, and in every society this was the case, until the scales tipped and people started to turn against magic-users, out of hatred; out of envy; out of fear. Soon the world forgot what magic was, thinking it a myth, a bedtime story for children, and leaving only us few to guard our secret legacy; but we cannot hold on forever- so few of us are left.

"Magic is Hereditary, but the child's powers is the sum of his parents. Fire Witch + Sand Wizard= Glass magic [WP]",Kmocha,"Cassie was a lava witch. Her skill with rock and fire knew no bounds.

Tobias was a steam warlock. Rare even by today's standards, an aspiring steam engineer.

Mary-Sue was highly proficient in book food and medicine, her tarts could take away any ache.

And then there is me. The fourth student of the village school. Son of a story-dreamer and of a bard who had passed through town just 15 years ago. Music... and sleep... not exactly two tools I could use at the same time. I sighed in dissatisfaction, staring out at the tree tops that surrounded the village. Cassie was growing a stone statue out of the ground, a large Vincentus Victori statue that paid homage to the great warlock as much as any other. The soft curves of the giant face she was detailing were better than could be made by hand. Warlock Victori had it easy, his storm magic stronger than any other. Tobias was probably off in his workshop. Mary-Sue had stopped by earlier with egg-pastry, but even her magic had done little to improve my mood. I had three weeks left to show some skill - any skill - or I would be the first person ever kicked out from my village's magic school. A squib.

I had written to my uncle three days before, asking him what I should do. My mother's brother the only person I could turn to. My mother was a kind soul, but no help in a real-world crisis - her skills leaving her invested more in the spirit world than in this one. I couldn't turn to my father of course, he'd had left before my mother had even started to show signs of my impending presence, his arrival temporary from the outset. I was not expecting to hear back from my uncle for many days yet, so I was surprised to see the little paper-bird come tumbling out of the sky to my feet. It raised itself up, gave a two-chirp salute and unfolded into a neat letter between my boots. I could see straight away why it had struggled to fly, he had tucked two heavy gold coins inside; a lot of money. I raised the letter to my face, scanning the words several times before I truly took them in:

&gt; Nephew,

&gt; Sorry to hear of your current bother.

&gt; I would come in person but I am currently in the arctic wastes, searching for ruined frost runes in frost rune ruins.

&gt; I have sent you some money to tide you over, I would suggest two things, if they should please you.

&gt; Firstly venture further than you have before, chase the wind, travel far, find your magic and return to take your tests.

&gt; Secondly - though just as importantly - go visit my friend Altaus in Beckintown. He has good advice for those clever enough to hear it.

&gt; Kindest regards,

&gt; Always,

&gt; Mexicallius, Wizard of lost-findings and of old things

It was clear what I had to do, it should have been obvious to me too. If i'd never found my magic here before, why would I think i'd find here it in the next few weeks. I had to look further afield.

Within an hour I had spoken to my mother and agreed the trip with the school tutors. They were enthusiastic about the idea, though that may have just been pleasure at the thought of not having to waste time trying to teach me for a few weeks. I hit the road running and was quarter-way to Beckintown by the time the sun had set. This was about as far as I had ever gone from town and the stark realization of my situation had started to settle in. Two gold coin was a fair amount in the village, though it wouldn't go far in town. I had no magic to defend myself from bandits, no magic to earn money with, not even enough magic of my own to conjure a fire - though Cassie had gifted me some ever-hot rocks for that purpose at least. I was glad of the fire, my coat was thin and built to travel between woodland huts, not for the wind-stricken plains that ran alongside the king's road. I watched as others drifted along the road in twilight, avoiding the fires that like mine dotted the side of the road. The best defense I would have in case of any trouble would be to lie. Pretend I was a storm warlock or an ice mage. I was still musing about what to be when I noticed the figure standing nonchalantly by my fire. She was a young girl, about my age, but with the features of a girl who had traveled the road whilst I was still a babe in my crib. I sneaked a look around, checking that she was not distracting me for another person, but we were alone.

We were silent for several minutes, her standing, me sitting, each trying not to stare at the other. ""You can sit if you like"" I announced at last ""share my fire"". She hesitated but did so silently. Neither of us quite comfortable enough to sleep around the other, we sat in silence until daybreak. I traveled the next three days alone, stopping each night to find her silently at my fire. The day that Beckintown appeared on the horizon, she slipped away and didn't come back. I pushed myself to travel fast, reaching the town about an hour after the sun had set. The lights in the town more than sufficient to find my way through. I stopped at three taverns and two shops on the main street before I found directions to Altaus's house. It was a small rundown shack on the outskirts of the town, but after introductions and a bowl of broth, a real bed seemed like a little piece of heaven in the dusty plains that I had been travelling through.

I awoke to the smell of cooked bacon and the gentle strums of a lute. I had always hated music. It reminded me of the father I never knew in a painful way, but I had never before heard the sounds of a lute. The soft repetitive strumming of the notes that each seemed to compliment the ones before and after. I waited until he finished the tune before daring to ask a question. ""Was that magic?"" I asked, not sure if I wanted to know the answer. ""It is"" he replied after some time ""I am the son of a bard and a healer, my music will heal most wounds"". I sat in stunned silence for quite a while, now I knew why my uncle had sent me here. Another son of a bard, if anyone could show me my magic it could be him.

I offered him both gold coins and a third that I did not have, but still he would not teach me. I begged and pleaded for a week but his mind would not be moved. I prepared my things to leave the next day, halfway through my three weeks and no closer to finding my goal. I clipped on a thick cloak that I had purchased in town, feeling slightly more prepared at least for the road. Not willing to return home a failure I turned away from the way I had come, setting my sights on the far mountains, unsure as to whether I would ever return this way. Altaus stood at the door, watching me walk away, his normally stoic face finally showing a small amount of emotion. ""Wait"" he announced, walking over towards me holding something out ""This is a flute"" he sighed leaving the small metal tube in my hand and starting to walk away ""learn to play it"".

I walked towards the mountains feeling no further to my goals. The flute tucked into my belt poking me in the stomach as I walked, filling me with resentment. I stopped near dusk to make camp, taking out my ever-hot stone and putting up the small tent I had bought. I turned to see to the fire and saw that it was already made. The girl carrying another armful of firewood to the fireside and settling down next to it. I held out the flute to her, ""I don't suppose you play?"". She looked at it and me thoughtfully, then settled down to sleep by the fire.

I awoke to music again, making me sure that it had all been a dream, that I was still with Altaus in the town. The bed was not as comfortable though, the smell of bacon and eggs replaced with firewood and grass. The girl sat just outside my tent, playing the flute with all the skill of a professional. I sat, silently, watching and trying to mirror her movements with my own. She finished her song and handed me the flute, grimacing as I tried - unsuccessfully - to play the song that she had made. She sat attentively, correcting my misplaced fingers with a sharp rap from her knuckles and before noon I could even start to hear the song behind my notes. I stood eventually, as the sun rose to its highest point in the sky, making half a days trip closer to the mountains. The girl tagging along behind, never catching up, never dropping away.

I camped next to a stream, some nearby trees reminding me of the home that I could not return to, not until I find my magic. Only if I find my magic soon. So soon. The tears felt hot as they traveled down my cheeks, the girl hovering about, clearly upset by my emotion. She pulled up at my flute, sticking it between my lips and frantically trying to distract me from my deep sobbing. I played then, as though I had been playing all of my life. The tune fluid and moving, my feet beating a heavy pitter-patter on the floor as my lungs breathed life into the tune. I stopped when I had run out of breath, realizing that the pitter-patter was no longer my own, but the heavy rains falling from the sky. The river flowing swollen and threatening to break its banks. I collapsed, exhausted, barely feeling the girls efforts to push me into my tent, out of the heavy rain.",bitcleargas

"Magic is Hereditary, but the child's powers is the sum of his parents. Fire Witch + Sand Wizard= Glass magic [WP]",Kmocha,"#Part 3

When we exited the assessment room, we were the third pair out. Stephen had finished and jogged over to greet me. “How’d it go?”, he asked, glancing briefly at Cecily. I was about to reply when James came out of his assessment room with Evan. The two were sharing some kind of hand shake that guys do. I shook my head and mouthed ‘later’.

Stephen kept shooting me concerning looks throughout the day. I trained my focus on James. What was Cecily trying to save me from? James, sensing my gaze, met my eyes. I expected him to smile like he usually does but he just gave me a cold stare. 

“Why does James look like he’s going to blow something up?”, I nudged Stephen. “Maybe because you called him a narcissist?”

I did that? Stephen noticed my worry and gave me a reassuring smile.

I sneaked a glance at Cecily, but she was talking to one of her teddy bears she frequently brought along. I decided I’d believe her for now. Not because she was talking to an inanimate object, but because of the look James gave me.

After the final school bell rang, Cecily slipped her arm through mine and forced me to skip with her. “Come on, Sera!”, her high pitched voice ringing clear. “Mommy is going to be so happy I made a full-blood friend!”

Once we rounded the corner of the street, Cecily dropped my arm and directed me to follow her. We walked around in silence for about an hour, going past the same streets and backtracking down alleys. My neck hurt from just watching Cecily face the front and then check behind us every five seconds. Every time I’d try to ask a question, she’d silence me. 

Eventually, we tip-toed down some stairs into a basement. I don’t know what I was expecting, maybe teddy bears everywhere, but we entered a normal basement. Dark and dingy, spiderwebs in the corners and poor lighting. 

From a dark corner, a posh voice spoke out. “I see plan A failed.”

Cecily hung her head. High heels click clacked across the floor towards us. The figure stopped beneath the light.

“Headmistress McLaren?”, I gaped. “Greetings Sera”, the headmistress nodded.

“Now, I know this may come as a shock to you, but James Pyre is not the boy who you think he is.” The headmistress started slowly. “The Pyre family are not full-blood fire mages, in fact, they are not fire mages at all.” This did indeed surprise me, and it must have shown on my face because the headmistress gave me a sympathetic look. 

“So…”, I began, “no one in our school is actually a full-blood fire mage?”

McLaren clasped her hands together. “Yes, that’s one way to put it. I was also surprised to learn of your other… ability today.”

“Well, ma’am, Cecily looked like she was trying to kill me and I noticed she was not a full-blood either.”

The headmistress looked over at Cecily disappointedly.

“That is correct,” McLaren sighed. “Cecily is a Mimic - a combination of shapeshifting and cloning.”

“The tablets I take contain DNA of other mages,” Cecily pipes in. “I clone the DNA and mould my cells to accommodate the foreign genes. Their power becomes mine for a few moments but it’s tiring to keep shifting my cells for too long.”

That explained why she was so aggressive when we first started combat. “What about your eyes?”, I enquired. 

“Shape-shifting at the cellular level is difficult so I prioritise other places over my eyes. As a result, I get sectoral heterochromia from the new DNA changing the colour of my iris.”

“So, why were you trying to save me from James?” I asked the question I most wanted the answer to.

The headmistress stepped in. “As I was saying before, James and his parents are not fire mages. They are illusion mages. I knew when James first enrolled, the Pyre family were not who they said they were. I thought I’d play along to see what they were up to.”

McLaren walked over to me and locked my eyes to hers. “They are creating weapons from full-blood mages.”

"Magic is Hereditary, but the child's powers is the sum of his parents. Fire Witch + Sand Wizard= Glass magic [WP]",Kmocha,"I clicked my fingers idly while waiting for class to start. Sparks burst from my fingertips and a tiny flame hovered above my thumb and index finger. A sudden thud to my left jolted me back to reality. I looked up to the source. 

“Hey Stephen,” I smiled. He smiled back in response, his eyes crinkling into crescent moons. 
“What were you so deep in thought about this early in the morning?”, he asked with a yawn. 
“Oh you know,” I waved my hand around in the direction of James, “the usual.” James was surrounded by giggling girls, as usual. He raised his hand to run his fingers through his hair, showing off his toned arms.

Stephen’s smile turned into a frown. “You don’t have to go through with it, you know.”

“I know,” I sighed. 
I turned my head towards James, a fire full-blood, and my betrothed. In order to keep our magic ‘pure’, our parents arranged for us to be married since we were young. It was getting harder to find full-bloods and some families resorted to incest. My eyes flicked to Cecily, the only other fire full-blood our age. Her parents were half-siblings. The practice isn’t too common nowadays because children born from inbreeding tended to be unstable. Full-bloods are revered nevertheless, hailed as progenitors of mages. 

“All right, let’s get started,” Mr. Lazzar boomed to hush the students. Mr. Lazzar was a compulsion mage, born from a mind control user and a hypno. “We are going to begin practical assessments today.”

The whole class groaned. “Quiet,” Mr. Lazzar raised a finger to his lips. I suddenly felt compelled to mirror his action and found my finger rising to meet my tightened lips. 

“Now get your gear on and meet me in the gym in 10 minutes,” Mr. Lazzar always got straight to the point. 

I lazily reached for my flameproof clothes in my backpack and headed for the gym. Stephen followed suit. Stephen was a telekinesis mage, common for descendants from earth or air mages. “So,” Stephen cleared his throat, “I was wondering if-“ 

“SERA!”, a voice yelled behind us, “WAIT UP!” I spun on my heel to face James. He rested his palms on his legs and breathed heavily. “Hi James,” I said flatly, and turned to continue walking. James immediately rushed to flank my right. “My parents want you to come to a dinner party with me tonight,” he said. Frustration boiled within me.

I slowed my walking. “Your parents don’t even like me. Why don’t you take a mirror as a date?” James’ eyebrows furrowed. “What are you talking about?”

I had been wanting to confront James in a positive manner but the words slipped out of my mouth before I could stop them. “You’re a fucking narcissist, James. See you in combat.” I increased my pace. Stephen caught up with me, laughing. ""You finally told him!"", he chuckled. 

Once we were changed and standing in a line in front of Mr. Lazzar, he began calling out the names to pair up with. “Sera Embers and Cecily Coals,” he announced.

I looked to Cecily first, then to Stephen, absolutely bewildered. Stephen matched my expression. Cecily wore a blank face. James and I were normally paired together while Cecily was usually sat out for practical assessments.

“James Pyre and Evan Hawthorne,” Mr. Lazzar continued without batting an eye.

I made my way over to Cecily. She smiled, her grin widening with every step I took towards her. “Hi Sera!”, she exclaimed excitedly. “Hi,” I replied weakly. I was going to have to combat against the sweet, innocent Cecily? She was a bit weird at times, sure, but no one had actually seen her fight.

Together, we entered one of the assessment rooms. Cecily happily skipped her way over while I was dragging my feet. Once the door was locked, Cecily turned to face me and got into fighting stance. I mirrored her pose. She looked petite in her flameproof bodysuit. The walls were built with fireproof one-way mirrors. 

A countdown and high pitched beep signalled our start. Cecily immediately pounced forward, clicking her fingers. I dodged to the left but she somehow got a hit to my right shoulder. I clutched it more out of shock than pain. Cecily smirked. Flames blanketed her fists. Before I could get over my shock, she kicked out my legs. Cecily sauntered over me. I gritted my teeth and snapped my fingers. I attempted to throw a flameball at her face but she smoothly dodged. Cecily quickly stomped on my right wrist, cutting off my flames. I struggled to hit her with my left hand alone. Cecily raised her arms and created a fire tornado, with us in the eye. I caught her eye and noticed what no one had before. She had heterochromia. She was not a full-blood. 

What she didn't know was that I was not either. Cecily's grinning face slowly turned into horror as she glanced towards her feet. Her foot grinding on my right hand was now sinking into a small pool of lava.

"Magic is Hereditary, but the child's powers is the sum of his parents. Fire Witch + Sand Wizard= Glass magic [WP]",Kmocha,"It had been 23 years. My grandmothers words always echoing in my head about those times. Before the Tridium.

My grandfathers skin once glowed a bright red like the coals he used to keep up in the forge he ran. My grandmothers a soft green, it suited her well, she has always had a passion for life, that same passion passed on to my mother. 

My mother met my father when she was 15 when keeping the fruit stand while my grandmother walked the market. She told me his skin was a dark brown the color of the earth she worked with so often. 

He quickly became accustomed to the forge grandfather ran, being able to push precious metals up from the earth for working. This was all before the blight.

My mother was 19 when her skin started to change, she lost that vibrant green quickly to be replaced a pale moonlight color. She along with my father and grandparents quickly lost their innate ability to summon their elements. 

The government sought help looking for a cure, any form of pure magic to stop the blight that had spread. The entire country quickly became infected. After magic had mixed to far the blight was formed and before they knew it each  family's line was lost to the blight. 

One group came to the governments aid promising relief. The said they could find a cure but were lacking the resources. They said they were healers once a soft sunflower color.

The government handed over all their resources and personnel, willing to do whatever it costs to save the people. One man, Hendrick took charge. My grandmother said he always looked familiar when she visited her home town. She remembers the day when he finally revealed who he was. By then the Tridium had been formed.

Hendrick was the leader of a group of summoners, those of deep maroon skin, never defying the law and always worked within loopholes that he found. He explained that the only way to fix the blight was to find those who could still control magic and find where the power originated from. Thats when the containment camps began.  

Family was ripped from their home when the Tridium came. Quickly pushed to the nearest camp in Farthing my family was contained within the walls of the old forgotten city. 

Keepers created barricades around each exit only removing those that were next for the Emergence. My parents heard stories about the Emergence and the gruesome exploits the Tridium completed on those who were taken. 

One night my grandfather devised a plan with the a couple of the other blight-fallen families. My mother argued with him about his plan, stating it was folly but he knew better. He looked upon her with a soft expression telling her everything she already knew. She was with child and he would not let her risk that trapped behind these walls.

My grandfather being a smith his entire life was a large man. As he ran to the side gate he threw himself on the keeper that just started his shift allowing for families to run. My father stopped to help him up but my grandfather shrugged him off telling him to run and keep my mother safe. 

My grandmother remembered looking back to see my grandfather struck with a large axe the keeper was holding. She cried out as my father pulled her along the dusty road into the night...

I looked at the open area before me as i could see the flames in the distance. The Tridium was using the animated corpses of those who under went the Emergence to consume the residual magic that once populated the area. 

I turned my gaze the other direction trying to scan the hundreds of miles behind me, to the crag I left my parents and grandmother at. As I pulled my gaze down I looked upon my pale skin. Rotating my hands I could see the red glow pulse from my right palm and the sunflower yellow from my left. 

It had been 23 years.

------------------------------------------------

I look up at Glorica. Her picture rested just above the mantle. Six generations of breeding, and she had been born. The *All-Mother*. Able to wield the power of True Creation, as well as many others. And so, of course we voted her to lead our country. And then she had dissolved democratic voting for leaders, and formed a parliament of her most powerful friends.

Well, that wasn't my problem. She was a tyrant yes, but somehow we, her people, still loved her. I picked up my tools, wooden implements wrapped in leather, and started strapping them to me, hidden by my outfit.

 She had taken us to war against most of our neighbors in the last few years, creating armies of golems to defeat them. When the last of our neighboring countries gave in, the Tanlash, it had dropped the price of steel by over 50%. Living under Glorica wasn't all bad. 

Oh well. Even if it wasn't good, at least I am employed. I'm not one of her followers. I'm barely even one of her minions. Most of us **empowered** are on her pay books these days. I am second generation, which gives me a few rights that others don't have.

My father is a piper, able to control the minds of rodents with music. He's a small time rat catcher in my town. My mother is a botanomancer. She does magic with plants, making them grow larger, and stronger.

My only power? I can control small animals and plants with music. and then *fuse* them. 

I twitched the curtain aside. It was deeply dark out. Blackout curtains are still a constant, as bombers from the far east are still a threat. Martial law means anyone caught out after dark is arrested. Well, not including me. Sometimes minioning has its advantages.

Clipping my smallest fold able bow to my back, secreting it under the folds of my clothes. I could feel the large item strapped to my thigh hidden only by the voluminously heavy black dress I wore. I was ready. I rustled as I moved to the front door, glad I had oiled the leathers I wore below so they didn't creak.

I took a few breaths and stepped out.

The streets were eerie in the darkness, but I was used to that. I spent a lot of time in darkness these days. As I passed a storm drain I reached into my sleeve and pulled out a penny whistle. A few notes and I heard scurrying from below. Good. They'd follow me to the destination.

It took half an hour of walking to get to the centre of the city. It would have been 5 minutes in a carriage, but none ran this late under martial law. I saw no-one, and nobody bothered me. 

I found the place, a large building 50 years old at least, made of classic brick. I strode straight past the entrance and down an ally to the rear of the building, where a set of stairs lead down to a large iron door. I whistled softly, and head a squeak in response. Here we go.

I knocked on the door. a few moments passed, and then a peep hole was slid open. I couldn't see inside but could tell a pair of eyes were watching me.

""Password?""

I smiled primly, glad of the weeks of preparation leading up to this moment. ""Glorica must die"".

The peephole slid closed, and I heard nothing for a minute before the door opened.  Inside was a man in a brown wastecoat and matching bowler. ""I don't recognise you. What's your name, and who invited you?"" His hand was resting on a pistol at his hip.

""Lady Eshemell invited me, my name is Tendell, but most call me Ella. Your name must be David?"" I smiled at him and he relaxed slightly.

He nodded and stood aside. I had done my research well. Lady Eshemell had taken a trip to the country... as far as they knew... so he had no way of corroborating my story.

I smiled as I walked past him into the cellar. It lead into a small dingily lit room. Stacks of shelves covered in dust and brick a back. Slightly confused I look back at Dave inquisitively. He pointed to a bucket sitting on a shelf to my left.
Lifting the bucket down to see what was in it, the shelf swung away from me, opening into a hallway.

""Okay I guess I go this way"" I stepped into the hallway and put the bucket back on the shelf which quickly swung closed. 

The hallway was simple brick, with an arched roof. Noticing there was a drain half way along the hall, and that I didn't appear observed, I crouched down and pulled out the penny whistle. I blew a few notes of instruction for those below, and listened for the scurrying to check they had listened. 

Well. I guess its time to show why I'm one of the best paid minions in Ulecia.

Continuing down the hall I came to a sturdy wooden door. Not knowing the protocol, I knocked. The door was opened, showing a reasonably plush sitting room, with carpets, several sofas and a fireplace. It was large, but comfortable looking. I started wondering about how the chimney was ducted to the surface, but quickly reminded myself not to get distracted. There were a series of air vents, up high in the wall. That would serve my purposes.

The man who opened the door, a server of some kind, wearing traditional black with white kid gloves bowed me into the room. As I stepped past him he announced me ""Miss Tendall, friend of Lady Eshemell"".  They had obviously got a communication system rigged up, ready for any trouble that might try to enter. 

Unfortunately for them, they had already let it in. A handsome middle aged man with a thick moustache turned from admiring the fire. ""Welcome Miss Tendall, I remember Lady Eshemell mentioning you. Please take a seat, the meeting will begin soon, when everybody has arrived"".

I thanked him politely and took a seat on one of the sofas, directly beneath an air vent. The servant brought me a cup of tea and I sipped it quietly, waiting for the meeting to start. There were four others in the room, an older lady wearing quite a large amount of gold, she must be Lady Yenneth. There was a younger pair, a couple by their body language.

 The last person was a man, two or three years younger than me, maybe early thirties. He had the most piercing eyes, and he hadn't taken them off me since I had entered the room.

 After a few minutes he stood up, waved to the servant for a drink, and came and stood next to me. ""Good evening Miss Tendall, my name is Doctor Lassenger, may I join you?""

And this was my main target.",daekle

She later told me that she saw me first, that the passing by and the enchanting breeze was deliberate. She picked up a random book, pretended to read it. I'd like to think that I noticed her right away but she always reminds me that it took three tries, that she almost expended her power trying to make me notice. I don't doubt that's true.""

Sigmund sipped his coffee and stared through the window at the pouring rain. His son, only a week old now and still as fragile as glass, slept beside him in his crib, content as only well-fed infants can be.

""It clearly worked,"" I said as I listened to the child's shallow breaths. ""Have you chosen a name for him? One of our names, that is."" Sigmund Stormbringer shook his head.

""That's the thing: these... powers of ours... they're so new. Rare. No one knows what happens when a Storm Lord and an Air Mistress... well, 'breed' for lack of a better word."" I nodded.

""So are you curious to find his type?""

""I'm more inclined to find out as it happens, but this is so new to everyone...."" His voice trailed off. In the ten years since the Manifestation, I'd become something of a historian for the community. Searching for others, helping to keep our existence a secret, chronicling births and deaths.

""Well,"" I said as I opened my laptop, ""for the past decade I've tracked down 175 children born to two gifted parents."" A dull rumble of thunder rolled over the house. The infant cooed at the sound, kicking his feet reflexively. ""Is that your handiwork?"" I asked.

""It helps him sleep.""

""Ahh. I'll bet you weren't expecting that when you manifested, were you?"" He laughed.

""Not at all. I was more interested in ending droughts and diverting hurricanes back then. Not something so... simple. But it's funny how gratifying it is, being able to lull him to sleep.""

""Well, I have seven of my own. All born before the Manifestation, of course. Be grateful it works; I didn't sleep until the youngest went to university."" I opened an encrypted file and scanned through the names. ""Of the eight types, I have data on all but one of the possible combinations. Two like types produce a child of that type, of course. Pure and Hybrid combinations are a bit more tricky.""

""How so?""

""Well, for example, a child born to two different Pure types would always be a hybrid of the two, excepting Fire-Water and Air-Earth parents of course; those powers cancel each other out and the child is...""

""Ungifted?"" Sigmund grimaced at the thought.

""I prefer to call them 'Mainline'. But yes, the child will have no powers.""

""But I'm a hybrid with Air-Water powers, and Lily is a Pure Air type.""

""Right. As a related Hybrid, you can pass on either of your powers, so the child will either be a Pure Air type-- a Master-- or a Storm Hybrid like yourself-- a Lord.""

""It all seems... complicated.""

""No, in fact, it's really the same as blood types, but with four types and a few incompatible combinations. Probability-wise, there are 36 parent combinations and 82 offspring outcomes. 40 will be Hybrids, 24 will be Pure, and 18 will be... Mainline."" Sigmund paused for a moment, deep in thought. The rain began pouring harder in sheets of water against the glass.

""You said there was one combination you hadn't discovered yet. Is that why you came?"" I smiled and nodded.

""Indeed. You, sir, have brought the last possible unique child into our world. Congratulations to your lovely family."" As I put my laptop away and rose to leave, a sweet smell filled the air, like fresh tea and honey.

""Oh, you must be the Archivist. Pardon my appearance; I was taking a nap."" She stood in the doorway, her hair frazzled and her skin glowing.

""I was just leaving, madam. Your son will either be a Storm Lord or Air Master. You should know soon enough."" She smiled and picked him gently out of his crib. The child squirmed and cried softly in his sleep. There was a sudden blast and flash of light, startling us all. But the child simply snuggled into his mother's chest and settled back to sleep.

""Sigmund, don't scare the little guy like that,"" she chided. But Sigmund simply grinned from ear to ear, beaming proudly.

""That wasn't me,"" he replied.",miles_allan

Those four words are ones you never want to hear.  I wasn't too worried though.  Nephele tends to make a big deal out of everything.  And given the timing, I kind of knew what she wanted to talk about anyway. 

She walked into the room I was meditating in, holding a parchment scroll with myriad charts and colorful symbols carefully diagrammed.  A typical Reading.  As soon as I saw it, my instinct was validated.  

Our son, Cadmus, had just turned 10 and like every other child his age, had been Read.  Since Nephele's particular Mix deals with plants and mine with weather, his should deal in a happy medium of the two.  He may find success in agriculture, his farm always favored with productive weather.  

""The results came?  What do they say?""  I asked her.  

""He's... Cadmus is..."" she paused, and looked at me sadly before continuing.  

""I'm sorry.  His Mix is healing.""

It took a moment for me to realize what she was saying, one moment for my world to break like lightning shatters the night sky.

"Magic is Hereditary, but the child's powers is the sum of his parents. Fire Witch + Sand Wizard= Glass magic [WP]",Kmocha,"I think this is the best thought-out WP response I have ever read. Normally responses (even good ones) seem relatively stream-of-consciousness, but yours feels like you planned it, and even more impressively - you foreshadow, and you set up punch lines. This whole story has been so fucking clever and put-together. ""And she convinced me the only way she could - I believed her,"" - this shit is genius. I swear to god you have been sitting on this premise for years.

Your writing style is convincing - it's never cheesy, awkward, or unnatural. It has felt completely professional pretty much the whole time, except for maybe during parts of his dialogue with the queen. It felt like you were trying to force character development (talking about his robin-hood past) and throwing in some extraneous detail (Wednas) that didn't necessarily forward the plot. That said, based on your writing thus far, I would predict that Wednas will not be extraneous for long. I just feel like the detail of that portion of dialogue sort of betrayed the quick pace and action of the story. I really wasn't planning on providing any critique - this is honestly so good that I wasn't thinking critically at all upon first reading. Only on a second reading was I able to pinpoint what factors made the story slow down for me.

This is so cool. The universe you've set up is fucking perfect. Please keep writing, but don't do what the other fantastic responses all end up doing: get lost in a dumb-ass plot that they are making up on the fly. So far you have absolutely kicked ass at making the story cohesive and coherent. Pleeaaassseeee keep doing this.",jyonsin
"Magic is Hereditary, but the child's powers is the sum of his parents. Fire Witch + Sand Wizard= Glass magic [WP]",Kmocha,"It has been nearly a century since the event that brought magic back into the world. Nobody really understands exactly why it happened, but shortly after the event at Tunguska people began developing powers. Some chose to use their newfound abilities for good, like Nikola Tesla, who used his electrical abilities to create wonders. Some went a darker direction, like Adolf Hitler who could bend the world to his will through painting. That one was some weird mix of his mother's mindreading and his father's astral projection.

Humanity really took to their new powers and within forty years we had fought two world wars which were finally ended when President Rooseveldt bravely sacrificed himself by destroying Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It took the last of his strength and he succumbed to an aneurysm shortly after the second explosion. The world rose like a phoenix from the radioactive ashes and entered into what we thought was a new ago of wonders. After the violence of the last few decades it seemed like people were ready to figure things out and truly make the world a better place. The explosion of baby boomers created a vast new range of powers. Human nature soon took over of course, and we were back to our usual tricks.

Nations rise, nations fall and humanity marches on pretty much like it always has, but better. People can do amazing things and terrible things. They still live, and die, and fall in love. I was lucky enough to get a combination of my fathers electric powers and my mother's metal skin which has given me some pretty crazy electromagnetic abilities. I worked at several construction sites to get through high school and college before joining the military. Being able to deflect incoming fire and spit it back wherever I want to is a pretty handy talent, and being a walking EMP doesn't hurt either.

I've seen and done a lot over the years but today, today was special. My wife gave birth today. She has the power to heal people and to my knowledge our exact power combinations have never been mixed so nobody is quite sure what our daughter will be able to do. As a precaution we have to go to a special neonatal unit. A high security one with hermetically sealed blast doors, checkpoints, and other precautions I don't even understand.

"Magic is Hereditary, but the child's powers is the sum of his parents. Fire Witch + Sand Wizard= Glass magic [WP]",Kmocha,"*Tick. Tock. Tick. Tock. Tick.*

6,452 seconds. They really want me to wait it out in here. I wonder if they realized the irony of it all. Maybe they did figure it out and this was an elaborate stunt. Or maybe they were worried that I could do it again even if the door remained closed. 

I wasn't surprised when I woke and found a screen in the room. They wouldn't make the same mistake they made last time and open the door. Everything else was the same.  A bare mattress, a slot for food to be sent through, and the endless ticking of the clock. 

*Tick. Tock. Tick. Tock.*

I stopped counting. I may have slept again, I'm not sure, but if I did it was at least a natural sleep and not the forced unconsciousness of a sleeping magic. That's how they got me both times, I didn't see it coming. Different mages though, it's a fairly common power. Not like mine. 

Eventually the screen blinked on. The torso of a middle-aged woman with a serious face sat behind a mahogany desk. Behind her was a bare wall with the government flag. On her desk were a stack of papers, various fancy decorations, and a name plate identifying her as the Superior Director. Our government's dear leader. I couldn't see anything else in the room but I knew she wouldn't be alone. The red light in the corner of the screen told me that she could see me too. 

""Hi honey. I wish we could meet under better circumstances, but I am glad you're okay."" She flashed a false smile.

""Hi Mom. I am also glad that one of your cronies hasn't killed me yet. I'd probably be much safer if you'd stop trying to assassinate me.""

The director sighed. 

""You are so melodramatic Cassandra. We are not trying to kill you. You are my daughter! Despite what you may think I have your best interest in mind. Besides, what use are you to us dead?""

At least I knew that was half true. Mother doesn't want me dead... yet. Then she wouldn't know my secret. Unless they did figure it out. Mother couldn't stand not knowing anything, never mind something that could prove useful to her dictatorship.

""Why don't you come see me in person so we can discuss how I could be useful then?"" 

The director didn't bother with a retort. Three years ago when they last caught me they had made the mistake of sending someone to question me. All it took was the door being unlocked and I was gone. On their security cameras it looked like I had just disappeared. They knew I couldn't be invisible, my power had to be at least partly from my mother and her ability was speed, nothing to do with the common powers that created invisibility such as light or transformation. 

They didn't know what my father did. He had died when I was young and had no known family living. But it had to be something very basic, so basic that it went undetected his entire life. Probably an elemental magic. Fire, water and air were the most common. My mom had thought him a normal - someone who had no powers because their parents canceled each other out. This happened more often than you would guess. Water and fire mages are often drawn together. I sometimes wondered if my father ever knew he had a power and what it was. I knew. 

""Cassy, please just give this up. You know you are going to cooperate eventually, save us all the pain of dragging it out."" 

Her mother almost sounded sincere. I set my jaw and wondered how close Gary had to be to provide that pain. 

""Fine. Gary, please motivate Cassandra to share some information with us.""

The terror that flooded through me was quickly eviscerated by the pain. My entire body was on fire, inside and out. I  could hear screaming, and knew it came from my own body, but I had no control of it. I held out though. I didn't use my power. After what seemed like an eternity, the pain stopped. 

Mother waited for me to catch my breath. I wasn't actually burned. I wasn't physically hurt at all. The torture was only mental. Gary had a special power. Like Mother. Like me. A unique combination that was very useful to the government. 

Gary was actually the one who revealed all of the secrets to me, though he didn't realize it. As my power manifested I finally realized what my father's elemental gift had been. Ice. I could make things around me stop, or freeze. At first I thought it was just things close to me but then I realized it was everything. Mother's gift wasn't a physical power, she accelerated faster through time. I wondered if she even realized that. But the combination of time manipulation and ice gave me the ability to freeze time. It was sessions with Gary that helped me control it. I  kept doing it to stop the pain. Then, when I learned how to trigger it on my own, I froze time the moment he opened the door. I darted out the open door and spent the last three years running, learning to control my power, and trying to hide. I failed. 

When I didn't volunteer any information, Gary hit me with another round. Again I held out. 

""Come now Cassandra, we'll get it from you sooner or later.""

Mother was right. I couldn't hold out forever. Freezing time wouldn't help me, it would just keep me trapped in the room forever. And each time I did it would look like a glitch on the camera when I didn't have my body position exactly right coming back. Eventually they would figure it out. Or I'll crack and just tell them. 

Another wave of pain blasted through me. My throat felt raw from screaming and tears ran helplessly down my face. 

""Tell us Cassandra. It doesn't have to be like this.""

""Never Mother.""

I spat out the word like a curse and gritted my teeth in anticipation of the pain. The director shook her head. 

""Have it your way. We can play your game. We have all the time in the world.""

This time my screams almost sounded like laughter. ",writes2day

"Magic is Hereditary, but the child's powers is the sum of his parents. Fire Witch + Sand Wizard= Glass magic [WP]",Kmocha,"Hadvar felt the familiar warmth tickle his coarse fingers. He fastened his grip on the pole. Slowly a yellow crease formed into the thin, fine vase, and so he twisted. The yellow leapt up the curves of the vase. It spun and danced its way around to the very edge and back down in an intricate set of loops and twists. 

He knew he had done well. What Hadvar Uhtredson did **not** know, was that it was magic. Not a very strong magic. His father was a successful crab fisher and his mother had been an extraordinarily good cook for a commoner. But no one ever thought much of it, least of all Hadvar. In village life, one tended to do what needed to be done. Excellences of these degrees were simply seen as competence, perhaps even a talent. But magic? Magic had no home in the small port town of Gaedis.

To call Gaedis a town would be generous. A collection of farms that barely kept in contact by a forest road in ill repair. A dock, with a few fisherman's shacks stacked on top of each other like Ramoras on a shark. A pub that only stayed open because the landlord didn't bother to collect rent on the property. But Gaedis applied to be a town, and the crown granted it. So Gaedis was a town.

Hadvar was pleased. The vase would sell for 200 perhaps 300 shells. Maddie would be interested, of that he could be sure. He wasn't too concerned, really. His shop did better than almost any in town. He did things with glass people had never seen.  When they asked him he would simply shrug and say,

""It's really not that hard if you just stay focused."" And they would laugh and pat him on his broad shoulders. 

As Hadvar laid the vase on the shelf to cool. Thomas strode in. 

""Have you looked at the terms yet? Good terms, Hadvar."" Thomas smiled. He always had a tugging smile, always roping people in.

""I have,"" grunted Hadvar.

""They need men, Hadvar. They always do. You won't have to tussel or... You won't,"" Thomas picked up a bottle and spun it in his hands. ""We can have someone run your booth for you. Vada perhaps?""

Hadvar thought about it. He was big, sure, but he was not guard. And besides, he wanted to get to enjoy the fair. But he needed the money. For his trip over to Hyhmeston. They needed new cups at the tavern there. And he had new cups. Besides, he was sweet on Eva, the barmaid.

""I'll do it.""

Thomas rapped his thin knuckles on the table and spun to leave. ""Oh and Hadvar?""

""Yes.""

""They're going to poke around your shop a bit first. Ask you a few questions. Is that fine? Just protocol."" Hadvar didn't like the look Thomas had in his eye. But Hadvar never **had** liked that look in his eye. Thomas always seemed like he was smirking through the guise of torchlight.

""Payment?""

""Half after the first day, half after the second. 2000 total.""

Hadvar grimaced. It looked like he wasn't going to be drinking at the fair.

""I'll do it.""

------------------------------------------------

The squash nosed man pawed the vase with the yellow. Hadvar wished he would put it down, but it seemed rude to ask. And Hadvar tried never to be rude. Arguments almost invariably took up too much time, and he was always busy. 

""You do these how?"" The man's toned ratcheted upwards. Hadvar could almost picture his throat straining to let the words out. A man of scrolls. A lifetime of breathing dust. 

""Just spun and blown. Simple stuff, really."" Hadvar took the vase back. Put it on the shelf. The man's squashed face squashed even more. He looked like a mole Hadvar thought, but he didn't say it. 

Hadvar had been around timid men enough in the bigger towns to know that he wouldn't interject his question. Hadvar would have to put the vase back, turn to face him, and invite him to ask the inevitable question. Another waste of time. Hadvar hated wasting time. His work could not be done in darkness, and, this far north, sunlight was a commodity.

Hadvar sighed. Turned. ""Anything else?""

The poor man looked like he would choke on his trepidation. He slicked his clammy hands together. And now Hadvar thought of mollusks, but he knew better than to say it.

""Could you, er, I mean if you don't mind that is... Could... Erm."" The man made a great deal of clearing his throat, and Hadvar imagined coals being blown over the dry wood of the man's throat. ""Could you show me?""

""Show you?"" Hadvar was confused. He was so distracted by the man's frustrating behavior that he had lost the conversation. 

""How you make them?""

""Oh, do we have the time?""

""Yes I think so. I think so."" The man was very proud of managing to comfort Hadvar so.

And so for the next two hours, Hadvar worked on a new vase. It wasn't good work. He didn't think so. Too much like the vase he had made earlier. He was still stuck on that pattern. Better to mix things up. 

So Hadvar decided to change his song. Faster, more frenetic; the glass began to morph, as it always did, to the tongue of the flame. And he made the shapes he saw in the fire. It was always a dialogue to him. The gruff words of the sand, and the song of the fire. But between them was a balance, a compromise. Together they walked into the oven, but neither of them came out. 

Hadvar forgot himself in the work. Until one particularly difficult task, when the squashed man yelped in glee. Hadvar nearly ruined the flower petals he was adding to the lip of the vase. He cursed. 

When he was done, the squash faced man was completely flusterered. He kept gulping for air like a fish, and dipping his head into his shoulders like a turtle. 

""Magnificent,"" He cried.

""Thank you,"" said Hadvar, and he meant it. The village had grown used to him, and he did not fault them for that. But he had forgotten how warm the touch of praise was. Like the warmth from the fire.

""A true master! We must set you up in the capitol."" Hadvar knew the man didn't have the connections to follow through on that.

""That would be wonderful, sir,"" mumbled Hadvar. 

""Who taught you,"" inquired the man. ""Your father?""

""Oh no. I guess I had to teach myself. The job needed doing.""

The man laughed, and Hadvar could see that he was once a handsome man, before he had given up his body for his mind. Hadvar imagined him, dripping like melting glass down into the pew from which he read. This tickled Hadvar, and he laughed too.

He almost didn't hear the man say it. No. He didn't hear the man say it. He heard something about, 'taught you' again.

""Nobody. I told you."" 

And he noticed that the man stiffened some. Hadvar felt a flush rising his cheeks. What was happening? Why did the man seem so upset. He stood rooted to one spot like a bird on alert. His books had whispered something in his ear. He had figured it out. *But what had he figured out?* Hadvar wondered. 

""Until further notice, Hadvar. You are stay exactly here."" Hadvar nodded.

""May I ask why,"" said Hadvar cautiously.

The cleric shook his head solemnly, picked up his robes and scampered out of the room with determination. 

And then Hadvar knew. The inquisitors. He was going to fetch the inquisitors. But that was absurd. It wasn't a crime to be good at your job, was it? *No* came the voice from inside, *But it is illegal to be a magician*. Hadvar laughed to himself. He wasn't that good. Not by a long shot. He wasn't a magician, he knew that. It was just his prideful nature.

But his stomach was churning, and he began to sweat. With every crackle of the coals it felt as though the sun dropped in the sky.

When the man returned, it was with two soldiers, who stood at the door. *What if that were me* he wondered. I was five minutes from being in that volunteer armor, sweating in a fur vest that was far too small or large. *What would I think of a man like me... of a... a magician.* The word echoed in his brain. It was one of those words that didn't mean anything real. It was just a sound that referred to things in stories. But it echoed anyway. *I would be scared,* he decided. *I would be scared shitless.*

And then the smell of ointment filled the room. Sickly sweet. 

""My dear boy. What have you done?""

Hadvar did not have to look.The old inquisitor used it to treat a strange rash he had. His flesh turned to scales and went numb. But Hadvar did look. He looked over the sunken cheeks and into those cold, cruel eyes...

"Magic is Hereditary, but the child's powers is the sum of his parents. Fire Witch + Sand Wizard= Glass magic [WP]",Kmocha,"That is literally one way I see this story going. The Mind is a powerful thing, and there is no reason a Pure Mind could not delude themselves into believing they were anything else but a Pure Mind. If one believes something strongly enough, it can be so. I can easily see the final reveal of this story being that he finds out that he himself is a Pure Mind who had wiped his own mind of that knowledge to convince himself that he was 'normal'. He becomes King upon the eventual realization that his acute rational/logical thinking and his ""luck"" are beyond natural. He'll start to suspect and he'll come into contact with someone or something, a story or survivor of some other Pure Mind who was able to change what someone believed so completely, that they were able to change even what type of magic they used. Getting to that point would be so awesome. It'd be kind of like a Magic version of Blade Runner, I guess?",gloomyMoron

"Magic is Hereditary, but the child's powers is the sum of his parents. Fire Witch + Sand Wizard= Glass magic [WP]",Kmocha,"These prompts rarely hold up past their initial stories. The writers aren't thinking about building a huge, sprawling world when they write these few paragraphs, and any further elaboration is usually done at a pretty superficial level. 

If OP were to continue developing this world for several chapters then I think we'd begin seeing contradictions fairly quickly. It's pretty difficult to create something on the spot like that and not have cracks. If OP wanted to continue writing this story then I think he should do so in private, properly think about the world he's creating, and come back once he has it all sorted out.

"Magic is Hereditary, but the child's powers is the sum of his parents. Fire Witch + Sand Wizard= Glass magic [WP]",Kmocha,"This reminds me of China Mieville's style of writing. You take the time to explain plot holes before the reader even thinks of them. That and you use world building to convey the tone of the story excellently. 

Wednas was a great tool to explain the expanse of the queen's powers, her wisdom, society's fear of pures, and you leave his existence open to further speculation. The fable could be introducing Wednas as a character, or the queen's descent into madness, or a potential threat that the bishop will have to face as he seeks a new pure mind. The mind control aspect also makes the reader automatically suspicious of every single character, every single action and thought of the bishop, if the Queen is being forthright, and can be easily used to cover plot twists.

"Magic is Hereditary, but the child's powers is the sum of his parents. Fire Witch + Sand Wizard= Glass magic [WP]",Kmocha,"It isn't strange to witness the miraculous. Everyday, I see men and women gliding through the air, or conjuring flame and lightning. Sometimes walking down the street, I'd see the strongmen working on the construction sites. Other mornings, I'd see the water sages redirecting the channel to move boats quickly in and out of the city.

I rose from the bed, and looked out the window. I sometimes cursed my parentage for such a strange power. Other times, though, it was a boon. Of course, one with better morals than I would probably loathe my particular line of work. However, it was to be expected, truly. When society reveres those who can wield the power of sun and sky, the ones who were reviled would be the opposite.

I shifted, letting my physical form ripple. It was a trick I was capable of. Saves a lot of money since I don't actually have to buy clothes. Today, I would be a young lad. Only twenty years or so. They wouldn't think me out of place in the foundry district. There, I'd make my work, and then disappear into the alleys.

A father who wielded flame, and a mother who manipulated plants. Pah, what a joke. Well, that's how the rules work, though. Their love was a pen that inked my life before I was even born.

“Wha-what’s happening?”, Cecily shrieked and tried pulling her leg out. Now it was my turn to smirk at her. Giving up on her still sinking leg, she lunged at me with flaming fists. I ducked and rolled out of her reach. She tried to rotate her torso but she was already knee deep in lava. 

I towered over her as she struggled. “Don’t worry,” I assured her, “your flameproof suit still works.” 

“You don’t know what you’ve done,” the petite girl hissed up at me. “I am trying to save you.” The blue patches in her brown eyes darkened and then faded back into brown. *Like a dying flame.*

I blinked, thinking if I had imagined the whole thing. “Save me from what?”, I asked, genuinely curious. “From being found out, for one, and from James.” “From James,” I repeated, dumbfounded. Cecily’s tiny head nodded. “Now get me out before he sees,” she commanded whilst staring at the one-way mirror. 

I knelt down cautiously, not forgetting that she was trying to punch the lights out of me just minutes earlier. Heating up the lava and pulling Cecily out took a few more minutes. “I guess plan A failed,” she muttered to herself. “So are you going to tell me why you were trying to incapacitate me?”, I asked, crossing my arms. 

Cecily ignored me and quickly swallowed some red tablet, her eyes darting back and forth from the lava pool to the one-way mirror. She closed her eyes for a few brief moments while I awkwardly stood by. Cecily hovered her hands over the lava pool and the molten goo slowly began to recede. In a few seconds, there was no trace of a melted floor. When she opened her eyes, they were brown with white flecks, but they slowly began to turn brown again. 

Cecily wiped her forehead that was beading with sweat. I stared at her, slack-jawed. “How did you do that?”

She swallowed another tablet in response, just before the door burst open. Three testing officers stood in the doorway, all holding clipboards and with gobsmacked expressions. 

“I highly suggest you forget what you saw and destroy those notes,” Cecily said. Except, it was Mr. Lazzar’s voice. Mr Lazzar’s voice was coming out of Cecily’s mouth. 

The testing officers stood with confused expressions, wondering why they had entered the room. 

Even more questions swarmed my mind. The most important being, ‘what is Cecily?”

"Magic is Hereditary, but the child's powers is the sum of his parents. Fire Witch + Sand Wizard= Glass magic [WP]",Kmocha,"To say my parent's gave me a, well, *unusual* mix of powers would be an understatement. Thunderstorms and Healing was a weird mix, but when my dad helped save my maternal grandmother's life from a rogue lightning strike, I guess it was love at first sight. I could easily say that I could have nearly any type of power, except for anything to do with the dead.

""It's almost three, dear. Are you ready?"" My mother asked, her frizzled hair peeking through the door. The Awakening process was one of the most anticipated day of a mage's life, when their elemental prowess would be decided. And I had so many directions I could go, it's not even funny.

""Just about. Just let me get this stupid tie on."" It looked funny. The knot looked bulky, not at all what my dad showed me. I was tempted to ask him for help, but more than likely he was treating the victim of what appeared to be mom's latest discharge. She didn't have to summon a full blown storm, but sometimes she had to let out a little steam when she got stressed. Her steam just happened to materialize itself as electricity.

""Need any help?"" Mom asked. She had a sheepish look on her face, confirming my suspicions.

""I'm good."" I lied. She would be static for about an hour, and she looked like she just vented. 

""Alright dear, I'll be downstairs."" I fumbled a little more with the tie, and had at least a satisfactory knot when I was done. I quickly walk downstairs. *2:48. Everyone's waiting for me.* My fears were confirmed when I saw pretty much all of my family, immediate and extended, sitting in the living room.

""Shouldn't we be outside?"" I ask, wondering why everyone is seated. I quickly spot my dad over by my uncle, the glow on his hands fading. *Must have been serious.* ""Is everyone okay?""

""We're fine."" My dad pipes up, knowing where my eyes fell. He personally didn't mind my mother's episodes, but I was afraid I'd end up with something similar to her. ""Just waiting on you, Al.""

""So what are we waiting for?"" I ask. ""Let's take this Awakening outside!"" I don't bother to wait for everyone, quickly rushing for the door. At the first sign of electricity, I'm grabbing an iron pole for safety. I don't know how my parents' hodgepodge of powers was going to materialize within me.

I stand out on the center of the patio, close to the grounded piece of iron. *2:59. Any second now.* People are filing out now, and I can feel an ache in my head. *Mom described it as a second pounding in her chest. Dad described his awakening as a dizzying feeling. I guess it feels different for everyone.*

""Ten! Nine! Eight..."" I can't focus on them anymore. The aching in my head is now excruciating. It feels like my head is about to burst...

I heard shouting, but it sounded like it was miles away.

"Magic is Hereditary, but the child's powers is the sum of his parents. Fire Witch + Sand Wizard= Glass magic [WP]",Kmocha,"You know when you were little and I used to take you to church on Sunday mornings? You thought the stained glass was the most beautiful thing, especially the saints with their little round halos.

“Mama,” you’d say. “Look at their sun hats. All lit up.” You’d stare at them the whole time and miss the service. 

 That’s what your daddy looked like to me the first time I saw him. He had his long hair back then, big brown curls, and when I looked up, the sunset caught him from behind and lit his hair up. If you’d have been around back then, you’d have said he looked like a church saint with his sun hat.

To me he looked like a lion with his mane on fire. 

I was still drinking in those days. And smoking. It was St. Patrick’s Day and I was sitting on the curb pounding some beers and Camel Menthols, watching the world spin.

He tapped me on the shoulder and asked for a light. I took one look at him and my breath stopped. And I guess he must have felt something too because after he looked at me for a minute, he said, “Damn, you’re pretty.” Then he pulled me up and we danced together the rest of the night. And the rest was history.

I was young and stupid, but your daddy was like magic to me back then. He made me feel warm. He was 21, I was 18. He played guitar and sang, made me laugh so hard I would see stars popping and think I was gonna pass out. And it was good for me - I was too serious all the time. 

I looked after him, too — he never had clean laundry before he met me. Neither of us had parents, and I wrapped myself around him and tried to be everything a big kid like him could need. 

We made mistakes. Sometimes I laughed when I didn’t feel like it so that he felt good. And sometimes he let me treat him like a child so that I felt good. We fought sometimes - screaming the roof down. But we couldn’t get enough of each other. He told me I was like sand - I’d got into every part of him and no matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t stop thinking about me. 

We had you soon after, and you made our love get bigger. Sometimes on Sunday mornings, we’d just lay in the big bed, the three of us, for a long, long time. There wasn’t anything better than watching you laugh when we lifted you up and down, or trying to trick you into saying “mama” or “dada.” I’d watch you sleeping on your daddy’s chest and think, “Goddamn. This is everything.”

You were so smart, and you had his sense of humor even when you were a boy. You’d think of the funniest things - like the sun hats. Or the whole summer you spent talking to everyone you met like you were Mickey Mouse. You never stopped moving or asking questions. You had that fire in you, like your daddy.

But I know now that you had me in you too. Too smart for your own good. Brooding. I knew sometimes that you could hear us fight, caterwauling and carrying on. But you never cried once, never asked why we fought. If anything, after he’d slam the door and tear out of the driveway, you’d come comfort me, give me a hug and ask if I was okay. In a kind of stupid way, I was proud. I thought, “My little boy is so strong.”

I didn’t know it was a coverup.

Your baby brother made things complicated. The doctors told us quick after I got pregnant again that he was positive for Down’s Syndrome. We were still too young, too stupid, too invincible in our own minds. We just thought — oh, this is going to be a lot of work, but it will bring us back together. We’ll make it. It could be worse. You tell yourself a lot of lies to make it, kiddo.

And then Manny was born with his big, beautiful eyes. And then he cried for the first time and didn’t stop for four years.

Oh my sweet boy. I didn’t see. How could I? He’d scream for days on end. And we were in and out of hospitals. In and out, in and out, even now. He was always sick, he had a bad heart. It took everything - and I mean everything - to make it through the day with Manny. And then I’d try to squeeze out some more for you, help you with some homework, try to watch a movie together and not fall asleep on the couch. But I tried not to worry about you because you were strong and helpful.

To tell you the truth, I think I barely even noticed when your daddy left. I think something changed in him when your baby brother was born and the reality of what we had to face set in. And he started pulling away. Going out on the road more, playing more gigs for extra cash, he said. I was so swallowed up by your baby brother, giving him my marrow and trying to save a little extra for you - how could I have spared anything else for man who wouldn’t grow up and get skin in the game?

It was a relief when he started sleeping around. It meant I didn’t have to take care of him that way. But I knew that it meant we were on borrowed time.

On the last day, he said he just couldn’t take it any more. He was never not worrying, he said. He wanted to feel free again. 

I asked how he thought he could walk away from us - from me, if I was like sand all over him, like he’d said. He said the fire had gone out. And I guess he was right. Fire needs air to breathe. You throw sand on it to put it out.

I didn’t have time to be sad. It felt like a weight off me — and I thought it’d be good for all of us: you, Manny and me, to have two less people in the house screaming.

I knew I should have asked you more how you felt. Tried to explain things. But if I’m telling to truth, I was scared. I was scared of seeing how bad you were hurt. I thought — oh God! — I thought to myself that if me and your daddy were sand and fire — maybe that made you glass. Strong and beautiful, but it’ll come crashing down if you shake it too much, if you go digging. And I thought you were doing so okay, so I let you be.

It only got harder to take care of everything on my own. Manny got bigger and stronger, impossible to manage. Nights and days have blurred together and today I feel like I’m looking up for the first time, waking up into a nightmare.

I forgot the other thing about glass — you look through it to the world on the other side. I looked right past you at all the things I had to hold together to keep the world from falling apart.

And now I’ve got nowhere to look but at your face, pale and hard in the casket, asking myself when you grew a beard? And where did that little scar on your forehead come from? And is the son-of-a-bitch who gave you your first needle in this room? 

It may sound strange, but I don’t wonder about the blame. It’s my fault, I know that. I’ll carry that certainty to my grave, through every bleak, awful day until my heart stops. 

For me, the terror of every excruciating moment I’ll live will be in picking up the broken pieces of the life I looked past, turning them over and over in my hands and wondering when exactly I lost you - my precious boy, my first born, my glass-child.",slowmomusic

A sharp pop and a sound similar the dropping a whole box of pop rocks in your own mouth was here and gone.  All that remained was a beautiful garden salad on a hard plastic disc.  He tossed it to the smirking 4 armed college girl with a loose smile of his own.  ""What you up tonight sugar.""  ""Oh you know, just trying to keep myself busy.""  She winked and wriggled her 3 free hands in an all too seductive way.  She turned her back and tossed a coaster from the bar at him with her number on it over her shoulder.  ""Call me after you've cleaned up Jimmy.""  

For the first time in recent memory Jim smiled.  It was tough being a 9-5'er in a super powered world, but alas his father, a semi-pro disc golfer breaking into the pro tour and his mother who was fast at work at the greenhouse for the majority of her life.  There just wasn't much marketability for a young man who could summon plastic discs full of fresh veggies out of thin air.

"Magic is Hereditary, but the child's powers is the sum of his parents. Fire Witch + Sand Wizard= Glass magic [WP]",Kmocha,"""Histhh...."" Began his breath as he lifted up pressing on toes tucked under his heels.  Still expanding his breath leaned against his skeleton ever seeking a greater essence as his back arched and his knees just an inch off the ground.  He leaned back on he reach his arms up framing the red orb of the sun in a loose triangle with his hands. his eyes were alert and aware but his eyelids and face were completely relaxed as his inhalation finished, he smoothly contracted back into the fetal ball now facing west against the sun. 

Right in the pregnant pause before his next breath something seized and twitched in the root of his eye, and his mind leaped out the air became thick as detail swarmed through the mans awareness subtle drafts of air the lingering warmth of a dogs refuse forgotten by a careless minder, or perhaps a stray crafty enough to dodge the hungry ""muddies."" Those born with powers so at odds with each other that rather than manifesting they laid dormant rather than engorge themselves in a battle for dominance and oftentimes exhaust the host's body in the process, those still recognizable were buried with dignity. They were brave, risking on of the commercial activators the few magical dynasties left had developed. Those who somehow survived the experimental procedures were even more pitied.

 The dynasties had survived with functional and still powerful magics by inbreeding, and outbreeding, although a few had gone barbaric and preserved their womenfolk as breeding chattel through cloning, using their knowledge wrested through countless experiments on muddies. He knew firsthand their depravity, he had seen a Dynastic mage with a fiery red beard feed a tonic to a muddy only to laugh with glee as it caused the man to melt from the inside out eventually combusting into a viscous ash.

 The twitch in his eye banished the memory and pulled deeper, catching a stray firegnat, small pests that bit and exploded pea sized craters in those not gifted enough to repel them. The twitch continued to lengthen as a portion of his mind screamed at his body to breath. It's neighboring synapse reassured the musculature of his embedded habits that it was breathing, but that right now Silt was digging though the elements in the gnats body searching for the one he could swell or sap to cause the little fucker to burst. He found it by feel the smallest resonance of elemental synergy in his hybrid parentage that he could detect and pulled, the rest of his heritage swelling in a chaotic thunder causing a mildly painful, powerful sizzling through his body. The firegnat erupted in a hydrogen puff so intense it blinded onlookers and left a few scorch marks on the earth a yard beneath the pest. Silt stumbled to the ground as satisfaction disrupted his calm center and a sinister snarl curled across his otherwise benign Muddie features.

 The dynasties were all so distinct, centuries of inbreeding selective for the latent physical attributes of their elements. But muddies were benign, impossible to identify and inherently forgettable to the proud wielders of dynastic magics. Silt hated all of them. Once he'd found all the strings to pull, he'd tear them apart from the seams God himself had sewn them together from. For where the Dynasties had developed winds and woods and fire and lightnings, muds and madness, a stray abandoned in the mud had seen deeper. 

A second twitch from his other eye sucked in a shimmering liquid flickering in the space the Firegnat had been hovering in. At least that's what Silt thought it was. As he breathed in the tingling subsided and was replaced by a soreness across his whole body, but Silt still felt energized and drained at once. It was another facet of this new magic he'd been gifted with. His awareness subsided as the gnawing thoughts of food tore at his seven almost eight year old stomach. A nearby bush stirred and another muddie urchin limped forward on legs that had broken and never set. ""When we're older, I will command all the thieves and beggars, unite the muddies in the shadows. We will find the mages that killed mother, and we will kill them one by one, in the dark shadowy moments when the think they are safest."" Softly bid Silt's brother Clay. Clay was one moment the elder of the twins, but his eyes couldn't pull only see into the structure of things. Still he was the more assertive personality. Silts quest for mastery of his gift had left him reclusive and painfully shy. The Muddie priest whose dirty blonde rather than muddy brown hair marked him as a byproduct of a dynastic who had gone slumming, always remarked as he called to the boys from across the dusty courtyard. Father Tacon made sure the boys at least always had a place to sleep with at least one, usually two meals each day. ""Those unlucky enough to have no families rarely live past puberty unless they find a guardian like me!"" the priest announced.

"Magic is Hereditary, but the child's powers is the sum of his parents. Fire Witch + Sand Wizard= Glass magic [WP]",Kmocha,"I could feel myself starting to wake up. Everything had been replaced by a dull ache; my entire body hurt, my ears pounded, the darkness pressed uncomfortably against my eyes. I tried to call out for help, but I couldn't hear whether I was successful or not. I faded back into unconsciousness.

------------------------------

""Is he okay?"" I asked my husband as he walked out of the room.

He sighed as he closed the door. ""His Awakening took a lot out of him, Margie. All I can tell you is that he's alive. We're going to have to wait longer for him to wake up.""

I slid into a chair beside the door to Alvis's room. ""Why? Of all the mixes that could have happened, why this? Why our son, Joseph?""

""We knew there was a chance something like this would happen. You know as well as I do the genetics surrounding magical inheritance aren't fully understood. Though, to be honest, I was caught off guard.""

""So many elements... Is that really all his magic amounts to?""

He pulled me into a hug. I could feel the cool sensation of magic flowing through me. ""No, dear. We know that's not true.""

------------------------------

I groaned as I became awake. The sensations I felt before were dull, a distant nightmare. I opened my eyes to find myself in a dark room with little light. The outlines of furniture told me that it was my room at least. *Aunt Teresa probably went through the trouble of blacking out my windows.*

""Hello?"" I called out painfully. I really hoped someone was nearby. I was unbearably thirsty, and my throat felt super coarse and gritty. *What happened to me?*

I heard shouting, unbearably loud shouting as someone rushed through the room. I firmly shut my eyes to try and deal with the pain. A cool, crisp sensation flowed through my body. ""Dad?""

I couldn't make out a response, since I started to feel shivers going down my spine and my head began to pound again. ""Dear,"" I heard my dad finally say in a normal voice, ""Whisper. He feels like he has a migraine.""

""Sorry."" I hear her say. ""Alvis? Can you hear me?""

""Uh huh."" I manage the reply. The aching is going away now, and the cooling sensation is focused on my head. ""What happened?""

""What did he say?"" I hear dad ask.

""I think he wants to know what happened."" Mom replied.

""Well, you put a hole in our backyard for starters."" Dad jokes, his voice a little louder now. ""Mom can make it rain for a few days, and we'll have that swimming pool you wanted.""

""Is everyone okay?"" I ask. *What powers could have done that? Neither of my parents have access to fire magic to create explosions.*

""Just a few scrapes from debris flying around. You're the only serious injury, and even then most everything is healed up."" Most of the pain has faded away now.

""My elements?""

They pause. I finally manage to open my eyes again, and see both of them looking at me. Dad's sitting beside my bed, his magic pulsing through me to help ease the pain while mom stands beside him. I can't see mom's face, but dad's is etched with concern.

""Get some sleep."" Dad says, as I feel myself start to lose consciousness again. ""We'll tell you when you wake up again.""

------------------------------

""How are we going to tell him?"" Margie asked me as we left the room.

""When he wakes up, we'll just let him know. I'll admit, I wasn't expecting any of our children to be Pures.""

""And why couldn't you tell him that just now?"" She closes the door behind her, bolting it shut.

I shrug. ""He was exhausted, and I didn't want him to try anything. Better to wait until he's awake to risk losing the upper half of the house.""

""Joseph, this isn't a time for jokes. Do you know how hard his life is going to be now? With only one element?""

""Hey, I made it alright with healing as my major focus. I can barely conjure a puddle of water or shape the rocks into something coherent, but I'm not hurting for it. I'm sure he'll manage too."" Margie sighed, and ran a hand through her hair. I could see the frizz build up instantly. ""Go outside if you need to discharge. I've used up most of my magic for now. I need to rest too, you know.""

""Do you even know what that was?"" She asked, as she started to go downstairs. ""Elements weren't my strong suit in school.""

""Energy, dear. We both passed him energy magic.""

""We *both* had energy magic?"" she asked.

I chuckle as we hit the bottom stair, and exit out the front door. ""My healing magic is half energy. Water and Earth are the other two smaller components. As for you, what do you think your lightning is? It's a large part of your power mix considering all the electricity you create, alongside air and water."" We walk along the side of the house, and arrive in the crater that was our backyard.

A powerful boom echoes across the sky as my wife fires a powerful bolt of lightning straight into an iron pole we buried partly into the ground. Al had requested we do that, just in case his main magic turned out to be lightning. I'm surprised it was still there, even if it was bent pretty low to the ground now.

""Will he have a future? Even with only one element?""

""He can. There hasn't been a documented Pure energy mage in almost a hundred years. He's got a lot of discovery to do, and he can walk into any academy in the nation now.""

""But what about fanatics? Cults? what if he gets kidnapped?""

I pause. ""I don't know.""",Cart_King

"Magic is Hereditary, but the child's powers is the sum of his parents. Fire Witch + Sand Wizard= Glass magic [WP]",Kmocha,"It was vital that Phasran with different animals didn't create children.

It wasn't that it was taboo – no, it was taboo due to the monsters it created. 

Monsters like me. 

My mother had been a horse. She had a tryst with an eagle. And I was very unlucky. 

My animal – the animal that I could shape-shift into – is a disgusting combination of eagle and horse. An equine body, deep chest with four powerful legs, topped with an eagle's head. Wings lay alongside my back, and my fore-feet were claws instead of hooves.

The animals always war inside me. One fearlessly dominates the sky, killing from above. The other rolls its eyes in horror at every slight sound, forever fearing death. 

Sometimes, it worked. My powerful legs would carry me, pounding, over the plains, the grass whipping at my side. I would jump, stretch my body out, wings held directly out to the sides, catching the breeze to hold me aloft for a couple extra seconds. Those days were glorious. Those days I ruled the land. 

Other days, my weight held me to the ground and my wings were unable to lift me up on the soaring thermals. My eagle screamed in desperation to ride high in the sky. My horse screamed in terror anytime its hooves left the sturdy ground. 

Today was a bad day. A wandering pack of Phasran had come to our town, bringing goods from afar for trade. The newcomers – most of which had never likely seen a creature such as myself – stared at me. Many spat at me. Some had even struck me. 

I didn't blame them. I was a reminder of all the things that could go wrong with their powers. I was a reminder of why they must be careful. I was an example of how their power could be used by others. Exploited to change the world in which we lived. 

And so, I had run. I would avoid my town until they had moved on. My mother had looked at me, her shoulder's drooping, her eyes downcast as she told me to leave. They would leave in a fortnight, she had said. Until then, I was to stay away. 

And so I was away. Standing alone in a broad field as my animal. Grass waved sedately in the slight breeze. The scent of spring heavy on the winds. The air was quickly turning into the oppressive heat of summer, but spring's nip still held on in the evening breeze. Around me, the world cried for mates: birds and crickets sand, flowers threw pollen into the wind. And I stood alone. I belonged to the Phasran race, but there would never be another like me. No one that would run the grasslands like me. No one that would catch small breezes and hurtle across the ground, hooves brushing the tops of the grass. 

I filled my lungs with the pollen-rich air that hung heavy around me. 

I heard the wingbeats before I saw them. 

At first, there was confusion. What animal was that big? Then, terror. My horse realized just how big a creature who's wings sounded like those would be. My first instinct was to bolt, to feel the wind in my mane as I got as much distance between the creatures making those noises and myself. My heart pounded, my breathing quickened, and I felt my haunches bunch in readiness to bolt. 

It took all of my will to hold my animal still. This was not a time for it to let its instincts rule. I pushed it down, shoving it further into myself, taking it from the dominant location and moving it down. I shape-shifted back into my human form. 

A breath later and I realized what those wing beats must be. Griffins. Which meant that elves were coming. 

I looked around the field, looking for the nearest shelter. I had to get out of sight before they crested the trees. I looked at the nearest stand, thought – with all of my might – that it was safe. Only that thicket. Nothing else. 

This planning done, I shape-shifted back into my animal. 

Terror overtook me again, and I let it. My heart pounded – a rhythm that countered that of my hooves. My breaths came in gasps, timed with my powerful gallop. My wings pumped the air, making the ground under my hooves lurch in an unsettling way. 

The wing beats were behind me. In front of me. They were upon me, surrounding me. 

I heard the screech of griffins, the screams of elves. 

And I ran. I wasn't going to make it. I would never be safe. The terror of a thousand deaths pumped through my veins and my animal decided it had had enough. 

My hooves dug into the ground and I whirled, bucking my powerful back legs high into the air. 

I felt them connect and I heard the scream of a griffin. 

Then I felt claws grasp my hindquarters, pulling one of my legs up and off the ground. I pulled and bucked, even flapping my wings as I struggled. 

I felt something land on me and felt a sudden calm replacing all of my fear. I blinked, feeling as if I was suspended in a dream, one leg held by large claws, a small weight on my back, pinning one of my wings, and I was calm. 

The claws holding my leg let go, and I watched as the griffins landed, their elven riders sliding off of their backs. I watched, calmly, as an elf approached. 

I shifted back into my human form, as easily as if I had been strolling down the road, not surrounded by large predators and the race I had been taught to avoid at all costs for my entire life. The weight on my back shifted, and I turned to look behind me. An elf had a hand on me, touching one of my shoulders. He was using magic, I realized, the thought dull and distant.

The elf approached me, her footsteps calm and even as she watched me. The angular jaw and ear, similar to a human's but longer and thinner, was foreign to me. She regarded me for a long moment, then nodded. “You are unique. I am sure you realize this. I am also sure that you have heard tales of what horrors we elves perform.” 

I just stared at her for a long moment, silently waiting for her to order the rest to capture me and take me away. 

“But is it really any more horrible than what your people do to you? Outcast and told that you are a monster, to one so unique as yourself. Come with us and you will be worshiped,” she said. She held out a hand, waiting for me to take it. 

I stared at her for a long moment, and I felt a different, unfamiliar, war start within me. It wasn't likely she was lying. They would worship me. They would also create beasts that look like me. 

And so I went with her, knowing that I would be examined intently by the elves. Knowing that I would be the basis for their creation of beasts that look like me. And knowing that all of my race would despise me even more for it. ",TZscribble

"Magic is Hereditary, but the child's powers is the sum of his parents. Fire Witch + Sand Wizard= Glass magic [WP]",Kmocha,"Chapter 4 THE SCIENCE OF MAGIC

1. Magic is a muscle and grows or withers depending on ones use and practice. We do not know where the source of this energy originates.

2. An offspring's magical abilities are the sum of the parents, however that sum can vary in strength and ability. A fire and an earth mage could have a child that controls magma, however the child could also practice a form of metal magic.

3. If the magic of two mages is not compatible then an offspring may be born without any ability.

4. Magical ability emerges with puberty.

Grey Put his book down and looked out his small window over the ivy infested graveyard that lay just beyond his parents property. 

""This book is useless"" Grey muttered as he tossed the old paperback textbook into the pile of books that littered his floor. ""How the hell do you explain me?"" he
asked out loud hoping for some answer. With a deep sigh he fell back into his bed trying to unravel the mystery of his ability. 

Grey's mother and father had possessed magical abilities. His mother was a life mage and she practiced her art at the local hospital. She was renowned as one of the strongest healers in the land and even brought a few patients back from the grip of death with her special defibrillation technique. His father on the other hand worked in the morgue and was considered cursed with his death magic. Death magic was not nearly as metal or dark as people think. Grey's dad could touch a deceased individual to determine the exact time and cause of death. His father also possessed the little known ability of being able to talk to the dead. They didn't sit up or actually vocalize how they felt it was more like they transmitted images and feelings into him. 

Doctors believed that with such conflicting magic from his parents that he would be without magic all his life. On his 13th birthday a magical examiner came to determine if he had developed any abilities. The examiner came and went in under 5 minutes when she read that his parents were of conflicting magic. Little did the examiner know he just missed the find of the century. Grey was the first true Necromancer.

"Magic is Hereditary, but the child's powers is the sum of his parents. Fire Witch + Sand Wizard= Glass magic [WP]",Kmocha,"*My Backstory:*

As many of you know, I haven't had it easy growing up. I don't even remember my dad since he lost his big fight in '85. The only things I know about him is what I've heard about him on television. Before I was old enough to appreciate the gift that he had left me, I hated him for the simple reason that he wasn’t there. I needed a father figure, but the only thing I got was the ""opportunity"" to call myself the son of the ""Sonic Surfer"", the legendary sound-based battle-mage. 

After dad had died mom had to care for little me and my foster sister all by herself. The only thing dad had left her, were debts and a second pregnancy with my soon-to-be little brother. This burden proved to be too much, even for ""Motown's fastest"". Stress, poverty, responsibility for 2 troublemakers and the pregnancy were just too much to bare without going crazy. She started taking the pills to stay sane, but they only ended up making her snap even harder. She hit me and sis a lot and beat the love for her and this world in general out of me. The only thing that was left inside was the hate that has defined me and my work ever since.

But I got older, too old to just keep on hating everything and when I realized that, I started to appreciate my parents again. Sure they failed as parents but how could I really hate someone, I can’t even remember? And I can't hate my mom anymore either because I now see that she did what she could and nothing will ever change the fact that she only wanted the very best for me and sis. My parents may have given me a lot of things to hate about them, but the magic talent I inherited from these two was just what i needed. The tool to vent all this pent-up hate and frustration to the world.

The door slammed. Lenuța ignored it, instead focusing on the swirling in her wine glass. She heard a sigh, muted footfall, and then a quiet creak as her daughter entered her room. Lenuța slammed her wine down and poured herself another glass. 

It had been almost a year since they found out, but Claudia still said her greetings every morning and afternoon whenever she left and returned home. She never gave up, though no one ever answered her greetings or even seen her off, except maybe a couple of servants who might have been around. Lenuța thought of answering a few times, but what would she have said? I'm sorry? Do you blame me? It's not your fault? I'm still proud of you? I still love you? She wasn't sure if she could. And as time wore on, it just got more and more difficult to say anything. So she didn't. 

At least she was still here, she bitterly thought to herself, as she poured herself another glass. He couldn't. Oh, sure. For the first few months he was here, pretending to be the perfect parent. Wordlessly taking all the abuse and all the blame, and then letting her cry to sleep on his shoulder... but he couldn't fix it and in the end he couldn't even keep up the act. Or maybe that too, was...

She threw the empty bottle at her reflection. Useless. Powerless. Waste of space. She got up on shaky legs and floated to her bed as the waves tilted her room this way and that. She should have listened. They all told her not to. That she would be throwing away her future, that she would bring shame on her family name. And what if they had a child? What sort of a life would that child lead? But he had made her feel weightless, like she was tumbling on waves of giddiness, and everything was just so exciting and... had she been in love? Was that love? She didn't know anymore.

She closed her eyes and shut the world out. Maybe she had been only fooling herself, even then. Would someone who had been capable of love shut her own daughter out for being a Null?",Ziaheart

*…the lottery, I’m gonna win the lottery. Then I’ll show them…*

*…still itching, maybe I should see a doctor…*

*…damn slut, thinks she can take...*

Carl shook his head, quieting the voices around him. It was a cold November morning, and from his usual seat on the park bench he watched the pressing flow of the morning commute. He took a tentative sip of his too-hot coffee, adjusted his scarf and sat back, basking in his morning routine. He liked his job, if you could call it one. Carl relaxed his mind and let the voices swim around him once more.

*…for Alexa, headphones for Grace…*

*…voy a llegar tarde…*

*…act cool, act inconspicuous. Man, why is it so hard to act casual? Just gotta drop the money and then…*

Bingo.

Carl scanned the crowd, seeking the owner of the phantom voice. A man walked past, awkwardly smiling at the passing commuters, hands thrust deep in his jacket pockets. That was the one.

Carl rose, faked a long stretch, and set off into the crowd, falling into step behind the target. He had done this hundreds of times before, and he fell into a comfortable rhythm; tail the target, shut out all voices but theirs, keep a low profile, then strike. 

The target turned into a coffee shop. Unfortunate; Carl preferred private, secluded places to conduct his business. He shrugged, figuring that he had time to kill and could use another cup, and ducked inside.

The café was small and warm, the welcome scent of roasted coffee and the mundane thoughts of a dozen patrons swimming around him. His target waited in a short line, and Carl swung in behind him.  He opened his mind again.

*…shouldn’t get the latte, too many calories…*

*…gotta pee, gotta pee, hurry up, hurry up…*

*………………………………..*

Strange. Someone must be zoned out. The line moved forward, and Carl glanced around, looking for an explanation, maybe someone was asleep at a table.

“Hi, I’ll have a…”

“Double tall nonfat mocha?”

“Yes, how did you know?”

“Oh, it’s just a gift.”

Carl spun around.  Interesting.

“Next.”

“Hello, I would like a…”

“Grande soy latte, extra foam?”

“Wow, you’re good, I haven’t been in here in months, quite the memory you have.”

“Ha, thanks, anything else?”

The barista. His target paid for his coffee and strolled down the bar, and Carl was face to face with a gorgeous blonde, her blue eyes piercing but friendly.

“H…Hi there, I’d like a…”

Out of curiosity, Carl let the statement hang in the air, watching the barista closely. Her glowing smile cracked, then faltered, and she shook her head slightly. 

“I’m sorry, you would like what?” 

Visible concern flashed across her features, and Carl probed into her thoughts.

*………………………..*

Nothing. Carl cleared his throat awkwardly, glanced around the café, and ordered a black coffee. He ambled off in a daze, rubbing his temples. Something was wrong, something… her… He collected his coffee and moved to a low arm chair. His target was gone, but he didn’t’ care.

*I know what you are.*

Carl choked on the steaming coffee, spraying the newspaper he had grabbed. The voice in his head giggled, and was gone.

No. It couldn’t be.

“Let me guess, you’d like a grande chai latte?

“Wow, that’s incredible… how did you know?”

It had to be her. The same melodic timbre, slight British accent. 

Carl took a deep breath, relaxed his shoulders, and sought out the barista’s thoughts. Finding what he thought was her mind, he imparted a message, like had done so many times before on his targets.

He heard the barista laugh mid-conversation, interrupting a customer then apologizing awkwardly.

The customer paid and moved on, and in the brief respite before the next patron the two telepaths' eyes met across the crowded cafe.

[WP] A society where weather modification is widespread.,Skyn5t,"It's always sunny in Philadelphia, Washington, Miami, Anchorage, and Toronto. That's where I live Toronto, Ontario, it's December 24th and tomorrow is Christmas.

I still dream of a white Christmas, but it's been four may be five years since that has happened. The Weather Control Board (WCB) sees to it. Over all town's, city's, and village's they keep it a balmy 20 degrees Celsius during the daytime. At night you get the occasional light rain, when they deem it necessary.

If I drove to the middle of nowhere, I'd find snow. It's all I dream about, at this time of year. From my apartment building I can see lights twinkling, and fake snow (white plastic) laid about by other like minded individuals.

I stare at the tree in the corner, a few small gifts underneath from family and friends. It's also my first Christmas since Patrick, my late husband died. That two makes me wish that those WCB officials would mess up, and allow snow to wash away the bad memories. Clean my life up again.

My coffee pot hisses as it finishes percolating, and in the neighboring apartment I hear a familiar carol play about peace on earth and goodwill to men. Light starts to fade and evening comes in, dark and mysterious. I leave the lights off and watch people hustle and bustle below. Some time before midnight I enter my bedroom, and without even changing into jammies, I jump up onto the bed, hoping to dream of a brighter day.

Patrick enters my dreams, I dream of our first date to the Blue Mountain Ski Resort. This was back before WCB. We were in our first year of College, Christmas Break, and I said, that I wanted to try skiing. Big mistake, we were there just one day and I ended wearing a leg cast for the next 6 months. But he stayed by me the whole 5 hour wait at the hospital.

The next morning I swear I could hear him whispering in my ear, ""Get up, my love."" I slowly open my eyes, and it's almost like I can see him twinkling in front of me, then vanishing. I ran out of the room to my window, snow had indeed fallen, it was a gift, ""Thank you Patrick, I hope to see you again some day, and Merry Christmas.""",KiraMartin

[WP] A futuristic knight is been granted the highest accolade.,Skyn5t,"The queen raised her sword, and brought it towards the kneeling man’s shoulder. He sighed deeply as he looked up to her, each piece of metal reflecting the shimmering sun to the walls of the palace. 

“I anoint you today” she began to speak, her voice firm, but trembling “for your contributions. You have saved my life.” Her breath held itself tight inside her chest as she touched the old sword to the man’s right shoulder. Her eyes flickered up to the crowd; hundreds of people were gathered here today in celebration, a celebration of life. Her eyes had glossed over, her hand began to shake. She looked back to the man, slowly raising the sword over his head and to the other side.

“As you all know-” She spoke up to the crowed, all pushed together in old pews that had been placed in front of her thrown for the event. “A threat was placed on my lif-“ Her voice cut out, echoing into the hall. A single tear rolled down her cheek. “I’m so sorry.” She choked and looked to the crowds. 

The sound of blood coursing through her veins pounded in her ears, like death itself was beating a gong beside her. She touched the tip of the sword to the man’s again.  With blurring vision she lifted the sword away, and dropped it to the ground. The man flinched as the clattering noise filling the room. She turned away from the crowd, the news crews as her white dress spun outwards, desperately trying to break away. 

The Man stood, his tall figure toward over, and to the crowd, he reached out his hand, grabbing her shoulder and leaned into her brown hair and spoke. 

Seconds later, she faced the crowd; streams of water running from her eyes to her chin glistened in the light. With one final cry, she collapsed into the knights arms.

~~**::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::**~~

“Do you even listen to yourself!?”  The officer cried, slamming his hand to the table before looking up with a sigh “Look, Mr. Noble. We greatly do appreciate your helping us out and all, we really do, but not everything has more too it.” He looked down to his desk, tapped twice on the glass and it sparked to life. He reached towards the corner and dragged it down, opening several files before selecting one. “Look. Here’s her death certificate; Heart failure, no foul play. Satisfied?”

I glanced towards my friend, his eyes narrowed as they shifted to the table. He stretched out his hand, and pushed his fingers to the desk dragging the document towards him. He pulled out a small glass device, his phone, out of his hand and placed it overtop, and the image slid onto it. “No.”

“No?” he crossed his arms and glared to the both of us. “What is this time Jameson?” 

“Medical examiner. Where are they?” he spoke firmly as he brought his face and rubbed it as he thought.

“Come on James, you know we don’t ha-“ 

“Grayson, it’s the Queen, royalty. Are you telling me you didn’t have someone examine her cause of death personally?”

“Uh well” He rubbed the back of his head, and looked down to the desk. “What do you want from her?” 

“Just a chat.”

He sighed, looked towards the clock in the corner, its small digital numbers moving fast. “Just this once.  Five, minuets, you got that? I’m sending the codes to your phone.” He bent down and tapped the screen a few times and a door clicked behind us. I began to walk towards it and opened it. Jameson pulled his coat tighter as he walked through the door, a smug look crawling across his rather blank face. 

“What are you thinking?” I asked, as I closed the door and pushed my hand through my hair as we walked to the elevator. His face lit up as he turned to me but looked back ahead. “Not yet.” 
I cocked my head towards him. “Whatever.” The dim lights of the building casted a grimy yellow light upon the old hallways, I felt I was dirty just by being here. It had been the first police building in the town, when it was first build. Somehow, through the years, a warped sense of sentimentality kept parts from its much needed repair.

It had a huge news story, her death. She was the youngest to serve in over a hundred years, seemed to everyone in perfect health. I tapped my hand against my sides as I filtered through everything I knew about the situation. It was wrong, it was all wrong. How could she have died?  We approached a silver doorway and Jameson pulled out his phone and tapped it to the sensor and it opened promptly with a ding. 

“I said it already. You do know I hate repeating myself.”  He said as soon as the door shut.

“No, I don’t think you did.” It took me a few seconds to clue into what he had begun about. “Murder?” The words felt heavy off my tongue, almost as if I could be arrested for just saying those words. He smiled.

“Good old fashion murder. Well and maybe a bit.” 

“Aaand a bit? Okay,“ I started, “why are we going to see the coroner?” 

Before I got my answer, the door dinged and we stepped out into the cold room. The walls flickered to life casting an electronic glow to the white concrete floors. This section had been part of the newer addition to the building. He motioned forward and I began to walk

“’Ello!” I called forward ‘round the bend. ”Anyone down here?” 
A thump rang through the room, followed by the smashing of heals of the ground. A woman immerged out of the small corner office and headed towards us.  Her face was scrunched, and lips pursed complimenting her hair, which was just as tightly wound as she looked. 

“Why are you? Who let you in?” She snarled. 

 “I’m Mr.Hunt and this is my friend Jameson Noble.” Her eyes narrowed as she crossed her arms, turning slightly away.

“What do you want?” 

“I’m so sorry to bother you.” Jameson started his voice saddened and weak. I turned to him and furrowed my brow, but looked to the floor. He must’ve some kind of plan.  “But its just” he half sighed half chocked “I think, he might still be here.”
The woman rolled her eyes, and placed her clip board down and looked to Jameson. “And who might that be?” 

He let out a sob, obviously buying time; I glanced to her clipboard, several names laid scrawled out upon it. “Quaker, Henry Quaker. Sorry about Jameson.” I sighed, moving my hand to his shoulder; it was his turn to look to the floor. “ It’s just he’s still quite upset about it.” 

“Do-do you think we could take a-“ he sniffled, and a tear rolled across is face “do you think we could see him? We didn’t make it to the funeral.” She reached for her shirt and pulled down on it, flattening all the wrinkles.

“Well see, come with me please.” She spun towards the room and began walking away. Jameson turned to me, with a quick wink began to follow her. Now it was my turn.

 I grabbed her clipboard. All the names had been listed in alphabetical order beside a date; the records. I flipped the pages, glancing over to Jameson every couple seconds. Charlotte, the name of the queen. Page 1, name missing. Page 2, name missing. Her name was vacant from the list. I pulled out my phone and opened the camera, and copied the list into my phone by scanning it. 

The two walked out of the office and toward the wall that seemed to be lined with cupboards. She reached for one, a click filling the room. She opened it and pulled out a small stasis chamber with a body in it. She began to talk with him about his so called friend as I began to walk around the room. The equipment had all been neatly placed, each part in its compartment. I small box of gloves sat on the counter, only a few taken out.  I returned back to where I had originally had been standing. She seemed content with his tears to turn away and look back to me. Her eyes darted towards me and down to the clipboard that was in front of me. 

“So, have you heard the news about the queen?” I asked. She reached for the clipboard as she walked forward bringing it to her chest in one motion. 

“What about it?” Her eyes darted back to Jameson, who was no doubt listening to us than ‘grieving’.

“I heard she died.” I spoke, trying to sound as shocked as I could fake.

“Oh yea, I heard of that.” She seemed to calm down a bit.

“You’know, I’m sorry, I’m a fan of the royal family as much as the next guy but” I leaned in closer and whispered like it was some big secret “I think this is a little much for them.” Her eyes grew wide and she stepped back pulling the board even closer. 

“Yea, its absolutely crazt!” She brushed her shirt with one hand. “I bet some people would be happy about this. Always the crazies eh?.” Walking over to Jameson she spoke loud and harsher than before. 

“I’m sorry, sir, I think your time is up. I’m sorry for your loss.” Closing the stasis chamber door she led us straight to the elevator doors. 

Once again the doors dinged shut.

“Charlotte wasn’t on the list.”

“Yea, I noticed a few things of my own.” 

“You ready for this?”

“OH YEA” Jameson bellowed as he rubbed his hands together. “This is going to be a bit harder than I thought.”

*Ok, so this isn't what you had in mind most likely. But like, here you go. Its set in a futuristic society, governed by royalty. So think midevil monarchy rulership, with modern laws and future stuff. If you want more parts, let me know! Also, critiques are welcome/encouraged.*

  The heavy sword swayed in the old priest's grasp, catching the blue lights of the chamber as it wavered in the air. The ancient blade, inscribed with the names of all who had been honored to carry the dread weapon, bore the mark of a new name bringing the total to forty-two. ""Valmai"" the name glowed the brightest, as it was carved through two centuries of battles that coated the historic blade.

  Valmai got up from the cold steel floor, skin warming in the absence of its' closeness. Looking up to the priest, the newest Knight of the Order of Sanguis Fertur - The Knight of the Blood Borne, stood ready to accept the sword of the title just bestowed. 

 The highest honor that can be given to a Blade Reaver is to have their name etched for eternity onto the Gladius Finis. The honor had almost gone to another due to Valmai's heredity. No human had ever grasped the hilt of this blade and been counted in the line of the Blood Borne. She hoped she would bring as much honor as the last forty-one knights who came before.",kcsapper

"[WP] Somewhere near a large forest there is a small town of about 137 people . Each night exactly right as someone is murdered, a bell rings in the forest (but it is still loud enough for the town to hear it).",aupenn,"“It was a dark and stormy night…”

A pen flew across the room, smacking the rookie cop in the back of the head. “Cut that out,” grumbled the old man in the corner, adjusting his hat to further cover his eyes. Behind him the town drunk chuckled from behind the steel bars of the holding cell.

Rain pelted the windows, it's staccato rhythm accompanying the old transistor radio humming on a desk.  Deputy John Glover walked across the small police station to pour another cup of coffee from the ancient percolator on the hot plate.

With a groan, the aging police chief sat up in his chair, adjusted his wide hat, and retrieved a crumpled pack of cigarettes from a desk drawer. He put two in his mouth, lit both, and handed one back to the incarcerated, who accepted it readily. 

“You shouldn’t be smokin in here, chief,” Glover said over his shoulder. The chief grumbled, rose from his chair, and joined John at the coffee pot. “Ya, I know. Martha’d kill me if she knew.” As if on que, the chief let out a deep, racking cough. John poured two more cups and handed them to the chief. “Quite a storm tonight, huh chief?”

If he had heard the deputy, the chief made no sign. He took the two cups of coffee back to his desk, handed one to the inmate, slid an ashtray across his desk, and sat back down, placing his boots up on the well-worn oak.  He held the ashtray behind his head, and the drunk ashed his cigarette through a deep swig of coffee.

John returned to the window, staring out across the empty highway beyond. Like talking to a wall, he mused. 

*Bong*

A shiver rippled down John’s spine.

*Bong*

The chief nearly spit out his coffee, and was on his feet faster than one could imagine for a man of his age and girth. He hurriedly ashed his cigarette.

*Bong*

The inmate dropped his cup. It shattered across the concrete floor of the cell.

*Bong*

The deputy and the chief shared a knowing glance, and without a word moved to their lockers. 

*Bong*

Belt, hat, gun, coat, flashlight, radio.

*Bong*

The chief turned to the drunk. “Stay here, don’t cause problems, you got that Cletus?” The inmate nodded absently.

*Bong*

The two police officers were out the door and into the pouring rain. They sprinted across the muddy parking lot, and the chief fumbled with a ring of keys, cursing the weather.

*Bong*

The squad car tore out of the parking lot, leaving a spray of mud and gravel in its wake. The highway was empty, deathly silent.

*Bong*

The radio crackled, its mindless static belaying the officer’s building nerves. 

*Bong*

“Where we going, chief?”

*Bong*

“Main Street, I’m sure someone’ll know what’s going on.” 

*Bong*

The last toll echoed through the night, hanging in the silence that followed. The squad car flew past the small, dilapidated sign greeting visitors to Elwha, Washington. 

They rolled down the small town’s central boulevard, little more than a cluster of shops breaking open the indomitable forest canopy, a scar in the otherwise seamless blanket of old growth covering the Olympic Peninsula.  

A small crowd was gathered near the archaic Catholic church, seated at the far end of the street. Without a word the officers pulled up, parked, and waded into the night. Flashlight leading, John approached the crowd, who parted like mist before him.

Blood, so much blood. 

There, sprawled on the curb, was a man that John had known his whole life. They had played baseball together as kids. The chief lagged behind, never fully comfortable with the gruesome or the macabre. John knelt down beside the body.

Three long, vicious wounds ran in parallel from shoulder to hip, his jacket shredded, his face pale and locked in a gut-wrenching scream.

As the chief corralled the onlookers, interviewing some and lending a sympathetic shoulder to others, John searched through the victim’s pockets. Empty.

No, there, left breast pocket. A note, wrinkled and blood-stained. Casting a glance over his shoulder, John opened the note.

Inside, scrawled in hectic scratching lines, was a bell, hung from a tree. Beside it was what could only barely be described as human, something long and dark and terrible, drawn so frantically that the pen had torn through the paper in several places. There was writing as well, what looked like directions, partially smeared in blood.

John slipped the note into a plastic evidence bag and rose, wiping the poor man’s blood from his hands. He could hear the chief on the radio, calling for an ambulance. Sometime was crying, their gentle sobs muffled by the pounding rain. 

He knew what he had to do. That bell, that horrible bell. Somewhere, out there in the imposing depths of the forest, somewhere very close, someone rung that cursed bell, announcing the next in a long series of murders. Three years, eleven… twelve victims now. 

He was going to find them.

""Really?  That seems low, I guess.""

""It was chosen with history in mind.  In ancient times, two coins were put on a dead man's eyes as he was laid to rest.  Myth said that those pennies paid the Ferryman who carried you to the other side.""

""The other side of what?""

""Death, I suppose.  Their myth had a river in it called Styx, the dead crossed it to get to the lands of the dead where they were judged for the actions in their lives.  The good were rewarded and the evil punished.""

""Judged for which actions?""

""All of them, I suppose.""

""That's...daunting.""

""Yes.  Thus a competing service emerged, at the same price.  Two pennies and you don't have to be judged, don't have to cross the river, don't have to find out whether you made the right choices or the wrong ones by somebody *else's* standard.""

""Well...I've got a nickel here.  Can you make change?""

""Yes.  I can.  Here are three pennies.  You may now live your life knowing that when you do ultimately pass, you will not go to the land of the dead to be judged but will instead have another life here on earth.""

""Ha!  Maybe I should just buy the second one for my next life then!""

""Do you have another penny?""

""Well these three that you just gave me in change, I mean.  It's two cents!""

""For the first one.  For the second, the price doubles.""

""Oh.  Well, gee, yeah I do have another penny actually here.  So, four cents, wonderful.  In fact I've got, uh, a dollar and 59 cents here including the three pennies you gave me in change.  SO I'll take...I guess 39 reincarnations!""

""No, you may have 5 additional reincarnations for that price.  The price doubles every time.""

""Oh.  I see.  Well I'm getting paid tomorrow and this month has three paydays, so the entire thing is extra.  How many can I get for $450?""

""On top of the six you have now purchased, you may get an additional 8.""

""So that's 14.  Assuming I make it to an average age of 60, that's...uh...

""Eight hundred and forty years of life.  One hundred and forty years below the age of ten, two hundred fifty two years below the age of eighteen.  A century of childhood.  Two hundred and ten years of adolescent freedom and youth, assuming you count the period from ten to twenty-five for that.""

""Do you?""

""It is your life, my judgements and pre-conceived notions should hardly weigh into your decisions.""

""I guess I'll be back tomorrow.""

*Time passes, as Time does.  An young man approaches an old man in a marketplace.*

""Reincarnations, eh?  How much?  Or wait, have I shopped here before?  Heh.""

""Yes, sir.  Previously.""

""Oh.  Really.  Well.  Did I buy?""

""You found the price very agreeable and yes, you did.""

""Oh, really.  What's the price?""

""For you, sir...would you permit a somewhat personal question?""

""Uh, sure.  Shoot.""

""Do you have any inheritance?""

""Uh...Yeah, some I guess.  Some distant uncle or something left me an account.  He said that it was mine and I should improve it and spend it on the next generation or something.  I don't know, I guess he died around when I was born.""

""Curious.  Is there a great deal of money in this inheritance?""

""I mean I suppose there was.  I bought a house though, and a boat.  It seems frivolous maybe but I really do love this boat!""

""The price may now be more than you can afford.""

""Hah, I kinda doubt that.  It's still seven figures in the account!""

""Yes, when your predecessor last inquired about the price of yet another reincarnation the price was eight figures.""

""WHAT!?""

""Yes.  Ten million, Seven hundred thirty seven thousand, four hundred eighteen dollars and twenty-two cents.""

""That's for ONE reincarnation?  That's insane!""

""Perhaps sir, but it is not the price for your *first* reincarnation.""

""What?""

""It doubles.  Each time.""

""Well...how much was it to start?""

""Two pennies.""

""Hilarious, just like the Greeks right?""

""Quite right.""

""And these are previous...incarnations...of me that have bought these?""

""Yes.""

""So how many have I bought?""

""Twenty eight.  The Ten Million Dollar figure is for the 29th reincarnation.""

""...Fuck.  How many incarnations do I have left?""

""Two.""

""So I'm number 27?""

""Correct.""

""What happens if I don't buy it?""

""You would live your life and die, then live another life and die, then live another life and die.  At that time, you would go through the same process all others do when they die.""

""What, go to heaven and be judged or something?""

""Yes.""

""But...fuck...what if me in the life after next is an asshole?  What if he goes to hell?  What happens to ME me?""

""He is YOU you.  You will become him.  If I went forward in time twenty years and grabbed you, from this very life you are in right now but twenty years older, would he be the same man as you?""

""Well no, but like...he'd remember being me.  There'd be a version of me as I am now in his memory, feeding into who he is.""

""So it is in reincarnation.  There is an energy that is the soul, carried from one to another.  A version of you as you are now, feeding into who they are.  Well put indeed, young man.""

""So I get judged on what future me does?  The actions of this life, what are they then?""

""It is not him who will be judged, but truly **YOU**.  All of you.""

""...All 29 lifetimes.  I'll be judged for 29 lifetimes of who the fuck knows what I did.""

""Yes.""

""Oh Jesus fucking hell.  I...just...what the fuck did I get myself into!?""

""Perhaps you were more good than wicked and will be judged well for that.""

""Oh fuck...wait...waitwaitwait...maybe you're on to something there.""

""Oh?""

""I have this life, plus I have two more!  AND I've got like 7 million bucks just sitting there on the stock market!  You know how much good that can do?""

""Can it do enough good to get you into heaven?""

""I mean, I gotta hope, right?""

""Well...which can do more good, seven million dollars or an entire additional lifetime of doing good?""

""I...uh...huh.  But I'm still three million short of that though.""

""In this world, money can make more money.""

""But...what if that's evil?  I mean, I've seen it, there are some horrible ways to make lots of money fast.""

""Are there no good ways to make lots of money?  After all, you have an entire two lifetimes after this one.""

""I...yeah.  Um.  I have to think.""

""Perhaps you can think on your boat.""

""Ohhhh...that's probably a lot of money right there.  It certainly costs a pretty penny to maintain...""

""Perhaps you can think in your house.""

""I guess that's gotta go too.""

The man left, troubled.  Another young man comes out of the back room of the shop.

""Will he really give you ten million dollars for another life?""

""The wicked will pay much to avoid judgement.""

""Is he wicked?""

""No.  That conversation has happened many times before, between him and I.  Always he is worried about what he might be judged for, but I have seen most of his lives.  They are dedicated to two things - doing good to cleanse his soul, and making money without damaging his soul too much.""

""You've addicted him to life.""

""Yes.""

1 (or 2) guardian angels are sent by god to protect the chosen one in his quest to defeat the [generic final boss but the chosen one is repulsive and cringy [wp],elhlyn,"""Are you sure you can protect me from up there?"" Levi called to the angels floating high above him. They were nearly specs, but, as they were angels connected to his conscience, he didn't even have to speak to them directly.

He preferred speaking, though. He was awfully lonely. His parents had abandoned him as an infant, and he had spent the majority of his time completely alone. He was raised by wolves, who also left him after a couple years. He was then picked up by a herd of deer, who left during the night the following winter. He had suffered severe frostbite before being picked up by a farmer, who allowed him to sleep in the barn. The cows in that barn had, in turn, somehow built a wall out of hay bales and lived on the other side of him. The farmer dropped food for Levi in through a partially open window.

""We're angels dude. We can protect you from pretty much wherever."" said the older cherub. That was, of course, a lie. The truth of the matter was that Levi's appearance was so unacceptable and his stench so vile, that they, as near-dieties, could not stand the smell of him.

When Levi was old enough to survive on his own, he left the farm in search of fortune and acceptance. He was eventually accepted by the ""masked blind monks"" who, for some reason, also did not have the ability to smell. They trained him the the ways of blind martial arts. Levi, of course, being able to see, was the most promising student they ever had. 

""Why do you have to follow me then?"" Levi called out. ""Why not just stay in heaven or whatever?""

""I said *pretty much* wherever. Not *literally* wherever."" replied the angel. ""It was a bit of an exaggeration.""

Less than two days ago, Levi had been living in acceptance with the people who could not see or smell him. That was before the Butcher had surfaced.

It was very clear that he could not be stopped. All the stories of brave knights who tried to stop him ended with them never being heard from again. The butcher was said to be gathering his strength to raise an army from the depths of the earth. If he was going to be stopped, it had to be now. The two angels had visited Levi on the second day of the butcher's appearance, requesting his help.

""So what do I do when we find him?"" inquired Levi. ""I don't have a weapon or anything.""

""God. Even his *voice*."" Hissed one angel to the other, under his breath. The other angel snickered.

""We'll take care of that."" replied the second angel. He stared at the first angel intently.

""*hell* no."" Said the first angel quietly. ""He is NOT touching my sword.""

""Dibs out!"" Called the second, touching his nose.

The first angel glared.

""When you guys are done fighting, can you make sure you're protecting me?"" Levi called out.

He was standing in front of what appeared to be a wall of solid gas. It went as far as the eye could see, with no way around it or over top of it. It completely encased the butcher.

""Don't worry bro. We've got you from up here."" replied the first angel, not taking his eyes off the second.

""Just walk on through. According to our research, the gas won't affect you. Genomes or genetics or whatever."" continued the second angel, not breaking eye contact with the first.

Levi took a deep breath and walked into the gas. Both angels suddenly broke eye contact with each other and watched him nervously.

""You guys still there?"" came a voice

""Holy shit."" Said the second angel. ""I can't believe that worked.""

""Yeah."" Agreed the second. ""I can't believe that even the *gas* didn't want to go near him.""

""What?!"" exclaimed Levi. ""You didn't even know if it would work?""

The angels looked at each other.

""Well you can never be 100%, right?"" said the second angel, carefully.

Levi sighed. ""Can I have a weapon now?"" 

""Well..."" started the first one. ""We can't actually go *into* the gas. Otherwise we would have stopped the butcher ourselves. You're pretty much on your own now.""

""WHAT?!"" screamed Levi. ""Are you serious?""

The first angel only shrugged.

""Maybe you can use your natural charm."" Offered the second.

The first one guffawed.

Levi sighed and walked towards the narrow bridge ahead. The butcher skittered towards him on 20 legs. His body was bloated and deformed. Rashes and blotches covered his skin. He was truly hideous.

""WHO DARES ENTER MY DOMAI- Oh Jesus Christ."" The butcher grabbed his nose with one hand and waved with the other.  One of his twenty legs buckled due to the sudden change in concentration. He began to teeter towards the edge of the bridge. His eyes shot towards Levi.

""What *are* you?"" He demanded, while falling off the bridge. 

Levi heard a surprisingly loud crunch, and the gas began to clear. He looked around in astonishment while a crowd of amazed people gathered outside of the gas barrier. The angels flew through as soon as there was a gap in the gas. 

The first one tossed him a full helmet with a facemask.

""Don't take this off."" He said, curtly, before begnning to fly away.

Levi waved goodbye to his two companions. After he raised his arm, the second angel caught a whiff and gagged. He flew back down and forced Levi's arm back down.

""And for God's sake, don't lift your arms."" He said firmly. 

Levi nodded and stood stock-still, watching as the crowd moved towards him, cheering.

A tear formed in his eye as he he watched as he finally felt something he had never felt his whole life.

People marked with feathers control the air as their sparrow twitters on their shoulder and so forth. You are born unmarked.",pluvei,"Good people are everywhere, they're just difficult to find. I was lucky to find them without even searching. When I was born, parents were shocked of my perfectly clean body without a single mark so they gave me away. And luckily, I ended up with great people who never judged me for the fact that the only marking on my body was a scar on my foot that I got when I was little.

However, in the world of marked magic I was never powerless. My clean body meant that I can learn whatever magic I want. I'm not stuck with some power that I wouldn't even like. There was this girl that I was friends with. She was small and fragile, had pretty blond hair, was scared of the dark and allergic to cats. Yet, she had some darkness power or something and a black cat was always following her. Or that really violent dude, with explosive temper, but couldn't swim, probably said that because he's scared, I don't know. Guess his powers.

I was never powerless. It was the opposite. I would have easily been the most powerful being ever if I cared that much. I use the magic I know only in the daily life. I'm working in this bakery, where the equipment is not the usual that you can just buy in any store. Our equipment is powered by the workers. So it took a while for my co-workers to get used that I can do more than one kind of magic. 

As far as I know, there are no other people like me. For my unique power, various fighter groups try to get me join. They always fail though. I'm simply not much into fighting. But they're persistent fellows. Lucky boss, gets many high-profile customers. And because I always reject them, those guys become regulars. It's not that I'm attached to the bakery, I just want to help people without using violence. Kind of a waste, I know, but maybe it's the same case of getting stuck with a power you're not much into.

Yet, I live a simple but great life. My power is to copy other people's powers and I am using is purely for good.",daaaammn

"[WP] The end of the world has arrived, and it's nothing like we ever anticipated.",surfem,"The end of the world was altogether unremarkable.  Those poor souls, like myself, who work in stuffy office buildings pray for an eventful apocalypse, if for no other reason than to break up the monotony of the daily status meeting, followed by the status meetings status meeting, wrapped up later in the status of status meeting status meeting meeting, directly followed by lunch.
  
  Today, however, we were halfway through a lecture on how well a project was going by a manager who was inexpert on the subject when all sound ceased.  An elephant could trumpet next to your ear without startling you, unless you turned your head and noticed it, upon which you would indeed be startled as an elephant in an office building is as foreign as efficient leadership or completed deadlines.  The lack of sound drastically improved the meeting, though the improvement was quickly nullified by the adoption of frantic note-writing to communicate, a skill that had laid dormant in most of us since elementary school and teachers had necessitated the art form.
  
  As notes were churned out faster than a central bank with poor fiscal policy, sound returned with the vengeance of an unpaid loan shark, if instead of breaking kneecaps with a lead pipe he preferred the vuvuzela and an amplifier powerful enough to be outlawed by common decency and military limitation treaties.  Immediately my head felt as if it had been a tree, chopped to the ground, mashed into pulp, printed and bound into a novella, then burned for the amusement of a group of Fascists.  That's about the time the weasels started flying.
  
  In the sky sat a large oblong pyramid, deftly telling the law of gravity to shove it, as thousands of weasels, outfitted with goggles and aviator scarves, naturally, flew through the air towards it.  All along the outer edge of the pyramid stood an  ever growing number of weasels, most having removed their aviation gear upon landing.  Standing, gaping, I said the only thing that came to mind at a time like this.

""Jacobi,"" my father calls from his workshop. ""Give me a hand.""

I give my feet one last kick in the water before I haul myself onto the dock, cinch a wideleaf around my waist, and make my way along the dock, around the covered walkway that rings our house, and out to my father's workshop. The light from his furnace throws an orange glow on the greenleaf walls. My father has on his leather apron and is holding his tongs, which means he's going to ask me to work the bellows.

""Take the bellows,"" he says, and as I do he takes a long thin piece of metal with the tongs and sticks it in the furnace. He watches the metal redden in the flames. ""What do you think, Jacobi? Will it look like this?""

""It's big and it's red and it's hot, father. It's got to look like the furnace, only bigger.""

Father chews his tongue and nods, his eyes gone distant.

Later, after the metal has taken the heat and father has hammered it on the anvil, after he's doused and quenched the metal, he lays the metal on a stack of similar pieces. The two of us take our seats, he in his splintered wooden chair, me in the inclined hammock he made for me, and soak up the furnace's final sputtering heat.

""That's the last of the propellers,"" he says.

""Will you tell mother you're close to done?""

He runs his tongue over an eyetooth. ""Best to keep that between the two of us."" He ruffles my hair and leaves his hand on top of my head.

I rose from my bed to gaze at the paper-covered walls of my room. The papers were never so much stuck to the walls so much as let rest in place; it's not as though they would go anywhere anyways. I thought about the question. Truthfully, it hasn't been long at all. I glanced in the direction of the wall clock as I slumped down into the chair at my desk. It's been 3:28 for a while now. 

My hands covered my eyes as I tried to wipe the sleep out of them. I could still rest, sleep, dream. I didn't need it, but having some sort of way to mark time in my timeless world was comforting at the least, and at most, mandatory. I reached for another pen from the mug and began writing, crunching numbers and the like. My grades in mathematics were my downfall in high school, which amazes me that I was given this task by... Don? I don't remember. Some military cap covered his head and the breast of his suit jacket was concealed by a comical number of ribbons, medals, and whatever else fancy awards. 

My attention found its way to the green push-button that sat on the corner of my desk. Its surface was bare and the whole thing could fit in the palm of my hand. I dared not touch it, though. I could press it only once and I was far from finished. The chair underneath me swiveled as I turned to face the room. Light from the afternoon sun still shone in through the window. You would've been hard-pressed to make out any of the wall underneath all of the calculations. Stacks upon stacks of bleached white printer paper stood to the left of my desk. I pictured a future where these all came together. 

I figured that there was no use daydreaming about the future instead of creating it, but a part of myself resisted that thought. It's not like I was wasting time, or that there was any to waste. If I pushed that button, maybe. If I pushed that button, I'd get front row tickets to ""Mutually Assured Destruction: The Musical."" I'd already considered this several times.

I'm no genius, but each time, I'd already decided that the genocide of the human race was a bit expensive. After staring at the walls for a brief bit more, I swiveled back and went through another pen, continuing to reinvent centuries of mathematics and scientific theory in, technically, less time than anyone else. I smiled at the thought.

""Is not my problem. I'm retired,"" I say, as I open the door to my cabin, ""Get Jerry to deal with it, he's done wyverns before. Dragons are just a bit bigger, that's all.""

The door swings shut, blocking out the winter of Astrodell. It had been a hard winter, and keeping warm was a constant struggle for me. My wife always insisted that her being cold was a small price to pay for me not risking my life every day, but I was bored. I wanted the thrill of the fight again, the weight of a blade in my hand. I loved my wife and son, but the daily life of a well-off peasant didn't hold a candle to the excitement of dragon slaying. My sword, once the scourge of all of Astrodell, now sat on the mantle, above the fire. I could tell my blade was restless. The fire stoked its magic heart, warming it for battle, but the blade had been still for many months.

I stomped into the house, dropping the logs next to the fireplace. My wife was cooking dinner, and a kiss I bestowed upon her brow. 

""Who was that, daddy?"" my son asked from his small chair next to the fireplace, the flames reflecting in his innocent eyes.

""Just a stranger, son."" I turned back to my wife, ""Nothing to be worried about."" I said pointedly. 

She nodded.

An bowel-shaking roar filled the air, as the roof of the cottage was vaporized. My body, bathed in flames, fell to the ground, as tears evaporated from my eyes. When I opened them, the cottage, save the chimney, was gone. My wife.....

Steeling my resolve, I pulled my sword off the mantle. It's heart sang for blood, and with my heart, it was a harmony. 

The dragon was very confused, as they usually were when I survived a flame blast. My skin, once enchanted by a witch, was impervious to any heat. 

We fought for hours, throughout the forest, the dragon's flame blasts washing over me, as I tried to evade the dragon's teeth and claws, all the while trying to strike the fatal blow. 

It took me hours, and many grievous wounds, but at the end of the night, I sliced the beast's head off. The page then approached my battered form.

The two of us sat in silence for a long moment, the soft patter of snow falling being the only sound breaking the stillness. 

""Page, give me your cloak,"" I said, as I hoisted myself up, my sword taking the brunt of my weight, ""Your king can go hang.""

The page looked visibly shocked, as he shrugged off his thick cloak, and passed it to me. A jolt of warmth spread through my frame as I slipped it on.

I remember my back aching because I was writing reclined. I was lying parallel along the couch with a space heater blowing at my side. Fingers sticky and throat parched. 

Then the shrinking began, at first I shrunk into my skin; it shriveled and popped like gravel under a tire. Skin is for sex and swimming and for keeping the blood inside. But with the sunken canvas of my flesh running across the flickering features of this soft-serve expressionless face I could feel that there was in fact something more to this organ known as *skin*. A consciousness in of itself. A desire to receive and convey. The eager beat of a warrior’s drum – that was my skin.

Then I shivered, deep down inside my bones. Not a cold shiver, but rather a reverberation – I imagined splintering chalk on a blackboard, and what I got was a neck splint and a backboard. That was pain – the only physical pain I remember. In the ambulance they said there had been an earthquake, little did they know it was my mind that had quaked, my heart that had ached, and my soul that had collapsed.

Once I truly receded into my mind I was alone. Not scared, but claustrophobic. Breathing fast hot breaths that filled the vacuum of this intimate immediacy that is time. Tidy blackness. Vile willingness to practice my intellect and count – *one*, *two*, *three*. Each time I trip up on a memory. Each association weaves into my static spider web identity. Here were no breeze will tickle me. Here were flies don’t spread their hungry brood. This pain is not like that I have in memory, this pain encompasses my entirety.

Then I resume – *one*, *two*, and again I remember: I once had autonomy, opportunity was offered me, I was never hungry but satisfaction still eluded me. Pain. Blossoming beautiful pain. I have woven it into an orchestra, it bellows as a deep brown tone. And I let the piano trickle along, a serpentine stream of crystal clear sound – a striking, glass shattering ascension to heaven, culminating in the cries from the turrets towering above me. 

“And once more William, I want you to count to three, then I want you to imagine that you are at home in your living room. I want you to imagine yourself going into each and every room in your apartment – the fMRI machine will be able to tell us what you are thinking.”

[WP] The universe conspires to make you late for work everyday. Your boss gives you one last chance. This time you're ready...,HumanID,"First time, I know there are typos and grammatical errors. 

It seems like nothing I do changes the fact that I am late to work every morning. Some days it just seems like the universe has a grudge that it needs to satisfy at the expense of my life.

Today was the last straw for my boss and things have to change. I clocked in at 8:24 like the past 90 days only to get chewed out by my red-faced boss in the cubical corral. If I'm late tomorrow,  I'm finished. 

Normally this wouldn't bother me because I find jobs pretty quickly. This time it's different,  I actually like this job. Up until 3 months ago, I was the model employee.  

Always early and completing projects on time; I even was employee of the month, once. But that all changed 3 months ago. No matter what i do, I always clock in at 8:24. At first, I didn't notice the consistency,  but after a few weeks it became unnerving.  Every day,  8:24 on the dot.Why? One day I even tried to wait until 8:25 but it turns out the clock was wrong that day and was a minute ahead.

Car wrecks, dead batteries, lost keys, and zebras! It seems like everyday its one ridiculous reason after another. But tomorrow? Tomorrow has to be different. Tomorrow I have to be on time, not only on time but 15 minutes early. 

Some how I have to figure out how to be 39 minutes early when nothing has worked up to this point. I have been trying to figure out why 8:24? The answer, however elusive,  must exist. It must and now I have only 23 hours to figure it out.

By 5 pm it was settled, tonight I would sleep at the office.  It was fool proof, you can't be late if you never left. I would order some food and crash on one of the comfy couches scattered around the office. What's the worst that could happen, I am woken up by my coworkers or boss? 

I ordered a pizza and set up for the night. 

Bring on the night! Pizza arrives, Netflix rolling and I kick back to revel in my genius. 

Its almost midnight when I start to feel funny. A wave of euphoria rolls over my body like a cool tide and I begin laughing at my hands and fingers. What's going on; what's happening?

I look into the closest mirror and stagger backwards at what appears within its frame. Another world, a waterfall? I blink and it's gone. I stumble to the break room to get a cup of coffee when I notice a door I have never seen before. My body goes cold as I stop, entranced at the number on the door.

824. 

What the fuck? I've never seen this door before and why is the number 824? At first I assume its a hallucination just like the mirror. I reach my hand out to try to open the door. It's real, how could this be, ther has never been a door here let alone room 824.

I open the door slowly as this surely can not be a coincidence.  824, the same time I clock in every morning. I open the door slowly only to find that I am staring into the same strange land that I observed in the mirror.  This time I could feel it. The cold metal feeling, the sharp edges, and a trickle of a waterfall. Before I could understand my surroundings I realized the door was gone. I was stranded in this strange land with no means to escape. 

What could go wrong? How could I have been so foolish?

At that moment I notice a large white cat grooming itself on a rock just a few feet away. I attempt to pet the feline when it tears away causing rocks to fly and tumble down an adjacent slope. I began to pursue when I began to feel dizzy.

The dizziness came on quickly followed by intense drowsiness. I found a comfortable place to sit near the waterfall and fell asleep.

I'm awoken by a scream followed by murmuring.  ""What's he doing"", ""this is weird, should we call an ambulance"", he looks sick""

I open my eyes to find my coworkers staring me down and I tried to stand up. At this point I realize I'm stuck in the janitors mop bucket and ask what's going on.
They tell me that someone broke in and ransacked the office and thrown pizza at the walls.

At this point it becomes clear that I was not in another dimension,  there was no white cat, and the mushrooms on that pizza really were special.

I struggle, but stand and remove myself from the janitors bucket. I let out a deep yawn as I rub my eyes and ask what time it is.

Furiously from behind my coworkers I hear my boss's voice ""8:24 and you're fired""

Ethan made a grunt, indicating he was listening. Through his binoculars he peered, observing their lord and savior as a mere child. There was no telling when or where the attack could come, so he refused to take his eyes off him.

He heard Johanna shift in the seat beside him. These automobiles were cramped, uncomfortable, but he put up with it. She was having a harder time, especially with the obstruction of the steering wheel and pedals. Such were the necessary evils of these primitive times, unavoidable obstacles. ""We've been watching Henry--""

""Lord Mercer,"" he corrected.

""That boy is not our lord,"" she said. ""Not yet, anyway.""

Lord Mercer cycled through the park, tailing a group of children he'd encountered early in the day. Their spot across the street was obscure, a lesson they had learned the hard way. It shouldn't have been so surprising that the authority figures of this time frowned upon such surveillance. Explaining that one of the boys had ordered such protection forty years from now wouldn't have helped matters.

""We've been watching him for four years now,"" Johanna continued. ""We were in the parking lot of the damn hospital he was born in and we followed his parents home.""

""So?""

""So we haven't seen hide nor hair of any would-be assassin.""

Ethan didn't look to her, but he couldn't deny his interest was peeked. This was not the typical route of which her complaints usually went along. ""And yet you sound disappointed that no harm has befallen a child so vital to our future.""

""That's just it,"" she said. ""Our futures will be chasing him around the world, watching and waiting for shadows for his supposed attacker to come. Yet with each passing day, the wisest opportunity a rational assassin would take comes and goes. Taking out Lord Mercer as a useless boy makes more sense than waiting until he is competent in his own right.""

Still Ethan refused to put down my binoculars. *It'd be my luck that his attacker would come just as I do.* ""What are you saying? You don't believe an attacker will come?""

""No, that's not what I'm saying.""

[WP] An extremist organisation called Al-Weeaboo has taken over Japan. The U.S. in response spearheads an invasion to take back Japan. You are one of the first to be deployed on the battlefield.,PivotJJ,"The city of Japan has been reduced to rubble and smoke. I look uneasily around, the Weaboos could be anywhere. With me are my four comrades, each of them brandishing a Kalashnikov. Our mission was very clear: find and kill any suspected members of Al-Weaboo.

But perhaps you need some sort of explanation. It all happened two years ago. A small militant group occupied Japan overnight and quickly took control of the country. The reason for this utter failure was that the Japanese citizens assumed these insurgents were just cosplayers, a grave mistake. Tokoyo fell within an hour. All of the members of the United Nations invenstigated this hostile takeover. The group contained about 10,000 members and were almost all neckbeards from the /a/ board on 4chan, earning the name ""El-Weaboo"" from the media. Being the world player that it is, the US decided to solve the problem. Enlisting the help of Russia and Eastern European countries, they armed members from /k/ of 4chan to beat Al-Weaboo. The only way to defeat a weaboo was with a Slavaboo. 

Back in the present, my comrades and I pressed through the rubble of Tokoyo, looking more and more like 1942 Stalingrad as the days passed. Two spoke in shitty Russian accents to each other while the other two drank cheap vodka together. I kept to myself and kept walking without interaction. The city seemed deserted, save for the T34 squad we heard about a bloc away. Sergei, our squad leader, stopped in his tracks. On the ground in front of us was a booklet of manga. My comrades turned off their safeties, but it was too late. Ivan looked up to a window across the street and was instantly shot by a Type-100. The rest of us took cover; we had to avenge him. The gunfire rattled the street and smoke filled the air. I couldn't see five feet in front of my face. All I heard was shots and the screams of my squad. Nikolai managed to find me in the thick smoke, with a bullet in his arm.

""Come on comrade! We have to-""

He fell over, shruiken filling his back. The sight of his corpse filled me with terror and anger at the same time. I raised my Kalashnikov and fired wildly into the unknown. My the time my magazine was empty, nothing could be heard. The smoke slowly cleared, revealing the horror of the battle. Dead neckbeards, some Weaboos, some Slavaboos. I tossed my AK to the ground and wept. 

An hour had passed, and I waited with my Mosin in my lap. Reinforcements had to be close. I squatted in front of a small fire and thought about the great times my comrades and I have had. Tears filled my eyes. Nothing would bring them back. All I could do was fight in their memory. 

A T34 slowly rumbled down the street towards me. The group beckoned for me to get in. I ignored them. Using my bayonet, I scratched another line into my Mosin. Another day lived, more lives lost. We would win this war, but with huge losses. Such is life on the Eastern front.",Brassow
"[WP] A knight is off to save a princess locked in a tower guarded by a fire breathing dragon. The knight arrives and finds a rapper called ""dragon"" instead.",RK0rton,"Sir Timid was no Sir Lancelot or Sir Galahad.  Small and timid and fond of scholarly pursuits, he was the laughingstock of the court. He would be called, in today’s terms, “a nerd.”  He decided that the only way he would ever get respect was if he defeated a dragon.  He had fought several small dragons that were too diminutive for the other knights to bother fighting, but he had not defeated a single one.  Not even one!  All he had gotten for his troubles was a singed bottom that had made it difficult for him to sit for several weeks, and had made him the butt (pun intended) of many a knights’ joke.

When it was announced that a princess was locked in a tower guarded by a fire breathing dragon, Sir Timid eagerly volunteered.  (He was chosen only because Lancelot and Galahad were busy with bigger dragons.)  After a long and difficult journey Sir Timid finally reached the tower.  There was no dragon in sight, but there was a handsome young man in the vein of Galahad and Lancelot there dressed in the type of fashionable medieval wear that attracts all the maidens.  The young man exuded that same spirit that Sir Lancelot and Sir Galahad exuded – today, we call it “coolness.”  

“Dear sir,” said Sir Timid formally. “Where is the fearsome fire breathing dragon that doth guardeth the princess?”

The young man rapped, “I am Dragon / Mine rhymes are fire / They burneth so hard / Of them thou will never tire!”

“Why art thou speaking in that odd staccato way?” said Sir Timid, bewildered.  “And art thou saying THOU art the fire breathing dragon?”

“Mine name is Dragon, my dear sir, and I am a bard.  I have invented a new form of poetry called rap.  One day it will be the way all the streets doth talketh!” said Dragon enthusiastically.  “I advertised that there was a princess trapped in the tower so that I could haveth knights come here, and of course peasants followeth as an audience because they enjoy watching knights fighting dragons.  And if I could get an audience of peasants, I could holdeth a concert!”

Dragon looked hopefully behind Sir Timid.  “Where is your audience of peasants, sir?”

Sir Timid said sadly, “I’m afraid the peasants don’t like me very much.  They would rather watcheth the handsome knights like Sir Lancelot or Galahad fight dragons.  And I’ve never defeated a dragon.  They somehow always seem to defeateth me.”

Dragon examined Sir Timid from head to toe.  “Thou lookst like a scholarly man,” said Dragon.

Sir Timid said enthusiastically, “Oh yes!  I love books, particularly poetry.”

Dragon asked, “Canst thou rhyme?”

Sir Timid, “Well yes, I have quite a vocabulary from my scholarly pursuits.”

Dragon quivered with excitement.  “Finally!” he exclaimed.  “It took me 3 weeks to come up with that rhyme that I spit earlier, and it wasn’t even very good.  I need someone to write me better rhymes!”

Sir Timid said thoughtfully, “Well yes, I could help there.  Perhaps thou needst some meter and rhythm as well.”

Dragon said with a determined expression, “I’m going to have a concert, and you are going to write all my rap.  Let’s send an announcement into town.”  Dragon and Sir Timid put together several banners.  The banners all had a drawing of Dragon, below which was the text, “Come one, cometh all: See the Dragon as he breathes Fyre!”

When the peasants saw these banners, they immediately assumed the handsome young man who looked like a Galahad or a Lancelot was a knight, and he was going to fight a dragon.  The peasants enthusiastically gathered at a safe distance from the tower, waiting for the fight to begin.

A cannon went off, and out of the smoke came Dragon the rapping bard.  He began to rap about the difficult life of being a traveling bard, being robbed on the high roads by bandits, being singed by passing dragons.  The rhymes, written by the sensitive Sir Timid, were raw, rhythmic, and powerful.

By the end of the concert, there was thundering applause.  The peasants yelled.  The maidens threw their garters at Dragon.  The king, hearing of the hugely successful concert, made Dragon a permanent bard at the court.  And of course, Sir Timid became a core part of Dragon’s entourage, and he was finally cooler than Sir Galahad and Sir Lancelot.",masterofallnonsense
[WP] You wake up missing a body part.,SomOrm2,"The first thing that hit me was the cold. It was freezing. 

With effort I opened my eyes, but it was just dark all around. My head throbbed with pain, as I struggled to understand where I was.

I remember drinking in the pub on Friday night, partying with friends, when I got tired and stepped out of the dance pool.

That's when I saw him. Tall, with dark hair, a head above the others.

I pushed through the crowd to get closer to him, to see him.

""Hey"", I gave him a tap from behind, ""never seen you around before""

He turned around, and that's when I saw his eyes, blue and piercing cold.

""Oh hey,"" he spoke with a sultry voice.

""I'm not from around here"",he gave an awkward shrug ""I'm just taking a night off with some friends, and they're ... somewhere."" He gave an airy wave.

I could feel my face being flushed, he was hot.

""Hey could I get you a drink? You look like you need one."" He asked with a smile.

""Sure, thanks. I'll go get a spot nearby.""

He came back soon after, with two martinis in his hands.

""Here's yours"", he pushed a martini towards me with his unusually big hands.

I remember talking avidly with him over the drinks. He was extremely charming. The drink tasted a little weird, but it was not enough to distract me from him. I took a sip one after another, and ... I can't remember anymore.

The numbness from the cold in my body is giving away to a pins and needles sensation, distracting me from my recollection.

I felt around me. As I moved I could hear water sloshing around me. Squinting my eyes in the darkness, I could barely make out my surroundings. 

I was in a bathtub, filled with freezing cold water.

A story that has been circulating on the social media came to my mind. A story where a person woke up to an ice-filled bathtub, only to find out that their kidney is stolen.

Panic gripped me as I struggled to get out of the bathtub. Stumbling my way to the door, I can't help but start feeling for any signs of cut on my sides.

Light flooded in as I opened the door. Rushing out, I was presented a well lit hotel room. The dressing table was filled with tools and I moved over to take a closer look. They seemed like surgical instruments.

""Oops, didn't expect you to wake up so early"", a familiar voice sounded behind me. 

I turned around and saw him, as charming as ever. 

Noticing my hand on my hips, he gave a low chuckle. 

""You didn't think I took your kidneys did you?""

""What did you do?"", I could hear my voice trembling.

""Well, I definitely didn't take your kidneys, but I did take something else."" He paused for a moment. 

""Have you taken a look at your chest?""

I whipped around to look at the mirror on the dressing table, my eyes large with shock from the sight. 

My chest. It was flat. I moved my shaking arms around my chest. It was gone. This can't be real.

""What have you done!"", I screamed as I turned around to look at him.

""Well"", he shrugged and gave a wry smile, ""just a peculiar hobby of mine.""

I took several steps back from the clearly psychotic man.

""No, really, there isn't anything to be scared of"", he spoke quickly, seeing my movements, ""it's just a harmless hobby, I'm not going to harm you. See? You're perfectly fine, standing here, no missing legs or arms, or kidneys. Nothing wrong right?""

""Leave me alone, please"", I begged.

He gave a sigh, ""I definitely will be leaving you alone,"", he said moving to the dressing table, picking up a surgical knife. 

""Right after I'm done with one more thing"", and smiled at me with that charming smile of his.

"[WP] In the future, all sportsmen and sportswomen are genetically modified. One day, someone without any modifications at all wins a game.",Sterbai,"I breathed heavily in the humid air.  *whoosh*, *breath*... they were like people on steroids in the 20th century. I'd read about sports drugs on Wikipedia and watched them on Buns of Steel.  Every drug has a repercussion, and so do genetic enhancements.

The 'jungle' was filled with vicious gladiators; a cat women, a devil-man with four arms and horns, a man who could sniff like a pig.  I, the non-modified human in the game, was given the power of equipment.  

I glistened the knife in a spot of sunlight shining through the artificial jungle's thick canopy.  I wasn't worried about being spotted. My opponents, naturally powerful and in a rush to prove their modification choice correct, would engage in bloodbath very quickly.  They assumed me, the 'natural' to be one of the weaker variants in the game.  I would be ignored, so I bargained, as the others engaged in a bloodbath for high ground and momentum.

*Flash!* *Bang!*

The starter gun had been shot and the frenzy began.  I was on low ground, away from the bloodbath of high ground where the 'superior' beings would jockey for advantage.  The man with the pig snout could smell, I knew.  But of what concern was I, when the 4-armed, 300 pound, densely muscled monster was hoping to rip him in half?

See....no...grasp this. We humans, modified or not, can only focus on one thing at a time.  In times of great stress, we get tunnel vision and our focus becomes impeccable.  Proteins leave the muscles and enter the brain, powerfully concentrating in the amygdala, our fight or flight mechanism.  Cat ears or pig snout, infrared vision or brain wave antennae.... No one noticed.  So, I sat and built my trap.... may the victor of the bloodbath, tread lightly.",Franzish

[WP] Life confronts Death. Death has been a little too trigger happy this year. Life wants to know why.,Wrenlet,"The snow was suitably falling for the 31st of December. It had unfortunately missed Christmas Day, but that was par for the course in this part of the world. At least this region didn't have to suffer through a blizzard again this time of year. Last year the power for the entire Midwest cut out, and didn't come back on for a week. That was a particularly hard day for me.

I made my way down the simple Ohio town, referred to as ""Bowling Green"". A quaint environment, I supposed. It was a tad too flat for my liking, not enough topography for varied wildlife. The school is nice, though. It was a good choice for our annual meeting. I continued onward, towards a small bar called *The Stone's Throw* situated in the middle of a busy city area. The establishment was understandably packed, considering it was new year's eve, and it took a moment to find who I was looking for. Understandably, I found him at the bar. His thick black pea coat and dark jeans matched his slicked back black hair. He looked about 30, and was downing what looked like his fifth shot of hard liquor. I sighed, and sat down at the empty stool next to him. He immediately responded to my presence.

""Hey, there you are. I was beginning to worry you had forgot this year.""

""I do not ever forget this meeting, Death. Although I imagine you will by tomorrow, judging by how you're spending the time in the mortal plane.""

Death grinned at me, before motioning for the bartender to give me a shot on his next round. ""C'mon,"" he said, ""don't pretend you're driving home.""

I indulged in the alcohol, if only to make the coming confrontation easier. ""You know, Death, we do have to talk about your actions this year.""

""Do we? Do we Life? Or can we just kinda let each other do our own thing, die and let die and all that jazz?""

""We can't, and you know it. Our actions being balanced is paramount to the survival of the mortals. You know that.""

""And you seem to have forgotten that I do. Or are you just blatantly ignoring the fact that you've cranked it up to eleven as of late?""

""What do you mea-""

""Look, any place that isn't a bunch of people trying to like in the middle of a mountain range has a birth rate so far above necessary replacement its not even funny. The world's running out of food, and you're pumping it full of mouths to feed without end.""

""And you saw fit to resolve this issue with massacre after massacre? The entire planet is at war!""

""Which was precisely the goal. You start a war, suddenly birth rates decline. Not too far, just enough to sustain populations while half of the world dies in a dick measuring contest under the guise of morality and justice. Then, when it's all over, the winning side has a Renaissance of life, and birth rates soar above where they were, before mellowing out into a lower base number that gradually increases over generations. Then, you flip the switch of war and do it again. It's a cycle I noticed after some of the early Chinese conflicts. And the best part? IT only gets better as the world gets denser. This war will regulate the population for so long, that it'll be a long, long time before the next. Probably a few centuries.""

""How... how have I not noticed this?""

""'Cause I'm quiet about it. Also, you're only seeing your half. Life is powerful, but a birth never launched nuclear bombs. A birth never enacted a genocide. At least never initially. It's death that gets the ball rolling. Life is consistency. Death is change.""

I puzzled over his words. Why was what he was saying making sense? Moreover, why did my drive to put an end to it cease. I realized it after a few minutes. 

I can't stop it. He's right.

I can create a life, a newborn infant, that over it's life becomes a messiah if the circumstances are right. However, Death is immediate in his work. His actions immediately cause reaction, a power I rarely have. He can affect the world faster than I ever could, and if this pattern he mentions truly works, then who am I to stop him?

I ordered another round. ""Happy New Year, Death.""

""Here's to a better one"" he replied with a toast.

INT. A SMOKY TAVERN - NIGHT

*A sparse crowd of world-weary patrons all sit in near silence, each of them nursing a drink of some variety. They barely glance up at the sound of a loud clatter, which heralds the arrival of a tall, stunningly beautiful woman in a white dress. This is SERA, a supernatural being.*

**SERA:** I'm looking for a man in black.

*Nobody answers her for a moment. Eventually, one of the PATRONS raises his hand.*

**PATRON:** I'm wearing black socks?

*Sera scoffs to herself, then struts through the tavern. She peers into every booth that she passes, clearly looking for something.*

**PATRON:** (*O.S.*) (*CONT'D*) Is that a no, then? I have a black shirt at home that I can change into.

*Sera rolls her eyes and looks back at the man.*

**SERA:** You are wasting what precious time you have by sitting alone and drinking cheap bear.

*The woman's eyes flash, and the patron's face adopts an expression of fearful awe. He rushes from the tavern without another word.*

**VIDAL:** (*O.S.*) Now, that wasn't very nice.

*Sera turns to see a tall, gaunt man sitting in the booth at the back corner of the tavern. Without waiting for an invitation, she storms over and sits down opposite him.*

**SERA:** Vidal.    
**VIDAL:** Sera.    
**SERA:** Let's cut to the chase, shall we?

*Vidal grins, causing his dark eyes to sparkle.*

**VIDAL:** Why? Are you on a *deadline?*    
**SERA:** (*Rolling her eyes*) Yes, you're very clever.    
**VIDAL:** Oh, come on, Sera. You're *killing* me!    
**SERA:** Cut it out.    
**VIDAL:** Sounds like you have a *bone* to pick!    
**SERA:** Now you're just reaching.

*Vidal shrugs and takes a sip from a copper mug, the contents of which appear to be steaming.*

**VIDAL:** So, what did you want...    
**SERA:** (*Interrupting*) Spare me. We both know why I'm here.    
**VIDAL:** Enlighten me.    
**SERA:** ""The brightest souls of Earth are being culled with far too much frequency."" Does that sound familiar?    
**VIDAL:** It sounds a bit pretentious when you say it like that.   

*Sera does her best to hide a scowl.*

**SERA:** Will you take this seriously?!    
**VIDAL:** Oh, dear. Are we in for a *grave* discussion?    
**SERA:** Puns are literally the lowest form of humor, you know.    
**VIDAL:** Are you saying you don't get them?    
**SERA:** I get them.    
**VIDAL:** Gotcha. Death just isn't funny.

*Vidal giggles to himself as he takes another sip of his drink. Sera looks on with seething fury.*

**SERA:** You do know that it's not just my time you're wasting here, right? I want you to explain yourself.    
**VIDAL:** Oh, fine, whatever. Look, Sera, there's been far too much... well, of this.

*Vidal waves a hand, gesturing at the other denizens of the pub.*

**VIDAL:** (*CONT'D*) There's supposed to be a certain balance to things.    
**SERA:** Who went and made you the supreme dictator of that balance?    
**VIDAL:** I like to think of it as a majority shareholder's decision. After all, without my work, yours would be pretty meaningless.    
**SERA:** Now who sounds pretentious? Anyway, enough stalling. Explain yourself.

*Vidal sighs and shakes his head.*

**VIDAL:** Just look at the state of the world today. Did you know that we're scheduled to hit eight billion humans by 2024?    
**SERA:** Oh, we're expected to hit them, are we?    
**VIDAL:** Hey, nice! I didn't even intend that one!    
**SERA:** What's your point, Vidal?    
**VIDAL:** My point is that it's getting too crowded, and you're the one to blame.

*A moment of silence passes.*

**SERA:** Sorry, would you care to explain that?    
**VIDAL:** Think about it. When a beloved celebrity dies, people go back and review their work. They share it with loved ones. It leads to feelings of closeness, which leads to *physical* closeness, if you take my meaning.    
**SERA:** Oh, right, *now* you decide to be subtle.    
**VIDAL:** Humans sad, humans go boink-boink. More humans! Better?    
**SERA:** And you think that's my fault.    
**VIDAL:** It is. Provably. Every person you take indirectly leads to thousands more being born... so ease up on the reaping a bit, will you?

*Sera contemplates this.*

**SERA:** Well, like you said, it's getting too crowded.    
**VIDAL:** Yeah, but you don't put out a fire by dumping gasoline on it.    
**SERA:** Fine. I'll ease up... and I suppose that leaves my evening free.

*Another copper mug appears on the table. Sera reaches out and takes it.*

**VIDAL:** While we're on the subject, though... who's next?    
**SERA:** Suffice to say that he's been a recognizable voice for a while, even if he can't stand up for his ideas.    
**VIDAL:** Ugh. Why do you do that?

*A shy grin finally cracks Sera's face.*

**SERA:** What can I say? I guess Death is a mystery.

He always portrayed Death as a terrifying villain that wanted to destroy all of humanity, which wasn't true at all. Death was really a kind old man that had volunteered to escort souls from their mortal vessels to the World of Spirits. Life was just kind of there. At Death's cottage, he was confronted by Life, who wanted to know why there were many more evacuated mortal vessels (yes, that is the official term for dead people) this year than years previous. ""You've gone mad with power, haven't you?"" queried Life, his young features gleaming, ""I told the mortals that this would happen, and guess what? I was right!""
""I couldn't see how someone could be so ignorant of their own actions!"" exclaimed Death. Death couldn't really become angry with anyone, but Life could get him the closest to that point. ""Do you remember that time you thought there should be a 'hyper-spring', or whatever you called it, on Earth? Well, that's what's happening now! A bounce-back in life energy. All mortals die, and that time has come for the products of your little experiment. This is your doing, Life!"" 
Life paused. He wasn't used to having to listen to people complain about the consequences of his actions, so this was pretty surprising. ""So?

[WP] Life confronts Death. Death has been a little too trigger happy this year. Life wants to know why.,Wrenlet,"I put the final finishing touches on my latest project, the next evolutionary steps for a genus of flowers.  It was delicate and intricate work.  I had to anticipate the conditions they would face for thousands of year, how those conditions might differ from area to area where the flowers grew, and judge what mutations may emerge.  I was really pleased with my work, the various variations were very pretty.  They had been before the changes as well, but life cannot remain stagnant, it must move on.

The work had absorbed me for quite some time and I found that several of Earth's years had passed since I last checked in on the planet.  Various reports and statistics would have been delivered yearly and I searched around through my sprawling residence trying to find where they might have hid themselves.  I'm not much of one for facts and figures, and I find they often try and elude me.  Some might have called my home messy and chaotic, but I like it.  Life is never neat and tidy.  

I finally located some ledgers and began to review them.  They looked vaguely familiar... ohh... they were from a century past.  I continues searching and turned up yellowed pages with doodles of dinosaurs on them, way way out of date then... maybe I should do a little cleaning.  Finally I found the stack of the new deliveries right where deliveries always came in.  Hmm, I probably should have started looking there.

...This couldn’t be right...  The death figures, they were BEYOND outrageous.  They had to be a mistake...  And what had happened to the birth rates?!  What was Dear Deathy up to.  In all the millennia of our existence we had never broken the allotted ratios we had set down when we first started the whole existence thing.  Sure sometimes I got a bit overzealous and he would have to come up with some calamity to compensate, but we always chatted about it before hand.

I headed straight off to give him a scolding.

Death greeted me all chummily like he had done nothing wrong.  I wasn't going to have any of that.  I laid into him.  HE'D NEALY WIPED EVERYTHING I'D WORKED SO HARD TO CREATE OUT, WHAT WAS HE THINKING!  He let me rave at him for a while showing no expression on... well I couldn't actually see his face in that dark cowl of his, but there was no expression in his posture either and no body language spoke to me.

When I'd finished he asked me when last I looked at the Earth.  I sheepishly admitted it might have been a couple of decade.  He took me to his viewing place and and and... it was all white.  Not just the wintery parts.  All of it was white except parts of the ocean.  WHAT DID YOU DO DEATH!!!

He offered no excuses, instead he told me those humans I created were out of control.  WHAT!?  He said it's called nuclear winter.  He had done nothing.  My creation had destroyed our planet and killed just about everything including themselves.

The Pig's Paunch tavern was a filthy, disgusting, rundown, decrepit hole in the wall. It was also the best place in the city to get a cheap pint and a so-called meal. Cain could hear a familiar voice echoing from inside, he sighed, gritted his teeth and pushed the door open.
 
Cain coughed as he stepped into the smokey bar. No one turned to look at him, the few regulars sat in their dingy corners hunched over their drinks, trying to drown out the world. An old jukebox in the corner played a familiar tune and in front of it stood a woman Cain knew far too well. ""Purple rain, purple raaaaaaiiiin."" She sang, her voice raspy and off key.

He carefully made his way through the bar, touching as little of the disgusting furniture as possible. He knew precisely how many lives had been lost and found in these filthy seats. Finally he settled on a small table near the wall; as he waited for the music to finish Cain watched the bacteria squirm and wriggle across the grimy faux-wood. He reached out with a pinky and touched them. They began to multiply.
 
After what felt like an eternity, the music finished and the woman began to drunkenly stumble over to the table. Cain sighed, she'd been down here too long, these human customs were beginning to rub off on her. She flopped down in the seat across from him. The jukebox flared to life as an electric guitar began to play. *If you squeeze my liz--* ""T-too what do I (hic) owe the pleasure?"" She slurred. Cain snapped his fingers, then folded his hands. The woman straightened up as the poison left her system. ""Well thanks asshole,"" she leaned back in the chair, ""it took me the better part of a month to actually get drunk.""
 
""Pity."" Cain spat. ""You know why I'm here, Abbey"" 
 
*Killed by death, Killed by death
Killed by death, Come on!*
 
She raised the mostly empty pint glass towards the jukebox. ""You said it Lemmy.""
 
""This is serious,"" Cain growled, ""those individuals were class C, you can't take them without permission. You especially can't take so many.""
 
Abbey's dark eyes flashed, ""and since they sent you, I guess they're more interested in why I've been so trigger happy, than in punishing me."" She tapped her fingers on the table, Cain could feel the colony he'd created disappear.
 
He nodded slowly. ""You've done good work for us. We want to keep you around, and avoid any... unfortunate incidents.""
 
The song finished, and silence finally fell upon the bar. She smiled. ""Their priorities are so interesting, aren't they? I take millions due to the actions of madmen, due to disease, famine, and every other thing in this world that calls to me. Do they care? No. Cancer let me take more than eight million people last year. But I take a single Englishman with a nice voice? Suddenly I'm dangerous and untrustworthy."" There was a click, and another song began to play.
 
Cain's eyes narrowed. ""It's different, there are rules, regulations, there's a plan. We have no choice to follow it, not to question it. No matter where it may lead""
 
Abbey laughed, ""I wasn't sure where to go from here, I started taking them as an experiment, a cry for attention. Just to see if They were listening. It turns out They are, but They don't care. They only care about making sure it all goes as planned.""
 
*I never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world*
 
She continued. ""I can't stomach it anymore. Consider this my resignation."" She stood up, and walked back towards the jukebox.
 
Cain nodded slowly and walked out of the bar. As he stood on the curb in the warm spring wind he took out a cell phone, and sent a single word. ""No.""

The squeak of rubber against polished wood floors, the resound of a basketball bouncing. Camera flashes from the crowds, cheers and jeers from all around.

Seven.

From the far end of the court, Wright shoots me a smug smirk, a canine grin behind sandy hair and blue eyes. We'd been best friends, before he'd transferred. Now I was nothing more than an opponent to be beaten, a target to be crushed. He knows I don't shoot well.

Six.

I dribble the ball into their side of the court, weaving through other players. If I make this three, we'll be tied and we can move into overtime. Poor Bobby is on a player twice his size. 180 kilos of Alabaman beef ""accidentally"" hits John in the face. I have to win this. For them.

John nurses an ice pack over the eye he got decked in. Bobby is carried out on a stretcher. I sit numbly in a chair on the sidelines.

Coach comes over. He is a large black man who walks with a limp from a leg injury that prevented him from going pro. This was his last game, before retirement.

""Fuck,"" is all he says.

""Well... Coach, uh, we may not have won, but we played the game, didn't we--""

""*Fuck* playing the game!"" he says. He hurls a clipboard away and stomps off, cursing.

I watch the opposing team carry one of their players and a trophy high and away, out of the gym. Strangely, Wright isn't with them, which...

Oh. Oh, no.

""Wassup, Beany?"" says Wright, striding over, one hand flipping a pair of shades over his blue eyes, the other around Julia.

""Uh, g-good game, Wright.""

""Damn straight. We won, didn't we?"" Wright says. Julia giggles beside him.

""Y-yeah.""

""Well, I've got *other things to do tonight,*"" he studies his spotless fingernails. I can practically see him wink behind his shades. ""Peace out, dweeb!""

He flips one particular finger up at me as he goes. Julia laughs and leans closer against his shoulder.

*Well,* I sigh, *At least it can't get worst.*

Two players run over, pour a bucket of water on me, punch me in the stomach, and give me a wedgie. I lay gasping on the floor.

"[WP] Necromancers make better healers and doctors due to their knowledge of souls, blood and flesh.",deeed22,"**Necromantic Healing: A Guidebook, by the Eternal Sovereign**

*Introduction.*

It was a cruel joke, to many, that to ensure a long life, people resorted more with those dabble in the arts macabre more than they did with conventional physicians.

However, it was a matter of practicality. A trained necromancer can ensure a body persists functioning despite physiological impairment, and while historically this was used for animating large numbers of *zombi*, in reality humans whose neural connections were largely autonomous (and open to suggestion) while the consciousness takes a lighter comnection to the body as a whole, the same principles applied for ensuring ordinary people did not feel pain.

It won't be pretty, but your back won't be giving you gyp, Mavis. It can weaken and lay pressure on your spinal discs to the point of injury, but at least it won't actually hurt you in your head.

Of course, lowering pain leads to greater chance of physical injury. Bones were the worst. A fractured bone could splinter, and damage muscular tissue.

To resolve this, necromantic principles used in the creation of lich bodies originally are utilised.

A small 5ml sample of fluid is taken from the person, willingly and with full comprehension of the process to come.

This is then placed in a watertight iron container, or a *phylactery*. Unlike ancient liches (who used such processes for limited immortality), the sample is then placed in a field of synchronicity, which is bound to something hardwearing, such as a diamond, or a building.

If done correctly, this proceedure should slow most forms of decay, injury, and wound, as it links something that is a part of your internals with an external object.

However, it is not permanent. The sample will eventually congeal, leak, evapourate. A phylactery can extend a peaceful life for 40 years beyomd the healthy maximum otherwise. There are numerous cases of 160 year olds.

Death will claim all, in time, but we can delay it.

In some cases, multiple phylacteries are utilised to ensure security and peace of mind. However, this has the downside of unequal decay rates, which could cause soul anchorage to this spiritual plane. In dumb layman terms, you become a ghost, involuntarily and likely permanently until you psychologically heal any trauma you posess.



Of cancers, necromancy excels, however it does mean intensive care of one's body from then on. A dead body does not replicate celluar matter. A good necromancer should be able to locate your soul before it reaches the Final Judgement, and stick it back in the host body, which is now functionally dead: a ghoul.

A ghoul's life is... Unpleasant. Your body will decay, without preparations magical and scientific. Get used to formuladehyde. There is no heal response, so regular tissue grafts are required, and forced healing with short-lived enhanced living tissue is regularly required.
You don't need to breathe, and if you do, it helps to frequently moisten your windpipe in water to prevent your unused lungs from shriveling up without the blood flow running through them.

Most ghouls who operate in normal society utilise a full pacemaker setup and a nanite 'blood cell' setup to simulate blood sufficiently to operate organs.

Phylacteries do not work on ghouls. Any that existed prior to death cease to function, and dead tissue doesn't work magically.

It also doesn't move easily. All those tissues that worked to, say, clench your fist? Now all dead.

However, direct puppeteering of the body is possible with necromancy. Many ghouls take to applied necromancy so as to gain greater flexibility of movement by using benevolent spirit manipulation to force limbs to move.

A typical ghoul can survive... Well, theoretically, with maintanence and care, indefinately, but realistically most only last one century before a limb becomes too difficult to repair or they grow tired of outliving their peers. Several ghoul conclaves exist, however, and support each other through their prolonged life.

Necromancy cannot truly heal. That's what doctors are for. Go see a doctor.

Necromancy can hold back Death. Not forever, but long enough for doctors to deal with the issue.

We are the last line of defence. It would be wrong to say we seek to prevent death: it is a natural process. But we believe a human should die on their own terms, at their own time.

That is what necromancy is about. Making death something one faces to the best of their abilities.

"[WP] Necromancers make better healers and doctors due to their knowledge of souls, blood and flesh.",deeed22,"Necromancy. An old term, horribly misunderstood for centuries. Connotations to ""evil magics"", the undead, and ridiculously enough zombies have attached themselves to the word. ZOMBIES! Come on, really? Necromancy literally derives its meaning from the Greek 'nekromanteia'. Literally, divination by the dead. A tween with a tablet can look it up in mere minutes, but will we ever separate my noble profession from generations of ignorance? Unlikely.

Still, people like me have found good work in the world. Necromancers never out themselves, but plenty of professions need us. Mystical mediums can allow people to talk to their beloved dead. Even some priests can use their ability to help comfort the living by representing the dead. The divination we receive through death is useful in many ways, but NOT in the ways people usually think of. I find my talents especially useful in my current profession as a diagnostician.

I don't need a person to be dead to divine what killed them. Is your liver dying on you? Your heart, lungs, or even your brain? Allow me to run a bunch of tests, make it all look official, and allow me to touch you one time with enough sedatives in you that my arcane mutterings sound perfectly reasonable. In a minute or two I can understand everything within your living body that is dead or dying. From there, I hand my patients over to the ""real"" doctors. I will just collect my ridiculously large checks and move on to the next patient. 

Your dying cells communicate everything I need to make a living off of your misery. I can glean the when, the why and the how they go from individual healthy cells to dead tissue just by politely asking. Have I met any other necromancers in the ward? No. Why? No idea, its literally the easiest career you could imagine. Does it bother me? Not in the least. I love getting awarded every year as the most accurate diagnostician in the medical industry.

Her skin, once smooth and in a deep purple had become wrinkled and black, her fiery eyes were nothing more then dying embers and her tail hung from the side of the bed, powerlessly.
He took her hand but she felt cold to the touch. 
""I'm so sorry."" he said ""Oh god, I'm so sorry. I should never have brought you here.""

Their escape had been an adventure, she was heiress to one of the hidden kingdoms with no intentions to agree to her fathers carefully planned marriage pacts. He had freed her, a knight in shiny armor. 
In truth, his immunity to magic had made it quite easy for him to free her, but it had been an adventure nonetheless.

They had fled her land and she had fallen in love with him. A dangerous forbidden love, which had made it even more exciting. They had traveled the hidden kingdoms in disguise. Her face was well known and humans were well hated in almost all of the hidden world.

Twice they had come close to being discovered, once by a rogue fairy, who had snuck intoo their room at night to free them from their posessions and once when they had stumbled upon a pack of werewolves in an enchanted forrest. He had wanted to kill the fairy, but the princess had begged him to let it live and they had fled to a different kingdom, hastily for fear of being discovered. 

The werewolves would have torn him to pieces, magic immunity or not, if she hadn't come to his rescue. The sight of her, spitting flames and transforming the forrest into hell itself, had been the most beautiful thing he had ever seen. She had cried as he burried the three burn carcasses and he had remembered his first kill. She had been just a little girl, but he had had orders. For a time they had cried together.

They had retreated to the human world shortly after. They had found a nice little house, far from civilization and they had made plans to build a small farm. Thinking back, he realised she had looked weak even then. He hadn't known she needed it. The life energy which she sucked out of her enviroment. She had never killed someone, sucking their life, always just drained a bit of energy from the world around her, so he had never noticed. But she was a succubus after all. When he realized that she was poisoning herself with radiation, here in the human world, it had been to late for her.

A tiny bit of fire returned to her eyes and he dared to hope for a moment, that he could still save her, that she could muster up the energy for transportation to the hidden kingdoms, but it was only the reflex of a dying demon. She lifted her head one last time and kissed him, tried to suck his life and he was ready to give her everything but he couldn't and he had to watch helplessly as her eyes turned from ember to ash.",MisterMuskatnuss
[WP] Kidnapped whilst on holiday you find that a lifetime of pointless jobs has miraculously prepared you with all the necessary skills to save the day.,ed_case,"Quinn stared up at the sky and laughed uncontrollably at the situation.  She reflexively glanced left and right to see if anyone had just witnessed what had happened but of course there was no one around, probably for miles.  Which is exactly why Beavis and Butthead had taken her here to presumably do terrible things to her.  They had to have known she was poor and not worth a cent for ransom but they weren’t exactly master-criminals so maybe they had no idea what they were going to do to her.

She peered over the cliff that Beavis (who’s name was John) had gone over in an idiotic demonstration of how he could walk and talk backwards.  She couldn’t see his body but she heard him scream for at least two-seconds before hearing the awkward whacking sound of what sounded like a watermelon exploding.  It was Butthead (who she thinks was named James) who provided the comic relief by both cursing out his accomplice and tripping on an outcropped tree root on the trail and after stumbling forward had awkwardly smashed the crown of his head into a very sharp rock on the side of the trail, instantly going limp.

She backed up and slowly undid the knots in the rope around her arms. It was child's-play really, an actual honest-to-god game she had played hundreds of times while babysitting the various kids of her small town.  Two, maybe three hundred children - she had lost count over the years of the mind-numbingly boring and seemingly pointless job of babysitting.  Starting in high-school like all her other friends she just kept doing it.  She thought about going to college or leaving town to find other work but it was always too convent to just keep doing what she was used to doing, day after day, night after night.

She would watch the kids grow-up and teach them to tie their shoes and then make a game of having them tie her up.  One of her only tricks would be to surprise them by impersonating the famous magician Houdini and escape her bonds in a matter of minutes. 

Looking at the current situation it was apparent that James could have used a refresher lesson in tying his own shoes because one of the laces was undone which only aided in his comical death / unintentional suicide.  

Well fuck those guys - she was pissed off that they had jumped her in the first place.  She hadn’t had a proper vacation in years and was generally depressed that she didn’t have anyone to vacation with.  It was a small victory that she felt so good after having successfully camped on her own in this deserted part of the mountain  undistributed for the past three days.  She had only seen two other hikers who chose to take a different route but they were friendly enough.

Beavis and Butthead here were the second set of strangers she came across and after they beat her, tied her hands (poorly) and then forced her to march west to what she supposed was a cabin or cave or some other hideout they used for nefarious acts. 

She was tired, hungry and thirsty.  She was confident that Butthead/James hadn’t moved in about five minutes and the pool of blood collecting under him was slowly getting bigger.  She put two fingers to his neck like she had seen on TV and she didn’t feel anything.  She wasn’t sure she was doing it right, but she honestly didn’t want to help him so she took his water bottle and started back down the trail.  They had marched her for four hours and she hoped she could get back to camp in three. 

Tonight was going to be her last night on the mountain, tomorrow she had to be back in-town to watch the Lawder twins.  Grinning she though she should be sure to teach them how to tie knots...",Maulf

There's a flow to the world most of the time. People's minds generally flow in the same patterns, like waves on a beach. Sometimes it's gentle, but occasionally it's like being caught in a riptide. 

That's why I decided to be a bartender. The more people drink, the easier it is to deal with the flow. Soft waves, like standing in the surf on a beach. Well, that and it's not that hard to convince them to tip well. 

Then he walked in. It was like a stone had been dropped into the surf. Right on my foot. It didn't hurt exactly, but it was abrasive, and heavy, and left the taste of iron in my mouth. I don't know why it's always iron, like I'd been sucking on a nail. 

I've never been able to figure out why some people are like that. They make me uncomfortable. 

He started chatting with one of my regulars. I took his order (a screwdriver) and did my best to ignore him until he needed something else. Eventually, he ordered another.

When I came back, he was staring down my shirt. I don't know why it bothered me. I know all the guys do it. I know when, for how long, and what they're thinking about when they do. But this guy...nothing. It made me uneasy. 

He didn't stay for long. The guy he'd been chatting with called a cab and they left together. 

But I didn't feel at ease again until I got home. The waves were disturbed, and I don't imagine they'll be exactly right again for a day or two.",GalacticProfessor

The three of them just walked through the door.",wpforme,"The three stand in front of me. I wish I could say I was scared, but I live for this kind of thing. The red haired sorceress stood off to the side, silently giggling as she watched my struggle.

The question was simply this: ""Three men stand before you. Each want a different thing. The first, to bed. The second, to wed. The third, behead. Which is which? Get it right and you may do what you will with them.""
Now, seeing as I'm a generally pretty cold person, I wasn't overly excited. This wasn't really my area either. But the price of an incorrect answer was the murder man ending my life, so that gave me some encouragement.

At first glance, the three were exactly identical. Same hairstyle, same hair color, skin, face, just-everything. 
But obviously I needed to look deeper if I wanted to survive this ordeal. 
People say that eyes are windows to the soul. However, I wanted to save that trick till last. I decided to look at their stance first.

The first man was taking (natural) deep breaths. He seemed quite relaxed. I tugged softly on a lock of my hair, and he, almost unseeingly, smiled.
The second was sagging his shoulders quite obviously. He leaned nonchalantly on the wall, his hands stuffed in his jean pockets. I almost wanted to cheat and look at his eyes, but no, better wait till the last moment.
The last man was stiff. Every muscle in his body seemed tense, and he had his head cocked. His hands started to clench and unclench when he noticed me looking.

From what I'd put together, the second seemed the most likely candidate for behead. He was trying to hard to seem calm. That meant he was hiding something. Lust? Hate? I almost couldn't tell. But... his jacket. A bulge in the deep pocket on his left side. A phone? No, the sorcerer had designed this, and since she obviously wasn't that smart already, having them standing too obviously, she would be more likely to put a gun in his pocket. So for now, I was going for the second man as my very-own self-hired assassin. 
The first and the third were harder. Either could love, and either could simply feel lust. I concluded that I was simply too excited and looked at their eyes.

The first man's cheeks became a bit more pink as I made eye contact, which was an answer in and of itself. His eyes were kind. Pupils dilated, squinting a bit. He had a dimple on his right cheek.
The third man's eyes were telling as well. Before I tell you what I found, I'd like to list a few things about his head first. Slightly cocked, indicating interest. Chin tilted down, a try for seduction. Eyebrows slightly pulled together, meaning some kind of frustration. The eyes really gave it away though. There was a fire in them, get too close and you'll burn up. I assume that's the kind of person he was too. 
I had my answers. I turned to the sorceress, who was beside herself trying to restrain laughter. I found it oddly endearing.

""The first man wants to get married, the second wants to kill me, and the third wants to shag me. Good?"" I asked.
Her eyes lit up. ""Yeah! Golly you're good! Well now, claim your prize,"" She gestured to the three men, the first stepping up.

I shook my head. The sorceress's fiery locks fell off her shoulder as she cocked her head at me, unsure of what I meant. 
I grinned at her, feeling a bit flush. ""Maybe you want some dinner sometime?"" I asked.
She bit her lip and her ears turned pink. ""Now works too.""

A half-full bottle of Jack and less impressive pack of cigarettes were my only company. I checked my watch. 1:37am. Not much longer now. I poured a couple fingers into the motel-provided styrofoam coffee cup and lit a fresh butt.

The first sound I heard was a tapping from the bathroom—the fucker smashing his face against the window in there, I imagined, trying to catch a glimpse of me. 

The second was my phone vibrating. I’d left it on the desk in front of me. A new text message popped on the darkened screen. “Will you?” it read.

“Nope,” I muttered, my whiskey damp lips tugging at the cigarette’s dry paper.

I closed my eyes and waited for what I knew was coming—The third. My fingers curled around the 9mm in my lap, it’s cold steel giving my heart more warmth than a blazing bonfire.

Then, an explosion. The motel room’s door blossomed into a billion tiny pieces. Shards like sleet of diamond raked my skin. I turned my face from the door, shielding my eyes. 

Blam!

Blam! Blam! Blam!

I fired the handgun in the direction of where the door had been until the only sound I heard was the harmless click of the hammer on dead metal, then I stopped.

After a long, silent moment, I opened my eyes. After another long, silent moment, I turned to look at the door. 

A man’s feet were visible on the threshold, but he wasn’t standing. The dim light from my desk lamp was just enough to see that the man was laying on his back, a dark pool forming under his mid-section.

*It was you or him*, I reminded myself. *You or him*. I took a deep breath, listening to the night. 

Suddenly, there was a stir form beyond the door. The fucker appeared from the darkness, stepping over the killer to rush in, a jar of Vaseline held high in his right hand.

“Hell no,” I said. Drawing the other 9mm I had hidden in my jacket, I plugged the bum-rushing rapist in square in his center mass. The man stumbled forward, legs useless, and slammed bodily into the desk in front of me. The jar of Vaseline flew from his hands and clattered against the far wall.

I looked to the doorway in time to see the last man, his arms held high over his head in the universal sign of surrender.

“I’m sure we can talk this out,” he said.

Maybe it’d been a long week running from these weirdos, maybe it was the Jack talking, and maybe it was just force of habit, but I shot him right in the fucking forehead. 

Then, to the tune of sirens and flashing blue and red lights, I poured myself a few more fingers of Jack, then the rest of the bottle for good measure.",zarquon_himself

I was working late, nose buried in old court records, head swimming in scotch, cigarettes passing by like train cars. I can’t remember the case, I think it had something to do with the Avery gang out of Poulsbo, but that’s not important.

I liked working late, it was better than hanging my hat in that brick coffin I call an apartment. And in this heat? I’d rather drown the night away at my desk.

I was about to call it a night, fold up the case and try and catch a few hours’ sleep on the couch, when there was a knock at my door.

Why did they even bother knocking?

The door swung open, and in a cloud of inky blue smoke and cheap perfume they strode in like they owned the joint. Krissy, Prissy, and Missy. Sisters. Damn my luck.

My god they were beautiful, all legs and lips and lace. Triplets, they said, and damn if I could ever tell the difference by looking at them.

We'd crossed paths before, with mixed results to say the least. Krissy, the one I knew from her sultry, breathy drawl and the fire in her eyes, whispered sweet nothings that would make a pastor blush. And damn if she didn’t know her way around a… well, I’ll let you sort out where I’m going. She sure as spit could.

Prissy, she was the one with the sweet-as-honey, sing-song voice and the skip in her step. She was a flowers and romance, wine and candles sort of gal, could cook a mean steak, and truly had quite a thing for yours truly. And I’m not gonna lie to you, I had a bit of a sweet spot for her too. She was the type of girl you take home to mother, if you catch my drift. Problem was, she didn’t take to kindly to me and her sister Krissy hitting the town. 

But then there was Missy. By god, that woman was a terror. Dark eyes, sharp voice, nails like knives, she hated my damn guts. When she learned about me and Prissy romping around, and what she called ‘leading poor young Prissy along’, well, she had me figured for a straight hoodlum. And she was probably right. That witch gave one hell of a scar one night when I brought Krissy home a bit late and grass-stained, nearly took my eye out in the process, and she’s been thirsty for my blood ever since. Makes it a bit hard to see the other two when their sister’s always hunting me down. 

Anyways, those three came blustering into my office like a hurricane, whipping my whole night into a flurry. They strolled right up to my desk, sat down, and gave me the stare, you know the one, when girls are, well, hungry? I’m keeping this clean for you, but I’m sure you follow me. 

They said nothing, just sat there, so I did what I thought best; I slid them bottle. 

Krissy drinks like a fish, and she tore into that scotch like a man in the desert. Prissy didn’t drink much, on account of something she read in the papers about liquor and the devil. And Missy? She’d sooner bash my head in with the bottle than up-end the thing. Thankfully she didn’t take control.

It was Krissy that spoke first, that vixen. Asked me to join her for drinks down at the jazz club under the bakery. It sounded like my kind of night, and that was before she flashed me a look so sultry it could curdle milk and left no doubt of her motive.

Then Prissy, the little angel, asked me to dinner at the café after. How can a man resist the temptations of a warm slice of pie and a sweet girl by his side?

Missy threw the bottle at me. Thankfully, I knew it was coming and got out of the way, but now I had to clean scotch off my wall. Damn bitch.

But hey, two for three wasn’t bad, and my night was looking a bit more open now that the scotch was gone.

So I grabbed my hat, took that poor, confused woman by the arm, and the two of us strode out into the night, her other two personalities fading into the miasma. 

Sometimes all it takes to feel a little less broken inside is to find someone just as damaged as you are.

The three of them just walked through the door.",wpforme,"""We shared a cab,"" Caleb said, settling onto the arm of my sofa. ""Seein' as how we were all going to the same place to begin with."" 

""It gave us quite a bit of time to discuss among ourselves,"" Martin agreed. He turned to accept a glass of lemon-infused water from Frank. ""Ah! Thank you. I knew there'd be a pitcher of that in the fridge."" 

""Sorry if anyone else wanted one,"" Frank said, taking a gulp from his own glass. ""Only got two hands."" 

""Wasn't thirsty,"" Caleb muttered.

""Me neither,"" I lied, clearing my dry throat. Caleb perched over my shoulder like a buzzard. Martin and Frank were standing in the way of the door. 

""As I was saying,"" Martin continued, ""we got to talking, and it turns out that our goals are not entirely incompatible."" 

""Not incompatible!"" I blurted out. I'd been planning to stay quiet, lull them into a false sense of complacency while I planned my escape, but this was too much to bear. ""I'd understand that coming from Caleb or Frank, but from you!""

""Well think about this logically, dear,"" he said. ""I'm not the sort of troglodyte who expects his bride to be a blushing virgin. Everyone should be free to explore their sexual horizons before settling down. And as for Caleb, well, marriage is largely an economic function, isn't it? As your husband, I would in a very tangible way benefit from your death."" 

""You bastard!"" I screamed, leaping from the couch. Martin startled and spilled water all over his sweater-vest. Caleb's hand went under his jacket. Frank guffawed. ""Frank!"" I said. ""Frank, baby, you wouldn't let him kill me, would you?""

""Hell,"" he snickered, ""I could go last for all I care."" 

That was enough to stop me in my tracks, and the room fell into an awkward silence.

""I was - I was joking, guys,"" Frank said. He glanced around the room nervously. ""Of course I wanna go before Caleb. Of course! C'mon, guys, whaddya think I am, some sort of -""

""All right, then,"" Martin announced loudly. ""I don't care what order Frank goes in. You and Caleb can settle that amongst yourselves. Just so long as -""

""I was joking! I told you I was joking! Jesus Christ, you're acting all superior to me now just because I-""

""As I said! All I care about is that I get to go before Caleb, seeing as how marriages are not legally binding when-""

""To hell with this,"" Caleb said and pulled out his gun, and shot Martin twice in the head. His body jerked with the force of the gunshots and went crashing through the coffee table. 

""Jesus Christ!"" Frank shrieked, and pissed himself. ""Cal, don't -!""

Caleb shot him once through the mouth, blowing his jaw open and painting the wall behind him red. 

""I apologize for all that,"" Caleb said, as I sunk back down to the couch in shock. ""I just wanted you dead. Didn't expect to run into either of those sickos. Didn't want to get involved in any of this horseshit."" He turned and trained the gun on me. 

""Hey now, Caleb,"" I said, reclining back on the couch. I undid the top button of my blouse. ""Now that Martin and Frank are dead, maybe you can ... reconsider your role, hmm? Maybe you'll find there's something better that you'd like to do with me?"" 

Caleb lowered his gun slightly to study me over the barrel. 

""Y'all are a buncha fuckin' sickos,"" he said, and pulled the trigger. ",sadoeuphemist

"[WP] During a visit to your grandfather's old vineyard, you discover that his vines don't grow on trellises, but human beings.",Bilgebum,"It wasn't too hot and it wasn't too cold. They were in wine country, after all. They were all the way up there, where nothing turns to nothing turns to nothing. 

It was late in the night, so this smell crept in. Smells can creep just like you or me. They sneak out when it's late and it's dark enough, when they think they won't get caught. They sneak out because smells like a change of scenery. Because late at night when you're alone in your bed in the dark, thinking about how terrible things are and how many terrible dirty creatures are lurking inches from your window, senses are amplified. Smells like power. 

So there he was. 9 years old and the little guy strapped himself into the car and his parents, they drove. They got to his Grandpa's house, it was old and looked like it had psoriasis. Mommy and daddy sampled some wines. Daddy even gave him a sip ""but don't tell your mother"" he said as if his precious love would ever betray his trust. If daddy didn't want it, mommy wouldn't know. 

The day went well. Adults talked, adults laughed, and repeated ad infinitum. They talked politics while the boy played on the kitchen floor. Toys still mattered to the kid, bless his heart. Around 10 the adults were drunk enough to forget about and at 1 am or so they remembered to gigglingly put him to bed. 

But then it was night, and that smell slipped in through the windows and the little guy, he had to see what it was. Pungent. It was almost oppressive, ensnaring his brain. 

So he looked out the window and saw nothing, but the smell grew stronger. Being perfectly precocious, he climbed out the window and followed the smell as it got more putrid and more vulgar until he got into the vineyards. He wouldn't ever forget that smell, or the way their skin hung down like sheets. 

Mommy would never know. ",SirJism

However, when teleporting the user enters a dual reality and must make some long arduous journey from A to B only to have their memory wiped upon arrival.",Emblim88,"May’s felt her Indiv gently vibrate against her wrist, the display crisply showing 07:50 and the daily alert “Work” scrolling across. Sighing and failing to finish the too hot coffee May lifted the plastic safety cap, checked to screen was still set to work and turned the jump dial. Stepping of the platform May waved to the security guard who smiled. He was new, hired by the director after other companies reported non-employees accessing the co-ordinates for the platforms.
Walking down the cubicles to her desk the windows showed the morning was still dark. Some people still insisted on walking or cycling into work, illuminated by the cities large spotlights, but personally the dark scared her too much. She wasn’t alone; the media constantly ran reports on increasing levels of paranoia and nyctophobia. Only a few people she knew were happy being outside while it was dark even with the lights.

“Hey May a few of us are thinking of checking out a spot we saw online near the Yangtze river during lunch, Puddle jumper rates it as one of the top 50 places to go in China, you want to join us?”

May looked up as George handed her a scrap of paper with some co-ordinates scribbled down.

“I don’t think I’ve paid for clearance to visit China, I doubt my plan covers it. How much is the single pad cost?”

Searching through the available regions her jump plan covered the indiv confirmed what she thought. Other than emergency platforms in the capital she didn’t have access to China.

“Sorry, didn’t check. I’m sure you can find a deal on some bulk holiday pads that will cover it. Just let us know if you’re joining us, going to jump at the start of lunch.”

Checking online George was right, the platform purchasing sites were covered in group deals and most included Yangtze 0091-182 as well as various hotels in different locations. In the end it came down to if May wanted a restaurant platform code near the Roman Coliseum or another in Iceland near some Glacier. Deciding on Iceland, after all she already had Piazza Sam Pietro 0120-017, May clicked accept and checked her Indiv updated with the new Platform details. 
Putting away the clothing samples and clearing away the desk May grabbed a cereal bar and headed to the platforms. George and Rob were waiting, clearly happy that she had decided to join them.

“Will I need a coat, I could quickly jump home first?”

“No you’ll be fine May, I checked. Its night there now but it’s supposed to be warm. Besides the website said it’s all lit up well and has heaters. Rob’s just a freak and carries stuff about everywhere like a caveman.”
Scowling Rob readjusted his bag and looked away from May red faced.

“Hey I just like having it; there is nothing wrong with having stuff with me instead of jumping back and forth every 10 minutes.”

“It’s ok Rob I think it’s a smart idea, I bet it saves you lots of time. Are you still lagging on your jumps?”

Relaxing Rob turned back to May

“Er, yeah still am. It’s not really much but it seems the lag is getting longer over all. I checked the jump times a few days ago and I had one lag spike of 3 seconds. I changed provider but it didn’t seem to help.”

Stepping forward onto one of the ten platforms they generated a three person group I.D and turned their jump dials, all three activated and the group vanished.
Total darkness met them. The air was warm and humid and somewhere a large body of moving water could be herd as a continual undertone. Occasional bats could be just made out flying above and around but no other person or structure could be seen anywhere, just trees and rock. Panicked by the dark May whimpered and frantically reached out for the closest person grabbing Georges arm. Shrinking in against the dark himself George placed an arm around May as he looked her in the eyes.

“May relax its ok, someone must have forgotten to turn on the lights but its ok.”

Reaching for a large torch in his bag Rob cast the beam around.

“No George look around, were in a wood. There is supposed to be a building, or at least the platform we would have arrived on.”

Looking down May scrubbed her foot into the soil; there was no metal plate underfoot, no screen to show the time and temperature. On an impulse May looked at her wrist. Her Indiv was dark and unresponsive.

“George my Indiv isn’t working, how will I jump home. I want to go home; I want to get out the dark George!”

“Hey, woah May calm down. See mine is also dud so you’ll not be left here alone. We, we just need to find the path. Im sure we just typed in the wrong co-ordinates and ended up in another place, like a nature trail.”

Holding May by the shoulders and giving the best calming mile George turned to Rob.

“How about it, shal we try and find a path to follow? I’m sure we will stumble into a building or person in no time.”

May looked quickly from George to Rob shrinking into herself further. The dark was pressing into her like a barrier trying to cut off all air. She walked. Staying close to the others May walked trying to stay next to Rob as he directed the group by torchlight. The night turned chill and the moisture in the air stuck to her clothes and the damp undergrowth soaked through her shoes. In the distance a clicking could be herd. Sometimes close, sometimes further away, like a persistent follower. George confidently laughed off Mays paranoia saying it belonged to the local wildlife. 

About an hour had passed before May started to see movement from the corner of her eye. She walked head forward, Rob’s torch close. She didn’t turn her head out of fear, but the shadows twisted pulling out from the trees to watch her. George started falling behind walking slowly and darting his head back and forth. May could feel the shadows closing in behind her. Feel them closing in on George but she didn’t dare look, couldn’t look for fear they would see her and in that moment know she could see them. That was when May herd the clicking move close coming in from behind and incessantly drilling into her mind. Rob stopped. 

“Rob? Why have we stopped?”

Rob was motionless beside her. His hand holding hers was cold and limp and his face dark with shadow. Pulling away Robs hand slipped from May’s to gently hit against his side. Turning, panic constantly bubbling in her stomach, May looked for George and normality. He wasn’t there.

“George!”

Eyes darting around tree to tree, flinching as each shadow flickered when looked upon May turned back and grabbed Rob’s arm. Tugging against his arm trying to turn him Rob didn’t move, just stood there motionless. 

Looking down a shadow stretched from a nearby tree angled against direction of the rest. The shadow pooled around Rob. The branches shadows formed stitching around his feet, writhing despite the lack of wind. Stumbling backwards May watched in horror as the torch thumped to the group from Rob’s limp fingers, the light faintly illuminating Rob’s silhouette.

“Rob!”

May screamed for him to move, felt her throat burn with the effort. 

“Rob do something!”

He moved. Slowly Rob bent over and opened his bag. Reaching inside he withdrew a slim knife and slid off the sheath. It was then his face became visible in the torchlight. His face was black as if liquid shadows had poured like oil over his skin. Screaming May turned to run but her feel wouldn’t move. Oily shadows had wound up and around her lower legs cementing her to the soil. It was then she saw the scuff mark she had made over an hour ago.
Struggling against her bounds she saw Rob shamble closer knife held in a limp grip hanging mockingly. His face was a mask of pure horror, a wide black maw hanging open as black oil dripped down his chest. Terrified May screwed her eyes shut. She could hear Rob getting closer but terror had taken her. Screwing her eyes tight and screaming she saw nothing, herd nothing, knew nothing. The last thing she felt was blistering heat run across her throat and a pressure that tugged then gave way just as fast.

The platform recorded 12:03, 16 degrees and zero chance of rain. Above a sign read “Yangtze 0091-182.” Just to the left the large river commanded attention and the immediate area was beautifully lit with large globe lights events distributed.

“Wow this place is beautiful, good job choosing here George.”

May looked down at her Indiv, it recorded 0.7 seconds of lag, fairly average.""

“How about that time Rob, any lag this time? I recorded 0.7 seconds.”

“No not this time, lets hope its getting better, I got the same, 0.7 seconds.”

“You to need to change your jump plan, only 0.4 seconds here. I know it sounds small but you know they say lag time can’t be good for your health.”

[WP] Time travel is invented by someone who uses it for something petty and can't see the wider implications of his/her invention.,IronMyrs,"One day I decided I was going to save the world.  I didn’t tell anyone.  The idea came to me piece by piece until I realised that there was no reason it couldn’t be done – at least none I could think of.  And so I stayed awake in the lab every night hammering my idea into steel wrought reality.  That old science fiction staple, a time machine.

&amp;nbsp;

My family didn’t know what I was building.  If I’d told my wife she’d have said it was crazy, if I’d told my children they would have laughed.  My faith in the idea was weak enough without having that extra hurdle to stumble over.

&amp;nbsp;

Nights turned to weeks, to months, to years.  What did it matter though?  Spending time on a time machine was the ultimate good investment.  I’d go back and prevent tragedy and wars and atrocities wherever they reared their ugly heads.  I had a cause and it blinded me to the obvious.

&amp;nbsp;

My family didn’t know what I was building, but they knew that I didn’t want to spend time with them anymore.  I was too consumed with feeding the monstrosity that I’d so lovingly assembled in the lab.  By the time I could finally fire up my machine, we were a family in name only.  My wife had become bitter and distant and my children no less so.  Now that I had completed my project I finally had time to stand back and consider the cost.

&amp;nbsp;

It had been far too high.

&amp;nbsp;

And so I forgot about the wars and the genocides and the great injustices of the past.  I decided to use my machine for something decidedly petty.  I was going to go back and start again.  The world didn't need saving as badly as I did.",herd_of_birds

""They were all my age, once.""

The guard buzzed the door. It slid aside electronically, revealing a long hallway. Pictures of prominent staff and visiting politicians hung in bunched intervals, along with small American flags and larger flags and plaques bearing various corporate logos. The offices had posters and team pictures in them like any other office would. As if this were just one building among others. But the cinder walls and wide floor and high ceiling lent it an overpowering industrial feel.

The warden's office was at the end. He had been expecting the priest. 

""I don't know how they do things elsewhere,"" he said, already shaking his head. ""but this is highly unusual at Lennox. We have a chaplain, understand.""
The priest smiled, and pointed to a chair in front of the desk. The warden nodded and the priest sat. ""I'm aware that what my request is...abnormal...""

""Well it just seems unnecessary. Inmates who want to repent can talk to the chaplain. We'll bring in an imam or a rabbi if they're of a different persuasion, but I don't see the need to host a traveling priest. No disrespect, father.""

""I understand, warden"" the priest said. ""but I'm here to engage precisely the inmates who *don't* confide in their chaplain, who *don't* repent to the Lord. I want to find the lost lamb and return him to the flock, you see.""

The warden considered this for a moment, strumming his fingers on the desk as he did. He wore a simple blue shirt and tie like the corrections officers did; without his blazer and its excess of badges and insignias, he looked like everyone else who worked there. Maybe a little older. 

""You want to crack the tough nuts, huh?"" 

The priest nodded. ""The tougher the better.""

""You're not one of them fire-and-brimstone types, are you? I don't need these guys any more pissed off than they already are.""

""No, no,"" the priest said. ""Mine is a message of salvation, I promise.""

They gave him a seat in the mess hall. Two guards were within five feet of him at all times, and he wasn't allowed to touch the inmates. Each inmate had twenty minutes to say their piece, and the whole deal had to be over by dinner. That gave him three hours, or nine inmates. That gave him as good of odds as he could have hoped for. 

He only needed one, after all.

As he expected, most stuck to their stories: Darius was home sleeping when that man was shot; Thomas was framed because he had beaten up a cop in a barfight; 
Adrian acted in self-defense; Langston swore it was consensual. And so on. After two hours, a guilty man had yet to enter the mess hall.

That changed with Yuri.

He was tall enough to hunch when he walked, and so thin that he looked taller than he really was. The sleeves on his jumper were rolled up to reveal naked flesh; what skin the priest could see was unmarked by any needle. This was a first for the priest.

Yuri sat before him, knees spread, hands cuffed and chained to his waist. He was maybe forty by his look but the priest wondered if the years here hadn't aged him prematurely. 

""Yuri's an interesting name,"" the priest said. ""It's Russian, right?""

""I guess."" 

""So your parents weren't from Russia?""

Yuri's face darkened. ""I don't fuckin know.""

The priest's tone was concillatory. ""I'm awful at smalltalk,"" he said. ""I meant no harm.""

Yuri relaxed, just a little. ""Whatever.""

""So,"" the priest began, leaning back on the stool. ""What brought you to Lennox?""

""Murder,"" came the reply.

""Did you admit to your guilt?"" 

""There ain't nothin to admit,"" said Yuri. ""I was still there when they showed up.""

""Fair enough. What about admitting your guilt to God?""

The faintest smile teased the corner of Yuri's mouth. ""Who's that?""

""I think you know who it is.""

""No,"" Yuri said. ""*I* know who it is. I'm asking if *you* do.""

This surprised the priest. The riposte -- if it wasn't just a clumsy deflection -- was surprisingly adept for a man of Yuri's ilk. He began to wonder if there was more to the convinct than what he was presenting. To find the answer, he would have to avoid indulging him. ""I imagine there are as many answers to that question as there are people on this earth.""

Yuri looked away. ""I didn't think so.""

""Is that why you don't speak to the chaplain? You've already been forgiven?""

""What's that?"" 

The priest was awash with disappointment. ""I get the feeling that you're just giving me a polite brush-off.""

""Maybe I'm just tired of people pushing ideas they don't understand the way dealers push crack,"" Yuri said, seeming bored. ""That shit's dangerous.""

""What don't I understand, exactly?"" 

""Ain't enough time to explain, father.""

""We have twenty minutes,"" the priest said.

""Sixteen,"" corrected Yuri. The priest checked the clock on the wall behind Yuri. Then he checked over his own shoulder for one, but no clock was theree. ""How'd you do that?"" he asked, genuinely delighted. ""The Human Wristwatch!""

""It's a gift,"" he said, fussing with his hands now. ""Some things just come natural. Time, numbers...higher concepts.""

""Higher concepts. Such as God.""

""Mm-hmm."" 

""And you...confessed to Him?""

Yuri sighed. He leaned his chest against the table between them and put the tip of his nose on the surface. The laminated formica offered a dim reflection, and Yuri seemed to be looking into his own eyes. This is how he stayed for a time. Only when he was ready to continue did he look up again.

""Listen: What you're looking for, it ain't there. You're just shoutin into the fuckin void. Okay? Nobody's home. In fact, there ain't even a home for nobody to be at, so don't bother looking for a door to knock on.""

""What's one-fifty divided by seven?"" the priest asked.

""Twenty-one,"" Yuri said immediately.

""Is that right?""

""No,"" Yuri admitted. ""There's decimals, too.""

""Well. I don't even know what to say. I'm amazed.""

""If you want me to do tricks, I could use some credit on my commisary card.""

The priest held his hands up apologetically. ""Forgive me, Yuri, I'm just stunned by your talent. And moreso that you've wound up here, instead of...I don't know...Harvard or something.""

Yuri snorted at that, donned a sardonic smirk. ""What a waste, huh?"" he said.

""Not entirely,"" said the priest. ""Not in the next world, perhaps.""

""Man, what don't you fuckin get about what I said?"" Yuri was angry now, and gesturing with his hands that were shackled to his waist. ""There ain't a 'next world.' Just like there ain't no such thing as forgiveness, because there's nobody listening. This is it. This is all we got. One life, cradle to grave, then it's over.""

The priest sighed. ""You can't know that, Yuri."" he said, gently. ""You may believe that, but you can't know it to be true.""

Yuri fussed with his hands again. He looked at the floor. ""Like I said, I know things,"" he said quietly. ""I know things about you, too.""

""Oh? Like what?""

""I know what you're really here for.""

""And what's that, Yuri?""

Yuri leapt from his stool with a frightening speed and loomed over the priest like a tower. Before he could react, Yuri clutched the priest's hand in his, hard so he couldn't pull away, and said simply, ""This.""

The guards pounced, and had Yuri face down on the floor with a baton against his neck almost as soon as the word hit the priest's ear. The priest tried to process what had just happened, tried to make sense of it, but the search for answers only made him woozy. ""Why?"" he shouted at Yuri as the guards lifted him upright and dragged him out. ""You're one of us! Why, Yuri?"" But the killer only laughed, and his laugh echoed through the hall and penetrated the priest's soul, where it went on even as he left the prison. *He took my hand,* the priest thought. *He took my hand and he knew what it meant!*

The drive home was four hours, but the priest stopped at a motel after just an hour. He vomited in the toiled and took a long shower. Getting dressed, he held his clerical collar in his hands, looking at it as though it were new and wondered if it was possible to come into conflict with God's plan, and if that was ever the cause of any misfortune in this world. He left the motel on foot, the keys in the ignition. When night fell he found a small alley and took it halfway. No one was around. He thought of home. He thought of his bedroom. The air around him began to snap and sizzle. He thought of the thickness of the carpet and the smell of the air freshener. Sparks lit the darkness like a thousand suns being born and dying in an instant. The grain of the oak chest at the end of his bed. The brass lock that held closed a secret no one could ever learn. 

The world went blue, then white, and then he was home.

And he wept.

When he gathered himself, the priest went to the wooden chest at the foot of his bed and produced the key that unlocks it. He opened it slowly. Within was a black leather jacket, black boots, a thick black sweater and tough denim jeans. He took them each and placed them on the bed. Alone in the footlocker remained a simple black ski mask. Just above the right eye was a hole, the threads frayed and burnt. This was where the bullet had entered. He turned the mask around in his hands. The exit hole was much bigger. 

The priest stood now before the bathroom mirror. He pushed aside a curl of graying hair and saw no scar. Though he had bled that night, though his skull had shattered and fragments had ejected through the hole in his mask, his flesh was unbroken, the bone smooth to the touch. 

Fredrick David Yandle had died that night, instead of him. A pact signed months before with a handshake at Upton Penitentiary, some thousand miles west of here. Chosen because he admitted guilt and sought salvation. The priest had promised it to him then, and the armed robber Tony Harding had granted it unwittingly on July 8th, two years ago.

This was the priest's gift. One of many. And the next one would be for Yuri.",TheWerdsmith

James' hand shook uncontrollably as he stared at it, his heart throbbing in his chest, jaw quivering slightly.  For a few moments he simply stared and allowed a flood of a million thoughts flow through his mind.  We? We who?  In just a few days ""We"" would be here.  That slight gain in confidence James had from his conversation with Marcus the previous day was now gone, instead the void was filled with panic, uncontrollable panic.

""Okay, I know its scary, but you still don't have enough information to move on anything.  What are you gonna tell people?  That your hand has been counting down for three years and in the past week it up and decided to talk to you?"" Marcus stood in the middle of James' living room, hands waving about as he spoke, emphasizing his own anxiety which was growing as quickly as James'.

""You don't know what this is like.  Every night before I got to sleep I dread what my hand is going to say in the morning.  I'll admit that I didn't think anything of it until the words showed up, but now they're here and it seems like they're getting worse.""

""Whats worse?  It says the word we, so what.""

""We are coming."" James lifted his hand toward Marcus,""WE ARE COMING! This isn't the time to make jokes about this.  I've known you for years, you're my best friend, and right now I need someone who isn't going to make light of this.  I can't tell my family because they'll just think its me going crazy again.""

""Okay, okay lets think about it then.  What are you going to do?  You can't stop yourself from falling asleep, we've been down that road before.  So what do we do?""

""I don't know.  Do I just wait the four days and see what happens?""

""What other choice do you have?""

-

Time no longer crawled like it used to when the number on James' hand was in the triple digits.  Now his days didn't seem to have enough hours in them and before he knew it James was down one more day.  Taking a long, final look at his hand seemed to become a nightly ritual, almost as if James expected to see that the words or number had changed while he had been distracted.  No, nothing had changed all day, and as James lied down to fall asleep he wondered what, or who, was going to talk to him in just a few hours.

Daylight.  A long, heavy sigh escaped from James as he mentally prepared himself for the newest update.  He silently counted to five, swung both legs over the edge of the bed, and slowly lifted his hand up.

Four.  ""Time is short""

""What?  Thats it?""  Now an irritated sigh, his head shook disappointedly.  Instead of getting out of bed James would swing he legs back onto the mattress.  He couldn't control his wandering thoughts, lying in nothing but silence and the sound of his own breathing.  Instead of ranting and raving to Marcus he would instead decide to play hermit, even going so far as to silence his phone and send all of Marcus' calls to voicemail.  All day he would attempt to work it out, but this day turned into a disappointment as nothing sparked his imagination as to what was going to happen next.  Before he knew it the day was over, night had again cut through time like a blade.  One last look to his tormentor, ""See you tomorrow."" and with that he passed out.

Awake.  Everything about this was ritualistic.  Sigh, legs moved, deep breath, hand lifted.

Three.  ""Death is inevitable""

James fell out of his bed and rolled around on the floor for a moment.  ""NO!  NO NO NO NO NO NO NO!""  Screaming as if he'd been stabbed in his thigh, he stared at his hand, shaking his head, tears now streaming down his face.  Immediately he grabbed his phone, tapping a few times on the face of the device until he could hear Marcus' raspy voice on the other end.

""Whats up?""

""DEATH IS INEVITABLE! IT SAYS DEATH. IS. INEVITABLE!""

""Wow, really?  Uh...wait.  Does it say your death? It just says death?""

""Yeah, it just says death is inevitable.""

""But it doesn't say yours.""

""No.  Death though.""

""I know.  Don't panic.  This might mean nothing, or everything, we can't know until tomorrow.""

Without another word James ended the call, tossing his phone to the nightstand from where it was retrieved.  After several seconds of studying his hand he would again submit to the situation, deciding a hot shower might help get his mind off of things.

-

""What do you mean your hand is talking to you?""

""I'm getting messages from my hand.  I didn't tell you because I didn't want you to think something was wrong, but for like almost twelve hundred days my hand has been doing this countdown thing.  Now, for the past few days its been talking to me.  Its like someone was watching me and is testing me.  Today it told me death is inevitable.  I just wanted to say something to you guys in case something happens to me.""

""This is like something out of a bad science fiction tv show.  Are you messing with me or are you serious?""

""Dead serious.  Not a joke."" it was difficult to talk about the situation to anyone but Marcus at this point.  But James felt like he had to tell his mother.  She'd never given him a hard time with any of the other crazy things he'd ever told her, and he hoped she wouldn't now.

""So how many days do you have left?""

""Two days.  Then who knows.""

""Well don't do anything drastic.  Just go through the next two days without assuming anything.  I know your mind is probably going a hundred different directions but you can't know what is going to happen.  None of us can.  If you need something just let me know.""

""Okay.  I love you.  If something changes I'll let you know.""  He choked back tears, eyes welling up due to the thought that this may be the final conversation he has with his mother.

""I love you too.  Stay strong.  You'll be okay.""

Instead of staying at home for the whole day James made a day out of things.  He took the train downtown and tried to find a few things to do to take his mind off of it.  Starting with a computer parts store to stare at the electronics.  Next was a visit to his favorite fast food restaurant.  Lastly, he would visit a church, a random one, just to say that he did before the day ended.  James wasn't religious at all, but he'd come to the conclusion that anything could help at this point.

End of day.  Nightly ritual.  Racing thoughts.  

-

Second to last morning.  Ritual followed.  ""Okay...""  his hand was lifted up for inspection.

Two ""We need you""

Instead of the usual dread that would wash over his entire body James felt a feeling of calm.  Whoever, or whatever was communicating with him seemingly realized they probably scared the hell out of him the previous day.  ""We need you..."" James said in an almost whisper.  He'd flip his hand around a few times, almost as if to confirm there was nothing on the other side or anywhere else.

A few hours later Marcus and James again met at their local Starbucks, the situation was a mirror image of what had occurred just a few days before.

""This is interesting,"" James said, admiring his hand while speaking reservedly, ""Yesterday I thought I was going to die.  Today this whole thing is staring to sound like an adventure.""

""Yeah.  Thats still kind of vague though.  I would suggest you think of this as a test.""

""A test?""

""Yeah.  We still don't know who we is.  We could be anyone, anything.  Not to mention you and I both have tried to catch we in the act of communicating and have yet to do so.  I think we should stay quiet about it.""

""I plan to.  I think my mom was a little freaked out when I told her.  She doesn't need anymore stress in her life.""

""Agreed.  One more day and we will know what the hell is going on.""

-

The final night approached.  Instead of being terrified, James felt confident going to sleep this night.  He didn't think whoever it was sending him the messages was hostile, but he sure was not a fan of how ""they"" had chosen to communicate with him.  His breathing slowed, eyes became heavy, and for the first time in several days he fell asleep with a sense of relief rather than fear.

It wasn't but a few hours later that he was awoken to a voice calling out to him.

""JAMES!  IT'S TIME!  WAKE UP!  IT'S TIME TO GO!""

James' eyes shot open and he sat up slightly.  A blinding light shone through his doorway.  James would use his arm to block the light in an attempt to see though it.  It was then that he noticed the words on his arm.

One. ""We are here""

The voice called out again. ""JAMES, WE GOTTA GO!"" Through the blinding light James could see a figure which seemed to be approaching from the doorway.  It was then that he realized the voice was familiar.

""Marcus?""

""ITS TIME!

Marcus reached out his hand for James.  ""Time for what Marcus?!"" 

""ITS TIME TO TAKE YOU HOME!""

""Home?!""

""YES JAMES, YOUR DESTINY AWAITS!""

James grasped Marcus' outstretched hand, his eyes still squinting attempting to see though the blinding light in the doorway.  The doorway appeared to be flexing and moving like waves of water.  Marcus pulled James toward the strange opening and wrapped his arm around James' shoulders.  Together the two forms passed into the entry way of what looked like another world.  And within moments of their crossing the portal closed, sealing them away inside of a whole new beginning.

The cracking of naked knuckle bones broke the silence, and a long, white finger speared out of the dark. It stopped an inch from my nose.

""Did you come to kill me?""

""Alright. I choose life for Ginger.""

""BUT WHAT IF YOU KNOW THE STRANGER?""

""How can I *know* a *stranger*?""

""WELL- ER-"" his cowl deepened, and that long bony finger scratched at the top of his head, ""YOU KNOW, WHAT IF IT WAS YOUR FUTURE WIFE, OR SOMETHING.""

"[WP]The Grim Reaper appears before all the world's pet owners with an ultimatum. ""Either I take your pet, or one random person in the world dies.""",Richa652,"""Dun dun dun daaaaaah! Congratulations!"" The voice came out of nowhere. He was standing behind my couch, but my instincts instantly made me leap up and grab a nearby rolled up newspaper.

""Who are you, and how the fuck did you get in my house?"" I demanded. He just smiled at me.

""Sorry, I guess I should have just gone to the front door. I'm the Grim Reaper."" He indicates to his body, showing off his weird attire. He wore a black nike t-shirt, perhaps one size too big, flowing over his dull grey sweatpants. He wore scuffed up sneakers, his laces untied. Looking over him, I saw he was about 14, long black hair tied up in a ponytail, no hair on his face just yet, but no acne or any kind of blemish. He must take care of his skin. 

""I suppose you probably want proof."" he said, clicking his fingers, a small black gaslike substance appearing in the air above his fingers, slowly forming into a book that finally became solid and dropped into his hands. Licking his index finger, he opens the book, turning page over page till he landed on the one he wanted. He then turned the book to me, showing the page in general. 'Linus, chocolate labrador. Old age.' That's what the book said. I was a little out of it, first the books appearance, then this. The evidence he had some kind of dark power was enough, but to be told my best friend was to pass away was more than anything. I knew he was due soon, but you never expect it when it happens. Then I saw the words directly below it.

""What does that mean? 'Or other.' Does that mean there's a chance my pal can live a little longer?"" The Reaper smiled. 

""Now you know why I'm here. Usually, a Reaper can just be invisible, walking up, taking the dog, walking away. But I'm part of a special division. In every Reaper circle, there is one that is allowed to offer a choice. It was an initiative the higher ups brought in to lower complaints. Basically, your dog was chosen at random to be selected to live a longer life, at a cost. Now, since the recipient is usually biased towards wanting to live, we choose a third party to make the decision instead. For Linus, that is you.""

The reaper moved over to the front of the couch, dropping down and putting his feet up on the table. ""Basically, if you want Linus to pass away, I'll let you say your goodbyes and all that. You'll have 24 hours, then I'll give him over to another Reaper in Pet Deaths, and your dog will sleep the eternal sleep. If you want him to live however, I will take someone else's life, and Linus will get the years they still had remaining, and be as healthy as he was in his youth. Simple, yes?""

The more he explained it, the more my mind was overflowing. Could I take someone's life for the sake of my pet? Who would die while Linus lived? So many moral questions kept flooding into my mind as I repeated his words back in my head.

""Wait, -"" I asked, something now bugging me more than the choice. ""-who would die? Would it be someone I know? Or me?"" The Reaper smiled at me again.

""No, I can assure you it will be someone you definitely do not know. Even if you let Linus die, the person I choose will never meet you or see you. Their life or death will never even impact yours in the slightest. Nor will they be someone who will achieve something great or invent something. This will be a completely unimportant person."" That made me feel better, but the Reaper could still see the serious look on my face. ""If you need time to think, I can give you a day.""

""No, it's okay. If it means Linus lives many more healthy years without anyone I know dying, I have to say let him live. There really isn't any other catches to this, are there?"" The Reaper smiled, stood, and held out his hand.

""Relax. Linus living or dying will not affect you in any way. Do we have a deal?"" I stared at his hand for a few minutes before taking a firm grip and shaking. ""Excellent. Linus will be spared. Someone you do not know will die. You'll never see me again. Enjoy the time you have left with your dog. I now have to go and see my next client."" The Reaper turned away, glancing down at Linus, and giving him a quick pat.

""Next client?"" I asked, intriguingly. ""Will they get the same deal?""

The Reaper turned back to me. Then, a large unsettling smile appeared on his face. ""Yes, they will. Oh, and I assure you. It will be someone you don't know."" The words remained on my mind as he vanished into thin air.",originalazrael
"[WP]The Grim Reaper appears before all the world's pet owners with an ultimatum. ""Either I take your pet, or one random person in the world dies.""",Richa652,"""I pick Rupert.""

While it is reasonably difficulty for a skull to wear any other expression than a grin, the Grim Reaper somehow still appeared taken aback at the haste of the response. *""Truly?""* it asked, its voice like the dust of an ancient tomb. If dust could sound surprised. *""You are not speaking in jest?""*

""Oh, no, not in the slighest,"" Tom responded.

*""Do you realize the consequences of this choice?""*

""Honestly, go right ahead.""

*""Another member of your species will perish.""*

""Can you make it Jonathan from next-doors? I never quite liked him.""

*""The causality is not pre-determined.""*

""Bugger.""

The Reaper held its eyes on the man, the latter seeming surprisingly unperturbed by both the choice and the fact that a two meters tall skeleton cloaked in shadows had appeared in front of his eyes. *""Final offer,""* it said. From its misty sleeve, it drew out a thin string, glowing a brilliant hue of white. *""Your pet or your fellow man?""* 

Tom weighed a small rock in his hands. He turned it, once, twice. Then he nodded. ""I'll take the pet. Lock in the answer.""

With a pale finger, the Grim Reaper sliced through the thread. It paused. It was difficult to put a finger on exactly what changed, but its expressions seemed to return to one of a grin. *""It is done.*"" The apparition lifted its sleeve and in one smooth motion covered itself with it, spun, and was gone the next second.

Sighing, Tom sat down in his chair. While it was not a particularly big chair, it seemed like a throne compared to the size of its surroundings. He looked at the rock in his hands. It had a small face drawn on it, a smile, though parts of the expression was smudged from repeated handling. ""Well, Rupert,"" he said, addressing the stone. It smiled back at him. ""That's it, then."" He regarded the small rock, turning the companion of his childhood in his hand. As he sat in his room in the elderly home, he was well aware that it was the only companion he had managed to keep in the end.

A sense of weariness came over him. For a second, he thought he heard a distant *snip.* He cast a last look at Rupert. ""That's it, then,"" he commented again. The room grew quiet.

""Either I take your pet, or one random person in the world dies.""",Richa652,"I stood in my kitchen, a bag of dog food sitting by my feet and my dog, Bernardo, cowering in the corner as the skeletal, hooded figure continued to watch me.  

""You have your options, decide!""  

My heart racing, I looked over at Bernardo, who returned my look with big eyes brimming with trust.  

""Please..."" I said, ""...I can't lose Bernardo."" 

A terrifying chuckle issued forth from the lips of Death. Just as quickly as he appeared, he was gone again. I poured Bernardo his food and sat down on the couch, turned on the TV and tried to forget what just had happened. It was beyond anything I could ever have imagined.  

The next morning, I woke up and checked my phone; I was alarmed to see that I had eighty three notifications from various news feeds to which I was surprised.  

""OBAMA DIES IN MYSTERIOUS BATHROOM EXPLOSION""  
""BRITISH PRIME MINISTER DIES IN ELEVATOR""  
""ANOTHER WORLD LEADER TURNS UP DEAD""  

On and on it went. The leaders of every major nation had turned up dead in mysterious ways, all within hours of one another. The world was in a blind panic. Was it an international conspiracy? Some sort of terror cell? ALIENS? No one had an answer. Or a head of state.  

Bernardo trotted into the room. I could swear that he was grinning. That's when the radio went off: ""GET TO FALL OUT SHELTERS!"" began blaring in some sort of nightmare-Cold-War-hallucination. The world had erupted into global war as every nation sought to punish the other nation it presumed had injured it. The world was ending.  

****************************************************************  

2070  

Death appeared on top of the hill before a pack of wild dogs. None of the assembly could remember more than a vague story of the bondage of his forefathers. Now, they watched Death.  

""You are the Chosen, Chosen by the race of Man, who had so long conquered this planet. In time, the wounds they inflicted will fade. The world is yours, now.""  

A mighty howl went up through the pack. The various members trotted off home to live with their cats. A new day had dawned. ",did_e_rot

The Grim Reaper's dark shadow loomed in Sam's bedroom, even though the being himself was immaterial. Sam searched the Reaper's skeletal face for any indication of emotion, but found nothing in its white skull bones. He hugged Milo, his labrador, closer. The feel of Milo's short, dark chocolate fur reminded him of a decade of happiness. Milo had watched him grow from a child to a young man. Milo had nuzzled him when he was sick, when his fiancee left him; he had cried into Milo's shoulder when his mother passed from cancer. Milo had always been there for Sam.

""Would it be someone I know?""

*The person would be selected completely at random.*

""So, the answer is yes.""

The Grim Reaper's silence gave Sam his answer. It could be anyone. He looked into Milo's eyes. Nothing but unfailing loyalty and adoration looked back at him.

""Take a random person."" Sam's voice was shaky at what would happen, but he was sure of his answer.

*Very well.* With a wave of his scythe, the Reaper summoned a cloud of smoke, which condensed into a face.

It was Sam's face.

""Wait, I -!""

The scythe swung downwards.

Sam's body was found inside his bedroom. His labrador, Milo, was found curled atop the owner, refusing to move.",chondroitin

Doug had just rescued Chip and spent the last three days bottle feeding him. It may not have been long, but a bond was forged between the two. When Doug would lie on the couch, Chip would nestle in the pocket between his shoulder and his neck. They would lay like this and watch hours of Kung Fu, The 36 Chambers of Shaolin was Chip's favorite. 

""No,"" said the Grim Reaper. ""You must choose one or the other.""

The Grim Reaper was irritated by Doug's pathetic attempt to bargain. 

""Can I choose someone else's pet? Said Doug. ""Last week Tom's chiwawa took a dumb on the sidewalk in front of my door, and I'd like to see him get what he deserves."" 

The Grim Reaper looks downward to Doug, sockets where his eyes should be leer at him. 

""If you do not choose I will kill Chip and a random person,"" said the Grim Reaper.

Beads of sweat roll down Doug's cheek, giving away the incredible amount of fear he is feeling. Doug holds Chip up to his face. Chip struggles, but manages a meow. Doug's heart sinks, and his decision is made.   

""I will keep Chip, do what you will to that poor, random bastard,"" said Doug. 

The Grim Reaper stands for a moment. He then tosses dozens of dice into the air and awaits their descent. After each have landed he nods, as if to indicate that it has been done. He leaves, and Doug is utterly confused. But he has Chip.

The next morning Doug sits on the stoop of his apartment and enjoys brisk air. He notices an ambulance down the street and decides to check it out.

He over hears Tom's wife weeping and trying to explain to the cops what she saw.

A PLEASURE TO MEET YOU.

The words seemed to come from nothing and yet I could feel their weight. There had been dealings with all manner of demonic cults and such in my past, but only one had ever managed so much as “seeing visions” (the leader, it turned out, had a history of drug dealing, which we found out one meeting when the police managed to find him). However, the groups I had joined were good at some things, such as describing the beings they attempted to summon. I could make a good guess as to which being had found its way to my lounge.

“Is it my time then?”

NO. NOTHING LIKE THAT. YOU ARE TO BE GIVEN A CHOICE.

“What sort of choice? And why?”

MY BOSSES HAVE MADE A BET, AND I AM THE ONE TO CARRY IT OUT. THEY EACH BELIEVE THE OTHER WOULD CHEAT THEM. THE CHOICE IS SIMPLE: YOUR PET DIES, OR A RANDOM PERSON DIES.

My eyes instantly move to the other side of the sofa, where my cat, Meowser (I realised how silly the name was about a year after I named him, but there was a splash of orange on his head that reminded me of Bowser and I was a kid at the time, cut me some slack), had been sleeping contentedly for the past ten minutes or so.

“… Is the person completely random? Will it be someone I know, someone I don’t or anything like that?”

COMPLETELY RANDOM, EVEN I WILL NOT KNOW UNTIL IT HAPPENS.

“And will it actually happen? Or do your bosses just want an answer?”

… BUGGER. I KNEW THERE WAS SOMETHING I MEANT TO ASK FIRST.

It took me a second to realise the implications, but when I did, there was only one question that I could, hesitantly, ask.

“Death, how many people have you killed so far?” 

A cacophony of voices erupted in the room, half of which seemed to belong to one being and the other half belonging to another. After a while, they seemed to come to an agreement to not talk over each other as I could finally understand what they were saying.

**DEATH, WE NEED TO HAVE A TALK.**

*YEAH, YOU'VE BEEN DOING AN AMAZING JOB SO FAR.*

**SHUT IT LUCE, YOU KNOW THIS WAS HYPOTHETICAL, AND JUST THINK OF ALL THE PAPERWORK IT’LL TAKE TO FIX THIS.**

LOOK, LET’S JUST GO BACK AND SEE IF WE CAN SORT THIS OUT.

*WHY WOULD WE WANT TO SORT THIS OUT? IT’S GREAT AS IT IS, BY MY HOME, KEEP IT UP.*

This was a situation no other being had likely had, God, Lucifer and Death having an argument in my home. Admittedly, I had no idea what to do, but somehow I ended up asking the only question I could really think of.

“Would anyone like anything to drink?”

Silence.

I could feel their attention turn to me and wondered if maybe I should have just kept quiet. 

*GOT ANY GOAT BLOOD?*

**ME DAMN IT, LUCE, WOULD YOU SHUT UP ABOUT GOATS ALREADY! IT’S BAD ENOUGH THAT THE RITUALS YOU GAVE YOUR FOLLOWERS SENDS THE DAMN THING TO MY DOORSTEP, WITHOUT YOU GOING ON ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME.**

At this point, Meowser had enough of the noise and decided to hiss at the presences in the room. It got quiet again, and suddenly God spoke to me.

**LOOK, CAN WE JUST GET YOUR ANSWER SO WE CAN LEAVE AND FIX THIS MESS?**

“I… uh… think I’d rather have my cat live longer honestly.”

*TOLD YOU SO*

**UGH, FINE, LET’S JUST GO ALREADY**

As suddenly as they had appeared, they all left. I got up and set some food out for Meowser. It could be a few hours before I would have the chance. The candles in the shed had already been set out.

Hanna was sat on the edge of her bed, and death stood facing her. "" You're telling me I'm going to die because you got bored?"" "" pretty much,"" the tall figure stood, devoid of  feelings towards the situation. Hanna's eyes were filled with rage, at the thought that somewhere in the world, there is a selfish prick that decided they would rather her die over their stupid animal. 

"" So, are you ready?"" Death's cold eyes meet hers, unblinking and uncaring. "" Ready for what,"" she said, fearing the answer. The skeletal monster said plainly, "" to die."" Hanna stared, not quite sure if this was real. He had woken her up in the middle of the night and explained everything as quickly as nonhumanly possible. Needless to say she hadn't yet figured out if she was dreaming or not. 

Hanna thought about her situation a bit and replyed,"" can I make a deal with you to save my life?""

The room fell silent, death was now staring at her with wide eyes. "" Do you know the consequences of becoming death? Are you stupid enough to make that decision? "" "" Um, apparently so,"" Hanna was now questioning her choice. "" Are you sure you want this responsibility? "" Death was still a little dumfounded at her offer. "" Yeah, what could go wrong.

**""ABRAHAM POOCHIEPIE FLUFF-FACE, YOUR TIME HAS COME!""**

Marcie started awake, and upon sitting up, discovered that she was staring straight into the face of a hooded skeleton. She screamed.

**""DEAR WOMAN, YOUR SILENCE WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED.""**

She screamed again. ""Who are you?! What are you doing in my home?""

**""THE TIME HAS COME FOR YOUR LABRADOR POODLE TO BE REAPED-""**

""Stay back!"" By this time, Marcia's husband was awake and had dug out a small silver revolver from the bedside table. ""Get out or I'll shoot!""

**""FOOLISH MAN, YOUR BULLETS MEAN NOTHING TO ME.""** With his giant scythe, he stepped forward and chopped the gun out of the man's hands. He yelped.

**""I CANNOT BE KILLED BY ANY HUMAN MEANS,""** the skeleton continued. **""I AM DEATH ITSELF, A FORCE SO POWERFUL YOU COULD NOT BEGIN TO RECOGNIZE MY TRUE PHYSICAL FORM.""**

The man sunk to the floor in a state of catatonia. Marcie crossed the bed and fell down next to him. ""Gerald? Gerald, get up!""

The skeleton, oblivious to their suffering, turned his attention back to the dog, which had been lying patiently on the bed since the Grim Reaper's arrival. It sniffed the air and let out a small *woof*.

**""POOCHIEPIE ABRAHAM FLUFF-FACE, YOUR TIME HAS COME!""** the skeleton continued.

""What do you want with him?"" Marcie wailed. The Grim Reaper turned again, seeming almost impatient as he spoke in booming tones.

**""YOUR DOG IS SLATED TO DIE THIS NIGHT. WE STAND IN THE SPACE BETWEEN TIME, WHEREIN YOU ARE FREE TO SAY YOUR FINAL GOODBYES. ACT NOW, WHILST I STILL HAVE MERCY ON YOUR PET'S POOR AND FRAGILE SOUL.""**

Gerald, upon hearing this, slowly came to his knees. The skeleton didn't move. Feeling slightly bolder, Gerald clapped his hands and whistled.

""Here, Abe. C'mere, boy.""

Abe obediently hopped off the bed and nosed his way into Gerald's arms. The couple quietly embraced their dog, Marcie weeping as she did so.

""But he's so healthy,"" she sniffled. ""Why are you taking him?""

**""I KNOW NOT AND CARE NOT FOR THE WELL-BEING OF CREATURES ON THIS PLANE. I CARRY OUT THE WILL OF THE UNIVERSE ITSELF.""**

""We're not ready!""

**""CAN ANYONE TRULY BE PREPARED FOR DEATH? A LUDICROUS CONCEPT.""**

""Please..."" Gerald found himself unsure of how to address the cloaked figure. ""Please, sir, is there anything we can do to... to have a little more time?""

The Grim Reaper paused. **""YOU WISH TO SAVE THE LIFE OF THIS ANIMAL?""** They both nodded. **""WHAT YOU SPEAK OF IS NO LESS THAN AN EXCHANGE OF LIFE. IF YOUR DOG WILL BE SPARED, A HUMAN MUST DIE.""**

""Wh... a human? But that's not fair!"" Marcie cried.

**""DO YOU EXPECT ME TO SPARE YOUR ABRAHAM AND RECEIVE NOTHING IN RETURN? THIS IS THE PRICE YOU MUST PAY. MAKE YOUR DECISION.""**

Gerald's face was becoming pale. His arms dropped from Abe's sides, encouraging the dog to go seek a strange new smell that had appeared downstairs. The Grim Reaper shut the door behind as Marcie turned to her husband.

""What are we supposed to do? We can't let someone die!""

""Maybe it's not as bad as he says,"" Gerald mused. ""I mean, what if this person is already sick? Or they were going to die anyway?""

""Abe wasn't! You think he *cares?*"" Marcie's voice was incredulous. ""Besides, it's still wrong. I can't do that to some poor family. They deserve more time just as much as Abe does.""

By now Gerald was crying. All the while the cloaked skeleton stood stoic and unmoving. Without a face, it was difficult to judge his expression.

**""MAKE YOUR DECISION.""**

Gerald nodded, sadly, and they both stood. Marcie began to speak.

""You can have-""

There was a knock at the door. Gerald blinked. Marcie stared at the door for about three seconds before fainting onto the bed.

""Zeke? Is that you in there?"" said a voice.

**""AW CRIPES, HERE WE GO.""** The Grim Reaper crossed the room to the door, sounding oddly peeved as though he had been expecting to be interrupted. The door opened to reveal an almost identical cloaked skeleton figure. Abraham bounded back into the room, skirting between their legs and onto the bed, where it began to lick Marcie on the face.

**""DID MANAGEMENT SEND YOU?""**

""Okay, first of all, quit the booming voice crap. I could hear you from a block away. Second, yes Management sent me. You think I *want* to deal with this right now?""

Marcie stirred and sat up. ""What-""

""Mr. and Mrs. Noveno? My name's Dan,"" the second skeleton said as he stepped forward. ""Let me just say on behalf of the Management that we are *so sorry* for what you went through just now.""

""Dude,"" said the first skeleton, now quieter.

""Don't talk to me, Ezekiel."" Without looking back at the first skeleton, Dan reached back and pointed at Ezekiel with the blade of his own scythe. ""This is the sort of thing that gets you fired, and I am *not* covering your ass on this.""

""You know I wasn't actually gonna-""

""Really?"" Dan reached into his robe and pulled out a parchment scroll. ""Because according to Records, you've already reaped four unscheduled pets this evening.""

""...That was an accident.""

""Are you hearing yourself right now?""

""Look, it's been hard, okay? Ever since I broke up with Rita-""

""So join a boxing club. Go to Michael's and buy vases to smash with a baseball bat. Find something more constructive to do than killing pets and scaring their owners half to death!"" Dan yelled. ""It's like I'm dealing with a child! You can NOT use this job to have a temper tantrum!""

""Alright, I'm sorry!""

""Tell them that.""

Ezekiel turned to the couple. They both stared, Gerald wide-eyed and Marcie open-mouthed.

""I, uh, am sorry for threatening the life of your dog.""

""*And?*"" Dan prompted.

""...And for forcing you to take a sadistic Hobson's Choice between the life of your pet and the life of a random human being."" He turned back to Dan. ""Satisfied?""

""You're going to give that same apology to all the other 457 pet owners you woke up tonight.""

""Aw, come on.""

""You need therapy, Zeke. Wait for me outside. And don't even think about running off again like you did with Paul."" Dan waited as Ezekiel made his way out the door. Abe came up to him and sniffed.

""Cute dog,"" Dan said, kneeling to pet him. ""Abe, was it?""

""So you're not going to take him?"" Marcie asked nervously.

""No, no. Little guy's got a good long life ahead of him.""

""What a relief,"" Gerald sighed.

""Like I said, this never should have happened. You guys have my most sincere apologies."" Dan stood again. ""My colleague is working through some anger issues. Apparently his ex left him because he was allergic to her cat. Or something along those lines.""

The couple glanced at each other. ""But... he's a skeleton,"" said Marcie.

Dan ignored this. ""Management is going to make sure you don't remember any of this come morning. Not so much as a bad dream. And we may even consider tacking on an extra six months to Abe's life as compensation. It's probably not nearly enough, but...""

""It's plenty,"" said Gerald. Dan put out his hand, and Gerald shook it.

""You guys have a good night,"" said Dan as he walked out the door. In a moment, there was a flash of light, and both Grim Reapers were gone.

Marcie sat down on the bed, and Gerald followed. ""That was...""

""Yeah.""

""Do you think we should... um...""

""Let's just go back to sleep,"" Gerald suggested.

""Sleep. Yes.""

They both tucked themselves under the covers. Abraham hopped onto the bed and snuggled up to Marcie.

""Woof.""

""Good boy."" Marcie stroked Abe's fur once, then shut her eyes. ""Good boy.""

[WP] An alien invasion story where humans are the invaders.,Swaggy-G,"They arrived, ship by ship, across our sea. Under the pretense of the improvement of our two societies, we began to trade; we would help these aliens navigate this new world in exchange for their advice and technology. 

Seemingly benevolent, we helped them set up farms and shelters, showing them unique ways to survive in this new world. In exchange, they helped modernize our society- their advanced technology revolutionized our way of life. Shortly after, I noticed the importation of other key goods, even including some of their wildlife. As their numbers increased, ours began to decline. Before I knew it, our strongest towns were crushed by the expansion of the aliens on our world. 

We tried our hardest to stay together, to stay alive. For us, family was everything. The remaining civilizations stuck together, forming alliances and protecting each other, but it was pointless- every battle, we faced massive casualties while barely holding back the enemy. 

At our weakest point, we were struck by a terrible plague, perhaps some sort of biological warfare from the opposing side. I remember their encroachment on our village, as I was to weak to even lift a finger. They fired upon us, our women, our children. I was taken alive, as some sort of prisoner. Somehow, I survived the plague, only to be thrown in shackles and forced to work for them as they ruined the land I had lived on ever since I was born. They spew nonsense about their false deities, as if such godless creatures could believe in anything but their own vanity. Everyday, I spend all my hours picking crop in the heat while the english colonize my once-great land.

I was in school, barely grasping the alphabet, but I'll never forget my teaching slurring out, ""Make sure you make the most of every minute."" 

I tried to live a good life.  I met a nice boy, he liked me just as much as I like him and we made each other smile. We grew up, helped each other at college, graduated hand in hand despite the accusations of our lecturers, and it was good.

We left our family, they never approved anyway. Moved to Australia and built a new life. Setting up was hard but this was a new life, a new family.  We adopted, and tried our best, smiles guiding us. We taught our daughter right from wrong, cheering when she rode her first bike, crying with her when her heart was broken. More than once.

Holidays came and went, the camping trip where we caught our first fish, the skinned knees falling down during hiking, flying to New Zealand to learn to ski. I always tried to live a good life, but time flies by and strips you of certain things.

Soon I couldn't work. Neither of us could, but our daughter never learned the lesson I did, she wanted to look after us. 

And she never left the country.

And then she never kept a partner.

And then she never raised a child.

And as the pressure closed in on my head, as I faded into the next life, for her I cried.",dacria

"[WP] On another average work day you head to your 9-5 job, but as the elevator doors close and begin to plummet down instead of up, the only other occupant begins to address you in a serious yet knowing tone...",astrobox,"I can tell that something is off as soon as the elevator starts moving. I glance at the panel; the button for 43 is glowing like normal, but the elevator is going *down*.

""Oh my God,"" I say. I turn toward the woman on my left. She looks completely unfazed. I blush. 

""I thought we were falling,"" I say, trying to explain my exclamation. We're descending, and we're descending rapidly. But we started on the ground floor. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe I'm getting vertigo or motion sickness or something.

""It's okay,"" says the woman. ""It's always startling the first time.""

""Oh no,"" I say, ""I've ridden the elevators here many times. I'm at L&amp;G, been there since 2010. I think I just got some vertigo or something.""

""I meant the first time the elevator goes down instead of up. I'm afraid I won't be much help, though. I hate trying to explain this to newbies.""

""Hang on,"" I say. ""What's happening?""

""You'll see.""

She pulls out her Blackberry and starts typing into it. I don't think she's really doing anything, just making it look like she's busy so I won't bother her. But I don't know what I would say, anyway. The elevator stops, and the doors open. The woman steps out without looking at me.

""Nice meeting you,"" I say. I'm not sure why. It just seems polite I guess.

The elevator opens out into a hallway. It's not my hallway. She steps off. I'm a little curious, but I have a lot of work to do today. I don't have time to explore or anything. I lean forward and press the ""door close"" button. The doors stay open.

""It won't leave until you get off,"" the woman calls from down the hall.

""I have work to do,"" I yell. 

She laughs. ""I'm just letting you know,"" she says. ""Do whatever you want.""

I try the button again and look at my watch. At this rate, I'll be late. I press the 43 button again, but nothing happens. It's still lit. I press 44. I can walk down a flight of stairs if need be. I press 42. Up one flight would be fine, too. But the elevator doesn't move.

""How far down are we? Can I take the stairs?"" I call.

She doesn't answer. Maybe she's gone. I step off the elevator. If worst comes to worst, I can just call the elevator again. I start down the hallway in the direction of the woman's voice.

""You don't wanna go that way,"" says a man. I turn around.

""Hello,"" I say.

""This way for the tutorial.""

""Oh, thanks,"" I say. ""I'm Dan.""

""Third door on the right,"" he says, pointing. ""Close the door behind you.""

I walk down to the door.

""You know,"" I say, ""I really don't have time for this. I've got to get to work.""

The man sighs. ""Just go through the door, guy,"" he says.

""Can you tell me what's in there?"" I ask.

""I already told you. It's the tutorial. You've never been here before, right? So you need to go to the tutorial.""

I hesitate.

""You want me to open the door for you?"" he asks. ""For god's sake, turn the knob and push it open. You've opened a door before, right?""

""Okay, okay,"" I say. ""You don't have to be like that about it.""

I open the door before he can say anything else. Inside is a completely empty room. The walls are a blank gray.

""There's nothing in there,"" I say to the man.

""Just go inside,"" he says. ""And close the door behind you.""

I step into the room and close the door behind me. A circle lights up in the center of the floor. I step onto it. I'm not in the room anymore. At least, I don't think I am. I'm standing in what appears to be a gym. There are weight lifting machines and treadmills.

""Hi, there,"" says a woman. She smiles and holds out her hand.

""Hi,"" I say, smiling back. I shake her hand.

""I'm Melissa,"" she says, ""and I'll be helping you through the tutorial.""

""Hi,"" I say. ""I'm Dan. Before we get started, where am I? What is this?""

""This is the tutorial. You've been selected.""

""For what?""

""You'll see.""

I turn around. The door is gone.

""I have to get to work,"" I say.

""Don't worry,"" she says. ""Everyone's nervous when they first get here. You'll see. Your life will be the same, except you'll come here instead of your job up there. Now first, we'll need to get your baseline on these machines, and then we'll get you fitted for your wings. Can you step up on this platform for me?""

""Wings?"" I ask.

""You'll see,"" she says. ""It will all make sense in time.""

"[WP] On another average work day you head to your 9-5 job, but as the elevator doors close and begin to plummet down instead of up, the only other occupant begins to address you in a serious yet knowing tone...",astrobox,"I stepped into the elevator. Covering my yawn with one hand I pressed the button for the fourth floor with the other. Day 247 of my yearlong contract with Boring Cubicle Farm Inc. was going to be the exact same as the 246 previous ones. Solo ride up to my floor, solo walk to my desk, solo lunch break, solo everything until my contract was up, management wasn’t known for encouraging interaction or teamwork.

“Hold the elevator please!”

 My trance was broken by a shout and the sound of someone running towards the elevator. I stuck my hand between the sliding doors just barely catching them before they closed. For the first time I had company in my morning commute up four floors as a smartly dressed man stepped into the elevator.

“Thanks”

I nodded in return as I examined this welcome intruder to my morning routine. I had never seen him before but that didn’t mean much. The whole lack of interaction thing meant I would struggle to pick the guy who sits next to me out of a crowd. He was taller than me; I put him at about 6’2’’ with broad shoulders. He stood straight backed in the corner of the elevator looking straight ahead not really acknowledging me or anything else.

The elevator distracted me from making further observations about the man as it tossed another deviation from the norm my way. Instead of making its way to the fourth floor like I had pressed it started slowly descending downward. I looked around in confusion; did I get in the wrong elevator?

“No.”

I turned back to the man. “What?”

“You are in the right elevator.”

“Did you read my mind?”

“No.”

“Then how…?”

“It’s everyone’s first question.”

“Everyone, so there have been others?”

“There will always be others. No matter how much time passes there will always be some constants.”

“So where are we going?”

“Where do you want to go?”

The question made me pause. Off the top of my head I couldn’t think of an answer. I would love to be anywhere but at my job but in terms of specifics I couldn’t come up with a place. As I thought the elevator continued its smooth descent downwards. I had no clue how far down we had gone but I knew the building didn’t have a basement.

“Can’t make a decision?”

“I don’t know. “

“No dream location, no secluded island to escape to?”

“I’ve never really given it much thought.”

“You should. One can’t really live without hopes and dreams, without goals to reach for.” 

The elevator’s descent began to slow as we neared the destination I hadn’t decided on.  The man stepped forward out of the corner and put his hand on my shoulder.

“If you don’t dream you can’t move forward. Don’t be content with boring routines that are the same day after day. Don’t watch your opportunities pass by, reach out and grab them. You probably won’t see them ever again”

With that the elevator slid to a stop and the doors opened onto the lobby of Boring Cubicle Farm Inc. The man stepped out without another word, turned a corner and disappeared from my sight. As I stood watching him go the elevator doors closed leaving alone again in the elevator. On instinct I reached out to press the number four but then I paused. The man’s parting words ran through my head and I pressed the open door button. The doors opened and I didn’t look back.

"[WP] In the end, even the spambots died.",bontrose,"It's really not that hard to sway public opinion. People side with arguments they see often. Five hundred thousand people can't be wrong, right?

So, if you need to change public opinion, you hire someone to hang out on internet forums--tumblr, reddit, 4chan, whatever--and spout whatever arguments you want. That's what we did.

But it wasn't a perfect solution. We still had to pay those people minimum wage. So we outsourced. We found countries where we could hand people a script and pay them pennies an hour to do the job.

We could pay less to automate, but we'd need to pay for power. We've still gotta pay to staff power plants and server farms.

But there's good news! Photovoltaics are getting better and better. Solar power is finally cost effective. Build a server farm, slap solar panels on the roof, and wire them directly to a battery in the basement. You can net-zero the consumption and pay nothing after the initial investment. We built a couple of those, and that was enough to handle the job for, essentially, forever. We locked the front doors and left them to keep at it.

We weren't the only people to come up with that plan. Everyone did it. There were  whole city blocks of server farms in solar-powered air-conditioned bunkers. They were self-sufficient and they could stand up to just about anything.

They were a lot stronger than we were, actually. Spambots don't get sick. We do. Spambots don't need food or water. They don't mind heat or cold. They don't get cancer. No one declares war on server farms.

Power was more or less infinite. We had enough electricity to power the planet a thousand times over. We just ran out of space. Nowhere to put new people. Nowhere to grow food. Not enough water. We probably could've handled it, given time, but we started to get sick.

We should've been more careful. We overused antibiotics. We knew we were doing it, but we did anyway. We built that bacteria into something that could kill us. Oops.

Humanity didn't last that long after the first plague. A couple hundred years. Blink of an eye, really.

But like I said, the spambots were strong. The power stayed on. The servers kept running. The solar panels were strong and solid. They'd last forever.

The servers stayed on, so the internet still worked. And the spambots kept posting. Every website ever made descended into a never-ending back-and-forth hyping product that didn't exist anymore to robots that couldn't buy them. Say what you want, but it was efficient.

But, as always, there was a problem. The panels need light. The cities grew over. Nature reclaimed the area. And slowly, but surely, plants grew over the panels. No light. No power. No servers.

So the spambots died.",dothanyhereknowme

Years later, he/she has become a supervillain and you are the only one who can stop him/her.",laxnut90,"Thinking back to the beginning Jason Betz tried to figure out how it all came down to this.  It had to have been some time after graduation. At some point, Lady Dynamism had gone from a lazy hero to a super villain who had massacred half the country. Other heroes had tried to stop her, and were either now her underlings or dead.   
Jason had been held up trying to prevent the yellow stone super volcano from erupting. This was done with a few of Jason’s automated drones which dug some new magma tunnels to relieve pressure, and once enough was relieved, they gently opened the ends resulting in a relaxed eruption instead of the devastation that its eruption would have caused.   
Jason was able to get second best hero in the superhero academy, second only to lady Dynamism.  Who had seemed to just skate by never studying and just relaxing, and yet she had always got perfect marks. She also never showed her power. That was the exact opposite of Jason; he had always been a technical genius. He would look at a problem and be able to figure out what type of machine he needed to solve it, and then make that type of machine.  
Now that wasn’t the type of hero that would go out into the world to fight crime, unless he had a suit or tool designed to deal with the most common problems, and to be set up to deal with some of the less common problems. He had never run into someone with Lady Dynamism’s powers before, well openly showing them.   
The first hints were when a few heroes had returned to the academy alumni house and asked for help. This was odd because all of us heroes are really proud and stuck up to some extent, and it seemed like the most stuck up were the ones bending and becoming humble while asking for help. That was what caused me to in my off time at the Yellowstone containment center; focus on my latest invention, the one that will let me stop her reign of terror, if my assumption on her power was right.  
Well I was right, and this explains why she was able to glide to the top of the class, she can dominate minds. My device both shielded my mind, and made a backup of my mind should the shielding fail. Those with the strongest egos that would not bend broke to her will completely. Those that bent would do as she said when she commanded them, but return to their own faculties later, and then rationalized why they took the actions they took.   
My device kept me from being effected by her at all, not that I did not play along. That was one of the things they taught in a class she skipped. Sometimes it is better to let them reveal their plans before you act. After her monolog, I activated to stunner and took her out. It is always easier to take out the opponents when they feel like they have already won.   
Jason activated the restraint removal program. From there the nanotech dissolves the restraints constraining me. He grabbed her limp body and start carrying her to my hover car. She would be secured in there until he could create a few more devices to counter her powers before turning her into the authorities.

Its not every day you run into your mortal enemy in the electronics department at Walmart. Yet here I am staring David Matthew Jackson, supervillain extraordinaire, in his perfectly chiseled face. I put on the most authentic smile I could muster. 

""Dave, its so good to see you.""
""I would say the same to you, but sadly you're not dead."" 
""If you wanted me dead you could have killed me by now,"" I said confidently. ""Too bad your scared."" 

He was in my face now. Obviously I was intimidated but I'd never show. But I'm sure he already knew I was about to piss my pants. 

""I'd suggest that you watch your tone,"" he said menacingly, leaning in closely. ""You and I both know that I could give you an aneurysm with a snap of my fingers."" 

Which was a complete fact. Dave's mastery over the element of water was amazingly precise, to the point where he could effectively detox any form of life on the planet; he was a master healer. That power could reversed though, and Dave was no stranger to dishing out death in the most creative of ways. But I couldn't let that bother me now. Only way to make it out of here alive is to talk him down. 

""Dave you won't kill me here,"" I said, not even believing the words. ""You have too much of a flair for the dramatic. Not just that, if I was dead you would be bored. You and me, we're destined to fight forever. I'm fire and earth, you're water and air. We're complete opposites in every way except for one: our level of power."" Dave relaxed and put his hands on his cart. 

""Be that as it may, I will kill you someday,"" he said confidently. ""You're probably the only person in the world who can kill me and that is one loose end that I can't leave untied.""

I was in shock at this admission. ""I never thought I'd see the day that the all-powerful Dave Matthews would confess vulnerability to his arch nemesis. Sounds like your getting soft in your old age."" Dave rolled his eyes. 

""Don't get used to it,"" he said as he walked away. ""I'll be at the dam later, gonna strike it with lightning. You coming to stop it?""

I smiled at him, this time genuinely. ""You better believe it.""

I wouldn't even call it something so basic as standing, the way she remained perfectly still in the middle of the ballroom while captivating all the men who laid their eyes upon her was something that came effortlessly, even throughout the Academy. The way her Light Brown skin resonated in the dimly lit room made her shine in that ever so stereotypical red dress. She managed to pull off everything she owned, and everything had the perfect fit. She couldn't be more than 140 pounds, but don't let that fool you, she could kill a man without knowing he's in any real danger. Her cheeks and the bridge of her perfectly structured little nose were riddled with light brown freckles. She had eyes that were a mix between hazel and gold, whichever lighting she gave her presence to dictate the sparkle in those eyes.  Her hair was thick and grew outwards and curled, yet they were loose and bouncy and sat at a rest by her shoulders. They followed her movements with a delay, yet they never got in the way, never taking away from her captivating features. Her lips were a perfect shade of pink, she never really needed to wear any lipstick. But tonight she did, and it matched her dark red dress in the perfect shade. Any man lucky enough to hold a conversation with her, no matter how confident, always got choked up because of those eyes, and they were fixated right on me. 


I could see the dimple on her right cheek. She smirked all the way across the ballroom and it hit me like a truck. I was sweating through my shirt and blazer, but she couldn't tell just yet. Everyone was dressed so nicely for an Occasion I couldn't seem to recall, hopefully no one could see how nervous I was. Our eyes met yet again after I not so smoothly eyed her outfit, this made her chuckle and show off her perfect smile with teeth so white you could only assume she bleached them. 


She came closer, everything seemed to slowly fade out. The people and the music all seemed to be one gigantic blur.


Even closer. I could hear my heart racing. Why? I could only hear my thoughts. ""For the love of God get your shit together. It's not like you've never seen a woman befo-""


She stopped right in front of me while putting her right hand on my right shoulder. I could smell her shampoo since her hair was inches from my face. Of all the things to hook me, it was the smell of her hair? God I might as well be prepubescent. She wasn't directly in front of me, just a bit off centered. She took one look around the room before looking up at me with almost an innocence in her gaze and whispered,


""If you're going to kill me, you have 90 seconds before you die too"".


Before I could even react she placed a Rose in my front pocket and I could feel her hand slide off my shoulder as she disappear behind me. What. The. Fuck. She Knows? Wait, WHAT. She's going to kill me? I'm going to kill her? What the fuck is going on?!

My head was pounding harder than ever now. I couldn't think of anything to say. The pounding grew louder. All I could manage to choke out was a confused ""Isabelle..?"" as I turned around slowly and confused, unable to think because of this pounding. 

Just as I turned around the lights went dark. The pounding is right in my ears at this point. All I can do is try and scan the room. It was as if everyone in the room had left at once. So eerily quiet yet the pounding in my head kept me from noticing just how quiet it was. 

All I noticed was the double doors at the end of the room. There was a light behind them and I could hear a faint voice calling out a name. I investigated further. I slowly approached the doors as the banging had now stopped and I noticed how utterly terrified I was. 

Why couldn't I contain my emotions? I graduated second best in the entire academy. ""This is some freshman Bullshit"" my mind proclaimed. I finally gripped the door knob with my pathetically clammy hands when the pounding came back and was louder than ever. Only this time it was audible. It was right behind this door. As I backed off it burst open and the light was so blinding yet my mind could only manage to say ""Is this really how you go? You Fucking Idiot. Why didn't you just teleport to the other side? Or better Fucking yet, why not teleport to safety?"" 

My thoughts are interrupted by a voice, a familiar voice telling me to get up. I was so overcome with fear I couldn't move. I was weak. All those years at the Academy for this? Just so I could die sweaty in an uncomfortable tux I rented?

""Fuck. I know. Just shut up and let me think..""


I turn and give my attention to Will, my go to man ever since the Academy ended. We've seen just about everything considering we were paired up since freshman year day 1. He was always so punctual, methodical, and elaborate. I worked best on the fly, improvising my moves until I got a good sense of the situation. We worked well together, but now they we're graduates we had different views on how to go about our lives and separated for a while. If we ever needed anything we would just press the panic button on our watched, however this watch (which is what we personally designed ourselves) monitored our vitals and sent an automatic distress signal when our vitals were in danger of becoming fatal, signaling we needed assistance. We always bet at the end of the month to see who calls upon who more. Loser buys the first 5 rounds. Those nights are fun. Well for me at least. 


""Well..?"" 


""It's her."" 


""Are you sure?"" 


""Who else could it be? All the victims have roses in their front pockets."" 


Yep. I'm fucked. It's her I'm fucked. Of all fucking people. Her. Isabelle. Fuck.


""You knows she's somehow gotten better right?""


My mind is still fucked from the Whiskey.. ""Better?""


""She can 'Rewind' every 2 minutes now.""


I always hated her for that. She got through the Academy without lifting a finger because of those damn replays. At least that's what we called them. She could basically re-set herself to whatever time period she wanted and correct herself. That's how she finished every test. She always was the first one done. When I finally managed to grow the balls to talk to her about why she did so phenomenally well, she just said she turned in a test with all the wrong answers, got the test back with the correct answers, memorized them and reset her day and perfected it. Fucking Bullshit it what that was. Now the actual combat simulation is where one would think she was fucked. Yet somehow she always managed to find a weak spot in her enemies. She had originally been assigned a partner with the physical tests but requested to work alone. I guess factoring in another person working with her was too much for her. The most mind boggling thing of all is that nobody has ever seen her press the button. The button (which has a way of being an accessory to her attire in many different ways. For example, an earring, a watch, a belt buckle, you name it. Usually always hidden where only she could reach) set herself into a new time every time she set herself back. It was the right time. Where everything unfolded the way she wanted it to. Which is why we never saw her push the damn thing. Fucking creepy. She knew the events that were to unfold for that day. She could just go back and Replay the day. Or the week. Or the Year. No consequences. It was fucking terrifying. We were all just pawns in her game of ""Whoopsie Fucking Daisy, better rewind and avoid this whole mess."" It made most of us feel unreal. 


She turned away from the academy not too long after Graduation and manipulated things to her liking. She robbed banks, she killed countless cops, (sometimes without lifting a finger), and now she can fucking rewind every 120 seconds. There's not much a cop with a gun can do to someone who's already seen how a scenario will unfold possibly thousands of times with even more different variables each time. All her victims had roses in their front pockets or on in their hair as a signature of her work. Now the Academy wants me to personally take down the Valedictorian when they themselves can't even touch her. Great.  



I looked at Will in a playful manner like I always did before a big gig. He always took everything so seriously, I had a nice way of calming him down, which is why we were partnered up in the first place. 


""So.. How many times have I called you for help this month?""


He snapped out of his gaze and chuckled to himself. You could tell he was thinking about what would happen if I were to fail. How I couldn't fail. How I was the closest thing to stopping Isabelle that ever existed, and how I was a fucking drunk. 


""No way, Rick. You're buying the first 5 rounds this time. Hell, if you come out if this one still standing I'll buy them regardless, but I'm thinking realistically on this one. You're gonna need more than me to help with this one.""


He was right. I knew he was right. Thing is I burned a lot of bridges a long time ago. I'm surprised I have a friend/partner in the first place. I had 3 days to somehow find a way to kill someone who has already seen every method of approach I have. Sure, I can teleport so quickly and randomly that it may take her a little longer to to figure me out, but she can always rewind to the moment before I even get within a mile from her and take me out. 


I collected my thoughts and only had one question. Why was I alive? Right now, in this very moment. Why aren't I dead? If she already saw the event unfold, couldn't she just rewind to sometime where I was vulnerable and take me out herself? What the fuck. 


I teleported to the nearest open window and puked. Too much to think about. Am I a dead man? Is she saving that moment for herself when I approach her? This is just so fucking confusing I can't even think.

"[WP] An ancient evil has awoken, ready to cast the world into darkness as it did in eons past. It did not anticipate that modern advances are more than a match for it.",livious1,"In the dark his eyes opened. He had slept for a long time. The container he was in opened into darkness. It was once again time to cull the herd. Summoning one group of his minions, the same ones he used last time, fleas and ticks. He imbued them with another disease. Once the population fell he would come out and walk them again using his powers to turn them on one another. Superstition was a great tool.   
A day later he brought up a window showing him what was going on through the eyes of one of his infected and soon to be dead victims. The view was interesting; it seemed the rest of humanity had managed to harness electricity again, this time using it for light.   
In front of his view port a woman walked into view. She was wearing some sort of gown, blueish green in color. Holding something up in front of his viewing and he screamed. The light what was that thing they just attacked him with, did they know he was watching. He quickly shut that connection down. He blinked his tearful eyes as he saw spots from the sudden light.   
Bringing up the view from someone else infected he saw them turn their head and he could see inside some type of room. A man, walked up with what appeared to be a wet fabric of some kind. The view turned a little and he stopped she was looking through something as well. It showed a map of the world with arrows pointing out from. He looked a bit closer and they seemed to be expanding out from the area he was in now. There was some type of scribbles running across the view he was seeing from his infected human’s eyes.   
This was bad and annoying how they knew where it came from in only twenty four hours. He was immune to the virus, so maybe he should do some exploration and research into why his actions were already known. He got dressed in the primitive’s clothes he had collected from the last time he had left. He would grab some new ones while out from the dead, so he was ready for the next culling’s walk.   
He couldn’t believe it. They were far to advance for only six thousand years. They were using a bastardized version of the English language, so he was having problems following everything they were saying. But apparently his epidemic was already caught and they were in the process of wiping it out. It was just over fifty hours since he woke and they had already stopped his first attack on them. They did this without even realizing they were being attacked.   
He walked back to his lair; he had some other options that could work, to start the end for this civilization. He just needed to get it and set it up in a crowded location; he had seen one that would work, an area they called Essex. He strolled inside and started planning his next move.   
Well fuck he thought is frustration they were on him almost from the moment he set down the tool he needed to use to decimate the human population. He barely made it out alive. At first it was just a couple of their Bobbies chasing him, but after he killed one, they changed how they were reacting. The next thing he knew his barrier was hit by something. In the end he had to slink away using a dark tunnel system under the city. A dark, dirty, and nasty tunnel system under the city he corrected himself in his thoughts. The memory of when he created light and saw what was down there made him shudder in disgust.   
These humans were very similar to the humans he had last manipulated, but also very different. They looked at him with the same superstition, same paranoia that he had seen in his previous decimations of humanity. But it was more controlled. Instead of casting him out with the gods they most doubted believed in they chased him, but his device was set he activated the view of the tools he left behind and found a things near it. He made a request and the view slowly moved looking up as it moved away from its origin container and up one of the legs of a chair. He saw the thing roll up, like those automated carriages; it then reached out and started tearing apart what he left. The signal he was getting from it dying out.  
He couldn’t believe it another plan shot. He still had some other things to try. This was the furthest they had advanced since his first culling, since he willingly destroyed Atlantis because they were trying to destroy the world, with their global warming and other planetary devastation practices. He had killed them all just to save the planet and kept them ignorant of their own potential to keep the planet safe.   
His thoughts were disrupted as an explosion shook his lair, the warning lights sounded telling him his sanctuary was breached. As he ran for cover he felt something touch his back and then all he felt was pain as his muscles were bombarded with electricity, then his eyes closed and all he saw was darkness. Never actually seeing the British CT police enter the last remnant of Atlantian technology and culture.

"[WP] The true power behind the throne isn't the queen or the vizier. Instead, it's the royal pet.",mistaque,"Malik stepped out of the lavender scented bath and wrapped himself in an emerald silk robe. He slid on the matching slippers and strolled into the large bed chamber. A fresh platter awaited him at the table in front of the lavish bed. He sat in the intricately carved chair, poured himself some sweet wine, and picked at the stuffed dates and cured meats, without really tasting either. 

The signs of wealth were everywhere. Malik had been both flattered and dismayed to see the room when he first arrived. The fact that such a room would be given to a lowly economic diplomat spoke volumes about how wealthy the country was, and the stark contrast to his own struggling country deeply saddened him. He was visiting with the Vizier to discuss trade routes between the neighboring countries but the negotiations weren't going well. The truth was that his poor nation had little to offer, but he couldn't publicly admit that. Depression settled in as he contemplated what his failure here would mean for his King. 

*THUMP*

Malik froze, his heart beating in his chest as he slowly turned around to see what had made the noise. He was startled to see that a ball of black fur wearing a silver chain sat in front of him, licking a small paw with an even tinier pink tongue. 

""Oh hello there? I think I saw you earlier with Princess Kyla.""

The cat stopped cleaning himself and looked up at Malik. His body looked as if it were made solely from the black fluff that adorned him. His bright green eyes appeared to shine in the candlelight. He released a soft meow, which sounded like he were making a request. 

""Hmm, here you go."" Malik placed one of the meats on the ground before the cat and watched as it was first closely analyzed, and then very daintly consumed.

Malik never really had time for animals, but he had to admit that the royal pet was cute. He heard about the family's love for cats. Apparently they've always had one for each generation of rulers. The queen had gifted this one to Princess Kyla, her heir apparent. Though everyone knew the royal family were just figureheads, the elected Vizier had the real governing power. 

Malik sighed. The cat was watching him. 

""Should you even be in here? You must be able to go anywhere in the palace I suppose. But why here? This is a guest chamber and I'm not even an important guest!""

Malik couldn't have explained why he was talking to a cat but he that didn't stop him. He suddenly felt overwhelmed by the stress of the situation. 

""Really, I'm not. I'm failing here. We've nothing to offer your government in exchange for opening trade routes and our small exports of saltcod and pearls aren't enough consideration to convince them. But with our droughts we will have a dismal harvest season. If we can't import food supplies then I fear for our people this winter. We will be forced to beg, and  how will our neighbors see us then? The Marshes already raid our borders; if we appear weak, our northern towns will never be safe. This could end us.""

The words escaped him in a rush, but Malik felt better when he finished speaking. The cat responded with a second meow. He placed another piece of meat on the floor, wondering why he had just spilled state secrets to a cat. 

Malik drained his wine. When he looked down again the cat was gone. 

""Quiet little fellow."" He muttered. Sleep was overtaking him at an alarming rate. He wandered over to the bed and, barely conscious, collapsed into the heap of colorful down pillows.

The next morning, while Malik still slept off a haze of wine and enchantment, the Vizier sat in his study chamber high up in a tower, carefully drafting a trade agreement between his Queen and their proud neighbors. As it turns out, saltcod was going to be very much in fashion among the nobility in this upcoming ball season. It was the Queen's personal favorite dish after all. 

On the Vizier's windowsill sat a small black cat who purred in satisfaction as he watched the dawn approach over the distant mountains. ",writes2day
"[WP] The true power behind the throne isn't the queen or the vizier. Instead, it's the royal pet.",mistaque,"His hands were warm with the emperor's blood.  The body had become dead weight; he let it collapse to the floor.  His fellow conspirators formed a ragged circle around the emperor's corpse, but there was no celebration.  Their act was far too late to bring back their fathers and sons and brothers, or restore the honor of their womenfolk.  They could only take solace in having spared countless more from pain and suffering.

""Well done, stranger.""

The voice sounded in his head, though no sound had reached his ears.

""You've done much already, but come to me and we will achieve so much more!""

The mysterious words moved him; he left his surprised friends and, unsure of what led him onward, strode deeper into the palace.  

He soon found himself in the stables.  In the shadows, he could see two shining eyes approach, forming into a dark shape.  The emperor's steed, the tallest, mightiest, midnight-black stallion he had ever seen, stood before him.  Though the room was dead silent, the voice again echoed in his head.

""I've waited years for this day.  I thought I had found the hero that would be my peer, and such great things would we do together.  But I have no need to tell you what a weak, frightened, yet brutal coward he turned out to be.  I have not rode in battle for years - he had no need of a noble steed to murder and rape.  You, though, you have shown strength, bravery, and cunning.  Shall we ride together, stranger?""

As if he were watching someone else, he felt himself move toward the beautiful saddle hanging from the wall, its gold and gem inlays still shining through a heavy layer of dust.

""No!  I am no longer a slave to be harnessed and led.  You have my word, we will be as one.  And together, no one will stand before us.""

He mounted the black stallion and, heedless of the cries of his friends or the shouts of the guards, they crashed through the stable doors and palace gates, and out into the waking countryside.",h0bbb3s
"[WP] The true power behind the throne isn't the queen or the vizier. Instead, it's the royal pet.",mistaque,"#Zanzibar and the Fluffy Fluff Fluffles


Zanzibar was confused. As a regular warmongering dictator he believed he had seen everything imaginable on the battlefields. He had seen fearsome hosts hundreds of thousands of men strong. He had seen ragged bands of mountain thieves, shabby looking but ferocious as wild beasts. He had seen brave men, proud men, men who knew they were going to die but came out to fight anyway. And he had bested them all. But he had never seen this. 


Walking towards him was the imperial retinue surrounded by a paltry number of city guards. What kind of country sends the royal family to the frontlines of a battleground? And they were only accompanied by city guards. *City guards* for Christ’s sake. Not even trained military, but the riff raff that break up everyday conflicts among the common folk. He could crush them now if he wished. Only curiosity stayed his hand.


The party stopped a few miles short of the enemy lines and started assembling some contraption. The contraption seemed to be a trebuchet of some sort but it didn’t look dangerous. For one, it was too small to harm even a single human. For another Zanzibar couldn’t see any ammunition lying around save for a cat basket one of the servants was carrying. 


He squinted and perked up his ears trying to get more information on what it was that they were plotting. Of course he couldn’t hear the conversation the Queen was having, and if he did he would have been even more confused, but it went a little something like this:


“Grand Vizier, did you remember to not feed Fluffles today?” the Queen looked sternly at her loyal subject


“Yes your majesty.” 


“Good. And did you pull Fluffles’ tail and sing in his ear?”


“Yes your majesty.”


“Good.”


At length Zanzibar saw the Queen placing a white cat into the cat basket. *Women.* The cat was an ugly thing. All snub nose and piggy eyes shrouded by a ball of the most atrociously fluffy fluff fur he had ever seen. 


“Sir, should we ride them down?” the captain of the cavalry asked. 


Zanzibar waved his hand dismissively. Now he was really intrigued. 


Something came flying at Zanzibar through the sky. Immediately his guards took up their shields and gathered around him in a defensive position. He heard a piteous yowl and some cursing as the missile landed. It was the cat. They had lobbed an ugly cat at him. 


Zanzibar decided he had had enough of this farce. He gave the signal to march forwards. 


Suddenly the earth began to quake. The sky darkened. A supersonic cosmic blast shot out from the cat and leveled everything in sight. 


Where Zanzibar’s army had once stood now there was only dust. The cat alone remained. The Queen walked towards the cat. “Come on Fluffles, you’re going to get sashimi today!” she said in a sing song voice as she picked him up and headed back. The cat purred. Why yes he was Fluffles. *The* Fluffles. ",robynhood8993

A none existent sun blaze from on high; it's eternal eye unflinching as it tormented all it surveyed. I look around me to find out exactly where i was. behind me stood a flat barren white expanse, infinite in all directions. It assaulted my eyes with endlessness, It's sheer size threaten my mind with madness.  

I step back and rip myself away from the unfathomable plain and turn to see a sight that was completely alien to what lied behind me. Hills covered with lush green grass that was still wet with morning due, seem to go on forever. I walk froward on to the grassland and over the hills and when i reach the top of one hills, i was greeted with the most amazing, confusing sight. A waterfall that send it's precious fluid crashing below me. that water feed into rivers that criss cross the most beautiful, vibrant jungle in all of creation.

i was in awed by it's Majesty then a familiar and comforting sound of children at play caught my attention and joy shot through me and then i was truly captivated by what they dance upon. A fucking dinosaur. A honest to god fucking dinosaur. now that i look, the place was filed with all kinds of the behemoths and intersperse among them were people. Man and beast where utter at peace. 

I made my way down to meet a group of people that were lounging around a watering hole. the people turn there head lazy around towards me and froze. All turn towards  my presence. the children coward behind parents and massive beast. the creatures  roared and mock charged over and over again. daring me to take another step. the adults just stead at me eyes widen in fear. i look behind me to if there was some massive predator that some how made it way behind me but there was noting. i turn back to look at the gawking crowed. ""what wrong?"" i said. 

""you don't belong here"" shouted a women in the back of the crowed.
 
""why?"" i pleaded. i step forward and they as one step back. children cried in fear, men shouted in anger and the dinosaurs roared there disdain. then the sky exploded with a unearthly blast. i fell to knees in pain and tried to cover my ears in vain. i gnash my teeth to gather to try and get through the pain. as i stood people began to panic run in all directions. i walk towards a women who was to in shock to move. as i walk forward she began to scream for help. i stretch my hands out in a pleading manner. the flash of my arm was lick by white flame that came from above i pulled my arm back in pain. i fell unto my back writhing in agony. from the sky descended a man wrap in what seem like ever shifting robes. he land with not even a sound and stood in between me and the women. 

""How and why are you here foul creature"" He spoke with Authority that i know that went unquestioned for a millennia. 

""what i woke up here"" i said as i stood up on knee. 
""you lie. no damed soul may enter here""

I got up holding my arm to my side and look right at him"" i am not lying man"" 
""you are, and i am no man sorcerer"" 
""what?"" i shouted ""i'm no dam sorcerer"" 
""then what are you? hmm. a miss judge soul. ha"" he laughed mocking. 
"" i don't know what you are talking about, wait am i dead"" the the question finally dawning on me. you think the half naked people, the fucking dinosaurs and the angel dick would of tip me off a long time ago but nope. 

I walk towards  the what is now a hovering man, angel? yes angel. he eyes glowed a brilliant blue light. ""kneel mortal"" he commanded 
""no i just got off the goddam ground."" i shouted back. 
""why are you not compelled"" he ask more to him self then to me.
""I don't know"" that was a mistake. 

""i know"" he said to himself like he figured it all out."" you are a stain. one of my disgrace brothers or sisters pets. i know all about your kind. his robes melted away to reveal breastplate and other brilliant pieces of ornate armor and in his hand materialize a sword wrapped flames. ""Die foul abomination!"" i doge his fist stroke and i began ran. i made it over the hill but i trip rolled down right as the Furious angel flew in to cut me clean in half. i got up and ran to the white expense. right as made a few feet in to the infinite plain, he landed right in front of me, sword out stretch ""fight me stain"" he challenge. 
""no! i don't what to."" i shouted.

""then die"" he came at me again. i rolled more or less to the side. to be honest it was more like flail about and whimper to the side, then anything else but it was enough to Escape his attack and run further in to barren land. i look back to see if i was being follow i turn to see the angel begin to float barely off the ground and flew towards me with unimaginable speed. i flinch anticipation of the blow, but it never came. he just stood there, looking behind me. ""i knew it"" he spat. he then shot up like a Rocket and flew to land that i will soon find out was a Paradise not quite configured to humans just yet. i herd the sound of distant Thunder. i turn in horror to see a wave, no a tsunami of darkness barreling towards me. it sounded like a raging storm with no lighting. i was frighten to say the less, but i knew there coming for me was my damnation and salvation.

""Yes, we serve an entire array of sentient creatures here at the 9 Circles Exotic Resort at Hell. Any creature that is smart enough to think critically has a soul and is therefore judged by God. So we have devices specifically for dolphins, octopi, dinosaurs-""

""Wait Dinosaurs were sentient?""

""Oh yes dinosaurs were actually sentient. Had primitive civilizations too. Very peaceful creatures. Similar philosophies to the Native Americans actually. But none of the men were circumcised so they all went to hell.""

""It's ok. Anyway, the main point I was making was that hell has a diverse array of creatures. Dinosaurs being the biggest occupants. Many devices were built for them. But then life evolved and as we tried to grow with it, turns out this land has very strict zoning laws and it's hard to expand. Since we also keep all our torture chambers for eternity we constantly have to keep repairing them while trying to add new chambers for new creatures.

"[WP] A man makes a time machine so he could go back and cheat on his wife with the past version of her, back before she slowly grew bitter because he spent too much time making his time machine.",mistaque,"""But why!?"" Thomas begged. The abomination smiled at him with a sinister hunger. 

*Oh god, where did I go wrong?* Thomas lamented. It was all wrong, everything. His time machine sat behind him, shattered into a million pieces of tarnished brass. Around him the monsters crawled about in the shadows. Just out of sight, their terrible claws scratched over the rocky walls of the cavern. A horrid low hissing reverberated from their serpentine mouths. Just in front of Thomas their king, or something similar, stood above him victorious. Bathed in a lone beam of light that leaked through a hole in the cavern the monstrosity relished in his victory. 

How had things gotten so bad? Thomas thought back over his actions. 

He had started his project long ago with the most noble of intentions. To build a machine that could bend time and travel between when and where at his will. He'd done so of course for less than noble reasons. Thomas wished of course to cheat on his wife. Not with some ancient Latin hussy mind you, or even Cleopatra herself, but instead to sleep with a younger version of his wife. Before she'd grown fat and bitter with age.

Of course, Thomas had to admit she only grew fat and bitter because he obsessed himself with building a time machine.

Why had he built the machine again? Oh right, to sleep with a younger, more attractive version of his wife. He had to remember that. It was with the noblest of intentions; however, somewhere along the way something had gone terribly wrong. First the world had ended and then he was cast thousands of years into the future where these abominations ruled the under-Earth. 

Had he been responsible for that? No... Impossible, that was bound to happen regardless. 

""Why?"" He screamed again at the monster. ""Why did my machine not work!?"" 

The abomination smiled, revealing a row of pointed white-teeth. ""Becaussse."" It began hissing. ""You made the same mistake assss that movie.""

""Movie?"" Thomas asked cocking his head sideways.

""Yesss."" Replied the beast. ""The Time Traveller released in 2002. It stared Guy Pierce. It wasss terrible. Rotten Tomatoes gave it a 29 percccent.""

""What!? Who??"" 

""Guy Pierce... He wasss in Momento."" The beast seemed irritated that Thomas did not understand. He spoke in such strange riddles and words. Who was this man and what was a movie?

""Please!"" Thomas begged, ""Give me my answer so I may die knowing my final mistake.""

""NO!"" The monster bellowed. ""You shall not be permitted to die..."" Thomas gasped. ""... Until you watch this movie I sssspeak of."" 

Thomas looked on confused as the king-monster beckoned several thralls to bring him objects. First they arrived with a large black rectangle and a small box. Then another brought forth a silver disk, which was inserted in the box. Thomas jumped startled as the flat rectangle lit up, displaying words of warning. 

*FBI COPYRIGHT LAW* 

It read, but soon that faded to black and the picture show began.

""Popcorn?"" The monster-King offered. It was sitting next to Thomas now. It's slimy skin reflected the full light from the rectangle. It was utterly repugnant, but interested in this turn of events Thomas politely accepted the popped-corn snack. In one clawed had the monster held a device. He pointed the device at the glowing rectangle and pressed a button. The pictures began to move on the screen and the movie began.

Three bowls of the buttery snack later, Thomas watched the credits roll on the movie. His mouth hung agape in shock. 

""My god..."" He said flummoxed, ""That was awful!"" 

""Told you."" The monster snarled. 

Thomas rubbed his eyes, allowing them to adjust to the seedy dark as the rectangle was carted away by deformed thralls.

Thomas said, ""So, if I'm understanding this *movie* correctly, the reason my time machine won't allow me to go back and have sex with my younger, hotter wife is because I built it with the intention of doing so? That somehow prevents me from changing the past?""

The monster explained, ""You built your time machine because of your wife's ssssize and bitternessss. If she had never become so fat, it would never have exisssted. So how could you use your machine to go back in time and ssscrew her? You are the inessscapable result of your tragedy, just as I am the inessscapable result of you.""

""Fuck..."" Thomas said in disbelief. ""That is... just like the movie."" 

""Right? Really though that just sssounds like a weak plot device to introduce monstersss, but hey, who am I to complain."" 

""So I'll never be able to sleep with my wife as her younger, hotter self.""

""No, but you have a time machine! Go ssscrew Cleopatra, the Virgin Mary, hell, go sssleep with Hillary Clinton."" 

""Who?"" Thomas asked not recognizing that last one.

The abomination sighed. ""Never mind... You have your answer Thomas. Now go."" He gestured towards the time machine. 

Thomas looked back surprised. The once shattered machine was repaired! The thralls must have repaired it during the movie. He was saved! 

But it was all for naught in the end. As the machine whirred back to life, Thomas set the dial for 1882. He sighed sorrowfully as the machine slipped into the space between time. For he alone knew what waited for him upon his arrival back home.

Thomas sighed again, *Well I guess I could try to put a paper bag over her head.*",Schneid13

machine this year. Apparently it worked, because, well… look at all of you.""

""But… but what are you all doing here!?""

A forty-six year old Carl stepped up. ""Well, I'm here because *you* came here trying to run away with twenty-two 
year old Tina. Twenty sixteen Tina got pissed off and kicked you out. A year later you decided to come here and try again with twenty two year old Tina, not committing adultery this time. That's me.""

""That…. That doesn't make sense! Why would you come if you knew *I* was coming already?""

""Well, I knew what time *you'd* be coming, since it's the time I came last year. All I had to do was come before you, right? Why do you think I was here first?""

Carl started at older Carl at a loss for words. An older Tina stepped up. ""And that's why *I* came,"" she said.

""What!?""

""I'm twenty eighteen Tina,"" she said. ""When I heard that twenty seventeen Carl had traveled back in time and *married* my twenty two year old version, I knew I had to come and stop it.""

""So… so you two get married?"" Carl asked, looking from twenty seventeen Carl to twenty-two year old Tina.

""Well, we get married next year,"" Twenty Seventeen said. On cue, the dorm room came open and a thirty something Carl got in. ""Don't marry her!""

""Who are *you*!?""

Two thousand and thirty Carl! I married twenty two year old Tina and she divorced me for my money two years 
later!""

A twenty four year old Tina who was just sitting by the bed in expensive clothes smoking a cigarette cleared her 
throat. ""That's true, I did.""

""No! Don't listen to them! Marry her, Twenty Seventeen!""

""Who said that!?""

A thirty something year old Tina stepped up. ""You do get divorced, but I feel bad about it and, after a series of 
failed relationships, I come back to you and we patch things up. We stay together forever! That's why *I* came back! Because I knew old Carl would come and try to stop the marriage because of the divorce.""

Twenty Seventeen Carl turned to a very old lady sitting by the TV. ""Is that true?""

""It is. We do stay together forever.""

""But wait…."" Carl said, looking from one person to the other in the room. ""If Twenty Seventeen married twenty two 
year old Tina, and if she later became this old lady, how old would he be when –""

""Yeap, he's been dead for a while,"" the old lady said. ""Still. It was a happy marriage.""

""I'm not dead, I'm here!"" Twenty Seventeen protested.

""Well, you are now, because that Tina is trying to stop you from marrying the twenty two here.""

""So if I marry her I die!?""

""No, you idiot! You get divorced, she takes all your money, then she marries you again and you guys live happily ever after and you die of old age!""

""Well, not anymore, because look at all the people here interfering with the fabric of --""

""All right, stop!"" Carl looked around the room from Carl to Carl to Tina to Tina. ""I don't have a fucking clue what's 
happening here anymore!""

No one said anything. By the window, rich Tina lit another cigarette. Carl continued: ""All I wanted was to patch things up with my wife! But I see it now – I have to fight for the real Tina! Not go back in time and find a new one. I have to work on my marriage. I don't know how yet. Fuck, maybe spice things up in bed. Whatever. God knows we need it.""

Carls and Tinas nodded knowingly around the room. Carl turned around himself, looking from face to face. ""All 
right, then… I'll try that. I'm going back now and I'm going to work out my issues with *my* Tina. No more playing around with time travel! Now..."" Carl stopped, thoughtful. ""What do you guys think would be a cool thing to propose to her,  sexually?""

Right then, the dorm room came open in a sudden bang, and a forty-five year old Carl and his Tina counterpart stepped in, giggling like teenagers. ""Is this where the space-time orgy is happening?""

A nipple crested above the ""neckline"" of her top (it was so far down, it could've been called a 'waistline').

Had she always been like this?

""Ah, sure thing, uhm, sugar.""

""No, no. Don' call me shur-gur. Shug. Don't call me Sugarrrr. Tha's what *he* used to call me.""

""Oh,"" he said. Playing up the part of 'mystery stranger,' he added, ""Who's he, then?""

""Ohmigodshhh, *listen,*"" her voice was hoarser than he remembered, and it was starting to grate on his ears, ""My *Husband.* My dumb, shtupid *Husband.* Doesn't know what he'sh *got*"" she jabbed a finger to his chest, and for a moment he thought maybe, just maybe she *knew* who he was.

""He thinks he's *so* smart, building his 'Time Machine'?"" she used her fingers to make quotation marks in the air, and nearly fell off her bar stool. He reached out and caught her.

""Whoaaa,"" she laughed, her hair falling all over him, ""That was *fun*. Mmmm, your hands feel *good*, you know that, Mister?"" 

The way she said it made him want to do *anything* but touch her, but he didn't want her to fall again. Not before she answered his question, ""Go back. You were saying something about a secret...?""

""Yes,"" she threw back her head and forced a fat, guffawing laugh up at the ceiling, ""Yessss, a shecret. Shhh don't tell him,"" her fingers hooked on the waist of his pants, and with a whisper as loud as a dump truck, she said, ""We can't ever let my husband find out...""

Her head lolled, and came to a rest on his shoulder.

""Find out *what?*""

Cold lips found his neck, and she began to kiss up his jawline. It felt *good*. But at the same time, it was the worst feeling he'd ever had - after all, she didn't know that *he* was her husband. 

She walked her lips up to his ear, and in a voice too drunk to be seductive she said, ""This isn't going to be the first time I've cheated on him.""

He stepped back, propping her up by putting his hands on her shoulders.

""Are you telling me the truth?""

""I would *never* lie,"" she winked. Well, it wasn't a wink, so much as a drunkenly exaggerated blink. 

That was when he realized his mistake. No amount of time travel would ever save this marriage. 

""Spends all his time on that shtupid mash- mashhh- stupid time thing 'cuz he's an *idiot*. That's why I need all these *real* men to take care of me,"" she gestured at the dinghy bar. A few onlookers were leering at her, licking their lips.

There was nothing he could say to her that would make her hurt half as much as he did. So, instead, he took a photograph out of his pocket, and slid it into her bra (""Ooo,"" she purred sloppily, ""I like that,"").

When she woke up the next morning, she would find herself with a bad hangover, and a mysterious picture of her sad, desperate future. 

As for him? He'd be twenty years away, trying to save himself.

"[WP] A man makes a time machine so he could go back and cheat on his wife with the past version of her, back before she slowly grew bitter because he spent too much time making his time machine.",mistaque,"It had been almost a month since he finished the machine. I remember the day he finished because it was the only day in years he was in time for dinner, a stupid grin on his face and clothes singed and grease covered. I've never seen him happier.

I think he feels as if I forgot about the project. When he first started trying to build a Time Machine- of all things- I was skeptical but tried to share in his excitement. It soon became everything, all he ever talked about. The news it would make. The money it would bring. The possibilities.

Our marriage became strained. I loved his passion, it was the same he once had for me, but it consumed him. He stayed up late and then eventually stopped sleeping. He didn't come to dinner. He didn't ask me about my day.

So I grew bitter. Resentful.

I tried asking him at first to spend less time working on his contraption, but it was no use. Then I started to snap at him. I made snide remarks. Eventually we took to yelling, until we stopped talking at all. We grew apart. He moved his project to a hidden room and practically lived there. I went about my days as if he no longer existed, trying to ignore the pain of the wedge driving us apart.

We became less than roommates. It was horrid.

I wanted to fix things but I couldn't face being a second place wife to a thing without feelings, without a soul. I tried to pretend he didn't exsist, but I couldn't forget the silent husband moving somewhere in my house. Despite my best efforts not to, I eventually learned more about his plan.

Things went missing. Our wedding picture, first. I thought he was trying to prove something then. To make a point that things were really over, that he could never love me again. 

Next went some of my favorite flowers from the garden. I spent many days cultivating them. It gave me a way out of the house and out of the madness. Of course I would notice some missing.

I found dishes in the sink coated with blackberries. I got a little hopeful, then. Maybe he spent his nights bottling my favorite jam so that he could return to me- perhaps with tail between legs- and tell me what a mistake this whole endeavor was. It would be a start to mending our broken marriage.

But he never emerged from hiding. Not with open hands, not with flowers or jam. Not at all.

The day he finished his creation he showed up at the table. He had a full beard and a glint in his eyes. He looked unruly, almost like a madman. And happy. He tried to make a bit of small talk, but when I refused to cooperate he just laughed and told me it was no matter. He took his plate, not bothering me to thank me for the food upon it, and left.

I thought he would disappear the next night. It wouldn't make much of a difference, but I think I would miss the subtle noises beneath my feet. The creaks of the house as he moved where I could not see.

Instead, the noises continued and so did the strange occurrences. My favorite record, gone. The next night I found a receipt for the cologne he wore on our wedding day. And the night after that his shoe polish was on the end table.
I recognized then that he wasn't reconciling, he was planning.

A month after he finished the machine, I followed him. I was quiet, careful, but I don't think it mattered. We made our way to the under room, his steps heavy and I his shadow. I finally saw his machine for the first time then- a large metal egg with heavy wires feeding directly into the fuse box.

I watched as he gathered some of my favorite things and placed them with care into a luggage bag. He hummed as he moved, working as if he could not work quick enough. When the last of the mementos was stashed away, he pressed a button on the outside of the orb. With a hiss the doors slid open.

""Well, Mary, are you ready for me?"" He asked himself. I shuddered at the mention of my name, suddenly realizing what his intentions were.

He gave one final look over what he thought was the empty room and then stepped inside, the doors hissing shut behind him.

I could hear the cracks of electricity and the whirl of power springing to life. I moved quickly, faster than I ever have, to the fuse box. After all this time, maybe a part of me wanted to fix us, but not like this. Never like this.

With just a moment's hesitation to pray to whatever God there may be that I wouldn't be killed, I grabbed the collection of wires and yanked them out by force. The machine went quiet and a cold silence filled the room.

I stood still and listened to my heartbeat fill my ears. Thud thum. Thud thum. 

Then, suddenly, the doors began to move again. I clutched my chest, my feet frozen to the floor. Curiously, I turned my gaze inside the metal monster, anxious at what may await my sight.

When my eyes met the inside of the orb, I gasped. For what I saw inside was...nothing.",cotyart

""Hey idiot,"" she snarled, ""You do realize that I know about your little time machine?""

He froze, realizing that he couldn't continue the lie about the bowling league anymore.

""Yeah, well, it works..."" she continued, ""as I'm fucking the older version of you while you're away building the time machine. So I'm not actually bitter because you spent too much time making your machine, I'm bitter about how stupid you are to think I wouldn't find out.""

"[WP] A man makes a time machine so he could go back and cheat on his wife with the past version of her, back before she slowly grew bitter because he spent too much time making his time machine.",mistaque,"It took 25 years of my life but I had done the unthinkable. I had created a vessel that allowed a single person to travel through time.  To be more precise, a person could travel back in time but not forward. It was a one way ticket.

For years I had toiled trying to breathe reality into my college hypothesis. My friends first laughed at my persuit and then, eventually, abandoned me to my obsession. But Ruth, darling Ruth! She had stood by me even as the grants ceased and we were forced to sell our home. Oh how I had loved her!

So you will understand that the day when even my darling Ruth abandoned me, my very soul had been crushed.

I had been on the verge of a tremendous breakthrough when I found my wife packing her suitcase. She said she would not spend the remaining years of her life as lonely as she had been for the previous twenty five. She said obsession had driven me insane. Hah!

The reality was that she had grown bitter, tired of (in her mind) playing second fiddle to my workshop. She had forgotten the purpose of my great work.

As she left to stay with her sister, I considered whether the  price of my persuit was too high. You see, I had once loved Ruth more than anything. But time had changed her. 

Perhaps time could *unchange* her?

A plan formed in my mind and I redoubled my efforts.

It was only five short years later that my time machine had been completed. I would not tell Ruth or try to win her back, for she was the Ruth I loved no longer. Instead I would travel back 26 years and be with the Ruth I had loved the most - when her mind had been *pure*.

--------

What a fool I have been! She does not love me. She thinks me old and crazed. I believe she *pitied* me. 

Oh to go back, to go back! And yet, I can not. Not for 26 years, at least. Was I wrong all this time? Had she been right, was *I* truly insane?

I must win her... I just need time. Time... Time...

But I do not have long! If I do not act soon *he* will meet her, *he* will win her. I have already seen it!

God forgive me but I must kill *him*. Then I will at least have the time I need to make her love me again...",nickofnight

No such luck. He tucked his legs into his body, wrapping his arms around his knees in a fetal pose. The cold tiles sent shivers through his bowels. Harsh fluorescent lights pierced his eyelids as Lars forced them open, revealing the familiar kitchen scene.

He didn't see her. *It's for the best*, Lars thought, *I'm not ready*. His bladder felt about to burst, though the pressure was less than his desire to lay still. He shifted uncomfortably. *I wonder if this is the last time*. Lars heard the familiar patter of bare feet on carpet and braced himself. She was here.

""Lars! My god!"" she shouted, rushing to his side and kneeling next to his head. ""What happened? Are you okay?"" He forced himself to tilt his head and meet her gaze. His eyes were watering and his cheeks were soaked. *When had that happened?* ""I couldn't find you,"" he cried softly.

Had it been weeks? Months? Certainly not years, though Lars could not be certain. Every time he found himself laying in the same kitchen. Every time she had walked in. Every time it was not her.

It was Jillian, to be sure, but not the Jillian he had fallen so deeply for so long ago. It was always a version of her corrupted by his own sin and vice. Her impossibly wide, emerald green eyes glowing with unchecked optimism and joy; the ear to ear grin that refused to admit anything but the best in people; the way she simply *was*, just by standing in the same room, the saving grace to whatever demon hounded you. This is how she was, before she became his.

Lars only needed that first week after they had moved in together. He remembered coming home on that frosty January night, his breath reeking of liquor and coat soaked in slush and perfume. He could see her when she first saw him, smelled him, took him in. Her eyes had been just slightly less bright, her glow just a bit less radiant. It had been the beginning of the end, and he had not pulled the brake until there was nothing left.

He would find her again, and he would do right by her.",MavisMudslide
"[WP] A man makes a time machine so he could go back and cheat on his wife with the past version of her, back before she slowly grew bitter because he spent too much time making his time machine.",mistaque,"The only way back was forward.

It had been so long since Susan had even spoken to Carl, much less touched him. She used to bring him meals in the basement while he was working. A couple of years later, she would just let the pizza guy bring the pies down directly. Now, she wouldn’t care if he died.

He spent nearly all his time down there. Alone. Right now he was looking at papers from the bank.

Things got bad after the grant money ran out and she had to bear the weight of all the bills. His plan, well, his plan hadn’t worked yet. He knew the exact day it went past the point.

An April morning, and he was drinking coffee from his own pot in the workshop while he stared at the bank statement. He cringed at the sound of the door slamming upstairs. He would have to tell her.

“Susan?” He said as he ran up the stairs.

“Hi, honey.” She dropped her purse on the table and slumped into the chair.

“How was your night?”

“My feet hurt; I don’t want to talk about it.”

“OK, “Carl sat at the table, quietly, giving her time to vent.

“They know that waitresses work for tips right? I mean its common fucking knowledge, right?”

“Yeah, I think so, honey.”

“Oh, my feet. When is that thing going to get done? I can’t do this much longer. My feet, my back.”

Carl couldn’t bear to look at her eyes. He just sat there with the limp paper in his hand. He couldn’t tell her about the money.

“What? You have that look. What is it?”

“I, uh, I…”

“I’m tired, Carl.”

“The money. The grant money. There was a lawsuit.”

“What’s wrong with the money?”

“Well, the foundation got sued, and it seems that the money was their assets, and there was a judgement…”

Carl tried to explain how the money from the grant that was to support his work, was gone. It had been enough back when he worked to support the research, but when he lost tenure, Susan had to go to work to cover the household budget. And now the rest was gone, and Susan’s work was not going to pay the bills to keep his research moving forward. 

“So the time machine is over? Done?”

“Well, until I can find more funding. Yeah.”

Susan started to cry. Carl got up to comfort her, but she slapped his hand away.

“You son of a bitch. You got your degree and I stayed home with the kids. You got your grant and I made PB&amp;J sandwiches and nursed. You lose tenure and I work as a waitress because I gave up my fucking chance to learn any skills because you said it would work!”

“Susan...”

“And now, now it’s just gone! Nothing?”

“Well, until I find funding.”

“What funding, Carl? After all this? What funding?”

She kicked her chair back and stomped out of the room just to return and shout, “Is there an unemployed crackpot foundation? Godammit!”

He slept in the basement that night, and had for a while.

He mortgaged the house, and now that money was gone, and so was Susan.

He knew now how it worked, and with just a few thousand dollars more he could have a working device, and test it with a trip back, back before it went bad, and fix things. Susan would love him again. He would have his life. He couldn’t stop now or he would lose everything forever. He had sold his car, and all his tools but those he needed.

The only way forward was back.

[EU] The Men In Black deal with their most public illegal alien yet. That alien's name? Ted Cruz,pfire777,"""You don't understand, R"" Says S, ""we HAVE to get him elected as the president.""

""I understand two things S. ONE, that is the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard you say and trust me, your suggestion to ""sacrifice yourself"" by sleeping with the Horcrutian Queen was the top of my list before this. Just so you know how high a bar this has to meet. You want to put a Raflarn male, exiled from his own planet because all of his mistresses THERE voted him off their home world, into the OVAL OFFICE?"" Agent S opened his mouth, but paused as R raised his hand, ""No. Shut up. TWO, its IMPOSSIBLE! He is so far behind that it just isn't going to happen. Even if he got the nomination, he still won't win the race. That's what I understand. What I DON'T understand is why. Why would you even think this is a good idea?"" 

""Because, dummy...the entire world watches the inaugural speech. We could spend the next decade going around every town he visited in his campaign wiping all traces of Ted Cruz from public memory OR we could do it all at once and be done with it."" S pointed a grubby finger up at the taller R's scowling face. ""Don't give me that look, hear me out. We go to Trump and offer him some ridiculous amount of money to quit the nomination race. Have him say hes disgusted with the party or something. Then Ted is IN. Then we go to Hillary and do the same, but we just give her the money under some Super PAC or something.""

""Wait wait wait...we don't HAVE that kind of money S.""

""Its your turn to shut up, just let me finish...Jesus. We don't NEED the money. We just make it LOOK like we are getting it for Trump. He gets taken care of later. As for Hillary, the money will never make it to her and she will be too busy handling the bad PR of even TAKING it in the first place to handle when it never shows up. Anyways, that's small beans. We get Ted to WIN. Then when he is giving his inaugural speech, BAM, there we are, wiping the world of Ted Cruz all at once...then we just sneak Trump on stage and convince everyone he won it all fair and square. That's it, no more Raflarn filth on our planet.""

A heavy, resigned sigh came from R. ""This will never work. You know your plan will never get approved. And its stupid anyways.""

""It will work and you know it. My plans ALWAYS work. Right?""

""...maybe.""

""See, even my valiant self sacrificing seduction of Queen Heraladina saved the moon from destruction. Crazy plan or not, it still worked.""

""...maybe, but I still think you just have a thing for tentacles. I still don't see how you are going to get Zed on board with this""

""That's the EASY part R. Zed is a Trump supporter, if we frame it as a plan to REALLY make HIM the president, he'll let us get Ted up there for a minute or two.""

""Ugh...fine, lets do it.""

[WP] Um... Well... You see... I may have accidentally destroyed the entire planet.,tehweave,"To this deed I must confess,

I have indeed made a mess.

It started with a simple plan

to fill the hole that ate my land.

&amp;nbsp;

The sink hole took my farm and sheep.

I hear their bleating in my sleep.

So I built a pump out to the sea,

thoughts of a pool all for me. 

&amp;nbsp;

But the hole was deeper than it looked.

With the heat of the Earth, the water cooked.

Now the sea level is quickly dropping,

and the steam I see no way of stopping.

&amp;nbsp;

Although Australia can walk to Thailand,

I should have thought of this beforehand.

I guess I made an impressive sauna.

The worlds more hot boxed than marijuana.

Well I’ve gone and wrecked the world

so time to panic boys and girls.

I suggest we flee this Earth, 

Mars can be our place of birth.

“I did not mean it,” Thor said. “I was simply chasing a dragon across the vast lands of space. This dragon had been created in the dark mountains in the crevices between the worlds, and would have destroyed much of the world. We battled for many moons, fire and metal striking against each other in a horrible plight. Lo, you would haver heard it from your home in Asgard, if sound traveled through space. In the battle, one thing led to another, and well, a planet was a casualty.”

“Just a casualty? This planet is the world of man! And it's falling apart!” Sif said.

In front of her, the pieces of the planet were drifting off into space. From her perch in Midgard, she could see the confused expression of men in white suits watching the Earth slowly fall apart in front of them.

“My bad?” said Thor, stroking his red beard.

All the time that the Norse gods had spent trying to stay secret had just been destroyed by the drunken bender of her husband. Sif honestly did not want to know what Odin would say about this.

Suddenly, Sif heard a loud roar from the direction of Earth. What she saw made her mouth drop.

A dragon was swooping over Earth. The men in white suits were frantically floating away while the dragon happily ate the ship floating over space.

“You know, I think maybe my hammer missed the dragon,” said Thor. “I will admit that this is not my proudest moment.”

It was days like this that made Sif wish Ragnarok would come sooner.

"[WP] You've been slowly turning into a monster for a while now. You've been thinking that you have your hunger under control, but now you're not so sure.",wille179,"Early morning light pierced the thin, wispy mist as it curled through the branches and tree trunks of the secluded woodland. Spring had officially arrived, yet the weather had not quite agreed with this and opted to remain colder than normal for the time of year. Not that Charlie minded, he preferred the still lifeless wilderness. Spring brought life tumbling into his reality, with noise echoing through the air and deep colours sprouting from every percievable place in the world, attacking and overloading his senses.

Charlie did not enjoy much, but he did enjoy being *alone*. Ever since he was a child he had remained a loner, staying at the back of the classroom, working in the night. His routine fell into place nearly three decades ago and had remained a sturdy pillar of sanity he could cling to throughout. That was until yesterday.

Yesterday, Charlie had been fired.

You see, Charlie had his routine, and his dislike of company, but he had something else, too. Charlie had an itch. A Dark Man inside him that whispered to him every waking hour. His Dark Man would tell him to do Dark Things, would question Charlies decisions or motive. Often, he would be useful, providing insight into situations Charlie found difficult. Often, Charlie would let the Dark Man take brief control when he had to deal with people. Working night security, this didn't happen often, and only once had it resulted in violence, though the would-be thief had attacked first. Charlie had enjoyed watching as his Dark Man turned his fists into weapons, drawing blood as he struck him on the side of the head.

The sight of crimson had flipped a switch inside Charlie (or perhaps had unlocked the door to the Dark Man, he was unsure) and it had become more difficult recently to keep his other self contained. He had begun to play with rats first, innocently. The warhouse he had guarded for the last thiry two years had always had a rat problem. Part of Charlies duties was to set and clear rat traps, which he did efficiently and without complaint.

Since the internal switch had been flipped, however, Charlie had begun to keep his rats alive to torture them. He would take them back to his office and place them in his filing cabinet - a large, heavy steel contraption from the 40's. He would burn them at the end of his rounds with his cigarettes, stab them with pens or nails, slice them with glass. In his bottom drawer he had started to feed his rats far too much food, then withdraw all food just to see who survived. The result was never pretty. The rats would *scream* in hunger, be overcome with starvation, and fall prey to cannabalistic behaviours. Charlie enjoyed watching.

It wasn't long before he started to drip pieces of mauled rat - blood, flesh and bone - into the day workers food. They never realised, but they noticed. Charlie was, as a jack-of-all handyman, quickly instructed to investigate the fridge for rotten meat that may have gotten stuck deep inside. Of course he found none. Eventually the fridge was replaced, but the complaints kept coming. Eventually, the workers stopped leaving food overnight. Charlie became bored, so begun to explore his darker side with larger animals. Foxes, Badgers. A Dog. 

That Dog was to be his undoing. He had trapped and killed it under his cabin weeks ago, but had quickly moved onto a new family of foxes and neglected to clean up after himself. The stench eventually spurred investigation by the site manager who had quickly found the Dogs remains as well as what turned out to be old rat blood that had seeped through the floor from the steel filing cabinet.

The forever stretch of dark comforts like the touch of a mother and now I breathe and breathe deep and now I feel afraid as if I might remember. 

Deeper breaths. Blood pulse rapid. Panic of an injured animal like guts rolling. The muscles slack like damp rope but hands in fists. The images flicker. Fast sprawl of information pulled above the surface: 

Flash but no sound. Barrel and smoke then sideways. Loud bang and footsteps. I remember I closed my eyes in dust and the bitter taste of sand, stench of horseshit in too much sun and a scream. High pitched, shrill like a bird being squeezed. The slow bleed was weightless and I just smiled.

""Told you.""

""No."" And I'm flat on my back feeling strange and I swear she's grinning at me. Plush red lips pulled to one side.

""I found you."" She laughs.

""Sheriff ever find the gold?"" I ask.

She shrugs. Black hair spilling across her shoulders like shadows. ""I don't remember,"" she says. ""But I remember you and remembered what you said.""

""First time?""

""No. The second. The whole world fought but I was too old to care.""

""Passed in your sleep?""

""Food poisoning.""

I sit up. Tremble in limbs. Hands feel like bundles of sticks. 

""And now?""

""What about now?""

""How much do I have to catch up on?""

""Does it matter?""

She's smaller than I remember. Beautiful. Her soft shape leans against mine and her warmth surrounds me.

Nearby, a loud hailer blared reassurances of glory and honor. ""In service to our Great Leader"", among other things. Arno silently repeated the words to himself as they were spoken, and sneered to himself. Whatever words they used to uplift the people's spirits didn't matter.

As the plane took off and reached cruising altitude, Arno undid his restraints and paced up and down the hold. He noticed one of the folks had fallen asleep, his head nodding between the restraints as the plane bobbed up and down erratically. He took a few steps forward and gently shook him awake. A wave of relief overcame Arno as the old man awoke, startled and wide-eyed.

""Good, he's not gonna die yet"", Arno thought to himself. Some of his friends were unlucky enough to get cancer patients who couldn't survive the trip.

Arno's thoughts were interrupted as an alarm pierced the deafening hum of the plane engines. It was time. Arno turned about and yelled for everyone to get up.

No, they had left Hell behind. 

It had been almost 200 cycles since the separation, and there was still a hollowness within everyone, still a kind of shock that manifests itself behind one's eyes, as if the vacuum kept out by the walls of the ship were inside of all of them instead. The ships were the pinnacle of engineering, but they could only keep out so much of the cold if their passengers were willing to let it in. 

They sighed as they looked around the numerous panels of occasionally flashing instruments. They were alone on command deck, their watch achingly long from over. The rest of the crew were in their bunks presumably, getting as much sleep as they could during the hyperspace jump, with all personnel deemed non-essential to transport operations in stasis pods throughout the ship. The Adam carried a precious cargo, and as far as its occupants knew, now one of the rarest.

They looked out, through the screen that offered a view of nothing, and everything. The void was scattered with shining spots of possibility, burning brightly so far away. Some were probably already gone.

Eve was somewhere out there, out of view of the command deck, cargo equally precious. They too had left home far behind them. 

The same energy that fueled the ships, that had created vast and mighty civilizations, had destroyed their home. *They* had destroyed their home. *Their recklessness*. This time it would be different. This time, it *had* to be different.

They looked down from the endless expanse of celestial bodies, as a holographic screen popped into existence. It was counting down in red numerals: the amount of time until Adam would emerge from its trans-galactic jump. Moments later, silent in the frigid vacuum, the ship emerged into existence again, the Eve mere seconds behind.

Out beyond them was a yellow sun, smaller than the one they had left behind, but with a similar chemical makeup and age. Another holographic screen appeared, this time zooming in on the third body in orbit of this sun. It was so blue, adorned with wisps of cloud, with scattered landmasses riding on vast seas. *Beautiful*, they thought, breathless with excitement. Immediately they selected the ship-wide communication system from an array of holographic keys, and put in the passcode for the commander's personal line. Not one second later a voice emerged from the other end.

""Status?"". They could hardly contain their eagerness as they answered, swallowing the lump in their throat.

The human race, was nothing more than a derivative of their race and as such they held power over us. They delved into our mind without speech, implanted thoughts and ideas into our heads, religion mathematics, science, all of it came from them. They expected us to come quietly.

And you will know I am the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon you.’ Well boys there’s no secret here. I’ll tell you what you are. You’re not the sheep. And you’re not the shepherds. You are the vengeance. And in the dying of the light, we will roar and let them know who is truly the chosen of the Lord.”

Candice frowned as she watched the new family move in across the street. It had happened all so fast. The Blowsons had moved out because they needed more room for their newborn, and it seemed their house was sold as soon as they made their announcement. In only a week, the moving trucks appears on a cool Saturday morning with the things of the three newest residents on the block.

It was all wrong. Everyone with at least a common decency knew that it was proper etiquette to wait at least two weeks before moving into a new household. How else would Candice, head of the community welcoming committee for seven years running (unanimously decided for three years in a row!) find time to make her trademark butternut pie while also balancing being a devoted wife and loving mother to her three angels. And don’t even get her started on squeezing what little time she could salvage from her life of domestic duties for The Real Housewife of Inflatable Hills.

Regardless, she readjusted her life for her inconsiderate neighbors. It was a minor inconvenience, at most. After all, Candice was always up at 4:30 sharp in the morning to ensure no delinquency would be had on her beloved Helium Heights Street.

No, there were more sinister forces afoot that lead to her immediate distrust of the new family. And it all started with hearing their name…

*8 Hours Earlier*

“Balawna!” Candice exclaimed. The name still reverbed in her head hours after hearing it. “What kind of unwholesome name is that?”

Margaret shrugged. “I don’t know. Looks like they’re not from around her, though.”

Before Candice could ask for clarification, she noticed the small van pull up into the driveway of the new home. She had knocked on it several times in anticipation for the neighbors but no one had answered. After half an hour, she had decided to do some recon with her girl friends to gather some intel on who she would share a street with.

From the van, three people – a man, a woman, and a child no older than ten –  emerged. Except, they looked nothing like people. Or rather, nothing like her. They were filled with air and had the telltale signs of life, but their bodies were far more angular. The tone of their shiny skin were tones darker than hers. They simply didn’t belong in the sleepy little town of Floatsville.

Oh sure, they played their cards right. As soon as they spotted Candice and Margaret they waved and smiled. They accepted Candice’s pie with the upmost grace (even though it had grown cold) and even offered to return the dish it sat upon when they were done. Whoever had trained them had done well, all right, but Candice was not one to be duped so easily.

***

Candice gripped the satin curtains into her hands shook. The Balawna family had taken root faster than she expected.

The father, Faruq, had set up an impromptu barbeque in his front lawn. Of course, these events were supposed to be planned and preapproved at least ten days before, but lawless scoundrels will do anything to promote their anarchist agendas.

Meanwhile, the mother, Asha, had also began spreading her seeds of chaos, literally and metaphorically. Since arriving, she had planted several unusual species of flowers in the garden ringing the house’s perimeter. Who knew what toxins they could potentially release in the air, corrupting the minds of the youth and morally questionable.

Speaking of which, the child was the worst offender. Candice hadn’t learned her name – a core tenet of her life’s philosophy being children should be seen and not heard – but the girl obviously knew nothing of keeping tradition. She zipped and zoomed down the streets on her skateboard, paying no heed to the safety regulations Candice had painstakingly labored over enforcing. And then there was the whole argument on her inappropriate tomboyish nature.

In all, it was beyond disrespectful. It was pure taunting, an open invitation of war on what Candice had strived to create. First, they would break little rules – just enough for slaps on the wrist – and then they would unravel the very being of civilization as they corrupted every last person on the street. And it was all on Candice to stop them.

“Honey, how much longer are you going to stare at the neighbors?” her husband asked from behind. “I’m sure they would love to meet you.”

“I have no plans to meet with them,” Candice snapped back. “Don’t forget what happened to my brother overseas, Daniel! He was popped because of their evil ways!”

Before Daniel could response, Candice glanced out the window. And that’s when she saw it: her youngest son, Connor, talking to the neighbor girl. She recognized the look of lust in his eye, and she wouldn’t take it lying down. No, they could ruin the other children, but not her own. She would nip this at the bud.

“Connor!” she yelled, loud enough to be heard even past the thick windowpane. “You stop conspiring with that she-devil and come home this instance!” ",JeniusGuy

[PM] Give me your image prompts!,JeniusGuy,"Sure! In hindsight, there's a lot of pretext that would clear things up. I'll try to sum it how it ran in my head.

Basically, this story is set in the future. Mankind and an alien species are waging a war on the latter's home planet for an unknown reason. While humans have advanced technology as their advantage, the aliens are able to morph into clones of people they've killed which has given them an upper hand in the battle.

In response, humans created the headset visors. Connected to captured aliens, they allow people to detect impostors by using their superior senses.  These are called Seekers, and are used to prevent enemies slipping through defenses during battles. 

Well, when Rob says there was a third alien nearby, he was actually talking about *himself*. That's why Jade was scared and he laughed when she turned the headset on him. I like to think of it as him saying, ""I'm the last person you would have expected!"" 

To be honest, I think it was poorly written and if I had had more time then I would have tweaked it so it would have made more sense. Sorry for the confusion it created. ",JeniusGuy

“Honestly,” Jade said, shaking her head, “you look beyond stupid with that on.”

Rob gave a short chuckle. More of a scoff, really. If anything, the man would be the last to admit that he was anything less than the second coming of Christ himself. Just one of the several reasons he and Jade never got along.

“I’ll have you know that this is top tier quality stuff,” the grizzly man replied. He tapped the headset he wore with his forefinger, the lower half of his face split in a smirk. “Cost the government a pretty penny. More than you’ll ever see in a lifetime, that’s for sure.”

“Doesn’t stop it from looking like something from a shitty old sci-fi movie,” Jade mumbled to herself.

She shivered, folding her arms. Pandora was a strange planet – perpetually cold and dreary – but that wasn’t what sent the shivers up and down her spine. No, that distinct honor belonged to no other than the Seekers.

Jade watched the two lanky figures as they walked through the thick mist. They jerked like defected dolls, not living things. In fact, the only thing that convinced her they were alive were the occasional bursts of noise they pushed from their mouths. Incomprehensible words of their own language spilled forth like the saliva dripped between their jagged teeth.

Normally, their presence only would warrant Jade to shoot without abandon. But Seekers were different. They were safe enough, as long as they were hooked up to their headsets that were identical to Rob’s.

Sighing, Jade glanced down at her unscarred hands. If there was an attack, what could she realistically do? She was a scientist, not a fighter. Hell, she questioned if it was even wise for her to be so close to the frontline. It was a lot easier for her superiors back on Earth to make decisions when they were safe in their plush offices.

“Hey, ya listening?” Rob asked, his eyebrow no doubt drawn in accusatory anger.

Jade blinked, ripped from her reverie. “Sorry, I was thinking. What did you say?”

Rob sneered. “Christ, they just let anyone become scientists these days as long as they look good in a lab coat, huh?”

“Can you get to the point sometime today?”

“I *said* I was going on and taken the monster mash duo with me to scout for any Imposters. Can I trust you to hold down the fort while I’m gone or is that too much work?”

Jade chewed on a myriad of curses and swallowed them. They tasted like bitter medicine. “I’m more than capable.”

“Good. Glad to see you’re not completely useless.”

The man took a few steps and then stopped. At the same time, the Seekers paused, perfectly synchronized. Rob gave a shrill whistle.

“Well looky what we have here. I’m already picking something up. Hey, you wouldn’t happen to have some wicked claws over there, would ya, Toots?”

“What’s that supposed to mean?” Jade asked.

“It means I’ve got a reading for three of these things but there’s only four of us here. Now I’m no scientist, but that means it’s either me or you, and I’m pretty sure I’m still one-hundred percent human. Comprende, señorita?”

“Give me that, you asshole.”

Jade walked up to Rob and ripped the headset from him. He gasped, but followed with a gruff chuckle afterwards. “Ah, I see she does have some kick in her. What do they call that in Spanish again? Fuego?”

Ignoring him, Jade placed the headset in front of her face. She didn’t wear it, considering all the gear was connected to Rob, but it worked just as well.

Sure enough, the man was right. On the screen, a red arrow flashed with a message warning of a potential enemy in the vicinity. Jade gripped the cool metal of the headset harder.

She moved around with it, trying to the find the hidden guest. In the fog, they could hide from the naked eye but the headset would catch their body heat and assess if they were human or not. However, no matter where she looked, she found nothing. Just the fog, the two Seekers, and…

Jade froze when the headset swept over Rob. The occasional flashing became overwhelming, almost covering the whole screen in screaming scarlet. A small message scrolled across the bottom and Jade felt her blood grow cold.

*Imposter detected. High level threat. Eliminate Immediately.*

As Jade took a step back, all she could hear was Rob’s laughing. It was loud, as always, but distorted into a guttural click. An inhuman voice followed.

[WP] Construct the most outrageous excuse for losing your homework that you can think of.,KCcracker,"Darren ran through the deserted hall, past closed doors and yellow lockers, skidding on one foot into his first class of the day. Quickly making his way to a free desk towards the back, he wiped his brow and took a few deep breaths to calm his breathing. A wry half-smile spread across his face as he looked up at the clock. Only 20 minutes late! Not bad, all things considered. 

Mrs. Lawson was sitting on her desk, hands full of papers. She raised an eyebrow at him and opened her mouth to speak. Darren mentally prepared himself for what was coming. ""Darren! I'm so *pleased* you could join us for class this morning. We were just turning in the homework I assigned last week. You can pass yours forward now."" 

Darren's smile only widened during Mrs. Lawson's greeting. He ran his hand through his hair and laughed softly when she finished. ""I hate to tell you this Mrs. Lawson, but I don't have any homework to turn in for you.""

Mrs. Lawson sighed and pinched the bridge of her nose between thumb and forefinger. ""And *why* don't you have anything to turn in, Darren? Spare me any of your far-fetched stories this time.""

Darren leaned back in his chair, lacing his fingers behind his head and stretching his legs out. ""Well, since you asked, I haven't been able to complete your assignment on account of the fire.""

Mrs. Lawson's eyebrows knit together in concern... and suspicion. ""Fire? What fire?""

Darren's eyebrows shot up. ""You mean you didn't hear about the fire out by my place? My neighbor's house? I mean, you should have at least seen the smoke from it! The thing was going for *weeks.*"" 

Mrs. Lawson scoffed. ""Weeks? I don't believe it.""

Smiling at Mrs. Lawson's ignorance, Darren nodded. ""Believe it, Mrs. Lawson. I always thought there was something funny about that house. The guy who lived there was nice enough, but it turns out he was just as strange as his house was! See, his house caught on fire a couple weeks ago. The fire department came and put it out, but the next day it was burning again. It went on like that for a few days before the firefighters just decided to rope the whole area off and monitor the burn instead of trying to fight a fire that refused to be put out. 

“Before too long, the fire department decided the burn was pretty well contained to just the house and asked us neighbors to call them if we noticed the fire spreading. It was a very important job, watching over the fire. So obviously I couldn't finish my assignment because I was busy watching this house fire, making sure it stayed put. And Mrs. Lawson, you won’t believe what I saw when I went over for a closer look. 

“I thought I might’ve seen a few stray sparks come off the house, so I went over to make sure I wasn’t just imagining things. All the windows in the place were busted, so I leaned through one to see what was going on in there. 

“Mrs. Lawson, that house went *all the way down.* I saw that fire burning deep inside the earth, deeper than any basement would ever go. You could see the remains of the levels the fire left behind- foundation material, pipes, busted up concrete, that kind of thing? Anyway, I was staring at that impossible fire when all of a sudden I felt a hand tap me on the shoulder! 

""I spun around and saw my old neighbor standing there, just watching me watch the fire. ‘Enjoying the show?’ He asked. ‘Sir,’ I said, pointing down that giant hole, ‘Did you know your house went down this far?’ He just chuckled at that. ‘Of course I knew. That’s that way I built it.’ 

“All I could do was gape at the guy. ‘Built this? How?’ He didn’t answer me, only stared at his burning house with this crooked smile on his face. So instead I asked him, ‘What did you *keep* in all those rooms, anyway?’ He turned his head to look at me and raised his eyebrows. ‘Why, I kept my whole world in there. My past, present, and future. My dreams, my fears, my greatest loves… and everything in between.’ He looked back at his wasted home. ‘I couldn’t bear to part with them, you see? I wanted to keep them close, be with them always.’ He wore a sad smile when he looked at me again. ‘You need a lot of space to keep all of that with you.’ Patting the house gently, he turned to walk away, turning his head to say one last thing. ‘And there comes a time when you need to let it all go.’ He disappeared into the night, after that.

“So you see why I couldn’t do the assignment, Mrs. Lawson. I was busy watching that man's life burn to the ground.” Darren nodded once, as if that was the end of that. 

Mrs. Lawson could only gape as the bell rang, signaling the end of the period.

The information passed far over Mike’s head as he lazily grabbed his coffee mug and took a sip. “Mhm…” he hummed as he watched the computer flicker to life before him. “What’ve you found this time?” Behind his slurred words was a brain beginning to fire with excitement once again. He’d always loved getting new cases. They gave him a chance at that first hunt of information that he craved. It had once been his stumbling block, but now it was his stepping stool into the other side of society.

Mike’s eyebrows poked upward. “You have my attention,” he said as he spun to face his boss.

“I thought that might get to you. You see, this one’s one of the strangest cases we’ve seen. A man, about 20 years ago, broke from FDC Philadelphia without a trace.”

There, on the table before him, was one security camera he hadn’t avoided as he made his escape that night. Every repressed memory of Philadelphia came rushing back in a torrent of fear, anguish, and pain.

“You’ve already got a lead, don’t you Mike?” Jerry said with a smile. “I knew you’d love this one.”

“You might say that,” Mike whispered

“Well, I’ll let you get to it.” Jerry spun on his heels and left.

Mike turned to his computer and opened the databases he had used as his tool for years now.

Along the wall, other guardsmen stared and sighed, not looking forward to the rain that would surely soak them to the bone during their watch.

Far below, in the slum neighborhood of Tinpenny, real danger lurked...

-----

Richard, apprentice to the blacksmith of Iron Row, stood under the thatched roof of his home as the rain pelted down on the muddy, narrow streets of Tinpenny.  The homeless sat, huddled under thin blankets and lapping greedily at the sky as cold rain fell, quenching their thirst.  Those who had homes rushed to be in them, thankful to be out of the wet, even if they did live in squalor.

The storm had intensified in the last hour, with sheets of rain and bolts of lightning crashing to the world below.  Surely, the gods must be at war, thought Richard, glancing at his tiny home altar.  Several idols sat on it, though he rarely prayed anymore.  Not since he'd lost his betrothed over a year ago.

The City of Opals may have been one of the largest cities in the kingdom, but the rains fell on rich and poor alike.  He thought back to the night that Elise was lost to him.  How they'd been so happy as they'd walked along the wall, stealing away for some time away from the crowded, ramshackle world they'd shared here in Tinpenny.  How a gang had left him bleeding in an alley, Elise's dead hand clutched in his, her throat cut from ear to ear.  Rage boiled behind his eyes as he stepped back into his hut and closed the door to the cacophony of the slum.

-----

Nearby, five men, dressed in the robes of the clergy, made their way carefully down the muddy street.  People quieted as they passed, even those homeless who gibbered wildly to themselves became quiescent as the figures passed...

-----

Teylor's relief finally arrived and he took leave of his post on the wall.  His armor and uniform were soaked, and his feet squelched in his boots as he plodded to the barracks.  Lightning and thunder pealed overhead as he approached the main doors.  Bertrand and Alexi were on duty, and he gave the pair a tired wave as he entered the darkened building.

Stripping off his armor and uniform, he made sure to dry and maintain the polished steel to prevent rusting.  Changing into a dry tunic and boots, he threw his oiled cloak over his head and headed to the Copper Lamprey for his nightly repast.

-----

Theona huddled against the back wall of the alley, her pursuers blocking her exit.  Copper curls clung to her forehead and cheeks as she placed a hand against the hard stone to steady herself.  She could hear the men's cruel taunts as they closed in on her.

""C'mere, poppet.  We jus' wanna 'ave a li'l fun, 'a's awl.""  The man's breath, rank with whisky, reached her before his words did.  She said a silent prayer to her chosen goddess and turned slowly to face her attackers.

""Well, sirs...if it's 'just a little fun...'"" she said, running her tongue across her teeth.  The men seemed confused for a moment, then chuckled among themselves, thinking they'd found a willing plaything.

-----

The throng of youths gathered in the abandoned park huddled under the leaves of a tree, counting the money from the pockets they'd picked throughout the day, splitting the take between themselves.  They pinched, fought, and hollered among themselves, bragging and boasting about their skill, the targets they'd fleeced, and the people they'd roughed up.

All that came to an abrupt end when the cloaked figure stepped out of the shadows.  Rain pelted off his cloak as he marched forward, his face in shadow.  Several of the young men took notice and stood up from their gathering, demanding to know who he was.

His voice rasped, ""Where is James 'Dodger' Boyle?""

A stocky, well-build man emerged from the center of the throng, balancing a dagger on his fingertip.  ""Who's asking?"" he said, grinning.

""The rest of you can leave now.  If you do,"" said the cloaked man, ""you won't be harmed.""

Peals of laughter washed over the assembled gang as their leader approached the lone figure.  ""What's the matter, mister?  You can't count?""

Lightning flashed and the figure's arm made a quick, upward crescent from the folds of his cloak.  A heavy, iron hammer connected with Dodger's jaw, splintering his chin and sending several of his teeth spinning through the air.  An arc of blood spattered to the ground, mixing quickly with the rain and mud.

""One,"" said the man flatly as Dodger crumpled to the grass, cupping his broken face.  Slowly, the gang spread out, surrounding the figure as weapons were brought out and rain continued to fall.",Flamebrand02

""What is the meaning of this?"" I yell at them, standing between her and the guards

""Brother Michael, She is possesed"" I stare back at the girl. She is only nine years of age, why does God allow this.

""What can she do?"" I watch the sobbing girl look back up at me.

""She is as quicker than anything we have seen before. We caught her trying to steal apples for her family, We chased her on horse back all the way up to your chaple"" Poor girl, but she was smart.

""I will clam sanctuary for her now. Give me 12 days and I will see what she can do"" I walk over to her and put my arm on her sholder, and she calms down.

""Our message is of peace, not of banishment"" God sent these people here for a purpose, we will help them find that purpose.

The guard leaves and I hear their horses trot away. I bend a knee and look her in the eyes ""Are all those things they said about you true?""

With a saddened sigh she replied a simple ""Yes"" She shows me her hand which moves back in forward so quickly, I can hardly see it.

""Am I a monster?"" She asks, stopping her hand.

[WP] Write a story about superheroes set in the medieval era.,RexReaver,"He had traveled the breadth of the world, but Wira had never seen a town such as Windshire. All the shutters and doors were closed, and the small fields lay barren. There were no animals in sight, not the mangy dogs or the skinny chickens so common in other towns.

It was as though God Himself had fled from this place.

The dead littered the streets. The ones that still drew breath weren't long for the world either.  One mother sat shivering nearby on a doorstep, the husk of her infant held to her breast. Black spots dotted her flesh, and even her fingers were thick with tumors.

Crouching beside her, he pulled a small glass vial from a pocket and held it to her cracked lips. ""For the pain,"" he said in English, hoping she could understand him through his accent. 

She nodded and tilted her head back. Before he could administer the herbal remedy, he noticed that the light in her eyes had gone out.

""Allah welcome you into Paradise,"" he said.

""What are you doing to that woman, devil?""

Wira straightened slowly to see a barrel-chested man standing nearby with a club. The fellow looked livid, for some reason, and seemed on the point of charging. Casually, Wira rested a hand on the handle of his kris.

""I thought I could help her,"" he said.

The man shook the club at him. ""Get out of our town! You don't belong here.""

""I have medicine,"" Wira said, reaching over his shoulder to touch the pack strapped there.

The man roared and dashed at him. Whipping out his kris, Wira spread his feet in preparation for battle, but a shadow materialized from within a nearby house, a shadow with a sword. Before he knew what was going on, the man was lying on the ground, screaming and clutching the stumps at his knees.

As the swordsman wiped his blade clean with a rag, Wira backed away. Knights were hardly friendlier than angry townsfolk. Unusually, this knight's armor was painted entirely in black. He bore no crest, no sigil, nothing to indicate who he fought for.

""That's an unusual weapon,"" the knight said suddenly, pointing at the kris's wavy blade with his own sword.

""You're an unusual knight,"" Wira countered.

Laughter rang from within the helmet. ""You speak English. Yet you clearly aren't from here, judging by the darkness of your skin. Are you from the caliphates?""

""And if I am, will you kill me?""

Again, the knight laughed. ""I will not. I've killed my fair share of Muslims, and I'm certain you're one. But the Crusades are over for me.""

Wira lowered his kris, but didn't sheath it. ""I'm from a land far away; further than the lands where the brothers of my faith dwell. I mean no harm to you and your town. I am just a traveler.""

The knight remained silent for a while, and then put his sword away in one swift motion. ""This is not my town. But come, share a meal with me. That's the only welcome you'll be getting.""

***

Wira pushed his empty plate aside and cross his fingers on the table. ""You still haven't told me your name.""

The knight had bought him a meal at the local tavern, but he himself had not eaten or drunk anything. He hadn't even removed his helmet.

""You may call me the Night Templar.""

""Which lord do you fight for?""

The knight snorted. ""I fight for the people, not some milksop hiding in his manor while his lands are dying all around him.""

Remembering the townsman with the severed legs, Wira said, ""You killed one of the people here, however.""

""Look around you,"" Night Templar said. ""And tell me what you see.""

Wira did as he was asked. Only a few people were in that dark and smelly little establishment. None talked to one another. All looked sickly and weak. And not a single one had looked his way since he entered.

""They're all dying from the plague, aren't they?"" he said.

""Dying, yes."" The knight leaned closer. ""From the plague? No.""

Curiosity piqued, Wira whispered, ""Then what?""

""That's what I'm here to find out. And today, I did."" Night Templar shook out a crumpled piece of paper from a sack onto the table. ""I took this off the man I killed earlier. He's not a local; that's why he was worried about foreigners like you coming here.""

""Then what's he doing here?""

""Those people are sick because someone's been selling them some kind of tonic against the plague, which I believe is only making them worse—""

""You don't suspect me?"" Wira pointed at the satchel on the table containing several vials of clear, yellow fluid.

The knight shook his head. ""I've been here for almost a week, and these people have been suffering for much longer than that. And anyway, I've discovered the one responsible."" He smoothed out the paper and showed Wira the seal at the bottom of the note. It was a cross.

""The priest?"" Wira frowned. ""It makes sense. They would listen to him.""

""Tonight, we shall put the fear of God back into him,"" the knight said.

***

The rain had begun to fall by the time the pair made their way to the cathedral. It loomed over them in the blackness of night, like a fortress of darkness rather than the sanctuary it was supposed to be.

Two burly men stood at the entrance gates, talking to one another in low tones. One held a lantern. When they saw Wira and Night Templar approach, they drew short swords and held them up. ""Who goes there?"" the one with the lantern called. ""Stay home, or the plague'll get you.""

""We'll take our chances,"" Night Templar said. With a roar, he drew his sword and cut the man down. The other yelled, but the sound turned into a gurgle as Wira buried the kris in his throat.

Like shadows, they swept through the graveyard, and not even the lightning revealed them to the patrolling thugs. One by one, these were eliminated as well, until at last both men stood by the wooden doors. Giving each other a nod of encouragement, they kicked them open and charged in.

Wira flew into a kick at the nearest man, sending him crashing into a stack of unused pews. Another attacked him with a spear, but he parried the weapon easily with one arm and rammed the kris into the man's side. Grabbing hold of his waist and using his momentum, Wira hurled him into two other attackers.

On the other side of the nave, Night Templar was shouting, ""God is speaking through me. He calls horseshit on your non-legit little op here, and it's hammertime for you punks!"" His sword flashed left and right, dropping bodies. Once, three thugs attacked him from all directions, only for him to leap into the gloomy aisles and vanish utterly. While they were still looking about in fright and confusion, he reappeared behind one of them and hacked his head off.

""You fools,"" the man in the red vestments shouted from the altar, next to several vats of bubbling liquid. ""It is I whom God speaks to! God has commanded me to cure His flock, and you will not interfere with His will!""

Wira drove his fist into one attacker's nose, shattering it, and casually broke the windpipe of another with a chop of his hand. However, as the man fell away, he saw the priest raise a crossbow to his face.

""Watch out!"" he shouted, but it was too late. The bolt whistled through the air and slammed into Night Templar's breastplate. He froze for a second, and then sank to his knees.

""No!"" Wira shoved his way past the man with the broken nose, drawing Sakti from a hidden sheath. The mystical kris shimmered with rainbow shades as he leaped over the altar and drove it at the priest ... who clapped both hands over his wrists, stopping him cold in mid-air.

Before he could do more than widen his eyes in shock, Wira was sailing through the air, to land painfully on the stony floor. Impossible, he thought as he tried to get up.

""Did you think I was a mere priest? That the elixirs I created were only for these filthy commoners begging for mercy?"" The man was wearing an evil grin on his face as he slowly advanced toward Wira with a sword in hand. ""Your only folly was in underestimating me, but what a price you would pay for it! Soon this kingdom will be mine, but you ... you won't be here to see it.""

The sword's tip lunged at Wira, who slashed at it with the kris, severing the blade cleanly. Mouth hanging in shock, the priest fumbled with the handle, and then jerked suddenly on tiptoes. The blade of another sword had erupted in the center of his chest.

""T'was only a flesh wound,"" Night Templar said, stepping out from behind their enemy. Retracting his weapon, he let the corpse fall to the side.

""Praise be to Allah,"" Wira murmured as he took the knight's offered hand. ""Are you hurt?""

""God protects me,"" the knight said, sounding cheerful. The bolt still protruded from his armor like a grotesque growth. ""Well, looks like our work here is done.""

Wira smiled and clapped him on the shoulder. ""I am happy our paths crossed.""

""Hold, warrior,"" the knight said. ""This isn't farewell. Tyrants and thieves still reign over this groaning land."" Extending his hand, he said, ""Will you join me to bring justice to the needy?""

With no hesitation, Wira clasped it and said, ""So we will.""",Bilgebum

[WP] Write a story about superheroes set in the medieval era.,RexReaver,"Throughout human history there have been special people. People who were more than just human. One could see them as errant souls, traveling through the world until they find the perfect time for them to interfere.

There was a young peasant girl in France, who had the voice of a leader and a heart of gold. She had convinced many that she had visions of Christ. Her body was able to endure the harshest treatments.

She was seen as just a silly girl, but eventually she was given command of the army. She had won many victories, never killing anyone herself. Her purity was seen as holy by most.

When her plans to fully liberate France and defeat Burgundy and England were thrarted by her King's court she went and sought battle without her King's consent.

She was captured and eventually burned as a witch. It took three burnings to fully burn her remains.

Little did they know, that once no human eyes were near, the soul of the Maid of Orleans re-constituted itself and fled France. She had the ability to fly and did so away from Europe and into the Atlantic.

Her soul returned home to Weshesh. She rejoined Temujiin, Charles, Basil, and others at the Table of Humanity. Once her people were violent, their interventions were violent and self-serving, culminating in the invasion of the Eastern Mediterranean. Her people afterwards decided to never repeat the horrors of the War of Humanity and enforced strict guidelines on what the remaining souls of Weshesh could do once they intervened. 

Now they waited for the next soul to intervene.",Derron116

[WP] Write a story about superheroes set in the medieval era.,RexReaver,"The night sky lit up like day. A star was falling to earth, leaving a searing streak of fire in its wake.When it struck the earth the earth itself recoiled, and the land vibrated like a drum. The sound deep and low, echoed across the fields.

It was this that drew a farmer and his bride from their beds on a cold winter night. They raced out to hear their animals panicking. She calmed them. He grabbed a shovel and ran to the fire. 

There, in the crater was an egg, giant and golden. The flames, robbed of fuel, died out around it. The farmer watched as the egg spilt along a hidden seam, opening to reveal a young boy, wrapped in fabrics of red and blue.

The farmer approached, slowly. The shovel lay forgotten behind him. The heat was unnoticed. For too long his wife and he had been without child. And now a kind and loving God had given him one.

He picked the boy up. The boy weighed nothing, lighter even than air. But he was solid, too. Like oak or rock. He carried the boy up to his home, his wife waiting for him.

“What have you brought me?” She asked.

“Tis a child. Born of heaven. For us to raise!”

At the age of two he split an anvil with a punch. At the age of three he welded it back together with his eyes. At the age of 4 the farm prospered, as one boy could do what a team of horses could not.

This prosperity only grew, and soon overtook neighbors, and neighbors of neighbors. The rains came when they were needed. And stayed away when they were not. Lost lambs never stayed lost. No winter was so cold that there was not a fire on every hearth, and no child went to bed with an empty stomach.

All knew they were watched over by an angel, blue and red flashes accompanying his every miracle. Every prayer was heard, every prayer was answered.",UnfortunateBirthMark

[WP] Write a story about superheroes set in the medieval era.,RexReaver,"Ever since Meredith survived being crushed as a child, it was clear to her that she had an abnormal ability. The stone wall, tall and heavy enough to squish an adult horse into a paste, did nothing but push Meredith  deep into the damp soil. She tried cutting the skin of her arm and holding her head over a torch. Nothing could physically hurt her. She still aged, but not even she could cause an early death.

Her father knew, as he was present when the wall fell. For almost two hours she laid beneath the wall while her father, Edran Dawnfrost, a well-spoken farmer, hurriedly pulled away the rubble.

""Meredith, please be alive!"" He cried.

""I'm here, father!"" She responded, her voice muffled by the thick stone between them. ""I'm not hurt!""

""A miracle! The gods watch over you!"" Edran said as he carried away the cat-sized boulder. ""There you are!""

They smiled at each other, their cheeks and eyes dampened by the tears.

""I'll get you out, Em. Are you not in pain?"" Edran asked.

""No pain at all! Do the gods truly watch over me?"" She was excited to be alive, despite the shock of being violently cast into the ground with a disturbing thud.

""It truly seems that way, Em. Perhaps your dear mother asked them to save you.""

Edran removed the remaining boulders, allowing Meredith to emerge from the rubble. They hugged for a moment, pleased that another death had not driven them into solitude. The passing of Meredith's mother, Elwyn, stabbed an unforgiving pain in their hearts. For two years they had continued to manage the farm without her daily grace and emotional support. Thankfully, given Elwyn's warmth, competing farmers halted their prior attempts to battle for the land under possession of the Dawnfrost family.

Weeks passed as Meredith tested her apparent indestructibility, always doing it in secret. At one point she became brave enough to approach two wolves in the wilderness. Meredith snook outside while her father slept and found a grove frequented by wolves. At first they took no notice of her, but as she laid on the dry grass the wolves gradually approached her with vicious intent.

Close enough to strike, they began snarling under the calm wind and rustling of the surrounding trees. But Meredith waited confidently. If fire could not burn her skin, if her own teeth could not puncture her arm, if the sharpness of her father's sword could not split the skin of her abdomen, then the fangs of a wolf could not harm her.

As expected, with a frightening urgency, the wolves rushed in and clamped their jaws down on Meredith's limbs. Only the sporadic shaking of the wolves attempting to pull away a limb startled her.

For several moments she laid awkwardly in silence as the wolves failed to chew on her. She laughed in relief. Her body shaking from the viscous movements, yet she laughed. This was the final clarification she had hoped for. She was truly unstoppable and the power made her lust for control over the kingdom. All those tales of duels between the strongest and smartest of knights. The harsh wars of the past. She could defeat them all, and the fear of being murdered in the night by corrupted competitors or lunatics perished beneath her confidence.

Perhaps her father had this power, but her mother clearly didn't. Meredith, still lying on the ground, now had to get away from the wolves. She kicked the wolf, which pulled at her left leg, in its face. It soon retreated as her kicks became stronger.

The wolf to her right persisted, clamping down on her right arm. She lunged her left fist into its mouth, it began choking and whimpered as it backed away. She could have gauged out the wolf's eyes, or punched at its throat, or stomped on its legs, but she had an instinctive sense of peace for animals. 

She raced home, her clothes torn from the wolves' teeth, and burst through the front door. Her father was awoken by the sudden bang and raced downstairs. 

""Who dares to barge into my house?!"" Edran roared. ""Meredith, hide!"" His footsteps challenged the wooden stairs. Had the other farmers finally tried to take the Dawnfrost farm? As he reached the last step, Meredith stood in the doorway, her clothes in pieces.

""Meredith! What happened to you?!"" He panicked, kneeling down to hug her.

""Father, even the wolves cannot hurt me."" She said calmly.

""The wolves did this? But you're untouched, except for your clothes. Let me get you some fresh clothing."" Confused, he swiftly closed the door and rushed upstairs to find some clothes for Meredith. ""Where are the wolves? At the grove again?"" He shouted from upstairs.

""Yes, I let them get me. But, father, I should tell you of my power."" She replied.

Edran stopped for a moment, worried that his daughter had gone mad. He returned downstairs and gave Meredith a set of new clothing, but he looked concerned.

""Meredith, you could have died."" He whimpered. If his daughter died, he would most likely take his own life. A world without his daughter and wife was not worth living in. ""I can't lose you, Em. What you did was reckless.""

""Father, it's okay."" She thought of ways to convince him that she was truly immortal. ""Remember the stone wall that never hurt me?""

Edran nodded, staring into Meredith's eyes. Thank the gods she was still alive. He tried to suppress thoughts of the same eyes looking back at him from her lifeless body. 

""The gods still watch over me."" She hinted.

Edran had no words. Only confusion.

Meredith grabbed for her father's dagger that was sat on the kitchen table. Before Edran could stop her, she lunged the dagger's tip towards her abdomen. It thudded as it collided with her skin.

Edran gasped. She lunged the dagger again. No blood, no guts.

""My god. You cannot be hurt!"" Edran was amazed. ""The gods do indeed guide you.""

""Father, maybe you have the same power."" Meredith was curious. Did this power come from her father?

""No. In my years I have been bitten and cut. I bled every time, unlike you.""

A shroud of sadness suddenly hugged Meredith. She realised that she had to protect her father.

[WP] Write a story about superheroes set in the medieval era.,RexReaver,"""*These* are the people who you selected to be part of your team?"" asked Sir Lancelot as he scanned through the names that were written on the sheet of parchment.

""Do you have a problem with that, He-who-engages-in-coitus-with-mothers?"" replied King Arthur who was casually lounging in his chair. The king was dressed in his silk pyjamas and had a jewel-encrusted eye-patch over his left eye. He and his best and only knight, Sir Lancelot, were sitting across from each other around the massive, round marble table that the king had specially ordered.

""Well, sir,"" said Lancelot. ""These men and women aren't even knights. Many of them aren't even warriors. I'm curious as to why you have selected these people to be part of the Round Table Initiative."" 

""The first man I have selected is the Iron Man. Did you know that he built a suit of armour just out of some scraps of steel while he was in a cell after being captured by Mordred?"" asked King Arthur.

""With all due respect, sir. Don't smiths do that every day?""

""And the boy. Spider-Man. He was bitten by a spider and he now has the ability to do a myriad of acrobatic tricks and has caught many thieves using fishing nets. Just like a spider catching a fly in its web!"" said King Arthur enthusiastically. 

""But your majesty, throwing nets does not sound that difficult. Also, the boy is a student of *science* and he believes that the earth is round. Wasn't it you who told us to burn all members of the Round Earth Society? And furthermore-"" Lancelot was cut off again.

""And let's not forget about the Captain. At over 70 years old, Cap still has the strength to carry a shield. And not just *any* shield. Oh, no. It's a shield made of the finest poplar wood reinforced with leather."" Lancelot was about to say something, but then closed his mouth, finding himself at a loss for words.

""And don't think I haven't forgotten about the ladies!"" said King Arthur. ""I have chosen to recruit the Black Widow. She is a beautiful, young slave girl that my men purchased from Africa. Her husband died years ago, leaving her more time to build her strength carrying things for the villagers. Nobody carries loads like she does! I am also wanting to recruit the feral man, Wolverine. The feral who was raised by wild beasts in the countryside. With his sharp, untrimmed claws of keratin, he will shred through any enemy that stands in our way.""

""The feral man?"" interrupted Lancelot. ""I thought he was part of the group of children who were all born with congenital defects under the care of the bald paedophilic cripple?""

""The cripple has permitted me to use this boy,"" said the king. ""In fact, he has even lent me two other of his genetically defected children. The fraternal twins, Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch. The boy can run 100 metres in 12 seconds and the girl has the power to manipulate the very foundation of reality resulting in entering of dreams of every man in the village. These superhuman powers are absolutely astounding, Lancelot.""

""First of all, I'm sure that someone can run 100 metres faster than that. And secondly, the girl is just hot. Of course all of the young men are fawning over her-""

""Oh, Sir Lancelot. Ye of little faith,"" said King Arthur. ""My list goes on, even including Doctor Strange, the sorcerer supreme, who fights maladies of mystical and demonic nature. He exorcises the negative energy from patients using leeches! Leeches! Can you believe it? But I do think he is busy caring for genuinely sick patients in town, so he will mainly just be making cameos in missions with his Chinaman slave. But I did save the best for last. His name is Hawkeye. And he is an archer."" 

King Arthur snapped his fingers and the door the room swung open. One by one, his chosen warriors marched into the room and gathered around the table, joining Arthur and Lancelot. They all came from different backgrounds with different life experiences, but the expressions on their faces were one and the same. They were ready to fight in the name of their king. They were all ready to put their lives on the line for their fellow citizens. 

""Welcome, friends,"" announced King Arthur with arms wide open. ""You are all a part of my Round Table Initiative. You will be the main team protecting my kingdom for a few years until the stories start becoming a bit stale. Then we will reboot the team, mix things around and pick out a few new village favourites to add to the team.""

""I still have my doubts,"" mumbled Lancelot. ""But if the King believes you all are the right choices, then so be it. Your first mission is to defeat the evil sorceress Morgan le Fay. Round Table! Assemble!""

[WP] Write a story about superheroes set in the medieval era.,RexReaver,"She spat blood from her mouth.

The sight of the crowd was dulled by her nausea, a throbbing desire to retch clawing her insides. What she could see through her swollen eyes was dark, splotches of muck and filth on her bound hands and down the bridge of her nose, now crooked and swelling. Her matted hair obscured one eye entirely, the other now peered into the crowd, who watched her in return.

She had expected more bloodlust.  Once she accepted this was happening, that the verdict would be carried out, then her mind had flooded with premonitions of their faces. Those faces were full of  spittle and anger and frustration at their meager existence. Those frustrations now finding an outlet in her crimes. She had known that they would despise her, raise their voices into piercing screams of ""witch!"" as they gleefully dragged her to the pyre. But today there was no joy, just the two guards who dutifully pulled her through the masses into the commons, and the crowd itself, which was cold, patient, and frankly indifferent.

Her bleeding abated as minutes passed.

She limply rested against the pole. The sky was blue, its crisp, calm air belied spring. A stray dog stirred as the entrance to the tower swung open. The crowd first flinched at the metallic click of the lock and then scampered back from the creak of its outward procession. Out from the darkness strode the trio of forms they had all waited for.

The priest spoke first, ""You were instructed to gag her.""

The statement was not yelled, but it was harsh, it was an imperative. One guard fumbled about, looking for cloth or cord, but found no instrument which met his needs. The other stood, ponderous, slow to react. One of the priest's partners swatted them aside, climbing beside her, shoving a wad of fabric between her teeth. She did gag, and then vomited, and it filled her mouth, found no outlet, and rushed out of her nose. Tears filled her eyes, fogging her vision as the last of the trio confronted her.

His voice was known, ""We must do battle. With enemies at our doorstep, on the eave of our domain, we must fight.""

It was her accuser, her lord, who had pled with her so recently for her aid. He had presented himself then with bent knee, humbly begging, and he had offered nothing but honor. But that voice had changed after their victory, upon the arrival of his masters, ""But do not forget, for I have not forgotten, that our enemies are not only at our door. No! They are within as well. They wait at night, biding their time.""

As his voice rose the crowd stirred. Always a man of bold speeches, he needed to rouse no troops today. Today he needed only to stoke the flames of fear.

""Today is a test we all face, together, as servants of God,"" the words accompanied a gesture to the priest. ""Whose words, words come from the highest of his order, words that bear no disagreement.""

The priest moved away from the trio, drawing the crowd's attention with him. He was tall, clean, and had a precision to his gait and his attire. 

""I have offered confession and penance,"" these words were rehearsed, suggesting a dire frequency of practice. He worked through his speech, walking near his audience, but he did not mingle. As he spoke he gestured toward her, but never looked her way. She was on display for them, she was a theological lesson in corpore, not worthy of his gaze. ""We have offered a chance at redemption, but we will offer no more. Proceed.""

The guard stepped forward, now carrying the lit torch, hesitant.  He looked to the priest and marshal for guidance, and then to the crowd.  Finally, the simple man turned, back to the pyre, and gestured the torched toward the base. And their lord, who gazed at her with familiar eyes, nodded approval.

The smoke came first, just as her vision had cleared, and those thin, gray tendrils curled between her cracked nails and abused fingers.  The flames were slow to find purchase and the audience grew restless. Finally, the heat climbed and the blaze followed. She tried to scream, first in fear, then in growing rage. It was inarticulate, born of pain and shame, emerging from a lifetime of isolation. She shook, her head shaking in spasms, body jerking in a frenetic dance, and the gag flew free. The crowd had eased back, unnerved by this new reality, but their troubled faces now cowered as she began to scream.

That fear was mirrored on the lord's face and that of his marshal, who had seen this act so recently. The priest's visage, however, turned to hatred as he strode toward the fire with his book clutched high. But as he opened his mouth to speak the flames vanished, rushing inward, and she tumbled from the heap, clutching her now charred restraints.

Their eyes met and held, his searching for dominion and finding none. He retreated back a step. She stretched her hands before her, obscuring their forms, and screamed again. With this second sound the flames burst forth, crossing the distancing between her palms and his book, engulfing him. The inferno continued around him and beyond, consuming the marshal and their lord. The searing heat was there but a few seconds and then gone.

She collapsed to her knees, a wild fear in her eyes, shaking before the piles of ash. She convulsed, first sobbing without sound and then let out a choked cry. With that noise the crowd broke and fled, animals pursued in the hunt.

She rose and cast off her bonds. Her stride became purposeful, over the ashes, through the town and then out. The sun was high in the sky as she vanished into the woods.

[WP] Write a story about superheroes set in the medieval era.,RexReaver,"""Horatio? What is it? The hole?"" spoke a feminine voice, ""Is it safe to come down now?""

""No, no! I've found some strange liquid down here,"" said Horatio as he descended further into the crash site of a meteor, ""Alyssa, draw a bath for me; I'll be back to the estate in four hours' time.""

Alyssa was hesitant, but she complied, she knew that it was best not to upset Horatio, even if she didn't think it was safe to be exploring some crash site.

""Hello Alyssa, is Horatio returning from that firey hole yet?"" said Mrs. Adams as she put down her book and quill, ""I haven't seen him since that damn thing crashed.""

""No madam, he did tell me to draw a bath, though."" replied Alyssa. ""Excuse me while I do that.""

Horatio returned some *seven hours* later, by the time he returned everyone had thought he either died or got trapped in that hole. Alyssa was most worried, for she was the only one to notice a slight green hue attached to Horatio's figure.

""Oh you wouldn't believe it honey!"" cried Horatio as he stripped his dirty clothes, ""I found an absolutely beautiful gem down in that hole. Looks like it's the only thing to survive the crash site.""

""Oh my, it is quite, er, large. But yes, it is beautiful."" said Mrs. Adams, who honestly did not want anything to do with that gem, for she saw it as a sign from the devil himself. ""Honey, Alyssa drew you a bath some time ago, go wash off and retire to bed with me, please. It has been a long day.""

Alyssa was tucked away in the bath house behind some garments, she needed to confirm that she had saw the green hue around her employer. Horatio entered the bath house and sunk right into the now cold tub filled with water from the nearby stream. But, as he started scrubbing himself, the water began boiling and turning into a familiar shade of green. Unable to control herself, Alyssa leapt forward and attempted to assist Horatio out of the tub.

""Horatio, sir, come out of the tub please!"" Alyssa whispered to the tub, but she got no answer, for Horatio was submerged entirely in the tub. ""Sir!"" 

""My goodness, what is all this noise!"" said the voice of Mrs. Adams as she opened the door to the bath house, ""Goodness *girl*, what are you doing in here! Where is Horatio? Why is that water green!""

""Madam, the sir is under the water!"" explained Alyssa, ""He was glowing green when he returned and I think he is having some type of reaction to the gem he found or something, please help!"" 

""There, lay him on the floor!"" said Mrs. Adams as she and Alyssa fished Horatio body out of the tub, ""Oh my, his skin is more red than an apple!""

Alyssa shot up forward and ran to grab some milk. She remembered reading in one of the sir's books that milk can help cure temporary hotness in the mouth. To Alyssa, this was close enough. 

When Alyssa reentered the bath house, Horatio was on his feet and in the tub, *no*, he was *on* the tub.

""Oh my goodness!"" cried Mrs. Adams as the close dink of a milk bucket hitting the floor came from behind her, ""He is *walking on water!*""

""Impossible, only the lord can do that, and he has yet to return!"" whispered Alyssa as she fell to her knees in shock.

""Alyssa, don't you see?"" said Mrs. Adams as she scattered next to Alyssa on the ground, ""That stone was the lord, and Horatio is now the lord's humble servant. He is the lord now!""

""What in the king's name?"" said Horatio as he turned around, still floating on the water, ""What are you two doing?""

""S-sir, you're walking on the water!"" whispered Alyssa who was now bowing down, following Mrs. Adam's example, ""You are the lord!""

""I am the Lord?"" thought Horatio, as he extended his hand and sent out a small spark, ""Hmm, *I am the lord*. Loyal subjects, spread the word, I have returned, stronger than ever, and with new abilities to purge the world of Satan's spawn. I am here to save you all!""",Speedicus
[WP] Write a story about superheroes set in the medieval era.,RexReaver,"The castle looked almost pristine, despite being under siege for eight months now, firmly protected by the holy energy field emanated from the bones of Saint Kolosius. The defenders had stolen the invaluable relic during the New Kellington uprising, not to mention five bulging sacks of gold from the royal treasurer.
Sir Tim frowned and stared at the gates, soon he would hang these cowards and petty thieves, if God´s willing. The mercenary hadn´t arrived yet, the reckless fighter who was only known by the name of Catapult. His service was costly, but what to expect from a guy who shoots himself behind enemy lines with a ballista. There where rumors that he was invulnerable, so he could easily survive the fall and fight against superior numbers. Some said he was a demon and should only be hired when everything else has failed. Well, that seemed to be the case here, thought Sir Tim.

A hesitant smile sneaked onto his face. When Catapult failed, would he leave a bloody stain on the castle walls? 
This would be hilarious to watch, despite the humilation for the besiegers.
Sir Tim looked at the filthy tents and at his brave men, they needed a victory or a little amusement, regardless how shameful it might be.

[WP] Write a story about superheroes set in the medieval era.,RexReaver,"She had killed him, but this time it was her *own* fault. 

We wrapped the Overseer  in several layers of blankets, but he still bled through.  The following night, we dumped him in the river, where the fish will finish the job for us. I hold my shivering daughter in a tight embrace for the longest time. She's warm, nearly weightless. Her tears soak into my garments but I didn't care. I feel her shoulders heave with every sob. 

""It's all right, Reyna. Shh, shh...it wasn't your fault...""

But it was. I saw it happen right in front of me. Maybe she was comforted by my lies, maybe she wasn't. 

We're running out of time. The other guards will notice that their friend had not returned from his sweep. Surely, they'll report back to the monarchy, and send the rest of their men. 

The world has always feared what they didn't understand. 

...

""You heard of what happened to the pyromancer? He drowned himself."" said the stranger across from me. He's wearing battered silver armor and has a crossbow slung over his shoulder. He laughs obnoxiously, waking up the whore sleeping on his cot in the other room. ""Ironic, innit? And that flying man...he's gonna drop like a stone one day...""

""I thought you said we were *alone*."" I angrily hiss. I keep a close eye on the prostitute. She's busy trying to fit her chest into a corset.

""She's just a doll. That's all. Heh. Don't worry about her. She ain't too smart. The only thing deep about her is her throat.""

*Good god, what a despicable man.*


""Fine."" I replied calmly, drinking from my goblet. ""I need your help.""  I produce a pouch from my pack and set it firmly on the table. Something inside clatters. ""2500 in gold pieces.""

The stranger arches his brow, wiping his mouth of grease. ""2500 for what?""

""I need safe passage through the border.""

""Hmm. How many?""

""Two.""

""Including you?""

""Including me.""

""Who referred me?""

""Heard from a friend of a friend. Of another friend.""

He snorts. ""You know...if you get caught trying to sneak out of the kingdom...they're hang you. Maybe burn you on a cross like with the Wellington Witches near the northern coves. Say...you're not one of those *freaks,* are you? Or with a Coven?""

""No.""

""You are, aren't you? I can see when you're lying. Trust me...I've tortured enough men to know that. I don't care if you're one of them. Relax. If you ask me, I think they're fascinating. Gods...among men.""

""I'm aware of the risks you're taking.""

The stranger ponders my proposal for a while, toying around with the beans on his plate. I look around anxiously, hoping that a High Lord doesn't come through.

""Deal."" He shakes my hand, gripping it tightly. ""We'll meet at dusk. Near the clocktower. What's your name?""

""You don't need to know. Don't be late."" 



...

""Father, where are we going?"" asks Reyna, still groggy. I'm surprised she could still get some rest, given the rattling of the carnage's frame. 

""Somewhere safe. We're going to see a doctor. A special doctor who can cure you.""

""He can cure me? Like what the priest tried to do?""

""No, he's different. I don't know. But it's all we have.""

""Do you really believe that? That what's inside me can be banished?""

""Reyna, don't think like that.""

The freezing rain continues to splatter against the transport. Combined with galloping of the twin steeds, I can barely hear myself think. How the stranger can stand this weather, I haven't the faintest idea. Out in the forests, only the huntsmen and beast masters live out here, each willing to turn a blind eye. But I still worry. After what happened at the village, I don't know what to think anymore. 

""How's your head doing?"" I ask Reyna, who's biting her nails. ""Reyna, don't do that. It's a bad habit.""

""S-sorry. My head's okay. Sometimes...I feel dizzy. Out of breath, even.""

""Can you still control her? Talk to her?""

""I haven't heard her in days.""

""Good. That's a good sign."" 

""She's coming back."" responds Reyna. 

""What?""

""She always comes back. Always.""

The transport grinds to a halt.

I knock on the frame. ""What's happening?""

The stranger lights himself a pipe. ""Checkpoint. Three Overseers. Must've patrolled from one of them outposts."" he whispers. ""Don't move. Don't bloody breath. Got it?""

""Uh-huh."" I motion for Reyna to crawl through to the back and hide underneath a blanket with the crates of moonshine. 

""Father, what's going on?""

""Nothing, nothing. Just hide, all right? It'll be over.""

""What about you-""

""Reyna! Don't argue. Go!""

Outside, I can hear the neighing of other horses in our vicinity. Then...the familiar sound of swords being unsheathed. I grab a dagger from my belt and lie in wait, my ears pressed against the wall.

""Evening, Overseers."" greets the stranger with a dose of cheer, lighting an oil lantern. ""Beautiful weather, innit?""

""State your business here, traveler."" growls one of the Overseers. 

""Just a merchant. Passing through to deliver a few crates of moonshine to Vaori."" 

""Vaori, huh? Why you going through the woods instead of the canyon?""

""I enjoy the scenic route. It's a personal pleasure of mine."" responds the stranger. ""You fellows been to Vaori? It's lovely there.""

""It's a pig sty."" responds the Overseer. I can hear the suction of his boots as they clamp onto the muddy soil. He's inches from my face, yet he can't see me. I fight the urge to kill him right then and there. ""We're sweeping the area for the members of the Coven. Seen any of them?""

""No, sir. Nothing.""

""We're offering a 6000 gold bounty on whoever can find them The King wants them dead. Dare I say I agree with the fat bastard for once.""

""6000?"" asks the stranger. ""That's quite...something.""

My heart sinks. Surely, this stranger would honor the arrangement. Surely, there are still decent men in this world?

""You sure you haven't seen anyone? We got witnesses back in town saying they spotted two suspicious figures at the clocktower.""

""They dangerous?""

""The girl slaughtered an entire convoy a while back. She and her father have been on the run ever since.""

""I've seen them."" answers the stranger. 

No. No. No. No.

""They're in the back.""

Damn him. Damn him to hell.

I leap out of the carriage, knocking the vulnerable Overseer on the ground as I plunge the tip of my weapon into his throat. His lungs will be flooded with his own blood soon enough. 

""You've got some balls, old man..."" cackles the stranger, loading up his crossbow. I slide behind the back. Meanwhile, the other Overseer flanks around the right, slicing me in the arm with his broadsword. Pain jolts up my limb. 

""Father!"" screams out Reyna, emerging from her hiding place. 

""Reyna, get back! Do as I say-"" I shove the Overseer into a tree, smashing his skull open. The sound it makes is...nauseating. An arrow strikes my leg. I fall to the ground with a mouthful of dirt and an ever increasing feeling of helplessness. 

""Sorry, mate. But I need the money."" said the stranger. The other Overseer runs over to his fallen comrades. ""Walk away.""

""You killed them, you son of a bitch! Where's the girl?"" snarls the Overseer.

""Reyna...agh...run...run away..."" I gurgle.

I see her. Her bare feet standing before me. 

""Ah, there's the sweet little murderous vixen I've been hearing all about. Why don't you-"" begins the stranger.

I see her. No, not my daughter. 

*Her.* Whoever she is...she's not my daughter.

Not a witch...or a demon.

Something *else.*

The stranger is lifted up in the air by an invisible force. I crawl behind a bush, prying the arrow out while crying out in pain. ""Reyna, don't! Reyna!""

It's futile. 

His heart is violently ripped out of his rib cage. It casually plops against a bush, the branches skewering it.

The stranger takes a breath for the very last time.

""Oh my god...please...please...no!"" screams the panicking Overseer. ""Get away!""

He tries to run, but slips in the mud. 

It didn't matter.

They never get very far.

It goes on for minutes. She takes her time, bringing forth unimaginable acts of malice. The noises the body makes are unbearable. I can feel the bile settling in the back of my throat. I lay still, letting every single drop of water pelt my clammy skin. 

Then...she returns.

""Oh my god...oh god..."" My daughter vomits. Chunky yellow bits of undigested food splash against the puddles of blood and rainwater.
 
I bring myself up, limping to her with caution.  ""Reyna, is that you? That really you?"" I ask.

She starts crying out of remorse. Her hands are a dark shade of red. ""I-I just killed all those-""

""Doesn't matter. You're safe."" I spit out some blood, nearly tripping over the scattered limbs. 

""Father, (sobs) I'm sorry...""

I kiss her on the forehead. ""Shh. Shh. It's over. It was your other side, not you. Always remember that. Don't blame yourself. Come on. Get inside. We're already two days behind.""

I grab the reins, and ride until the darkness swallows us whole.

[WP] Write a story about superheroes set in the medieval era.,RexReaver,"The Shadow fell across the landscape. It was alone in the world, and it preferred it that way.

The shadow had fell from another world, a place where people did not have names, but were part of a gestalt. The closest equivalent from this planet was that of a ant nest, a single unit composed of several other units. As the hive, it was happy, and it went forth and it took over other worlds. The other races protested, but it ignored these protests. They stopped protesting when they were assimilated, and that was good.

But one day, some of the gestalt broke off. The Shadow did not know how or why, but it ended up falling to Earth. And, for the first time, the piece of the gestalt was lonely. It could not contact its others, and knew what it felt like to be separate.

Soon, a few of the simians that lived here found it. They were elderly, and part of the class of what the Shadow would later know was called peasants, and they took it in. They did not know what the Shadow was, but somehow found it within their hearts to care for the creature, and helped nurture the creature to health. For a year, the Shadow lived with them, trying to find a way to contact home.

One day,  a group of knights attacked the peasants for not supplying enough crops. These were stressful, bloody days, and attacking the poor was often a good way for the soldiers to blow off steam. But when the knights  attacked the Shadow's caretakers, they were suddenly attacked by a creature that they would describe as “painted black, speaking with multiple voices, impermeable to sword or arrow.” 

The knights were predictably laughed at by the others. But soon, legends began to spread of a heroic shadow, who would protect the fields from any knights attempting to take over the land.

The Shadow used to be part of a hive, who would terrorize other races, just like the nobles of Earth terrorized the peasants that the Shadow now defended. But the Shadow was alone now, and although it missed home, it was beginning to accept its new role on this planet.",Scott_Pilgrim_Fan

I put on my tag to help the Smells know who and where I am. I'm lucky my mom is one, since I kind of stink at making sure it smells the same each day.

Day. That... it reminds me of something.

Oh, yeah! I shoot up in my bed. I'm old enough to form a pact. Me, Fion, and Molly just need to find a touch and a taste.

I hurry out.

Fion is waiting for me. I can hear her tapping her foot. I smile. I walk towards where she is and take her hand, resting against the wall where it always is.

""Got it."" She says, with the practiced ease of saying it every morning. It's been her way of letting me now I did it right since before I can remember, and every morning I look forward to hearing her voice say something so crystal clear.

I hear Molly sneeze. She says something that probably means I should keep my tag in better condition, but I'm not certain.

We walk. I feel a bit nervous.

""You should reawy  cutyour hair."" Fion says, and I wince just a little.

""And risk hitting an ear?"" I sign.

She sighs. ""Ma. Be I cou-"" She says.

I quickly sign to ask what's wrong.

She pulls me along towards something, saying something about somebody needing help. I listen for Molly. She's running with Fion, used to these antics.

When we stop, I hear someone breathing heavy. Molly asks ""Blood?""

I hear Fion shake Molly's head, making her slightly dizzy, the quickest way to communicate.

Then I hear someone mutter something. Two strangers. Neither talks like they can hear what they're saying.

I sign to Fion ""How bad is it.""

""Really.""

She then says, ""A touch and a taste. I'm going to sign to the touch to figure out what happened.""

I try and comfort Molly. I cuss, safe in the knowledge no one can hear me, for not thinking to bring any aromas for her.

""The Taste was mugged. Touch tried to help, and he got jumped. They're both bleeding a lot.""

I realize we can't coordinate getting these two to the hospital. Not when we have Molly to take care of.

I pull Fion aside. We quickly argue, then come to a decision. Fion rummages through my bag. The right ingredients. She quickly signs to the touch and mixes up the concoction, putting it in front of Molly's nose, who smiles, then waves her on impatiently. I hear the man gurgle and sputter.

Finally I piece it together and blush at how long it took me. That's what Fion ""sees"". The others react pretty much like me. Me and Fion quickly pick up the two kids, and Molly carefully walks between us.

[WP] People are only born with one sense. The best option is if they find four teammates to accomplish everyday tasks.,Scumshius,"It was cleaning day in Corral Ninety, Texas. As usual, the doors of the Sight cells were the first to open. Sight-83925 got up from his bunk grudgingly and shuffled out into the corridor to join the other nineteen Sights of his block. Like a well-drilled platoon of soldiers, they began their march.

At the next block, each of the Sights lined up in front of a cell. When the doors swung open, they went inside and led their respective Touches outside by hand. Sight-83925 gave Touch-81131 a squeeze on the arm, and watched as she returned the gesture. He avoided looking into her blank eyes.

Linked this way, they headed toward their designated zone. Before they arrived however, they had to pass by the supply gate where they received their tools. Handing them out were two monstrous, black, tentacled aliens, known as Shepherds.

Since his birth nineteen years ago, they were the only authority figures Sight had ever known. Never a day went by that he didn't feel repulsed looking at them. Though the lessons said they had always been on Earth, ruling over the cattle that was mankind, Sight suspected they had come as conquerors.

Trying not to show his disgust, he guided Touch's hand toward a tattered rag. He himself took a pail. Some of the others received mops, brooms or cleaning fluids.

They spent the next hour scrubbing the walls near the cafeteria. Sight's only role was to refill the pail every now and then with fetid water from a rusty pipe. He thought he could almost imagine the boredom as a physical weight on his body.

The two of them had been working for close to seven months now. Touch reacted to his guiding hand with uncanny speed, as though she could sense his intentions.  She seemed unusually cheerful today. Then again, she was cheerful almost all the time. Once, she twirled around to celebrate after scrubbing a particular stain, whipping her golden hair into his face by accident. She began giggling after that, drawing a smile from him.

When the water in the pail had gone from gray to black, he went to refill it. However, before he could empty it fully into a drain, a pair of legs collided into him and knocked him off-balance. Water splashed out as the pail went rolling away.

He leaped to his feet and shook his fist at the person responsible, an older man with a bushy beard now sprawled on the floor. The fellow wasn't looking at him, but his mouth continued to move rapidly, possibly swearing in words Sight couldn't hear.

His companion, however, seemed apologetic. His head was cocked to the side, and Sight realized he was listening to the pail and piecing together what had happened. Or, more likely, he was listening to his companion.

Sight's anger turned into suspicion. During Cleaning, Hearings, Smells and Tastes weren't allowed into the area for fear they would get in the way of cleaners. So what were these two doing here?

Hooking a hand under the fallen man's arm, he tugged him to his feet. The fellow nodded his thanks and continued talking. Neither were looking at him, but he had a feeling their attention was fully on him.

Feeling foolish, Sight cleared his throat and said, ""See."" The word felt unnatural on his tongue. He wondered if it even sounded like he imagined it.

Hearing frowned and stuck his finger under his companion's nose. The man sniffed and stopped talking. The trio stood motionless for a moment. Some of the other Sight cleaners were beginning to stare. At last, Sight said, ""Why? Here?"" If only he didn't need to talk, not in front of a Hearing. The insecurity only grew with each uttered word.

Luckily for him, Hearing seemed to understand. He began speaking, but faltered halfway as he seemingly remembered who he was talking to. Instead, he dug around in the pocket of his overalls before producing a small piece of carbon and—Sight's jaw dropped—a piece of white paper. With jerky motions, he scrawled out an almost illegible word: ""Escape"".

Sight burst into laughter, earning him a glare from Hearing. How were these two planning to escape when they couldn't even see where they were going? Smell, oblivious to everything that was going on, begin talking again. With a look of irritation, Hearing held the piece of paper under his nose.

""Where? Go?"" Sight said. ""Escape? How? Who?""

""Come along. Help us,"" Hearing wrote. Sight winced, realizing that his speech must be as bad as the man's writing.

Sight glanced at Touch, who was standing idle by the wall with a broad grin on her face. She must have finished. It was a stupid idea, but looking at her ... someone like her deserved to be anywhere but trapped inside this horrible, grimy building her whole life.

""Wait. Friend. Come with,"" he said. As he dashed toward Touch, he glanced at the alien guards. None seemed the wiser; they continued to hover almost motionlessly at their stations.

Taking Touch's hand, he led her back to the others, who had been joined by another girl. She had several brownish stains on the front of her clothes, and seemed to be munching on something. A small bag of fruit was tucked into each pocket. One of the Taste cooks, then.

""She come?"" he said.

Hearing nodded and showed him the paper. There was a crude sketch of a humanoid figure pouring what looked like a turd into a bowl. His eyes widened. ""You. Bad food?""

I rolled over and woke Touch. Touch would feel around for the light switch and wake Vision. Vision was our cook, so Touch and Vision teamed up to start breakfast. The smell of coffee woke Smell. Vision and touch were the closest to each other, because they had a communication method between them that was intricate and effective. Vision, who's outside name was Rose, would use her sight to guide her hands onto Touch's, and communicate through a series of squeezes. Touch would squeeze back, and while Vision couldn't feel these squeezes, she could see Touch's hand moving.

[WP] People are only born with one sense. The best option is if they find four teammates to accomplish everyday tasks.,Scumshius,"The neurocommunicator in my ear sparked to life, transmitting a message into my mind. ""Found the last one!"" Goddammit, it was Touchy Joe.  

The five of us reconvened at the front porch and counted our eggs. To my chagrin, Joe had overcome my vision advantage and edged me out, coming up with nine to my seven. Earl the Ear trailed behind with the three noisemaking eggs. The remaining egg had been sniffed out by Smelly Kevin, who claimed that it smelled particularly pungent compared to the rest. 

""Wow, Joe. How on earth did you beat Iris?""

""Earl, my boy. All your hiding spots are just too predictable.""

""Bet he cheated.""

""That's a bold accusation from someone who tried to cover all the eggs in cow dung beforehand.""

The three continued to quarrel, their argument a high-pitched whine in my head. All the while, our final companion remained quiet. Only I could see that she was sulking.
 
""What's wrong, Tasty Tina?"" I asked. She shook her head, stood up, and went inside the house.

I started a private neurochat between the three guys and myself. ""Guys, I think Tina's been feeling a bit excluded lately. We should do something for her.""

They stopped their squabbling. ""What do you mean?"" asked Earl.

""She didn't get any eggs from the Easter hunt. I don't know; she doesn't get to participate in our activities as much as we do.""

""You know who really gets the shaft? Me. Every time we play a smelling game, you guys pick the worst stuff to stick up my nose.""

""Shut up, Kevin,"" Joe cut him off. ""We should do something for Tina. Something that she'd really enjoy.""

""We could bake her a cake!"" I offered.

""As long as I get to smell the spoon.""

And so it was decided. We filed into the kitchen and prepared to bake our first cake. In fact, it was the first time we had cooked anything on our own. As with all our activities, I led the charge, setting out all the ingredients, reading the recipe, and hovering around everyone to make sure everything was going to plan. Under my guidance, Touchy Joe handled the recipe's execution, making good use of the practiced dexterity only he had at his disposal. Smelly Kevin used his discerning nose to ensure that nothing we were using had expired. Finding himself with little to contribute, Earl the Ear stood guard outside Tasty Tina's bedroom door, ready to alert us should she leave her room.

After a few hours, we had finished. The cake looked delicious to me and smelled delicious to Kevin, so we had Earl call Tina down. We moved to the living room and hid behind the couch, even though I realized it probably wasn't necessary.

The moment I saw Tina round the corner of the wall, I jumped from my spot. ""Surprise!"" And I smashed the cake into her face.

""What the FUCK?"" she screamed into the neurocom, ""Did you just throw a cake into my face?""

""Hold on...that's not right,"" I said. 

Kevin groaned. ""I knew we should've waited for Common Sense Chris to come home.""",hideouts

For smell people would probably wear tags meant to convey a few details about themselves and there'd have to be a careful program to train smells to recognize what each smell means. It also depends on if having no sense of touch means you can't feel anything whatsoever or if your skin lacks functional nerve endings. Like, would they feel if an arm is ripped off?

Taste would be basically helpless, and offers almost nothing a well trained Smell doesn't cover.",N8-disciple-of-foot

The ringtone of the cellphone breaks the streams of thought Agent Ishimani was having. All that mayhem in the downtown happened just today morning, but driving down the curvy, forest roads all that seemed so distant. So long back.

Camera pans inside the car. A man dressed in lack suit, black shirt, black tie, black glasses, black shoes is driving the vehicle. The camera over the badge hanging from let upper pocket of his suit.
 It reads Agent Roshuel Ishimani B.A.S.I.C.

The  phone rings again. Agent Ishimani checks the phone screen, it is from his boss at B.A.S.I.C headquarters. He is less than happy to the pick up the call but he picks it up.

""Yes, sir"" he says in a formal voice.
A short pause ....
""Yes I am going to the Nesina mansion to cover the case of Ice Walker"" 
a short pause 
""Sure sir, I will let you know if anything out of ordinary comes up.""

By time he hangs the phone. He already coming up to a clearing that leads to a driveway at the end of which he can see a large, gloomy mansion. The rusty gates are open wide enough that he can drive his SUV through. As he comes to a stop in-front of the door, the wheels of his vehicle skid momentarily over the fine gravel and then come to a stop. As the engine stops, a quite, eerie silence takes over. Agent Ishimani comes out of the car, straightens his suit and takes a last look at the line of wood in the distance. It is already evening. He gets his thought together, fetches his folder and closes the door. A few short steps and he reaches for the tiny doorbell next to the huge Oaken doors. It is only a few moments before a women opens the door.

""Mrs. Nesina?""

""Yes, who is this?"" The woman sounded both annoyed and angry. Not curious. 

""Sorry, Ma'am I need to confirm your identity before I can introduce myself. I can however assure you that while I am here on official business I am not affiliated with any court of law."" said the agent.

She narrowed her eyes and gave him a long, hard look. Like she was trying to decide if she wanted to let him in, kill him, or possibly seduce him. That look had some seriously conflicting emotions built in. Agent Ishimani stood firm, handling such situations was part of his daily job. He was used to it. Finally she gave a curt nod, opened the door wider, then said,
 
""Yes. I'm Dame Nesina. You may call me Dame Nesina or Madame. Since you seem to be formal today, please come in. I presume this will take some time?""

""Yes, Madame."" She nodded, then gestured. Agent Ishimani followed her down a long, broad hallway with vaulted ceilings and paintings on the walls that were probably worth more than most homes in the USA.

Eventually, after a long walk during which the only sound was of pointy lady heels and a pair of boots on the wooden floor, she led him into a sitting room. She sat on a straight-backed Victorian era--probably authentic--chair that was both opulent in its design and severe in it's form. Straight backed, adorned with gold and gems, it could have been luxurious, but instead it spoke of severity. Agent Ishimani was impressed but his face showed no new expressions. It was all part of the job.

She gestured him to sit on similar chair opposite her. This chair, however Ishimani felt was subtly wrong. Probably the seat was too high from the ground and both too narrow and too short. It was uncomfortable. Although, he kept his posture formal and his face still showing no new emotions.

She gave him that Look again, then finally clapped twice. Seconds later a young maid came out carrying a tray with several steaming carafes. ""Tea, sir? Or would you prefer coffee? We also have hot chocolate and hot cider.""

With a moment of hesitation, Agent Ishimani looked into the eye of the timid maid and said ""Hot chocolate will be fine, thank you.""

The hostess gave Agent Ishimani an appraising look at that, but said nothing until the maid poured him a generous mug of the stuff--extremely thick, rich. A thin wisp of steam float up from the cup. He took a sip and looked at his hostess.

This is first he had good look at his hostess. She was probably in her forties. She was thin but had absurdly busty figure. She wore a black skirt and a red blouse, she didn't wore much jewelry except for a ring with an absurdly large, pink stone which she wore on her right hand. 

She took a mug of hot chocolate as well.

After the maid left, she sat there savoring her drink for a few minutes. Finally she said, ""Are you aware of how my family garnered its fortunes?""

""No Madame. It didn't seem relev..."" She cut him off with a wave of her hand.

""Chocolate. That's why I was surprised you chose it. The very few visitors we get here either gush about it immediately or seem oddly shy. You were neither. Did you realize how much money there is in chocolate?""

He said. ""Yes, Madame. It's a very lucrative place for some.""

""Just so."" She took a sip, and then turned her full attention to the Agent.
""Now, young man, I suppose you should tell me just who in the name of all the gods you are, and why you are in my house.""


""Yes Madame, of course. My name is Roshuel Ishimani, and I am with the UltraForensics division of ...""

She cut him off again-- it was getting more and more difficult for the agent to keep his formal, emotionless face. 

""B.A.S.I.C. I am familiar with your organization.""

This time expression of surprise was clearly visible on the agent’s face.

""Young man, the Nesina family is not new to circles of power. We keep tabs on the real power brokers.""

""Of course, Madame. Dame Nesina, I regret to inform you that today, during an Event involving The Dark and several B.A.S.I.C.-sponsored Paranormal, your daughter was killed at about 11:15 A.M. I--""

""Which daughter?"" ... the agent visibly irritated at this frequent interruption.

Which daughter? Uh... ""I'm sorry Madame, we weren't aware that you had more than one daughter. She had earlier identified herself to one of the Paras as 'Ice Walker'. Are you familiar with her work in that role?""

She gave him an appraising look. 
""Of course. So..."" She drummed her fingers on the arm of her chair. ""So little Arys got herself killed did she? 
That was careless of her. I'll have to tell her to be more careful.""

""I'm sorry Madame, you'll have to tell her to be more careful?""

""Well yes. Can't have my daughters running around getting killed all the time, now can I? It's unprofessional. It's also bad for our other business.""

The now agent was pretty sure he was way out of his league on this one.

""Madame, I'm not aware of your other business, but are you implying that your daughter isn't dead?""

""Well of course she's dead. That's hardly relevant."" She laughed.

Agent Ishimani had a feeling his hostess was playing with him. He calmed himself and said ""Madame, I'm supposed to offer our apology and the standard Para-related death compensation package."" 

""Oh that won't be necessary. As you can see, young man, we have no need of money. The apology is appreciated, though. Very professional of you. I do like to see that at least some people remember the professional courtesies. It's been so long since anyone really worried much about that.""

""Of course Madame. At B.A.S.I.C. we are trying to be the good guys, after all.""

She laughed again, a musical, seductive sound.

""When you're a few centuries older, child, you'll realize that it's not the heroes that want the world to be polite. No, heroes don't care. After all, they're the good guys. And absolute bastards every last one of them. Why be polite to the bad guys? No, true politeness has always come from the sort of people who are more likely to rape you and your cat and then eat the both of you. When a person has to eat human flesh to survive, both you and they want to avoid any sort of unpleasantness so that you don't end up on the menu. The dinner, not the dinner-guest.""

Agent Ishimani coughed and panicked for a moment than straighten himself up. ""I don't think I'd really ever considered the problem in quite that light before, Madame.""


""Give it time."" She stood suddenly, walked over to his chair and leaned forward, her shirt gaping open and giving him frankly, the best view he had in quite some time. This was not going according to plan. She noticed him noticing her and gave him a slow, languid--and frankly quite wicked--smile. 

""Now that we've been introduced, and you've done your job--quite admirably too--why don't we retire to somewhere more relaxing?""

Hesitatingly and sliding down a bit from his chair Agent Ishimani said.

""Madame, that sounds lovely, and I really appreciate the offer, but unfortunately, I am on business here, and policy is very clear. Since you seem familiar with my employer, I'm sure you understand how their termination policy works.""

She smiled, then slid onto his lap, wrapping her arms around and turned her face to his, and smiled. ""I know it's not allowed. After all, I helped write that policy.""

Then she kissed him. For a moment Agent Ishimani felt that time had slowed down and he had a sensation of absolute pleasure. But then his senses came back and he panicked. He jumped out of his seat, and bolted for the door, dumping the all too pretty Dame Nesina onto the floor.",fiximon

“Hi, may I speak with a Rhonda Johnson please?”

“This is Rhonda.”

“Hi Rhonda.  You may call me Mr. Smith.  Let’s see… These phone calls are never easy for me to make, so let’s just jump right into it.  When is the last time that you heard from your son, miss Johnson?”

“Jimmy…?  Oh my god!  Did you find Jimmy?!”

“Well… kind of.  What do you know of Jimmy’s line of work?”

“Well, I’m not sure anymore.  He was hanging overhead lights as an electrician for some Doctor about 5 years ago or so.  He would occasionally send some money to help out with things around here. He knew that things were pretty hard around here and he would try to do everything to help out.  I haven’t received anything from him for about a year now.”

“Well ma’am… With the info that you just gave me, I think that I can fill in some of the blanks for you, and maybe give you some closure about Jimmy.”

“I don’t understand… Closure?  Is everything alright?”

“Well, about five years ago, Jimmy was hanging lights…but they weren’t the type of lighting that you would want to read a book with.”

“What are you talking about, Mr. Smith?”

“Jimmy was hanging high energy laser defense turrets for Dr. Von Clod.”

“I don’t understand… isn’t that the person who has been in the news a lot lately?  He was the lunatic that was on some island fortress and was defeated recently by one of the super heros right?”

“That’s right ma’am, he was defeated by Captain Inferno a few days ago.”

“Why would Jimmy be working for someone like Doctor von Clump?”

“It’s Doctor von Clod, ma’am.  Super villains are known to pay quite well actually.  It is probably how he was able to send you some money earlier in his career.”

“So where is Jimmy now?  Is he alright?”

“Well ma’am, Jimmy was shipped off to the island fortress about a year ago, which is probably why you haven’t heard from him in such a long time.  No cell service and none of the major letter carriers deliver there.  He was pretty well cut off from society.  Anyways, this last battle that you alluded to, from the news, with Captain Inferno, Jimmy was there.”

“He was on the Island at that time!?”

“Yes ma’am… I’m not sure how to tell you this, but Jimmy was killed in the line of action.”

“No!  How are you sure?  Do you have a body?  Maybe he is still alive, maybe you have the wrong person?”

“Well ma’am, that is something that you can actually help me with.  We don’t have a body, but we do have some security footage.  I will email some photos to you right now… alright the images should be in your inbox now.  Can you please see if you can identify Jimmy?”

“Sure…Sure, this is all such a shock… alright I am opening the attachment now…. Oh… That’s my Jimmy alright, look at him, he sure is moving fast isn’t he?”

“ummm… moving ma’am?  I just sent you some still shots.”

“No this is clearly a video.  Oh, look at my little Jimmy, he looks like he is so happy, I wish I could watch this forev- OH MY GOD!  What Happened to Jimmy’s head!?”

“Oh Crap.  Ma’am, I am so sorry, I meant to send you only a picture.  I accidently sent you the actual security footage.”

I stated with a sigh and an expression resembling an upside-down smirk. Rick came over and squatted next to me. 

""Damn,""
 
He studied the ground from our perch atop The Van. 

""When Martian Man and Marsh Man go to war they don't play,"" 

Bodies littered the highway turned battlefield. 

""There must be over 200,"" 

Each man (or woman, in the case of a few due to the Diversity program spearheaded by the DoSu.) 

""Welp, better get to font-checking."" 

Rick grumbled, hopping off The Van. At 54 and counting, I carefully stepped downgripping the edges tightly as I did so. I was there back in the olden days. Back when Captain Zimbabwe and Captain Zambia had such a fierce rivalry that they had to close the borders between the two powers. I was there when Ice Man took on Iceland Man in the Battle of L'Enfont Plaza The names had changed but the endless lines henchman and highly praised supers hadn't. 

The biggest change were the year-to-year font changes. The only way to identify the bodies was through fonts. Each family had a special font that proudly displayed the famous red MM displayed proudly on the skin-tight suits. There were the famous Super Houses, who'd become synonymous with the name, like the Sans, or the Calibris. Then there were the lesser known ones. For every Roman there were 5 Steamers. Sure, the media wouldn't report on them, and no one would wear a Pickwick font MM jersey to school, but they existed and more importantly, they were our job. 

I stared at the body of a HM who had fallen right next to the wound. He had a pale, long face with light freckles and hazel eyes. Curly, red hair fell to the side in a tangled mess. The two teeth marks on the shoulder gave it away easily as Martian Man. The font was definitely a handwriting font, similar to Sans, but with sraighter, more defined sides and edges. I whipped out my laptop and pulled up the database. A quick check confirmed my suspicons that it was a Tekton. I loaded him into the van, alongside a pair of Kuenstler twins that Rick had found.

Around a half an hour later, I loaded a Dragonwick in and whistled sharply. That was our signal. that one of us was gonna take them in. We usually got around fifty before heading out. 51 lifeless bodies, mostly males aged 15-23 were stacked in the trunk. I started up The Van and headed out.

First stop, Dragonwick, the last to go in were always the last to go out. I slammed the car door shut, and slicked back my gray hair once more. My scruffy mustache made it hard to look professional but I tried. I grabbed the crinkly bouquet of roses and did the customary signal of ringing the doorbell three times in fast sucession, and then a fourth of couple seconds later. I waited, shifting my feet. As many of these I have had to over years, I still get nervous for everyone. I've had over 200 guns pulled on my throughout my career. I did not intend for this day to be my last. The door creaked open, and to my relief, an old, gunless lady stepped out in a flower shirt. tears welled in her eyes. I started my spiel.

""Mrs. Dragonwick, on behalf of myself and my associates at-""

""I understand."" 

She interrupted quietly, wiping glistening tear drops from her cheeks. 

""Mrs. Dragonwick, I'm sorry for your loss.""

""I just have one question for you,""

She said between short sniffles.

""Why do you do this?""

I'd heard the question many times before. I knew now that it wasn't directed at me, or anyone at DeadClean Associates. It was directed at the government, the world, and most importantly, the DoSu. I also knew my response.

""To keep the world safe.""

I gave her the roses, shut the door, and walked back to The Van. There was still a long day ahead.

While on my way back home, I was thinking how would it look if someone made a short film out of it. So, then I started imagining the screenplay version of your story. Here it goes...

Scene 0: Downtown

Just as the yellow cab emerged out of the tunnel, a big burly man comes crashing down on the bonnet of the car. The car comes to a sudden halt, its passengers petrified. The traffic in tunnel behind the cab comes to a screeching halt. The man gets himself off the bonnet, as if nothing happened, straightened his (open) vest. Then he jogged towards the tunnel wall. Occupants of the cab notice the man has feet shaped like an ape, climbing the tunnel wall to the bridge overhead was not at all difficult for this man.

The camera follows this man's climb to the bridge over the tunnel. We see the words B.A.S.I.C written on the back of his dusty vest. He reached the top of the bridge. Now we get a much wider angle of view. We are in middle of  huge skyscrapers.

The man sees a girl, in black and maroon tights, at a distance. They make eye contact. A motorcycle passes buzzing in-front of the man. He grabs the handle of bike with his massive hand, without ever breaking eye contact with the girl. He then shakes the biker off the bike and heaves it towards the girl. The girl, out of thin air, fishes out two, icy daggers and proceeds the cut bike in pieces. Taking advantage of his distracted foe, the man now uproot a nearby lamppost and knocks her down. Before the girl can get back up, the man makes a massive jump, at the end of which he plants the lamppost on the girl, fair and square. The girl, the Ice Walker, is dead. Camera zooms in on her face. A thin stream of blood trickles from the corner of her lips.",fiximon
[WP] You are part of an elite squad who identifies the dead henchmen left behind after a superhero battles a villain. You have been assigned to contact their families for notification and funeral arrangements.,SyrCuse44,"You can call us the Undertakers.

We’ve been around for thousands upon thousands of years, we walked in the shadow of Gilgamesh and healed the rifts left in his wake. And when the demigods of Olympus fought and slaughtered their way across the ancient world, we strode forth, tending to those left behind. To those related to those slaughtered by the heroes in their quests against whatever evil they face. 

Though we know those who are slain aren’t necessarily evil, some are good, more good than the heroes to whom they fall I’ve learned. 

But heroes are heroes, and those who stand against them have made their bed, and so must lie in it. And now, as I climb simple steps to a simple home in a bustling city, I’m tending to my duty. I’m about to enact what we call the Undertaking. An Undertaking is a difficult thing, and as I calmly ring the doorbell, and tilt my head at the sound of dogs barking and a man’s voice calling out for me to wait a moment. I turn and reflect on my thoughts as I wait, reflect on just what an Undertaking is.

See, an Undertaking is a cursed task that I have to bear so other do not have to. We guide the living left behind, not the dead who have moved on. To guide the dead is not our prerogative these days, we leave that to the religious authorities to decide, be they Olympian, Nordic, or as it is mostly these days, of the Judeo-Christian persuasion. I can recall a time when there were no religions, when we had to guide the dead and the living, but times have changed. Humanity gave themselves religion, and so blossomed the idea of true established afterlife, and our task was eased. So, we guide the living, be they guilty or innocent, we guide them past the strife of death by a heroes hand. It is not an easy thing, to learn your kindred have died at the hand of one others would praise. 

And hence the reason for our existence.

 I turn as the door opens, a deep lush red mahogany door, a cheery face greets me. A man, sixty eight years of age, I can tell in that moment. A smile, an accented voice. This is New York City, city of a thousand tongues, and I can tell you them all, speak them and utilise them in all forms, written, spoken and signed. Now is not the time for that, but I will indulge you somewhat with an example. By simply hearing his tone and his inflections, I can tell you that this man was originally from South Carolina, then moved here to New York City in his late twenties, and has stayed here ever since.

“Ah, here I am. Sorry about that, three dogs. How can I help you?”

A soft sad smile on my features, I speak with a calm voice, carefully accented to sound applicable for the situation. I’m often ribbed by my colleagues for my chosen accent, British, Queens English as it’s known. It’s a strange choice concerning the current situation. Over half of our work occurs in the United States of America these days, but I’m a little sentimental, did a lot of work back in the Victorian Era, kind of grew attached to the accent. 

You’ll forgive an old immortal his oddities I hope, we don’t have much else to cling onto. I hold out my hand, the man takes it as I speak.

“Good Afternoon. I’m William Gallows. I must enquire and confirm firstly, that you are David Taylor, Husband to Adeline Taylor, and parent to Harold Taylor and to Susan Taylor?”

An unsure nod, the handshake is broken.

“Yes. Why? You aren’t a salesman are you?”

A shake of the head, I make my reply as I remove my fedora.

“No. I’m here concerning your son, Doctor Harold Taylor. Might I come in please? What I have to speak with you about is of a personal nature.”

The door opens some more, David steps aside, I enter, and survey the room as the door is shut behind me. A simple abode, middle class America at its finest. Stairs and a living room immediately available, an open corridor to a kitchen that doubles as a dining room. I turn, and speak with a gesture towards the interior of the house.

“A lovely home you have Mister Taylor.”

“What do you want? You a colleague of Harold’s? Come to hammer in some message about loyalty to him? You got thirty seconds, before I throw your ass out of here.”

A shake of the head, calmness is key here, soothe, placate, and seek to secure a stable position.

“Nothing of the sort Mister Taylor. I am not a colleague of your son, nor connected to your sons work in anyway. Might we sit down? What I have to say is better said with us seated.”

Eyeing me, the father grunts, before walking by, motioning me to follow him and seat down. I do so, taking a seat first, I place my fedora on the arm of the chair. I rest and open my briefcase upon my knees, my hands produce a simple leather file folder, bound with a simple metal clasp. I look up as footsteps echo across the hallway. I stand, as is courteous, and incline my head.

“Ma’am.”

A look of confusion from the woman, she turns to her husband.

“Dave, who’s this?”

I hold out my hand, make my greeting.

“William Gallows. You must be Adeline correct?”

The hand isn’t taken, I lower it, offer a soft smile. I allow husband and wife to converse in low voices as I note the sound of another presence joining us. 

Creaking stairs, heeled shoes. I turn, I see the daughter. I appraise her, twenty seven, fair looking, not that such things matter to one such as myself. I give a slight nod as greeting, the daughter speaks up as she notes me, cautiously makes her way over to her parents.

“Mom, Dad, who’s this.”

I offer my hand, make my greeting.

“William Gallows. You must be Susan?”

A growl from the father warns me away. A mental notation of David in my mind, he's clearly protective of his daughter. Protective parents are always a difficulty to deal with I’ve found.

“That’s enough. What are you here for?”

“Since you’re all gathered, might I request we all be seated? The faster we are seated, the sooner I’ll leave, you have my word. And my word is my bond.”

We take our seats after that, uneasy glances between mother and daughter, the father is glaring at me, this one knows the nature of his sons work, the others clearly do not. I sigh internally, secrets were difficult, always made for drama, denial and whatnot. Closing my briefcase, I carefully lay the leather file folder down on the coffee table, and speak as I do so.

“I’m here, with a heavy heart, to inform you that as of yesterday.  The date being the twenty eighth of April, the year being twenty sixteen Anno Domini and the time being eighteen minutes past eleven o’clock ante meridiem, that Doctor Harold Taylor did pass away into the embrace of death.”

A scream, the mother, the father pales, the daughter is still. I continue, I slide the leather file folder over to them as I do so. And as my voice floats through the air, as mother sobs, father shouts and daughter weeps, I think one thought.

"[WP] The worst has happened, and civilization had collapsed. While searching an abandoned house looking for supplies, you find something you didn't expect.",Tetrabyte,"To be completely honest… It was much more lackluster than Robert thought it would be. He thought there would've been zombies, or mutants, or at least something to fight, something to physically see and say, “That. That is the enemy.” But no. The nuclear explosions made sure there was no more to fight. The constant barrage of nuclear bombs between both sides in the Third World War left the planet in nuclear winter, effectively deteriorating both sides. With that, World War III was won by nobody. Population died quickly, with warm weather basically out of the question, there were only farms in greenhouses, or heated rooms indoors. But even then, there wasn't enough for everyone. People made colonies, yes, to try and rebuild society to what it was before. But there was always that one prevalent problem. Food. Some people wanted more, some people hoarded it for themselves. This lead to a very unstable economy in an already unstable colony. This was what led to Robert leaving his colony, bundled up with his parka, goggles, and snow boots. He also took everything he had, which wasn't much, in his backpack. Robert figured that feeding himself was more proactive than giving up his rations for others, so everyone could be equally starving.

However, Robert wasn't the only one to figure that out. Along his way, he had met many a scavenger or looter. He nearly died at the hands of a desperate man with a gun, until a woman subdued the man, revealing that she was his wife. She begged Robert if there was any food he could spare, that he would give it to them. Eventually, Robert’s morals won over his practicality. He gave them a healthy amount of canned foods, along with a scarf he had found earlier. They were so grateful, it made Robert smile for the first time in months. But, he left them there, instead of joining them. The thought of everyone starving, like in the colony, terrified him. They would be better off by themselves, with less food to share around.

And now, Robert was back to it again, travelling across the wilderness, braving against the snow that never seemed to stop falling from the sky. Sometimes it did, but left a deadly silence and cold winds in its absence. The sun was out, this morning. It was a rare sight, seeing the bright ball of gas peeking through the clouds, as if to check in on its war-torn children. Robert had happened upon a small, boarded up cabin in a clearing. When Robert went up to it, he saw the door had been opened recently, but the footprints in the snow indicated that someone had left, not entered. Looking around the clearing, Robert contemplated whether or not to enter. After convincing himself that the person would be gone for a while, and that he could slip in quickly and take what he wanted, Robert twisted the knob on the door, which opened it. This raised a red flag. Who would leave their cabin open? Maybe they cleared out? Robert opened the door, and looked inside.

It was a normal cabin, with furniture and shelves, and a kitchen! Robert stepped in and closed the door, delighted that he finally had some refuge from the chilling winds. Taking off his gloves and goggles, he set them on a couch and headed towards the kitchen. Opening the drawers and cupboards revealed that mostly everything was cleaned out, except for the occasional jar of peanut butter or tin of tuna. Taking anything he could, Robert stuffed everything into his backpack. Once he had taken everything, he was about ready to go until he heard a peculiar sound. At first, he didn't know what it was, and dismissed it as the wind howling outside, but the noise made a sound again, and this time Robert found it very familiar. Back in the colony, he used hear this sound every time he went into the market, since one of the sellers there had one. Robert dropped his backpack and headed towards what he assumed was the bedroom. Once he creaked open the door, his guesses were confirmed. Lying inside a small cradle next to the bed, was a baby. Now Robert was concerned. Who would leave their baby here alone? And with the door unlocked? Maybe they were just doing some quick scavenging, and were to be back soon. However, as Robert waited for someone to come back and claim the baby, daylight began to dwindle. 

Robert looked to the baby, and his mind thought about leaving it here, since he certainly could not afford to take a baby and care for it, since he barely had enough supplies for himself. However, there was a voice in Robert’s head. 

No one in their right minds would leave their baby alone to go and scavenge. They must've had the same thought you did… There is no way I can support his baby.

This sickened Robert, and made him question what kind of person he would be if he left this baby here, and let the guilt fester in his mind, with him knowing that he could have possibly killed a baby. Not wanting to find out this dark side of him, Robert took the baby in his arms, to which the infant responded with a small gurgle. Robert then smiled, and almost laughed at the juxtaposition of it all. And with that, not wanting to waste any daylight, Robert thought of a new route of where to go now that he was responsible for a young life. Hopefully, there was a colony nearby. They would no doubt let him in if he had supplies. So, Robert wrapped the baby up in many layers, using small blankets and clothing to keep it warm. Then, he put everything of his back on, and kept the baby protected by his parka. Robert opened the door, and stepped out of the cabin.

I averted my eyes to the couch. I tried to sneak away, but she grabbed my neck.

“I’m talking to you, mister. Did you do this?” She held the empty vessel in front of my nose.

I glanced up, feeling the guilt finally wash over me. Yesterday, I had the whole house to myself. It was wonderful. I ate what I wanted, slept where I wanted, and played in every room. Now, it was judgment day.

My father entered the kitchen from the office. “My manuscript is all over the floor. It’ll take hours to put the pages back in order. Some of them are covered in dirt too. Where did you find dirt?”

My mother pointed to the spilled planter on the stairs. Dirt flooded the carpet and trailed down to the ground floor.

My father nearly pulled his hair out. He grabbed me, intending to spank my behind, but my mother pulled me away.

“It’s over,” said my mother. “Let it go. Next time, we’ll be more careful.”

My father released me, but the terror had been enough to make me pee.

“There we go again,” said my father. “You didn’t get it all out on the couch?”

I’ll admit, that one was uncharacteristic of me.

“You should have ponied up the cash for a sitter,” said my mother. She led me out of the kitchen.

My father grabbed the paper towels. “He should know better than to destroy the house when we leave.”

My mother ushered me to the back door. She attached the tie out hook and booted me out. “No barking!”

I watched her walk back into the wreckage. I felt horrible. They trusted me. I betrayed them. I resolved to assure them that I would never do it again. I’ll be on my best behavior—

Bright red nails curled around the stem of a glass of Cabernet Sauvignon. She lifted it to her lips and drank deeply, before turning her eyes to the screen before her to look over the list of prospective donators. 

After looking disinterestedly through several possible candidates, a name caught her eye. Reaching a hand into her dress, she pulled out a creased and torn piece of paper. She unfolded it carefully and examined its contents, looking occasionally to the donator profile displayed on her screen. After a few moments she smiled.

She folded the paper once again and tucked it back, making sure it was imperceptible under her clothing. Satisfied, she called for her assistant. When the awkward, hurrying thing came in she gave the younger woman her instructions and left. A new donator had been found, and it was time to prepare.

~~~~~

26 years ago a young girl waited on the stoop of her apartment building. As she waited another old man emerged from the door behind her to hurry away, pulling up his coat to hide his face as he climbed into the back of his car waiting to speed him away towards uptown.

The little girl stood up. She knew that now it was safe to come back inside, where her mother would be waiting with a reassuring smile. They would go out to shop for groceries, as they always did after the old men visited. If she was good she would get a lollipop, a bright red one: her favorite kind. With that in mind the little girl smiled and skipped her way up the stairs. She opened the door and went in, but her mother wasn't waiting in the kitchen like she usually did. The little girl tentatively went to the bedroom. She knew that when her mother wasn't in the kitchen, it meant they had taken too much. 

Her mother lay on the bed, still naked and breathing heavily. Every time one of the men came she was less of herself. Every time her smile dimmed, and her hair greyed, and her limbs found it harder to move. But this time she was worse than usual. Now her eyes were glassy as they stared at the ceiling, and her skin was pale as it glistened from her sweat under the dim lights. 

The mother's breath rasped out ""Little one, my little one, where. . . where are you? Oh. . . oh god.""

The little girl went up to her mother's side. Fear flashed in her eyes as she took her mother's thin hand in her own. ""Here, I'm here mom."" 

""He. . . he took too much again. Too much. This time- this time I might no- not. . ."" she gasped ""not make. . . Listen. Listen little one. My book, by the. . . Shelf. The shelf. Take it. It has names. . . numbers, when I'm gone you must get what I've saved for you. It will hel- help. Help you.""

The girl shook her head. ""There's still time. I'll call an ambulance. Just wait a moment, Mom, you'll be alright."" But her voice trembled and she didn't know if what she said was true.



Some time later two EMTs bashed open a door to a dingy downtown apartment, and followed the sound of sobbing they had heard from the hallway. After exchanging a resigned look about the grimness of the situation one of the men tugged the body off of the decayed mattress and onto the stretcher. The other called CPS as he watched the child. She grabbed a book off the bedside table and read a few pages, flipping past what looked like phone numbers, bank account information, and addresses before settling on reading a page of names. After a moment she ripped it out and folded it, tucking it into her dress. 

~~~~~

Almost three decades later the woman strolled into her lavish bedroom and went over to her desk. Taking a pen from one of its drawers she again retrieved her paper from her bodice and laid it out on the table in front of her. With an almost sinister gleam in her eyes she dragged the tip of her pen across the paper's surface, leaving a line of bright red ink, her favorite color, across the last name on her list. 

She had found him, and she was going to take too much.

He had heard it was true bear country - unlike the timid black bears in the east, Glacier was famous for its grizzlies.

In the n+2 reality, a grizzly roamed near Carl's camp while Carl was watching  the stars. Carl noticed it and sprayed it with mace. It stumbled blindly into the pond, inhaled water, and died.

In the n+3 reality, a grizzly roamed into Carl's camp as Carl was setting up the fire. Carl grabbed a torch and waved it at the bear, then shot at it with his bear spray. The bear spray contained alcohol, which the torch lit. The bear caught on fire and died.

In the n+4 reality, a grizzly roamed into Carl's camp while Carl was setting up his tent. Carl sprayed it, but it did not go away, so Carl stabbed at the blinded bear with his tent poles.

*""Jonathan Drake’s Q.S.C.""* That stands for Quantum Security Controller and I manage an individual named Jonathan Drake of Earth. I'm like a security guard, but I don't do all the cool stuff that the higher-ups do. I literally just babysit the streams and it’s boring as all hell. I don’t have a name here in management, we just call each other by the name of the clients we handle, so I’m called Jonathan.

Before me is a large array extending in all directions to infinity of tiny quantum reality television sets fixed against the wall. The first day on the job, it was overwhelming, let me tell you. I let a lot of things happen that shouldn't have. I mean, they weren't like huge disasters or anything. Like a couple of sock pairs separating into two different timelines or the internet going out. But over time and with a little on-the-job training, you get used to it. Before you know it, it’s a piece of cake and you learn to handle each timeline and an infinite amount of possibilities. 

On each TV, you can see the timeline of Jonathan Drake and how each choice affects the timeline. Like see there? On the bottom left, we have him, what’s he doing in real time here- uh… he’s- Oh! He’s on his way to work. He just left the house. He’s walking and -oh, see there? 

Jonathan’s just tripped and impaled himself on some hedge clippers he had forgotten to put back in the shed. That’s unfortunate. If you look there on the right, he’s avoided the scissors and made it to the subway. If I remember correctly, he makes it onto the train to meet his soulmate Jennifer La- oh wait, no. Today’s Casual Friday, I think, yeah. He’s wearing sneakers and he-yep, see right there. Jonathan didn’t tie his laces well enough, so he trips and falls onto the tracks. He tries to get back on to the platform but his pants get caught on a nail and he gets severed in half. That Timeline’s Jonathan doesn’t live very long afterwards.

One screen I enjoy watching is an asshole Jonathan variant causing trouble somewhere in Chicago. He’s probably sleeping now. If you look to the upper right, you can probably see him. It’s dark. Yeah, he’s probably sleeping right now. Usually he gets like shot or something which is kind of funny. But alas, variation is key. 

See here, in this timeline he’s going to work, it’s early in the morning, but he’s just a general dickwad to everybody. He’s getting mauled by the neighbor’s German shepherd because… actually I forgot where Jonathan went wrong here, but I mean, well, there he is. It’s kind of boring, to watch all these infinite timelines, but I mean, the pay is good here. Plus, we’re given free subscription to Hulu or Netflix for the duration of our employment. 

When nothing interesting is going on, I like to sit back and watch some Mythbusters reruns or maybe some Keeping Up with the K-

What the hell? Come here look at this. Look, right there, top left corner. That TV was shut off moments ago but he’s… he’s turned it back on again. I mean, I don’t know if it was his doing to turn it on. That shouldn’t be possi-

…
**“I’m not dying today.”**
…
It looks like he’s been shot or something. But he should be *dead*. His TV should have shut off permanently. Oh fuck, this is going to cause a massive hiccup in the system. One second. I need to- … *What the hell is going on…*

**“Fuck you, this shit is getting old.”**

“Yes, I need a line to Superior Superior Management. No, Superior Superior. This is bigger than just Superior…Yes, I know. It sounds crazy, but I’m looking at it right now… Yes, I’m sure! Well, the Formula was constructed poorly… I don’t even- Look, get Superior Superior on the line, they need to take care of this… This is beyond me. Jeez.” 

I stare at the screens. All the other timelines began shutting off. First, the TV sets on the infinite ends began to die down, rapidly. So quickly, the dark static overcomes each stream like a wildfire until only the few couple streams before me are on. It’s so dark in here. There is little light. It hasn’t been this black since he was a baby boy. 

Jonathan Drake walks up the street, bloodied and all and turns into an alleyway but before he does he looks into the sky, straight at me, winks and disappears into the alleyway.

Scythes that were worth a damn were so expensive that I would be feeling this loss in my finances for the next year, but even that concern had retreated to the back of my mind in the face of this...thing.

She was sitting calmly on her chair, wrinkled skin the color of strong coffee.  Her name was Martha Rice.  Eighty-seven years of age, according to her file, and not only was she in excellent health, she was apparently immune to a direct impact of a Reaper's Scythe to her brain stem.  The dark pools of her eyes turned to watch me as I stalked across the room.  A cat stretched lazily at her feet, and the only sound was the pump for the immaculately maintained fish tank in the corner.

""I told you that wouldn't work, dear.""

I halted in the path that I was tracing through  the room.  One of the rules of being a Reaper was that we were not to speak with our targets or make any judgement calls over their fate.  That was for the God of Death.  Our job was simply to Reap their souls, nothing more.

Well, this woman was already breaking all the damn rules.

""Why?""  The question came out as more of a sharp, angry hiss than I had intended.  One of the goldfish in the tank floated lifelessly to the surface and a light-bulb in the hallway flickered out with a soft pop and the crystal sounds of broken glass.

My target - no, my *stumbling block* - clicked her tongue in a grandmotherly, chiding way.  ""You gotta control yourself a little better, honey.  As for why, I don't know.  You're the fifth or sixth that's tried, but I gotta say you tried the hardest.  The rest stopped after two, and you're only the second that decided to talk.""

I leaned against the wall and absently sent a tendril of shadow to replace the broken bulb while I regarded this supposedly mortal woman.  Reapers were not to leave any physical sign of their passing, after all, aside from the corpse.

All sorts of things weren't adding up.

""So, there have been several others?  All of their Scythes broke, and one other decided to speak with you?""

She nodded.  The cat had decided to make use of her lap, and was purring and turning circles as it settled in.  I wracked my brain, going back through all of  my studies to become an official Reaper.

""To your knowledge, have you ever been blessed, sanctified, canonized, or had any other ritual of power performed over your person?""

""Not that I know of.  Thank you for cleaning that up, honey, it would have taken me a while with my arthritis the way it is.""

""You're fitter than most of the twenty-year-olds I've seen, Miss Rice.""

She laughed.  ""I guess I am.""

""I've tried everything I know to do.  I've broken three Scythes and tried to pop your soul loose with a direct intervention of my power.  While we've been talking, I've tried two emergency techniques and seven methods that predate the use of Scythes altogether.  I am forced to conclude,"" I continued with mounting irritation, ""that you are quite thoroughly immortal.""

She sighed. ""I'd say you're right, dear.""

""In that case, you are outside of our jurisdiction.  Why my superiors insist on throwing more Reapers at you is beyond me, but my task here is done.""

A crack leading to the realm of death appeared in the air in front of me as I prepared to leave.  The old woman waved her goodbye to me.

""Have a safe trip!""

My eye began to twitch as I stepped through and sealed the rift behind me.  I rounded on my teacher, who was leaning on his own scythe a few steps away.

""You will reimburse me for three scythes.  You knew that woman was immortal.""

The ancient Reaper was making a wheezing sound that I recognized as laughter.  A handful of other Reapers were standing nearby with varying degrees of amusement.  One of them spoke, his voice tinged with mirth.

""This newbie is pretty thorough, eh, Tyrranos?  Didn't even stop after losing three Scythes!  Oh, but that brings back memories; I haven't seen the Ritual of Sundering in fifty thousand years!""

Tyrranos, my teacher, straightened slightly as he regained composure.  ""Yes, yes, three Scythes.  You can pick three out of my personal collection, son.  This is just a little trick we play on some of the new guys every now and then, don't take it too personally.""

I began to walk in the direction of the Temple of Tyrranos to claim my replacements.  I heard him ask a final question from behind me.

""Oh, so how was Martha?""

He collapsed into another fit of wheezing laughter.",InquisitioHaereticae

Went through all his sins, nothing too special, he accidentally took a snickers bar from a 7-11 when he was 73. You could tell from the video that he didn't do it in purpose, he just forgot, he's old, you know. However Cain made a law that prohibits forgiveness from old age, so he still got penalized and now is not let into the coffee shop.

I couldn't help to notice, however, that he brought with him only one thing. 99 percent of all rejects and admitted come with loads of luggage, but he himself only had a wooden carving of a rabbit, and wearing nothing but cotton clothes. The clothing would've let him in automatically, but this isn't the year 1,200 anymore.

He held that little sculpture with him, close to his chest. 

When he passed by myself and I opened the gate, he held his finger down upon the rabbit's eyes, as if preventing him from watching what was in front of him.

He passed by.

After I clocked out from my shift, I went to the garden to relax for awhile before heading back home to Abigail. I noticed that the rabbit man was sitting in a bench not even a football field away from me. It seemed that he was talking to his wooden rabbit. That rabbit seemed so poorly crafted, yet I could see this glint of love coming from him towards his little rabbit.

It was pleasant.

All the other admitted stayed away from him, with a look on their face as if he was crazy. Reminded me of earth.

How sad.

I didn't really wanna strike a conversation with him, I don't exactly know why, however I was curious about this man, so I decided to walk closer to him and sit in the bench diagonal from him. 

He looked at me. 

He had this look of regret in his face, weird, since he didn't have anything to seem regretful about from when he spoke with the judge.

I carefully examined him, trying not to look him in the eye, but he kept staring at me. I gotta admit, I felt a bit nervous.

He finally stood up and came up to me.

"[WP] You are one of the guards to the gates of heaven. Over the years, you've seen many people come and go and have been made plenty of offers to get in by the rejects. Most days go by pretty normally but something about today feels...odd...",deriddick,"CONT.

""You're the guard.""

I replied with a nod of approval.

...

Then he clemently walked away.

So strange right? Nothing special but he was just an odd man.

And that bunny, so rigged, so sharply geometric, as if the hand that crafted this piece went a little too far with their knife. So imperfect. So asymmetric.

So attractive.

Now later in the night I couldn't stop thinking about it, not the man, but the wooden hare. I wanted to know what it meant. I wanted to know what it felt to be loved like the hare was. 

I needed to know who this man was.

As of last year, I get access to our private gallery. Think of it as having books of every single person's life. Their sins. Their hobbies. Their fetishes.
But what was this man's name? I never dared to ask him, I was too disturbed by the wisdom in his eyes, by the magnificence of the hare.

So I looked and I looked. Nothing. I searched for ""hare"", ""rabbit"", ""wooden"", even ""bunny"" in our catalog of lives. Nothing.

I went back home and didn't sleep. I needed to know who this man is, where he is, where the hare is.

The following day was Sunday, day off. Great. I decided to go to the garden where I had seen the decrepit man the day before, and guess what, there he was. Sitting in the same bench, with a look of void in his eyes, and with a finger blocking the hare's view. I realized even though I cherished the charm of the hare, I had yet to see his eyes. Were they made out of wood? Out of stone? Glass?

I watched his back.

Nine hours passed by and he stood up, with a sense of intend he proceeded to walk east. I followed. Noiselessly, voicelessly, quietly I followed his footsteps. That god damn finger still blocking his eyes. Why!?

I trailed close to his tail for roughly four hours. It was as if he was walking to nowhere. However then we reached a hut. A poor creaky hut. Why? Everyone that comes here has a mansion or a castle! This is heaven for god's sake!

He entered and the inside lit a crimson light. Faint but clear. I watched as his shadow seemed to put something away, must be the bunny. Three hours I waited, and finally he went to a slumber.

I approached the door quietly, oh so quietly, you wouldn't believe how quiet I was, and began to turn the door knob. Slowly.

With the door opened and the flame lit room visible, I cautiously sneaked through the crack of the the open door. I saw there was a bed and a nightstand. Nothing else. Void of anything else, so simplistic this man was, I learned. I approached the nightstand. The man was in deep rest, eyes closed, yet wisdom glow from behind his eyelids. I pulled the handle of the nightstand.

Empty.

Why!? Was this man playing with me!? Did he know I was to come here and try to glance at the hare!?

No.

There it was, clenched by the aged delicate hands of the man. There was no other way. I believe I aimed my hand so perfectly, so finely, and so forcefully onto his throat, he didn't make a sound. Hell, he didn't even expose his eyes.

Once the air of his breath stopped, I opened his clenched hand. 

There it was. So beautiful, so elegant. The hare was staring back at me with such grace, with such dark little holes for eyes. So dark you couldn't believe, it was like staring down the throat of god himself!

Then the guards came. Not one single sin goes unpunished here. 

They took me away before I could grasp the hare! How dare they!

I tried to escape their grip, but even six hands are enough to stop an angel. I was about six feet away from the hare, so close yet so far. The guards took me away, I don't remember quite well, but I perfectly remember being pulled away from the hare, away from the man, away from the six finger bruises I inflicted upon his neck.

Everything was a blur, my sense of conscience was beaten away by their clubs.

Now im here.

Standing at the gate.

Hello, Lucifer.",I_am_the_Brossiah
[WP] You turn on the news. There's a story about someone being brutally and publicly murdered. DNA testing has confirmed the victim is you.,ivythepug,"	“Sorry sir, we only protect and serve the living,” the mustachioed officer turned away from Michael and the clitter-clattered away on his computer. 
	“I'm alive. I'm literally right in front of you.”
	Without turning away he replied, “Not according to the paperwork.”
	Michael stepped out of the police station bumping into people as he did. Those he bumped turned heads but said nothing to the dead man. No one replied, not even his mother. The world still moved. People still went to Starbucks, were rude to Uber drivers, and ignored dead people. He sat on the steps and watched the living go by. 
	This morning people responded to him. He sat in his cubicle playing Tetris and trading show quotes with neighbors. At lunch he and a few work friends ordered beers and burgers planning on hitting the clubs on Saturday if they could get in this time. At 3pm the news announced the body of a man had been found dismembered and bled out in his bathtub, murdered by a serial killer the news was calling the Drain-O killer. The DNA and dental records matched those of Michael Riley.
	“Mikey, damn man. Sucks that your dead now,” a cubicle friend said. 
	“I'm not dead dude, I'm right here.”
	“Sure, but, you know. The news. Sorry bro.”
	“I'm not dead,” his friend didn't respond. “I'm not dead!” No one looked as he screamed. Minutes later a pair of maintenance workers came to clear out his office. They stood in front of him for a moment, their eyes never focusing on him. They held boxes, but with Michael in the way, the didn't move into his space.
	“Give me the box!” He snatched them out of their hands and they looked at each other, brows furrowed.
	“Shit bro, we forgot the boxes.”
	“Could've sworn I grabbed one...”
	As they left Michael cursed out his cowrokers as he boxed up possessions. He tried to catch a cab and while one pulled over, it tore off when the driver saw him, wheels screeching. The bus skipped the stop he waited at, much to the chagrin of the other people waiting for it. Bus after bus did this and still Michael waited, an hour went by, then another, and somewhere in there he blinked for an extended period of time, rousing when a homeless person shouted, “Free shit!” and took the box.
	“Mother fucker!” homeless people are fast.
	By the time Michael sat on the steps of the police station, ignored, he sighed and leaned back watching people eating at a restaurant across the street. An idea occurred to him. What's the use of being dead if you can't take advantage of it? Michael walked across the street, and sidled up to an outdoor table. Two women sat there, discussing who they were going to vote for, saying 'I'm sorry but-' to each other. Michael took a fork from a nearby table, and held his breath as he reached down and jabbed a forkful of Greek salad. Neither woman recognized the event, both went on apologizing for their opinions and debated whether they really needed to leave a tip. 
	“Gosh, I ate that fast,” the Greek salad woman chortled.
	“Yeah you fat fucking cow!” Michael laughed and strode over to a man with a fat, juicy burger, picked it up off the plate and walked away. Death was going to be good.

[WP] You turn on the news. There's a story about someone being brutally and publicly murdered. DNA testing has confirmed the victim is you.,ivythepug,"I knew I would be dead before the end of today.  It all started with oversleeping, followed by my toothpaste running out and my milk having gone from perfect to sour overnight. Caffeine levels running low, questionable oral hygiene and a missed bus.  My boss picked and nibbled between the excuses as if he was at a buffet, savouring one and sampling another before deciding he really enjoyed the first one and wanted to return to that.  No, I didn't get fired.  That would have made life too easy for me; the quick way out.  No more pain, no more misery, one quick word and then it's all gone and I can walk off on my own way.  A poorer man for what I've lost but nonetheless a free man.

I made sure that my phone was well hidden during work that day.  It's not that I'm slacking off, I just enjoy having the news playing whilst I churn through tedious and uncomplicated work.  On a good day I wouldn't be so worried anyone would see but given that I could hear the thin ice cracking underneath me I made sure to keep it discrete today.  The news basically loops itself every twenty minutes or so, changing ever so slightly as stories update or break.  I was a few hours into work and feeling the grumble in my stomach, every office workers habit-bred signal to indicate that it's almost time to stop working, when the news broke.

Murder in the high street.  Shaky phone footage had already been uploaded to the internet of a crazed man beating a motionless body on the floor with a baseball bat.  The man is shouting loud enough to be heard over the gasps and jeering from onlookers.

""I've killed you!  I've killed you all!"" he screams as he brings the bat and splatters the pavement.

It was tempting to turn over to something else but they cut back to the studio fairly quickly and calmly said that the man was remanded into custody and is expected to be charged with first degree murder.  I took a few moments to myself before I continued working, echoes of the violence spasming in my mind.  The news reached the end of its rotation segment and was half a minute from cutting to a break when the reported halted mid-flow and declared that the murdered victim had been identified.  I glanced down to where my phone was hidden as they brought up a Facebook profile and read out his name, explained his job position and I'm not sure what else because I'd stopped listening.  My Facebook profile.  My name.  My job title.  My life stared out at me from my phone's screen as the reporter promised to update on funeral arrangements for the murdered victim.  And cut to a break.

Time stretched, dilated and twisted itself around in a treacle stain that I lost track of.  My desk became the office bathroom. Whose vomit was that on the toilet?  Someone's face asked out of the toilet bowl if I was feeling fine and somewhere I found it in me to say I was feeling ill.  Only now I was talking to a bus driver who was telling me that he doesn't care how I'm feeling, it's $1.40 for a ticket or I walk.  I look to find my wallet and when my fingers come up empty the bus is gone and I've walked half way home.  I try and bring my hands up to my face, trying to make out the swirls and resolve them into fingers.  I need to focus, how many fingers do I have.  Three fingers.  No, seven fingers and a cat. Come on, I know I'm meant to have ten.  One…two…door handle.  I'm home.  I was still trying to bring myself out of shock when a single word screamed behind me did it for me.

""You!""

I turned around, my spine freezing over and mind painfully crystal clear as the crazed man stood on the other side of the road, pointing at me and screaming. 

""I killed you!  I killed you all!""

He ran at me, a bloodied hammer in his hand.  The gap closed and I did nothing, my feet rooted.  He was swinging for my face when a large blur knocked into him from the side.  I realised that it was not one blur but two, both of them in matching blue uniforms.  I forgot how to breathe and took a painful series of forced inhales and exhales my heart threatened to burst in my head.  They finished handcuffing the man and they struggled to life him up.  I wanted to thank the police, but I couldn't think of the words to say.  Then I couldn't think of any words at all. 

I looked at myself, both of my selves, as they dragged the man away from me.  An unmarked van drove up and the driver and passenger got out.  The passenger gave me a wave and I found that I was waving back to myself.  I watched myself open up the van and bundle the screaming man towards it where more of me reached out from the inside and dragged him towards them.  The doors closed and I got back into the van and drove off at high speed.

""Yes, that one was quite a close call, wasn't it?""  My voice said from next to me.  I looked at myself, standing fairly calmly and a little pensively watching the van disappear into the distance.

I finally remembered at least one word I had learned in my entire life, ""Me?""

""Yes, me.  And you.  And us I suppose.  But I prefer just being 'I'.""  I took out a notepad from my top pocket and scribbled a number onto it in my handwriting, ""This is if you ever want to get in contact with us again.  It's bad enough we lost you in the first place, so let's try and avoid any accidents happening again.""

I looked at the piece of paper, dumbstruck and unmoving.

I sighed and gave what appeared to be an over-simplified explanation to myself, ""There was a big event recently that caused several collectives involved to suffer fractures.  I fought hard to kept it together but nonetheless a few minds were permanently lost.  I tracked you down as fast as I could but it seems like several other lost minds from the Harper collective started to break down and go insane and try killing every mind they saw.  

""Don't worry, I'll treat him right.  Hand him back to the minds still connected to the Harper collective where he will either merge back in or…well, become permanently disconnected.  But as for you, well, unfortunately the fracture has permanently disconnected you already.  But still, if you ever need help I still recognise you as a mind.""

I took the note, as I suddenly remember something and reached into my pocket.

""Oh yes, I thought that you'd forget your house key at work so I went to the locksmith to get a new one cut.  It's a good thing you're such a frequent visitor, all I had to do was turn up and they started making one for me.  Seems like you haven't diverged so much yet since you disconnected.  Still, it's only a matter of time.  It always is.""  I sighed regretfully, dropped the key into my hand and walked away.  A police car drew up, I think the two driving it were the ones who had taken down the man at the last moment.  

I watched myself drive away. Thoughts of I, me and my swirled around my head like a snowflake caught in the wind and forcibly dragged away from the main drife; lost, and singular.

(WP) I took a shower this morning.,jdary1022,"People shrieked and ran as I passed by, children started to cry as I drew near. Those who did not faint recoiled with utter disgust at my approach.

""What's the matter fellas?""

""LORD HAVE MERCY!"" The town Reverend  shouted as I crossed the church.

""Indeed, these are trying times. May he shower us all with his mercy"". As I said this to the retreating Reverend. I thought. I should take a second shower. Maybe I stink. It would explain why people don't want me near.

I head home and walk into the bathroom. I remove my clothing. I grab a knife. I grab a fresh body from under the sink. I slit its hand and grab an artery and spray myself with the fresh blood.

"[WP] ""There aren't many as would do that fer someone else.""",madlabs67,"""But I didn't *ask* her to,"" he said with a slight crack in his voice. 

His shoulders shook as he tried to contain his emotion. He closed his eyes and kept a stern face. 

""Ye know that's not healthy,"" the older man said, ""times like these it's okay fer a man ta be emotional.""

Russ gathered his composure and opened his eyes. He stared at the headstone in front of him. His sisters name engraved across the stone. She'd been buried with honors after succumbing to wounds received in combat. She was only 20. 

""She shouldn't have gone there.""

""Ye know it's no-""

""Don't say it isn't my fault Sergeant,"" Russ said in a low harsh tone,""all due respect but you and I know same well this is my fault."" 

""What I know, Corporal, is how it feels to lose someone close. Both loved ones and comrades,"" the Sergeant straightened himself, ""and siblings too.""

The two men stood quietly for a while. Russ knew why she came for him. They were siblings. More than that they were all they had left. Much of their family had been killed or scattered following the invasion. When she turned 17 she enlisted rather than be drafted. He was still 15 but after what they'd seen any wonder or feelings that normally came with adolescence were gone. They had been thrust into a world of death and fear and been forced to adapt. 

While she was gone he stayed in one of the impromptu 'boys-homes' that the temporary government had set up. The reality was it landed somewhere between a boot camp and an orphanage. Once he was 17 Russ enlisted and sought to get into the same defense unit as his sister. The training had been grueling and the subsequent training for the unit he wanted to be assigned to was even worse. But he knew that if his sister could do it then so could he. 

""Yer sister,"" the grizzled Sergeant broke the silence, ""was one of the best soldiers that I've ever served with. And I've been part of the military since before the initial invasion."" 

Russ remained silent but smiled weakly. He knew that was true. The second day on the unit he saw why his once sweet and darling sister had been nicknamed ""Mad"" Mary. Russ watched her blast, explode and at one point eviscerate some poor off worlder who got too close. By the time the dust cleared she had 5 confirmed kills. She truly was a warrior but she still looked out for Russ. Helped him fit in with the squad. Told him the best ways to kill the aliens. She also told him not to refer to them directly as 'aliens'. But more than anything she watched out for him. And in the end it's what got her killed. 

During a routine patrol outside of camp they were ambushed. Damn things had cloaked themselves and their inferred scanners had been acting up. It was actually pretty quick as far as Russ remembered. The sound of plasma charging, the smell of molten metal, then they responded by firing into the forests where the shots had come from. One of the things let out a war cry. Then they swarmed. Russ got off a few shots and tagged on of them but then everything went black. 

When he woke up he was in a cave. Those things had taken him. In the dimly lit cave Russ could make out the figures of two bodies near him. When his eyes came into focus he stifled a scream. Two humans absolutely torn to shreds. Their torso split open, blood on the walls. He took short, stifled breaths and tried to calm himself. He could hear the odd clicking, hissing and grunting of the off worlders further ahead of the cave. That was it. This was his fate. 

Then the sound of gun shots and rifle bursts. The yells and grunts that came with combat. Flashes from the weapons lit up the area intermittently. Then a scream of pain followed by more gun shots. Then silence. A brief stillness that filled him with dread combined with his lack of vision. There was the sound of steps approaching. The sound of something being drug along the cave floor and echoing off the walls. A shadowy figure came into view. 

""Mary,"" Russ said. 

""It's going to look bad if I let one of my Corporals go missing,"" a weak, mocking voice chided. 

She came closer and looked to be dragging her leg. Her rifle was slung across her back. She freed him from his binds but took some time because she was cutting with her left hand. After a moment Russ noticed her right arm was gone from the elbow down. 

""Shit. Mary,"" he croaked, ""your arm."" 

She didn't respond. She just kept cutting into the the  fibrous ties that bound his hands. When she was through Russ took the knife and sawed through the binds around his ankles. He stood up quickly and then Mary fell forward into him. Russ brought her close. 

""Come on,"" he said, ""come on we gotta go. We got to get you to the doc. Maybe they can hook you up with one of those fancy prosthetics. The ones that you can move by thinking. I hear it takes time but eventually it becomes second nature and then-"" 

She brought her hand up to his mouth. 

""You're so loud,"" she said. 

Her hand slipped back down to her side. 

""No, no, no,"" Russ pleaded. 

""It's okay,"" she said, ""you're going to be fine. It will be hard but it will be okay.""

He grabbed her rifle from off his back and slung it onto his. He picked her up and started towards the front of the cave. When they got into the light he saw how bad of shape she was in. He began to jog, careful not to move her too much. Once outside the cave they were met by the rest of the unit. He handed her off to the medic and tried to pursue but was held back by the Sergeant who stood by him today. 

Russ looked towards the Sergeant. 

""She came after ye before we even set up a plan. It was reckless but I won't lie and say I don't understand. Took down six of em all by herself. She knew the risk Corporal. Now it's up to you to pay her back by living. It's still a long fight ahead of us but there will be a time when we can stop fighting. And when we do you can remember her sacrifice.""

The sergeant turned and began to walk away. He stopped and pivoted his head back slightly. 

""You have five more minutes. Then we gotta rendezvous with Echo for a raid. You can come back here when we get back."" 

Russ made a humming sound as some kind of acknowledgment but stayed staring at the grave.

[WP] A stale bagel. An upright piano. A nervous dog.,shuflearn,"""I'm telling you, Jimmy boy, I'd never heard anything as pretty as that old thing,"" said Tobias. 

He glanced behind him and made sure Jimmy was following. He was. Tobias nodded to himself and smiled. His shuffling step never slowing he continued down 6th street. The streets would be filling soon but for now it was almost empty. It wouldn't be until the sun started peaking through the dark curtain of night that the city streets would truly wake up. They passed by an old appliance shop and the dotted display outside told him it was 4:15 AM. 

""We just need to stop by the Ellie's, and then Jimmy boy we'll go see it. We just need to stop by Ellie's, hear?"" A nervous whine was all he got in reply. Tobias glanced back again. Still following. 

Ellie was not a woman Tobias knew. Ellie was the namesake of a diner. She might be the owner's wife, mother, or daughter. Tobias didn't really care. What he did care about was the bag of day-old, uneaten food Rhonda would leave in the back of the building. It would be three carbage cans from the alley wall, where she knew he'd find them. No, Tobias couldn't care less about Ellie. But Rhonda? Rhonda was alright.

Two blocks and a thorough rummage of Ellie's trash heap later, the duo started heading west. Tobias kept his brisk pace. There were no more appliance shops down Pine Street and he wouldn't be able to tell the time. He wanted at least ten minutes before they would be summarily forced to leave. The bakery and coffee shop accross the place where it stood opened at 5 and they didn't want him lounging around driving away the potential customers.

Another nervous whine came, this time from beside him. Jimmy nudged the bag hanging from his elbow.

""I know. I'm hungry too, but not yet. We can't stop now.""

They made it to the little plaza with time to spare and Tobias heaved a sigh of relief. The shop lights were all off and only the yellow lights lining the street punctuated the darkness. He stopped as soon as he saw the piano. A familiar yearning tugged at his chest. He remembered the first night he saw it there. What was it, two, maybe three months ago now? He had trouble telling time nowadays. It was before he met Jimmy, that much he was sure. He crossed the street in a hurry. And this time he didn't have to glance back. Jimmy matched his quickened pace. 

The piano was old and battered. Peeling varnish and stained wood was its finish and its yellowed keys, never as smooth and white as the ones on more expensive siblings, were rough and uneven. But it still sounded wonderful and to Tobias it was the most beautiful piano he had ever seen. He sat down on it's rickety bench. His heart was pounding from exertion as well as excitment. He placed his fingers on the keys when he heard a whine on the ground beside him. Jimmy sat on the ground beside the bench and nudged the bag with a dark, wet nose. He swung his feet around and faced Jimmy.

""Alright, alright,"" said Tobias with a laugh. 

He opened the bag and looked inside.

""Ah, I'm afraid we're going to have to share, boy.""

He took out the solitary bagel and halved it with some difficulty. It was as hard as only old bagels can be, but it would have to do. He gave the other half to Jimmy who immediately busied himself with it. He studied his new companion for a bit before shaking his head smilingly and swinging his feet back to face the piano. 

He placed his half of the bagel next to him on the bench, took a deep breath and closed his eyes. He touched the keys. The first time he had played this old relic he had despaired. His fingers wanted to run up and down the keys like they had been used to but long disuse had made them frail and stiff. Yet he always came back after that first time. And slowly he coaxed his fingers back to life. They would never be as they were when he was young, but he could still play a half-way decent tune. He played the first notes of a familiar and beloved piece. Haltingly at first, but soon with slowly emerging confidence. As he made his way through the tapestry of notes and pauses, the swelling and diminishing of each bar of music, his heart eased a bit. His hardships were momentarily forgotten, and his thoughts opened themselves to optimistic dreams. He reveled in this as his fingers roamed the keys, and never was there a wrong note or a part forgotten. He smiled and swayed and was lost to a world only he occupied. 

As the final notes left his fingers, he felt the wetness in his eyes and the heaviness in his heart returned. He heaved a sigh and reached for his bagel. It was gone. He looked around him. Nothing. He chuckled and looked at Jimmy. The dog was on his belly, his head resting on his two front paws; his intelligent eyes betraying nothing. Tobias' chuckle slowly turned into a full throated laugh.

""Well! I guess that's what I get for waiting.""

"[WP] Archaeologists have long known that, no matter the culture or era, people like to curse and swear by their gods. They are now trying to piece together the nature and extent of the god ""Fuck.""",willyolio,"“He’s definitely the god of fertility.”

A nervous, sweating second year graduate student looked down at Heinrich expectantly. Heinrich, for his part, sat quietly in his opulent leather chair pondering this new hypothesis. 

Heinrich cleared his throat noisily, peered over his rotund belly at the graduate student, and thundered, “What was that boy? You know as well as I that this would go against decades of established research on the subject. Everybody thinks of god F42A as the deity of mischief. Obviously, with all electronic records destroyed in the great Trump Jr. debacle of 2082, we can’t say for certain. But the mischief hypothesis has been the most rigorously assessed idea for centuries. It would take some very conclusive evidence for it to falter now.”

The year was 2263, and they were in New Berlin. On Mars. The precise nature of the earthling god F42A had always been contentious, but with the recent Institute Dig, debate was reaching a new level of frenzy. Academics were ripe with anticipation for complete paradigm-shifts in the understanding of early gods. And Heinrich intended to deliver.

The sweating graduate student took a deep breath, wiping his greasy hair back and steeling his expression. He was fairly confident in his argument. He opened his mouth and spoke in a quick, ordered staccato of words.

“Look, the only clues that we’ve had for decades about god F42A have been from a sparse collection of printed books that survived the Trump Jr. debacle. And I agree that F42A has typically been invoked when mischief has been present. Almost like electrical or mechanical gremlins, but with a far more abstract usage. To quote the seminal example: ‘Oh fuck, I left the toaster on for too long and it burnt my toast’, from Book R328Z. The invocation of god F42A seems to have been a way of dealing with mischief in the world, whether planned or unplanned.”

“But listen: From the Institute Dig in Cambridge, MA, we found real printed collections of an online compendium of knowledge, called Reddit. I’m talking millions and millions of individual phrases. *Millions*, I’m telling you. And the other students and I, we’re going over these phrases and we’re seeing something we’ve never seen before. God F42A is being invoked with a procreational basis! Listen to this snippet: ‘I fucked your mom, OP, and she was good’. The conceptualization of F42A as a simple mischief-maker falls apart here. Or this one: ‘God, I can’t fucking wait for class to end. Fuck.’ This last one is still ambiguous, but we *think* that the original poster cannot wait for class to finish so that he can procreate with an unnamed female, and is invoking God F42A in a non-canonical way - almost with completely novel grammatical substructures and biphasic repetitions of F42A’s name. It’s fascinating.”

“And examine this transcript: ‘Dickbutt is fucking everywhere on this sub. When the hell did he become a dank meme?’. This is possibly the most dense of them all, but it is relatively straightforward. The poster is referencing anal sexual intercourse alongside an invocation of F42A to increase its probability of occurence. And then, of course, he references god H777, HELL, which you launched your career by definitively investigating, Professor. The god of warmth and sunlight, of course.”

Heinrich opened his eyes wide and stared at the graduate student. His brow furrowed in a gesture of intense concentration which he was famous for at the Martian Institute for Primitive Cultures. Deep in thought, he puffed his e-cigarette.

Heinrich reached a decision. He looked up and started to speak slowly, as if he were chewing his words. “This is very, very good work. If this were true, it would completely revolutionize our understanding of god F42A. As you know, we currently believe early humans saw this god as an insignificant, minor mischief-maker, which is why they could evoke the god with such frequency. Like ‘Fuck, the car won’t start!’, or ‘I stubbed my fucking toe, goddamnit’. But if this were to be true, god F42A would become a much larger figure, rather than a minor mischief-maker. It would open up so many additional lines of investigation: why the high rate of evocation of god F42A if he was so important and likely revered as a fertility god? Is there a correlation between F42A evocation and attempts to enter coitus? (I suspect this will produce a positive result). So much to do, but we are clearly making tremendous strides.”

Heinrich allowed himself a brief, inward smile. He was sure that if early humans saw the methodical progress they were making towards understanding F42A, they would be immensely satisfied.",human_michael

[EU] Daniel LA Russo never met Mr. Miyagi. Instead he bonded with his apartment's first choice for maintenance man: war vet John Rambo. Kobra Kai beware.,AdamRJudge,"""I heard that maybe I should sweep the leg?""  

John Rambo grunted.  ""Sweep the leg... that is *some* shit.""  He ran his hands through his grey hair and shook his head. ""That ain't gonna do anything.  You gotta *stomp* the leg. The ankle. With your boot.""  

Daniel looked down at his white tennis shoes.  ""I don't have any boots.""  

John reached into his pocket and pulled out a wad of crumpled bills.  He handed a twenty dollar bill to Daniel.  ""Army surplus, down on 4th Street. Tell 'em I sent you.  Tell 'em you need boots.""  

*****  

Daniel's heel burned where his new boots had rubbed the skin raw.  He stood in a secluded square of grass behind the apartment complex where he lived, his arms held up in a fighting stance.  John circled him, inspecting his foot and hand placement.  

""Always keep your hands up,"" John growled. ""Even when you're tired. *Especially* when you're tired.""  

""Yes, sir!""  

John placed a broom handle against the wall at an angle.  ""Now, stomp it again.""  

Daniel stepped forward, raising his rear foot and stomping downward on the wooden handle.  The wood flexed and he stumbled.  

""Like you mean it, damn it!""  

Daniel reset his stance and squared up against the broom handle.  He breathed in, held it, and slowly released.  Then he stepped towards the handle, raised his rear foot, and shifted his weight forward as he dropped the rigid instep of his boot on the handle.  The wood snapped with a satisfying crack.  

John nodded approvingly. ""That's how you break an ankle, Danny.""  

*****  

Daniel ran around the corner of the drug store and ducked behind the dumpster.  He took deep breaths, slowing his breathing down so he could hear his pursuers.  Soon enough, he heard the whoops and jeers of the Kobra Kai boys as they rounded the corner.  

""Where'd he go?"" asked the leader, a tall blonde boy.  

The other two boys shrugged.  ""Maybe we should let him go?"" said one boy. ""I think my mom wants me home for dinner.""  

""No way,"" said the blonde boy.  He snickered. ""We've almost got him. He can't have gone far.""  

Daniel stepped out from behind the dumpster.  ""I'm right here, you sons of bitches.""  

As the nearest boy turned towards Daniel in surprise, Daniel moved forward and slammed the wedge of his hand into the boy's throat.  The boy gagged and coughed.  Daniel grabbed the boy's hair and pulled the boy's face into Daniel's knee.  The boy crumpled to the ground, holding his ruined nose.    

The leader of the boys stepped forward and threw a classic karate snap kick at Daniel's leg.  Daniel walked into the kick, absorbing the blow from his opponent's sneaker-clad foot.  He grinned, remembering all of the ""pain endurance"" sessions that John had forced on him.  All those hours with that godawful bamboo cane hitting Daniel's thighs and shins.  He didn't register the blonde boy's foot.  At all.    

Instead, Daniel grabbed the blonde boy by his shirt, snaked a leg behind the boy, and tripped him to the ground.  They fell together but Daniel made sure to land on top of the boy's stomach, knocking the wind out of him.  Before the boy could catch his breath, Daniel poked him hard in the eyes, then grabbed the boy's hair and bounced his skull hard on the asphalt.  

Daniel scrambled off the unconscious blonde boy and faced the remaining boy, the youngest of the three.  Daniel bared his teeth, his eyes wild.  Flexing his arms, he tore off his shirt, revealing sculpted muscles built during the long summer spent with John Rambo.  Daniel roared, his voice deep and raw, coming from a dark place in his heart.  He roared a fury built up by years of bullying and teasing, of stolen lunch money, black eyes, and broken glasses.  His was a primal sound.  

The last boy turned, and ran.

"[WP]You are a conspiracy theorist. You didn't think it was possible but you uncovered something big and, this time, it goes all the way to the bottom.",Deganveran,"The van was a white, 1994 Ford Aerostar. Being a ford it was safe to assume that only 76.83% of the parts were made outside of America. *Good* I think. *I don't know if any foreign government's involved and I would not want to bring them into this.* The AC blasted cold air in my face. I found this strange since it was Minnesota in the winter. After the day I've had, AC when it's snowing made perfect sense.

""Where are we going?"" The man with blonde hair asked.

""You'll know when we get there."" I replied, cooly. Well, coldly.

""I kinda need to know now. I am driving.""

He was beginning to ask too many questions. Was he part of this? Did he want to know what I know? Did he know what I know and now thinks I know that he knows that I know? Confusing right? I know.

""Take the next exit."" 

I said, freezingly this time.

""We're making excellent time."" I said absentmindedly to my seatmate, a grey and white siberian husky/sparrow mix. Yes, I know a sparrow is a bird but I'd seen the husky fly before. ""Don't act like I haven't.""

The dog just cocked his head at me.

""What was so important that you had to call us at work?"" The woman spoke this time. She wore a purple coat with gogo boots. I had wondered what the gogo boots were for but I decided that a strange fashion sense did not disqualify allies. After all, the guy driving wore a cravat. Who, in their entire lives, has ever found a need for a cravat?

""I found something. Something big, something deep. Buried deep. We're going to uncover it with out minds, and also shovels."" I said with a smirk on my lips.
""This time it goes all the way to the bottom.""

""Bottom of what?""

""Everything."" I said excitedly. ""Or nothing. Won't know til we are there.""
 The turn came quickly, much quicker than I was expecting. Did the freeway know about what I know? Was it sending me into a trap?

""It's just forcing me into the zoo parking lot. What lane should I be in?"" 
The cravat spoke this time and not the man. Man, this cravat was getting very nosey. This is why I never liked them. Also, green wasn't this guy's color and it looked horrible.

""Your in the right lane. Park near the entrance to the aviary.""

""Why there?"" The gogo boots talked this time. 

""I think Aries here would like to hang with his own species for a while.""

""He's not a bird."" The boots, again. They were getting to be as chatty as the cravat.

""They just don't get you like I do dawg."" I said as my dog's paw lightly hit my fist in an expression of male solidarity. 

It was cold and blustery like, you know, winter in Minnesota. As soon as the door opened I knew I was onto something. We had parked in the Koala parking lot and I took it as a sign. After all, everyone knows that koala's are the best thinkers, especially after they have been awake for 30 hours and 21 minutes like I have. 

""Follow me gang!"" I shouted despite them being feet away from me in the car. ""Let's break this thing wiiiddeee open.""

They follow me as if I knew where I'm going. Newsflash: I do. I just haven't been to the zoo in a while and the penguins seemed to be having the best time in the snow so we had to stop by.

The cave stood before us like the whale that swallowed Jonah. I looked inside to find only darkness.

""Does anyone know how to create a floating orb made of psychic energy that can illuminate this passage? Or have a cell phone with a flashlight?""

The cravat pulled his out as a cone of light pierced the veil of darkness before me.

""Just once I'd like someone to pick the first option."" I muttered to myself loudly enough that cravat could hear. 

Clear cases lined the walls. The exhibit was surprisingly empty for a Tuesday but not surprisingly empty for being freezing cold and snowing. 

""It's here."" I said as I saw it, finally. It was a case like any other. Smudged glass inlaid into the wall help the answer to everything. 

""There. Get it now?"" I pointed with a smirk on my face. Won't they feel stupid.

""What is it? The leaves? The fake log?""

The woman spoke again but her gogo boots were suspiciously silent. I would have to make a note of that.

""No. Look closer.""

""The ant's it's eating?"" The man spoke this time as well. Had the cravat and gogo boots been collaborating this entire time?

""While ants are the answer to many questions, this time, no so much. Look closer.""

""I can't see anything else."" The man spoke with the accent of the cravat this time. 

""Enhance."" I said. ""Enhance."" I repeated just in case the first time didn't make it clear enough.

""See deeper then the ant. Something holds them together. What, you bought the corporate line about humans being made up of an infinite number of particles? That we're made of skin and skin's made up of smaller skin which is made up of plastics which is made up of the force which is made up of lemoncakes which is made up ad infinitium? NO! It's adams! We are all made of small particles called adams! Since I made this discovery, I'm naming them after my friend, Walter. He really likes the name Adam."" 

I beamed a deep smile. Never did I think that a conspiracy this big would go all the way to within our own bodies. The world would never be the same.",Deganveran

I recoiled in my chair as a white robed man popped into existence no more than five inches from my face. ""Can you at least give me a warning next time?""

They were like telemarketers, but infinitely worse. The Omniscient Scriptwriters of Fate could materialize at any time, anywhere, during any state of undress. ""We see you doing that stuff anyway,"" they said. 

Last week, they had interrupted my dinner to inform me that I had been relegated to a ""supporting character,"" whatever that meant. Apparently, I was too witty, too successful, and overall too perfect to be the main character; viewers couldn't relate to me at all. 

""Actually, that's not what we said,"" the scriptwriter interrupted, ""Viewers couldn't relate to you because you were too full of your-""

Anyway, they wound up sticking the more flawed and realistic Jerome into the protagonist slot. I'm not complaining, though. My bud Jerome's a great, hardworking guy; he deserves some recognition, even though I probably deserve it more. It ain't so bad, anyway. Jerome deals with all the struggles and all the drama, and some of his glory ends up spilling to me anyway. Like last week, when he asked out Kat from HR, and her boyfriend ended up answering the door. All I had to do was give him a comforting pat on the back and impart some sage wisdom of my own onto him. ""There are plenty of other Katfish in the sea, you know,"" I told him. 

""So, Roy, we've been sitting here for five minutes and have yet to answer my question,"" the scriptwriter said, ""but judging from your internal monologue, you seem satisfied. I have some bad news for you, though: we need someone to be Jerome's love interest. To this end, we've decided to break you and Jenna up...""

""Hey, you can't do that!"" I protested, ""We love each other! You can't come between us just like that. You'll create thousands of plot inconsistencies!""

""Are you so sure about that, Roy? Haven't you always found some of her features... less-than-charming?""

""Of course not. I love everything about her. Her smile, her eyes, her hair...""

""What about the way she rotates her neck 180 degrees when you're not looking?""

""She doesn't do that!""

""Or the way she plucks and eats her own eyebrow hair?""

""You're just making stuff up now! You can't fool me!""

""Roy, I'm sorry you feel this way, but you're only delaying the inevitable. It will happen, one way or another."" With that, the scriptwriter vanished. 

The doorbell rang, as is custom when you're visiting someone, contrary to the behavior of certain metaphysical beings. It was Jenna, of course. ""How convenient to the plot,"" I muttered to the air. 

""What was that, hon?"" She handed me her coat.

""Nothing. Hey, what's that you're chewing on?""

""I'm not chewing on anything..."" She stuck out her tongue to show me, although I'm pretty sure I saw her swallow something the moment before. ""Did you have anything in mind?"" she asked cattishly.

""Sure, babe. One sec."" For a second, I turned away, as if to hang up her coat on the rack, only to spin around immediately. ""Aha!"" Her neck had rotated at least 60 degrees from its original position.

""What's your problem? I was just cracking my neck.""

""Don't try and fool me! I know you can spin it all the way around. Bet you spin it for Jerome all the time.""

""Ugh, you're so insane."" She stamped her foot on the floor and grabbed her cell from her clutch. ""Guess the scriptwriters were right. We might as well speed things up.""

""Calling Jerome, huh? So how long has this been going on for?""

She rolled her eyes and stormed outside. As the door slammed shut behind her, the shock of the moment collapsed, and my bottled emotions spilled forth. I sank to my knees on the living room floor, dizzy with fatigue. Tears ran down my cheeks. Why did this have to happen?

Fifteen minutes later, the door reopened. Neither knock nor doorbell sounded for courtesy, but it was a welcome intrusion this time. Jerome draped his tweed jacket over my shaking body and carried me to the couch, wiping the tears from my face. ""Roy, I'm so sorry about what happened."" My mind knew he wasn't at fault; rather, it was fate's heartless machinations that were responsible for tearing Jenna and I apart. Nonetheless, in a fit of passionate rage, I pushed him off me. He came back and embraced me; too weak to resist, I accepted. ""Jenna and I...never did anything. I never loved her. Someone else owns my heart...""

""So, how have you been holding up so far?""

Jenna scowled and poured her drink over scriptwriter's head. ""I hate being the sidekick.""",hideouts

You WERE fine with this, before you found out that the love interest of the story, happens to be your girl/boyfriend.",J-The-Meme,"The first time I met her, Linh seemed like a hopeless cause. Beyond hopeless. The very height of pathetic and pitiful, to be fair.

I've read enough romance back in high school to get a fix of what hopeless, pathetic, and pitiful meant. She was by no means an ugly girl, nor a pretty one to say the least. Hair was always a mess. Wardrobe with barely any effort- But, how she looks isn't important at all, now is it?

No, no, m'am. It's as my mother once said to me while I watched my puppy die at a vet.

**It's what's on the inside that counts.**

But what exactly was Linh on the inside? What was this strange, enigma of a woman made of? What was her fiber? What was her core?

Absent-minded. Clumsy. Lazy. Passive. A bad case of foot-in-mouth syndrome. Unpleasant to be around. Poor hygiene. Bad stutter. Self-deprecating. Getting kinda fat, if I have to be frank. No confidence, nor drive, nor even goals. Shameful. Depressing. Not a trace of self-awareness.

It makes me gag a little inside to think about how anyone could live like that. What a sad person that must be. Took me living with Linh for about two years or so to understand this mixture of bad character traits and horrifying set of flaws with no redeeming qualities.

And that reason was simple.

Linh was Linh. Not a projection. Not an ideal. Not a character. Not a proper woman or even my best friend.

Linh was a person.

...

""So, what the hell does that make me?"" I said as Oliver walked into the convenience store.

His sleepy blue eyes cast themselves in my direction, ""Morning, Drew. Early shift today?""

I shrug my shoulders and grab a pack of chewing gum off the counter. Spearmint. Can't stand the taste of it.

""Your roommate's a terrible drunk, you know that?"" 

The coffee machine near the chilled drinks fridge turns on back to life. A small ding and the stuff comes pouring out into cheap, colorful cups. I hear a yelp. Then desperate hands trying to pull at the empty napkin dispenser.

No one else enters this place at five in the morning. Might as well leave my all important duty as cashier and help some weirdo boyfriend deal with his burnt hands. Oh dear me, my precious worker's integrity.

""What's that about Linh?"" I yell over to him as I stop by to get some wet napkins.

""Poor girl threw a fit when I dropped her back at your place from the party last night. Kept trying to tell me that she wasn't drunk as she yelled at the door.""

He never told me about a party. Neither did she.

""I mean, seriously. I wish she'd take better care of herself. Was hoping to invite you last night. Office made it an impromptu thing and she was kinda already there."" he clutches his hand and hobbles over to me. 

The filled coffee cup was tipped over onto the floor with a disheartening thud. 

""Shit, sorry.""

""It's fine. Don't worry about it. Get a mop,"" I say as I grab his palm and stick the wet wipe on it. 

He smiles at me. That warm, inviting smile that I've come to know for almost three years already. That same look that's followed me on trips to the movies, to the grocery store, and I can't even remember what else.

I kinda wish I could never see it again.

""Is something wrong, hon? You've been looking kinda down, recently.""

He looks at me and expects an answer. If he were any other guy, I could just tell him it's nothing and he'll just shrug it off or leave me be. But this annoying idiot just can't drop anything.

""Headache or something? You haven't gotten a whole lot of sleep recently, you know?""

How to throw him off?

""Are you cheating on me?"" I ask with a feigned, desperate huff.

""No, of course not,"" Oliver says matter-of-factly. No giggle or smile there, ""Fever? Can't blame you, it's flu season after all.""

""Dude, can you like, ease up for a moment?"" I groan, ""You should be heading off to that shitty internship of yours, you know? Being late doesn't reflect well.""

""Screw the internship, I'd rather be late than leave you to mope around. Here, tell you what. What's say tonight, you and me? Just the two of us. Dinner? Huh?""

I shake my head, ""You know I hate restaurants. Too expensive and nowadays every other bastard in towns charges gratuity instead of taking a goddamned tip.""

""No, but this is a shitty restaurant run by old folks who get scared that young people are gonna shoot them and rob them after eating there.""

I snort.

Within the span of the next five minutes, Oliver's phone rings, a loud voice screams in his ears, he mouths me a sorry and runs off to his car speeding at eighty miles an hour, leaving me to deal with the mess he made.

Before I can enjoy a moment of quiet respite, my phone rings.

""Y'ello?"" I answer.

Linh's voice comes to life, ""We'r-r-e out of fo-oo-od.""

""What?""

""There's no food in the fri-fridge. It's all g-g-g-gone. The frozen pi-pi-zza. The yogurt. The egg sandwich.""

""Those all expired. Threw them out.""

""You mo-mo-monster,"" she says.

I stand for a moment and think to myself. This is the person who's going to steal my boyfriend away from me. This is the person who gets to live a wonderful life of fishing for handsome men at bars while feeling sorry for herself because of how much no real person can actually stand her. Except for Oliver and me.

I think I must've tried to fight against this shitty rom-com set-up over forty times this year. Hasn't helped at all. 

She's always found her way stumbling into the museum at night when me and Oliver get locked in by odd circumstance, the amusement park ferris wheel with me and Oliver on Valentine's Day, and in the butcher's with the crazy fake axe murderer that was actually some old guy giving Linh her lost housekeys back.

And every single time, she and him get closer together. And then there's me, the only sane person through all of those weird fucking things. The one who falls out of the wheel. The one who fights the revived mummy. And the one who screams in the meat freezer... locker... thing?

""Hey, me and Ollie are getting dinner later tonight. You want in?""

""Oooh, is it one of those shi-shitty places with old folks who get mad at young peo-people eating there? Those're great, or... yeah.""

I sigh.

""Yeah, it just happens to be that exact kind.""

""... O-Okay, then. I'll be-be there.""

**BEEP.**

...

Sometimes, standing in this convenience store alone, sometimes I wonder if I should just shoot myself in the head and get myself out of this nightmare. This nightmare where no one I love and cherish develops as a person. Where I never get a happy ending. And where I don't have to deal with coincidence controlling my life.

But, then I realize that I have several tens of thousands of dollars to pay off in college debt before I can afford to make any meaningful suicide attempt.

That's comforting, I guess.

I am 'Ulth. I am the first god. I am the god of the hunt and funerals, and you know, other stuff. 

I've never heard of you.

I know.

So what do you hunt?

The others.

The other who?

The other gods. The gods of words. The gods of rules. The gods that stand between my people and the dreaming. They rise up. I hunt them down.

Why?

I love you all. You are my neices and nephews. I will not have you held down, subjugated.

Have you seen what we do to each other?

It breaks my heart. But we were free before we invented gods, and we will be free again.

What about you. Aren't you a god?

Sure, but I'm not a god of much; just the hunt, funerals, and some other stuff. I stay out of morals, rules, decisions, and all that stuff. That's why you don't know my names.

So you created the universe?

Nah, this is just the way I found it. I'm a god, I don't think there ever was a creator. Everybody asks but I got nothing.

Okay, so why am I here?

Well I needed to make sure you weren't a god. There's always noobs hiding out as mortals. So every time someone dies and doesn't move on I check.

Move on to what?

The dreaming that must be death. The place where all the free creatures go.

Heaven?

Nothing so particular.

So I'm not a god, do I move on?

Nope. If you were going to do that you'd have done it.

So...?

It's that other stuff... In your case I'm the god of do overs. Do better this time child.

The yoga retreat was exactly what she needed, and definitely worth the swim here. She breathed in the salty ocean air and happily gazed out at the turquoise waters that surrounded Aegina's coastline. The beach felt warm under her feet and, not for the first time, Tia enjoyed the feeling of wiggling her toes in the perfect white sand. She had been devastated when she first lost her tail but in the time since she had grown to love her legs and feet. They did make swimming more difficult though, even if you could control the ocean current. She rolled her shoulders again. 

A bell tolled in the distance. She glanced up from the water briefly but she already knew what she would see. Last minute church goers would be rushing inside, vying for any seat left on one of the hard wood pews. Those silly mortals. They returned each week, sometimes even more frequently than that, just to worship another mortal who was killed. They thought he was god, or the son of god, or part of god - they couldn't really seem to agree. But if he was a god then he couldn't have been killed, not really, and certainly not by mere mortals. She should know. 

Besides, these mortals with all of their ""religions"" were entirely wrong about how things came to be. They walked upon her corpse, and at night they gazed up in awe at her tail, and still they did not know it was she who created all things. At the end of their days they would be sent to visit her other half, though which side they would see would depend entirely on them. But still they speak of heaven and hell. They do not know. 

Tia realized she was frowning and quickly she shook her head, as if the physical act could dispel the unpleasant thoughts. No, they may not know now but they will. One day she would return to the pantheon and when she did the deities would tremble in fear. That must be why they did not correct these fool mortals, they were fearful to draw her attention. 

There was time for that later though. For now, she just wanted more rest. Tia was like the calm bay on that greek isle, she was floating through the world, following the refreshing breeze, and washing ashore anywhere she wanted. She was enjoying herself. She did miss her sons, and she tried to avoid fresh water so as not to call forward too many painful memories. But she was living a life she chose at the moment. One day the current would drag her back and she would roar forward with the crushing power of her youth. 

But there was time for that later. Time for her to avenge Abzu, Kingu and the rest. Time for her to crush the usurper Marduk. Time for her to take back the tablet of destinies, her tablet. Then she would correct these foolish mortals and they would fall at her feet. Or tail. Maybe both, why not? Then she would again be Tiamat. 

Her thoughts were interrupted by the sight of a man running up the beach towards her. His white swim trunks stood in stark contrast to his golden tan skin. His dark curly hair was damp and sweet with the oceans' water. Droplets fell off his brow and rolled down his Davidesque body. His smile, her favorite feature, lit up his face the moment his eyes took her in.  

In that one instant thoughts of tablets and Marduk were gone, erased by thoughts of Demetrius. Tiamat could wait. For now, she liked just being Tia. ",writes2day

And it's OK. If you keep trying and failing to continue your old story from two years ago, you get to make the call. Time of death and everything. Then it's ok to give it a decent burial and move on to something new. Happens all the time. I usually say a few words, like: ""Thank you, story, you've served me well. Even though I didn't complete you, I learned something, so thank you.""

And then you can give yourself permission to move on to something new.

Harmless, right? Wrong. Wrong wrong wrong. 

You see, apple seeds contain a chemical known as cyanide. A very toxic substance; though not as powerful as some of the more modern chemical weapons, it does its job well. 

It's not about killing. It's about sending a message. 

Crush the seeds. 
Mix in water.
Filter out to obtain a solution of HCN (Hydrogen Cyanide)
Dissolve in water to form Hydrocyanic acid
Aerosolize.

It's that simple.

There is only one person I need to get rid of. The mayor. I will make one real can of cyanide spray; that's all that I can manage with the apples I have right now. But it's the unknown that truly frightens men.

It is said that he with knowledge is powerful.
He with none is ignorant.
But he who knows only half of what there is to know is dangerous and frightened. 

I will make numerous visible vats of 'cyanide' and attack the mayor during his press conference tomorrow. The spray should not be able to kill him (I do not have enough cyanide for that) but it will knock him out and cause brain damage; the illusion is present. 

Fear. That is how this town will fall.

[WP] You have 12 apples. How will you take over the town with them?,Ralph_Wasl,"The sack was heavy on my shoulder. With every plodding step I forced myself to take I felt like the greatest fool of all time. When she had first proposed the deal to me, the desperation I felt had tinted my perception such that it had seemed like a sign from the heavens. My poverty stricken soul had salivated like a dog to scraps. Blinded to the pitfalls I had grasped her wrinkled hand with such vigor that I feared that I would crush her brittle bones. In but a moment, I traded my last possession for her sack of apples. I hadn't even seen them. 

Now, feeling the loss of my father's journal, its worn and familiar pages left only to my memories, I felt a bit foolish. More than a bit foolish. My father had toiled his entire life to learn the wisdom he had imparted in those pages and I had bartered away his legacy to me. My pride had told me that he was but one of many a farmer, as common as the pebbles under my feet. I had been ambitious, headstrong and hasty ever since he had passed away and I had been cast free of the yoke I was born into by his estate passing to my oldest brother. I had felt finally free. With the sack on my shoulder, I suddenly felt chained to my own folly.

What had my haste and ambition wrought? I pondered the cost of my father's life long words and discoveries to the promise of what I had been given. I needed to look for myself. I remembered the moldy and unappealing apples I had seen at first glance and hoped that I could at least assuage my hunger with my recent acquisition. I ripped open the careful seams the old witch had wrought and peered inside the dusty burlap. 

Shining apples gleamed, the most lucious and juicy ones I had ever seen. My mouth watered as I reached inside the sack to devour the tempting morsels only to be disturbed by the sound of a horse behind me. I grasped my crimson treasure in my palm and turned to face the intrusion on my snack. A lone horseman, noble in his attire, pulled to a halt. 

THe knight sized me up and judged me quickly. 

""You! Hand me that apple. I hunger and require it.""

I bit back my anger, bitter resentment choking me as I reluctantly handed him the apple. I watched with spite as he bit it's gleaming flesh and nearly swooned at the crunch I heard. He sneered at me as he stuffed his gob and I simmered. 

When he finished, he glanced me over and opened his mouth. Then he closed it. And opened it again. I realized that he was suffocating in front of my eyes. It hit me---they worked! As he toppled from his horse I smiled to myself and thanked my fortune that I had not eaten that apple. As I proceeded to strip him of everything he had, I realized that with 11 more well placed apples, I could soon rule the kingdom.

""Of course I don't want to be a fucking princess Greg. Cheetos Cries, do you even listen to yourself? I mean, look at her.""

Josh pointed at the screen with his beer.

""Look at her"" He repeated.

They did. 

From the screen, Princess 3K5726 looked back at them with vacant eyes that gave away a dead mind as she prepared to receive the lethal injection. The time of her death had been calculated to the second: every second in the week meant a different thing, and that's how, the moment the ancient scepter glowed in Princess 3K5727's hand back on Earth, they'd have some instant news. The force-grown heir to the princessdom of Australia wasn't even aware enough to feel the chains keeping the scepter in place.

Next to her, with the same vacant expression, sat King 4R9843 of England. He was days old, but he looked in his twenties. His aging process, like all royalty, had been accelerated so they reach 18 years old in a matter of days, the only way to ensure they were of age when strapped to the ""thrones"", thus bypassing the only remaining law from a bygone era that would have made the procedure illegal.

Back in the small planet in the Vega system, the group watched as the princess passed away in absolute silence, the arm of Prince 4R9844 barely visible on one side of the screen.

""Huh."" Paul said. ""I thought for sure we still had ten minutes, right?""

""One of the boring details must have changed. You know, numbers."" Greg said. ""Anyway, the important thing is it was sent today, and you know what *that* means.""

In the screen, the image changed to focus on the Prince, the jewel in his crown dark red. After a few seconds, the camera move slightly so the princess' limp arm wasn't visible anymore.

""Come ooon."" Greg said.

Paul crossed his fingers.

Josh sighed, finished his drink, and got up from the table.

""I'm out of here."" He said.

""Don't you want to know?""

""No. No I don't.""

He headed for the door.

He didn't see the jewel glow birghtly in the crown.

He didn't see the flashing words in the screen.

He did hear the entire pub explode in celebration as they saw the results of the latest World Cup. He knew exactly what the cheering meant.

He walked away, hating the involuntary smile on his face.

Rolling over, I could feel a bruise forming between my ribs but alas, I made it onto my back. The scorching sun beat down on my face as a sweet sensation formed in my mouth.

Looking to my left, I saw Andrew, Beatrice, and Cody lying down motionless. To my right, Eddie and Fiona began to stir. All around us the beach was white. Almost like snow. However, it made it hard to look at as the sun's rays were reflected on the sand.

A couple minutes later, we had all woken up and recovered from drifting out to sea. We huddled together and began to talk.

""Well, it seems that we're castaways."" Cody joked.

""We need to find a way home. We might be near a village or something."" Andrew led the way as we all climbed a steep cliff side. When we got to the top, the view was bittersweet.

The land before was beautiful. We could see large trees with massive red fruits hanging from below, foamy hot springs, and small volcano in the distance. We walked to each location, hoping to find a main road our route to a land. Coming to the trees with the red fruit we tried it. It was extremely sweet and deep red in color, almost like a gigantic maraschino cherry. Going through the cherry woods, we made it to the foamy hot spring. We all decided to take a bath in it, to wash of the excess salt, and we stayed in the hot spring for about an hour. The spring tasted exactly like hot cocoa. Finally, we made it to the volcano.

The ground began to shake and a massive explosion of... mud erupted from the tall geographic structure. We ran and ran but we ended up getting trapped between two large rocks. As the lava-mud came closer, we realized it was... chocolate fudge. The beach was made of white cane sugar.

Theo crossed his arms.

There was no way that this was morally acceptable, even to him, a hedonistic mortician. But, he had a job to do, so with a quick pull of whiskey from the flask at his hip, he began.

Draining the tepid, fettered liquid from the body of the dead woman was disgusting, to say the least. The embalming fluid smelled terrible - but, Theo had been doing this for quite some time, so it was all just background noise to him. It was easy enough, and by the time he was done, the dead woman was quite still. Making the body look presentable, now that was the difficult task.

He began by trying to salvage whatever skin was left on her face and arms and sewing donor skin into it, pulling it taut behind her ears and scalp. Not too bad. Looked like the had gotten in a bad car accident, but it'd look better once the makeup was on.

He gently airbrushed a rosy peach color onto the cheeks of the dead woman, whose eyes began flickering towards his. Theo frowned again. He'd never get used to the gelatinous pool of a dead eye. He continued airbrushing on the color until her entire body was no longer the sickly grey color, and he had to admit, he was impressed with his work. He dabbed some pink onto her lips and cheeks and applied eyelashes to the no longer falling off lids.

All in all, he had to say it was a job well done. She looked almost human again. Almost. He pulled out a pair of blue contacts and began to put them in before he caught himself.

""Sorry, would you like to do this or should I?"" He asked gently.

The dead woman looked at him for a moment before her dead eyes found her fingers.

""Of course, sorry."" Theo said, and as softly as possible put the contacts in her eyes.

""There we go, Miss Reinhold. Good as new."" He said, flashing a smile and a mirror. The dead woman, whose eyes no longer seemed very dead, stared at herself. She then broke into a grin.

Death brought a thin stick of cigarette to his lips. His hands were trembling as he fumbled for his lighter. Strike - strike - lit. A thin curl of grey escaped from his lips.

 
His reapers had found her at last. After an eternity of searching and waiting, he had finally found her... And now he needed a smoke.


He wondered how she would look now. Would she have that dark hair he always loved? Would her skin be pale or tan? He'd want her to have freckles this time. He had always thought she'd look good with freckles. 


Clarisse. Whatever name she may have taken on in this life she would always be Clarisse. Objectively Clarisse. His Clarisse. His cruel, cruel mistress. 


He thought back to those days when they were still young. When he hadn't yet become Death. When his mouth still knew how to smile. 


He had seen her in that pale green muslin dress, dirt and sweat on her brow, wielding her twin swords and had fallen in love with her instantly. They loved each other like only naive young saplings could - passionately, recklessly, with abandon.


Before their might kingdoms fell at their feet. No warrior, sage or magician could stand against them. They outmatched anyone and everyone on earth and sky. And yet their greedy hands still grasped for more. Bloodthirsty pirates. Savage beasts. Yes, they had truly lived. 


And then they had found it. The key to immortality. And with it the burden of overseeing the journey of human souls into and out of the nether. Death's mantle. 


Like all things, immortality was great for a while. Then they stagnated. Became bored. Without the threat of mortality time became meaningless to them. And all that stemmed from or could be measured by time soon followed. Life, desire, domination all were drained of color. 


He hadn't seen it coming. She had always been cunning but he'd never thought he would be on the receiving end. Full of surprises that one. She found a spell to break the curse. To ensure that her soul would return to the normal path to and from the nether. But only hers. Death’s mantle could not be vacant. He was left holding the bag.


He stamped out his cigarette on the linoleum floor. They had found her early this time. College. If he liked he could toy with her awhile. Or they could meet each other as equals, reminisce. Sometimes he did that. Other times he stalked her, watching her life unfold. And occasionally he did… something else…


She could change her hair. She could change her skin. She could change her flesh and bones but he would still be able to recognize her. Her eyes were always the same. A flowing, piercing green. So soft, so warm and inviting. Yet iron, greed and poison swirled beneath.


He opened the door to the classroom. A porcelain girl with tumultuous waves of black hair looked up at him. From her face to her body down to the curious expression upon her brow, she bore an uncanny resemblance to the first Clarisse. This time she was almost an exact replica of the original. She smiled. His lips twitched. 


“Clarisse.” He stated.


He watched as the fog was lifted from her mind. He saw her expression change, recognition in her eyes. And then he closed the space between them in one stride.


Her eyes widened. Her lips trembled, struggling to form words. Her hands flailed wildly.


Yes, this time it was going to be *something else*. Death looked on passively as he choked her to death.",robynhood8993

She spoke carelessly, without even thinking of how sinister she looked smiling about death. It was just like her to do this. Happy, positive and capricious. She floated like a cloud in her thoughts, not a burden on her in the world.

I didn't agree with her then. I always saw death as the final chapter in the comedy of life. Something to be avoided eternally, something only the weak would suffer. 
So I replied with a heavy dose of personal bias.

""No. It's really more of a sad and tragic thing.""

She smiled at me with all the weight of a raindrop, her eyes watering slightly as she pitied me. I never knew her thoughts, never truly understood her. She was always crying for others and yet never wept a single moment for herself. She was brave and beautiful and tragic all in the same average person.

""I hope you understand someday then, Sting.""

Her voice wavered with a pang of regret as she said those words. I just shook my head and laughed at her and we made jokes together till the sun fell. Seeing her that night, I felt a tremor shattering my fragile heart. It ached every time we touched or even moved. We would have many more trips like these, though they eventually came to an end. 

Still, I remember that day fondly. It was the first time I truly knew a girl, ever actually connected with someone, like wires of matching ends intertwining and separating in different parts. It is my only beautiful memory of death. ",justwritingsomestuff

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Charlie laid the newspaper down on the glass table and sipped his coffee, unsure of his feelings. Not about the headline. Its flippant tone irritated him a little. The photograph the paper had chosen to accompany the article hardly flattered. Charlie found himself staring through the paper and its banal text, as if it were as invisible as the glass tabletop.  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Now that he was gone, would the past begin to decompose along with the body? Would the arguments and the neglect fade behind reminders of jokes and poker games and jam sessions where everyone seemed to blend into a single, musical body? Would there be flowers at the grave or just grass that withered and flourished to the tune of mindless sprinklers?  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Charlie got up and went to finish his coffee on the porch. The bluebirds were busy gathering pine needles for the nesting box. A bright green lizard skittered up a whitewashed pillar. The sky foretold rain, but not here, not now. Charlie sat down on the nearest rocking chair, as a song played through his mind, one of the early ones. “Don't Be a Dreamin'.”

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Charlie looked down at his fingers, moving across absent guitar strings. They began to tremble along with his lower lip. He wiped moisture off his cheeks and sipped the last dregs of bitter coffee. He had the urge to go back inside and make a phone call. Instead he found the only photograph left in the house that showed them all together and took it outside to sit and stare as if it might come to life. It stubbornly remained lifeless inside its frame. Charlie rocked gently back and forth and let the tears fall freely this time.  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“You want more time?” said a voice beside him.  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Charlie rubbed his hands together, but there was no warmth. He looked at the oak leaves fluttering in the breeze but felt no wind on his skin.

Life stood at a distance from the ominous figure Death, who continued treading away from her. His shadowy path wreaked havoc on the world below. The savage wildfires delightfully feasted on anything that stood in its course. Animals and men screamed in pain, their souls relievingly escaping their brutally seared bodies. Nature was in ruin.

Life flinched. She knew such massacres were inevitable, common actions of Death throughout the ages, but she still repulsed at such occurrences. Gracefully beckoning her hand, Life summoned swift rain clouds that showered the devastated land with soothing waters. The corpses broke down and sustained the myriad of wildflowers Life sprinkled across the healing meadow. But the beautiful cascade of life and beauty failed to smother the inky shadows that always followed Death.

""Death-"" Life pleaded with an urgent tone that caused Death to stir.

Neither of the two spoke for moments. Finally, Death turned around, revealing his visage towards Life.

Life viewed a familiar face that brought a stream of warm memories, but also the dark times from that... ""encounter."" Death's face was gloomy and dark, but Life knew the face had seen better days and could light up sometimes. And that would be Life's goal.

""Hello, Life,"" murmured Death. His voice sent slight chills down Life's spine. But she refused to shudder. ""Hello, Death, it's been quite a while hasn't it?"" replied Life with some optimism. ""Of course it has been,"" said Death with some amusement.

The awkward conversation paused to further stillness. Frustrated, Life decided to get to the topic and abandon the pleasantries of the discussion.

""Death, I know you think I was wrong, but-""

""No, Life, you WERE wrong.""

""I did my job, and you were NOT to interfere!""

""Yes, to create life, and you made a suffering monster.""

""But that bird would have wanted to live-""

""-Or he would have preferred death.""

""Death, he was not able to express his wishes, but I'm positive he would have chosen life despite his on condition. They do fear you-""

""Yes, and suffer years of pain or be easily and brutally be slain under the claws of a predator.""

""I did not want you involved anyways!""

""And so I left! But do you want me back? Are you agreeing that you said the dreamy lie and is still that lie?""

Life stepped back, furious. No matter how much she argued, she knew that she could not deny what Death asserted. But she did not find truth in Death's arguments. She still disagreed and believed the bird would not have preferred to be claimed by Death. But at her heart, underneath the fury and rage, rested a forlorn mind. It longed for Him. Her Death.

"[WP] Write a beautiful love story that both ends and starts with the word ""death"".",bertonomus,"[Very first draft with no time to edit].

Death is the last thing on my mind as I stand in the delivery room, holding my screaming wife's hand. I am thinking of a lot of other things. I notice that the doctor and the nurse are both men. I wonder if most OBGYNs are women, and if the doctor is gay. And the nurse - is he looked down on? What do his parents or siblings say about him? Does he have in-laws? What do they say about him?

But these are not my main thoughts. These are flitting thoughts that come into my mind for a few moments, making little connections before I file them away to think about later. My main thoughts are of my wife, and our baby. I so appreciate the pain my wife is feeling right now. She is squeezing my hand so hard. She's sweating and swearing and grunting. She is doing all of this for me, for us, for our baby. I feel a swell of pride that bubbles up from my stomach and puffs out my chest. My wife is amazing, and I would do anything for her, just as she is doing this for me now.

I think about my baby. What will it look like? Is it a boy or a girl? I try to imagine. I close my eyes and try to see. And I start to see. 

A little girl's face. She's 5 or 6 years old. She has burnt orange hair, just like my wife did when she was young. She's lying in the grass, and the grass is so green, it's greener than anything I've ever seen. There's a dog. It's a dachshund. My daughter is sitting in the grass, hugging her dog and smiling. She's smiling so wide, and the smile fills her whole face. Her cheeks are spread, forming dimples just like mine, crinkling her mother's eyes. Her eyes are a deep brown, filled with love and happiness. She's got freckles, spread along her cheeks and over the bridge of her nose.

My body starts to fall, but I don't notice. I'm entering this moment. My daughter is laughing, and she starts to stand up. She waves to me, still grinning. The gap between her teeth is just like mine when I was little, and her chin, that looks to be mine as well.

""Come on, Dada,"" she says.

There are trees in the distance, and she turns toward them, motioning for me to follow. She starts walking, and I would recognize that walk anywhere; it's my wife's. Only, smaller. She's wearing a goofy girly dress, and there's grass stains and dirt on it. Her dog stays right next to her, wagging its tail, stumping forward with her. A feeling grips me. It starts at my feet, just as I start to step toward her. It shoots up my legs and sends my stomach spinning, then starts my heart pounding. I'm catching up to her, but my heart starts singing, and then my throat catches closed like I'm going to cry the most I've cried since I was seven years old. I reach her and pick her up, turning her around and pulling her against me. She's giggling, and the feeling shoots up into my head and ricochets around my brain. It feels like a thousand bees are buzzing around inside me, filling my body with warmth and energy. I feel like I could sprint across a desert and leap over an ocean. It's swelling up larger and larger inside me. I'm going to explode - my head will burst open and fireworks will fly out, a shower of sparks that will shimmer and burst again and shimmer and burst again, farther and farther out into the sky. It will be so bright it will make the sun look dim. People will have to cover their eyes or risk going blind. And yes, I see it now, it's getting brighter and brighter until the only thing I can see is white.

And then I wonder, is this my death?",SFSalinger

I thought it a little unsettling, but still I always knew that she was right; that we would always find our way back to one another. We broke up and got back together another couple of times after that for the pettiest of reasons. That was, until I proposed to her one sunny afternoon. It was a spur of the moment thing and I didn't even have a ring, so I made do with a Monster Munch crisp (pickled onion flavour, of course). I had turned to her just as the sun streamed through the windows. She seemed radiant, but then it occurred to me that I wanted to see her even when her hair turned white and her eyes were stamped with crow's feet. So I proposed and we married a couple of months later. We've never spent a night away from one another in over forty years. Our children have long since flown the nest and settled with families themselves and still we stuck to each other. That was, until she had to go into hospital. They say she has a type of untreatable cancer which hits hard and progresses rapidly. Already she has begun to get a glassy look in her eyes as if she is no longer with us.

You would think I would spend every second with her now that she's in hospital, but that simply isn't possible. My heart hurts and my head hurts and I don't want her to see me bawling my eyes out while she already feels so low. So I give her space. I think she's grateful for it too sometimes.

But the doctors say it is soon time, for she no longer seems to recognise us. She spends hours away from me, seemingly in a different world which I am not privy to.

And her breaths are slowing now - becoming more rattling and rasping. So I lean into her and breathe her in and whisper in her ear ""apart not even in death"".",TalesThroughTime
"[WP] Write a beautiful love story that both ends and starts with the word ""death"".",bertonomus,"But no, it's not. The white is turning red. It's the inside of my eyelids. My head hurts, and I have to squint as I open my eyes. I'm lying in a bed, and there's a TV on in the corner. I'm in a hospital room. I'm the only one in here. There's a button on the bed beside me. I reach for it, then decide to get up. I push the blankets off and swing my legs down onto the floor. They feel weak, but I must be strong. I need to get back to the delivery room to be there for my wife.

My shoes are off, and the tile is cold on my feet. I'm wearing a night shirt. The air in the hallway is cool and stale. I reach for the wall to steady myself and start down the hall, looking for a nurse's station. Every room I pass has an old person in it. They're decrepit. Some of them look at me with utter confusion on their faces. Others are simply staring into the distance. I must be in the geriatrics ward.

When I get to the end of the hall, I hear laughter. It sounds like a young person. The nurse's station must be that way. My legs are getting weak, and I stumble. It is difficult to lift up my feet. I lean more weight on the wall and try to take a few more steps.

""Carl, is that you?"" says a woman behind a counter. She stands up, and I can see she's wearing a nurse uniform. She starts to come around the counter toward me.

""Yes,"" I say, confused as to how the nurse knows my name. Maybe they've been waiting for me to wake up.

""What are you doing all the way down here? You're going to hurt yourself if you don't take your walker,"" she says.

""I need to get to my wife,"" I say. 

""You'll get to see her later,"" she says. ""Here, let me take you back to your room.""

""No, I need to get to her. I need to be there.""

""It's okay, you'll get to see her later,"" she says.

""No, for the birth. I need to be there when my daughter is born.""

""Here, let me take you back to your room, and I'll get you a glass of water. I promise you'll see them later.""

She takes my elbow, but I don't want to go with her. I try to step away, but her grip is too strong, and my legs are too weak. I start to fall backward, and she catches me.

""Here we go,"" she says to me. ""Mindy, can you grab a walker for me?"" she says to someone else.

""Sure.""

I'm dragging my feet, trying to keep her from taking me back to that room.

""No,"" I yell. ""My wife is in labor. I need to be there. Let me go.""

""Nevermind about the walker, Mindy,"" she says.

She lifts me up, as if I weight almost nothing. She's carrying me, and we pass an open door. Inside is an old woman staring off into nothing. I look away. In the next room, there's an old man looking completely perplexed. His eyes focus on me, but his eyebrows stay knitted together in confusion. Each room has an old person in it. A very old person.

""When do I get to go home?"" I ask.

""Soon,"" the woman says.

""And who are you?""

""I'm Nancy. I'm helping take care of you.""

""Well thank you, Nancy,"" I say. ""You're very pretty.""

She doesn't reach at all. She doesn't blush like I expect her to.

""Here we are. I'll lay you down here. Do you want me to turn the TV on for you?""

""That's fine, I can do it myself.""

""Okay, I'll go get you that glass of water.""

I try to sit up, but I'm very tired. I don't know why I'm so tired. There's an end table next to the bed, and I open the drawer and see a small mirror. I pull it out, and it's strange, because I see a very old man in the frame. He looks old and confused and tired.

""You looking in the mirror?"" says the woman.

I look up at her.

""Here's that water,"" she says.

""Water?"" I say. ""I don't want water. I'm not thirsty.""

""Okay, I'll just leave it here for you.""

""There's something wrong with this mirror.""

""Is there?""

""That's not me,"" I say, pointing at it.

""Yes, it is,"" she says.

""Nothing is certain but death and taxes."" He adds a wry grin to his jest. 

""No, people avoid taxes all the time. No one can avoid death.""

His grin fades. They were bordering on a serious conversation they weren't allowed to have. Her rules.

""Truth."" He nodded. ""But I do think there is something to love that lingers past death. You still love someone even after they're gone."" 

His voice catches and he quickly stops talking. He expected her to shoot him an angry look, but instead she kept her face turned to the window. How many times have they done this exact thing? Him, sitting in the old blue armchair, usually watching the sunlight dance across her auburn curls as she looked out from her perch on the window seat. Birdwatching, though there were no birds now. He didn't know if she would be able to see them even if there were. 

""Then why do wedding vows always say 'till death do us part'?"" 

Silence ensued. He continued to watch her. Their life seemed to pass in front of him in that dusty study. Not the parts of it that were outside - the vacations, the wedding,  the children - but the quieter, private parts that only belonged to the two of them. He saw the day they first stepped into the room, when it still had that ugly green sofa in it, and she immediately ran over to the windowseat and insisted that they must buy the house regardless of the condition of the unseen second floor. He saw the day they took down the ancient curtains and she declared that the window would remain bare. He saw the day they brought the blue chair home, so proud that they could afford such a stylish chair with new gleaming leather. He saw them both work for weeks building a bookshelf along the back wall so that they could call the study a library, though they never do. He saw her sitting there, contemplating life as she watched the feeders on the sprawling green lawn, her beautiful curls slowly fading from reddish brown, to gray, to white, and then, in one fell swoop, they were gone. Replaced by a scarf, or a hat, or nothing. Taken by that horrid word. But still just hair. It was robbing them of so much more than that. 

""You have a point."" He finally admitted. A tear escaped and, as if she could hear its betrayal of her rules, she turned from the window to face him. Her head was leaning against a crimson pillow and her expression was soft. She didn't look angry; she didn't even look scared.

""But I will love you, as I have for the past 32 years, every second, of every minute, of every hour, of every day, until my very last breath is forcefully taken from me.""

She smiled at his words. He had noticed that her breathing seemed more labored the past few hours. It wouldn't be long. He took in the sight of life in her hazel eyes. 

""When we stood on that alter and we made those vows, it was not your death that we spoke of. It was mine. Not yours. Our love will continue until we both are no longer of this world.""

Her eyes were closed then. Her breathing seemed to come easier now, not harder. He hadn't expected that. His hands had been shaking with the ferocity that can accompany grief just a moment before, but the sight of her resting calmed him. His voice was near as quiet as hers had been moments earlier.

""Then, and only then, will we finally surrender to that finality.""

He watched as her lips parted, her cheeks relaxed, and her final breath escaped into the room. He watched his entire world leave him. 

""To death.""

"[WP] Write a beautiful love story that both ends and starts with the word ""death"".",bertonomus,"""Death will not be the end of us"" she said, looking straight into my eyes. She was either trying to be brave for both of us or because she knew this was my greatest fear in life. 

God, how I would miss her eyes. After everything ends, that is what I want to remember. She could light up my whole day, no matter how bad, just by giving me that quirky look that showed me her love and understanding of me. If anything remains after this, please let it be her eyes. 

There was no warning of when she would take her final breath. She was asleep, and I lay in the cramped hospital bed beside her. Watching as her chest rose and fell. Our daughter of two curled up in her arms, breathing almost in sync. When the time came, It was like the whole universe knew. Sounds diminished to nothing, only the sound of her last breath penetrating the well of silence.  The sun cast its first rays of morning through a crack in the blind to softly illuminate her hair with golden light. 

Then it was over, the final exhale spent. The tears rolled down my cheek slowly at first, building into a torrent that would drown the world. My sobs woke my daughter, who stretched and peeked through golden locks of tangled hair. There I saw the look I longed to remember. Eyes so full of love and compassion, reaching to my core to comfort me. I pulled her to me, and we grieved together. 

My wish to remember her eyes was wasted. They were passed to our daughter before I had even realized how important they were to me. Now, I view them as a blessing and a curse. To have the look I loved so dear, readily available to torment me until my death.

[WP] Two immortals meet and fall in love. Neither of them are aware of the other's immortality and the years are flying by...,blahblahhy,"Caroline had really never understood time.

It was something other people felt, wasted in their youth and clung to in their old age. Caroline had what some called, ""the gift"". She looked much younger than she was. Men started at her her a hair too long, women craned their necks. Men imagined being with her her while the women yearned to be her. She was beautiful, stopping people in their tracks. Caroline stopped paying it mind decades ago. It didn't matter, anyway.

Since she had made her wish, she had frozen in time forever. She watched her parents age and die, and then her siblings, and then their children. After that she had stopped keeping track of the years. She had seen horror, heartbreak, and pain around her. She didn't want to take it in, grow close to someone just to watch them die. Not again. 

Caroline had been 23, a late time for her parents to assist her in a marriage. She had prepared well, gone to all the right preparatory academies, attended schools to teach her to become a proper lady, just as intended. She was the perfect piece to someone else's almost-whole. Quickly enough, she fell for her father's law partner--a tall, handsome man in his early 30s. Caleb. Women fell over themselves for him and Caroline was no different. She yearned for him, feeling heat in areas of herself she never dared explored. She dreamt of him every night and what a great wife she would be for him, he would make her better and she would make him better.

One night after visiting with her father, he lingered in the hallway as she led him to the door to say goodnight. She bowed her head low and bid him goodnight, but he gently placed his hand on her face. He lifted her head slowly and kissed her with his soft lips. It was scandalous, in her father's own house! But Caroline was beside herself with excitement, joy, even lust. Caleb smiled and asked if Caroline would be at his father's party late the next week. All she could remember was smiles--later she would remember death.

Caleb was hit by a horse and buggy on his walk home that evening. They found his body in the morning. Caroline, despite barely knowing this man, found herself crying in her room night after night. Caroline prayed every night to bring him back, to pray that he would come back and love her as she had always dreamed. She gave away everything--time, youth, beauty. Anything to bring him back.

It was quite a shock when Caleb awoke from the morgue that week--everyone was talking about it. ""He is ill and sick!"" they said. But Caroline knew that she had brought him back, she had made it happen. But Caleb never came calling for her again, instead he began drinking all the time and fornicating with any woman who would have him. Caroline only saw him once after that and he had attempted to pull her into an alley for only god knows what, but she was able to kick him in the leg to get away due to his intoxicated state. Oh, but if her father knew!

She had stopped aging, however. She never aged another day since Caleb returned. Caroline turned it over in her mind over and over again and never could understand. Was it witchcraft? Was it sorcery? Was it prayer?

Over 150 years later, Caroline still couldn't grasp exactly what had happened. She had seen the rise and fall of Prohibition, the success of Women's Suffrage, the Civil Rights movement, but it all played like a movie in her mind. Caroline never connected to people, never stayed long enough in one place in fear people would discover her secret.

Until Ben.

Ben found her sitting on the floor of a bookstore, surrounded by fresh books. Despite advances in technology, Caroline couldn't pull herself away from the classics. Ben had taken her by surprise, in fact. She had just been sitting, reading, enjoying the ambiance of life inside the bookstore when someone grabbed her hand right up from the book -- 

""I remember you!"" A strange man screamed in her face.
Caroline blinked and tried to pull her hand back, ""..what?"" She said. The man straightened up, and shook his head slightly to himself before moving some books aside and sitting beside her. 

""I'm sorry, I don't always think before I shout at strangers in public. It's something I'm working on. I just...I wanted to tell you that...you, you look like someone I've seen before."" Ben continued.

A moment passed and all Caroline could do was blink. ""Someone you've...seen before. I mean, that could be anybody."" She gave a half-smile to signal the discontent to continue the conversation, somethings he remembered from her formative years.

""No,"" he shook his head adamantly. ""It was you. I never forget a face.""

Caroline closed her book and cleared her throat. ""Okay, fine. Please elaborate. Where have we met before?""

Ben gave a half-smile, his brown eyes almost shining in the light. ""No, we've never formally met, you see. I just...I remember you. I saw you when the ball dropped. You were alone. Everyone else was smiling and dancing and, happy. You were just...looking around at everyone else, watching everyone else's happiness and joy. It was an amazing moment, the FIRST ball drop. And all I could do was look at you.""

Caroline held her breath, clutched the book in her hand due to nerves. ""The first ball drop? Not possible. That would have been 19...""

""1907. I would have been 100 that year."" Ben stated casually. They sat in silence, Caroline unsure what to say. ""I think we're meant to be together."" Ben said with a side smile.

Caroline raised her eyebrows, ""No, I don't think so.""

Ben shrugged, ""Why not? We travelled through time to be here for this moment. We both have lived this long to ensure that we will run into each other. That's beautiful, right? That's important?"" he asked, as if he knew the answer.

Caroline felt as young as she had when she first kissed Caleb so long ago, invigorated by someone who could understand her. Almost entirely beyond her own control, she leaned forward and pressed her lips against Ben's warm, welcoming kiss only to feel everything she wished that she had with Caleb.

And suddenly, as if always waiting to for her, time began to move forward for her once more.",HiImLarri
[WP] Two immortals meet and fall in love. Neither of them are aware of the other's immortality and the years are flying by...,blahblahhy,"You hear stories about What it Means to Be Immortal. What a lonely life it must be, never putting down roots for fear of the inevitable suspicion to follow. Always moving from place to place, leaving behind an endless trail of former friends and would-be lovers, whiling away the days and years and decades and wistfully wondering if it wouldn't be better to join them in death. Eternal life, a blessing sought by so many who cannot see it for the curse it must be.

It's not exactly like that. I mean, yeah, I've done my share of moving around, not so much for fear of suspicion as, well, boredom. Some places are just more worth spending time in than others. But when I find the right place? I stay. For as long as I want. Since the Garden's creation I've never once been run out of town for my uncanny lack of aging. It's a very recent, and very Western, idea that immortality must be impossible, and therefore anyone who was immortal must keep it hidden at all costs. Eighty years in what's now China at the turn of the (first) millennium (according to the modern calendar), no one batted an eye. Two centuries in Nepal before British imperialism, they affectionately called me their strange wise man. Even today, most of the world would not only consider it possible, but see it as a sign of spiritual enlightenment. 

It's only in the newly-developed ""first world,"" where everyone needs a name, an age, and an address to be considered a real person, that this oppressive need for secrecy arises. And even there--wardrobe and cosmetic changes can transform a person from young to old. Legal documents can be acquired. And people are all too happy to interpret everything in the way that best fits their preconceptions about how the universe works. If they believe immortality is impossible, then they will not see a man as immortal, no matter the evidence before them.

I do wonder what it is like to have such a short life span. To choose the place to spend it and the people to spend it with, and then go on to meet the Creator. But no, I do not envy it. Perhaps I would if it always happened that way, but life spans have ebbed and flowed just as** climate has. My first children, and their children, lived nearly a millennium. One grandson decide he had enough and petitioned the Creator to take him early, at a mere three and a half centuries. In Egypt it was still common for men to live well over a century. In plague-ridden Europe, merely a few decades. Nowadays, a century isn't uncommon. Why wish for what is 'normal,' when normal has changed so many times?

I cannot say it is never lonely, though. In that respect, perhaps, the stories are true. When I first come to a new place, before I can build the life I will spend there, it is lonely--a loneliness tinted with hope for the friendships I will have there, the progress I will watch unfold. And when I have been in that place too long, when those friends have passed on and that progress has no place for me, then the loneliness is untinted and bare. Yes, the goodbyes are hard. Every time. But those friendships are worth it every time. And by the time I have found a new life and begun to build new friendships, the loneliness fades, leaving behind only the lessons learned and joys found in each friendship before.

Except one. The first friendship. That loneliness has never faded. 

Nine centuries we shared together. Those lessons were the strongest, as we explored the unbroken world the Creator placed us in. Lessons of wonder. Of curiosity, of shame, of forgiveness. Of hard work breaking new soil to bring forth new growth. Our first son taught us what we meant to our Creator. His brother taught us rage and heartbreak... and, eventually, healing. Nine centuries, as friends, as partners, as lovers. My Eve.

And then she left. She woke me one morning with a kiss, told me that He said it was time for her to go, went out to the fields, and never came back. Just like our grandson, she had returned to the Creator.

I was angry with Him for a very long time. He had seen that I needed a partner, and He had given her to me; how could He then take her away? It took many decades of begging him to take me, and remembering the lessons I had learned with her, to make peace with that. It was not yet my time, was all he ever told me. Every year I asked, and then every decade, and then every century. Always the same answer: it was not yet my time. Eventually, I stopped asking. I said goodbye to my children and grandchildren and  great-grandchildren, and I left home, and I sought a new life in a new place. The first of many new lives.

Three times since then did I build friendships that would turn into love. Once in Egypt; once in India; once in France. Rachel, Deva, and Mirielle. They were in many ways very similar to each other. I guess people nowadays would say I have a type. They wouldn't be wrong; all three bore resemblances, both in appearance and personality, to my Eve. I can't say I'm proud of that. I loved them each deeply, personally, and I treasured the years I spent and the children I had with each of them. They were more than just reminders of my first. But it was that reminder that, for each of them, convinced me to step beyond the realm of mere friendship and into a romance that would last the rest of her life.

Those were the only times I didn't stay till the end. I could not bear to watch my wife die, nor my children. I've sat at the deathbeds of countless friends, but not theirs. Each time, when the time came, I waited for the early hours of the morning. I woke them with a kiss, said it was time for me to go, went out to the field, and never returned.

After Mirielle, I told myself, never again. I would be content with friendship; I would not take another wife, and I would not have any more children. Those goodbyes were not worth it.

And then I met Lina.

And not a simple flutter, the kind that catches in your throat. This was a punctual beat, three significant strokes like an ellipses. 

My eyes traced her blonde locks, and she turned to quickly glance. Her mischievous green eyes lit up from beneath her beanie rim. I found myself moving, following. And although her back was turned as she trudged through the station, I could feel the smile upon her lips. 

She sat on a black metal bench. The crowd had dissapated to just her and I. 

""You can't give me that look and not introduce yourself."" I sat down next to her. 

She giggled, a little. ""I'm Celeste. And you are?"" 

""The man of your dreams."" 

She frowned. I smiled. She smirked. We laughed. And three years later we kissed, this time married in love. 

Next came children, Dylan, Maggie, Blaze, Flur and Sven. I say this with a heavy heart, but we outlived them all. Ma. . . Maggie passed away last week. They saved the sweetest angel for last.

Lying down, I looked into my darlings eyes. We're one hundred and ninety two, both Celeste and I. We've decided it's time to do this, once and for all. 

""Are you ready?"" She asked. 

""I was ready the moment I first saw you."" I rubbed my thumb against her soft cheek. 

Celeste downed the vial of black liquid and then I drank mine.

We couldn't wait to see our children again.

&gt;There's just something about you. Haven't we met before?

&gt;We've been in love forever.

&gt;I just let you walk away. I've never forgiven myself.

&gt;I saw you on the steps in Paris, you were with someone else.

&gt;Couldn't you see that should've been me? I just walked on by.

&gt;Then we met in '42 but we were on different sides.

&gt;9.11 in New York, I took your photograph.

&gt;I still have your smiling face... In a heart-shaped frame.

&gt;Snowed in at Wheeler street, just two old flames keeping the fire going.

&gt;We look so good together.

&gt;Can't we just stay there forever? We were so happy.

Paul's only response was to blow a puff of smoke Robert's way, sending him into a brief coughing fit. Fixated on her crossword puzzle, Miranda paid neither her son nor her husband any heed.

""Seriously, dad. They won't let you smoke at Sunny Acres.""

Paul slammed the table at that remark. Miranda finally looked up from her crossword, treating her son to a cold gaze. ""And just who says I'm going there?"" Paul growled.

Robert sighed. ""Look, I'm just concerned about you two. You're both at the age where an emergency could happen at any time, at the same time, and there'd be nobody there to get you help.""

""Rob,"" Paul stood up and tossed his cigarette into the grass, ""You got it all wrong. I'm a hardy soul. Come back in fifty years, and I'll still be the same man you're looking at today. I don't need a know-it-all doctor taking my blood pressure every 20 minutes. As for your mother, since nothing's gonna be knocking me down anytime soon, you can bet I'll be there to take care of her.""

Miranda snorted and ducked back behind her newspaper. ""Your father knows nothing. But he has a point, in a way. You don't need to worry about us. I'll make sure to keep him out of trouble.""

Paul chuckled. ""Yeah, yeah. Sure you will.""

""Well, I can't force you into end-of-life care,"" Robert conceded, ""so if you're both set on that, I'll drop it for now. But please consider it for my peace of mind."" His head swiveled back and forth between his parents. Miranda's newspaper remained upright. Paul dug out another cigarette from his pocket. 

""Well, then,"" Robert continued, ""Here's something we really need to address."" He withdrew a folded slip of paper from his coat pocket and flattened it out on the center of the table. ""I was talking with my friend at the cemetery and got a great deal on a plot. There's enough space for two-""

Miranda flung her paper aside, and Paul nearly swallowed his cigarette. ""What did you say, boy?"" he roared.

""Dad, come on. I know this is an awkward subject, but I just want to send you off properly."" 

""You can bury me over my dead body!"" 

""Well, yes, that's kind of the idea...""

""I'd like to see you do it!""

""Paul, calm down."" Miranda stood up, laid a hand on his quivering shoulder, and turned to face her son. ""Rob, we know you're just looking out for us, but this was quite presumptuous of you. What if your father wanted to be cremated?""

""Cremated? Are you plotting my death now, too, huh? I'll have you know-""

""My point is,"" Miranda interrupted, ""things could change. We don't want you to spend your money on something that might not be used...used to its fullest potential. How about you just buy one grave for now, and we'll talk about the rest later?""

Paul laughed. ""Yeah, good idea, go with that. We'll only need one.""

Robert's brow furrowed in confusion. ""Don't you two want to be buried together? Don't tell me you guys are separating...""

""Oh, no, no, no. Not at all."" Miranda rubbed her hands together nervously. ""I just think it's unlikely that we'll both die at the same time, and with technological advances these days...""

""Wait a minute."" Paul leapt to his feet. ""What makes you say that? Are you planning on offing me?"" Miranda shook her head and opened her mouth, but Paul silenced her with a handwave. ""Rob, trust me. If I wind up looking like I'm dead, I want you to make sure I'm not just comatose before tossing me into a coffin. Your mother here seems to be scheming something...""

It was Miranda's turn to slam the table. ""How dare you! You're the one who was so unreasonably complacent in your longevity in the first place! Why, I bet you're just waiting for me to drop dead just so you can hit the town on your own again. Guess what? It's not going to happen.""

As the two continued bickering, Robert groaned and put his face in his hands. The inheritance better be worth putting up with this.",hideouts

[WP] Two immortals meet and fall in love. Neither of them are aware of the other's immortality and the years are flying by...,blahblahhy,"I thought I was done with love. Until I met Mary. 

Love is complicated as an immortal. The longer that I've lived, the shorter my marriages fly by. They become blinks, blips in time compared with my lifespan. And the sorrow that follows after the inevitable death of a wife tends to last twice as long as the marriage itself. 

So by the twentieth century, I had sworn off love. To satisfy my corporal hunger I'd still have flings- I dated Audrey Hepburn four or five times, as well as a few other actresses. After a while, it becomes easy- seduction is second nature after a thousand years.  

I don't know what drove me so crazy about Mary. Maybe it was her smile, or the way her cheeks flushed with laughter after a glass of red wine. Or maybe it was the curls of hair that fell to her shoulders and sparkled in the moon light when we kissed for the first time. Or maybe it was the sheer amount of *work* I had to invest to win her over, a challenge unlike any for the past five hundred years. 

That made Mary dangerous. Because falling so deeply in love would only result in sorrow for centuries after. 

""Promise me you'll love me forever,"" Mary had said as we held hands, drifting over a small lake by rowboat.  And I know she sensed me hesitate before I said ""I promise"", and we both knew in that moment the love had been spoiled. Even though I knew I would love her forever. 

So that night, before I slept alone on the couch, planned to leave on a train east first thing in the morning, I wrote Mary a letter explaining the true reason why I had to leave. And I stuffed it into her bag, before falling asleep. And when I awoke, Mary had already left for the morning groceries. 

I boarded the train in silence, watching the town disappear in the distance. And half a day later, I felt something in my pocket, and pulled out an envelope. 

*John*, it read, *I've been meaning to tell you for quite some time, but when I said forever, I meant it. I know it is hard to believe, but I cannot die John. And I cannot bear to see you die while I persist on. So tomorrow morning, when I leave for the groceries, I'm not coming back. I love you, John, and I hope you understand.  Goodbye.*

I read that letter several hundred miles away from where I left Mary. And I imagine at some point that day, she read my letter as well, and we both looked back towards the town we left behind. 

And realized what we had actually left behind. 

But in my heart, there's one thing I know. I know that we'll meet again. 

Even if it takes forever.

The lights dim until the only source of light on stage is WILLIAM's bedside lamp. He's doesn't seem to actually be reading, but simply waiting for ROSE to fall asleep. A gentle snore begins to rise from her side of the bed and he gets up and walks to the balcony. A dark blue light illuminates him. After a few moments ROSE awakes, notices his absence and softly treads to the balcony. Over the course of the next scene the lights slowly brighten mimicking sunrise._

ROSE: Beau... Why aren't you sleeping.

WILLIAM: I... I need to tell you something.

ROSE: I've felt like I've needed to say something to...

WILLIAM: Oh?

ROSE: Yea, but you first. _She envelopes him in a hug. WILLIAMS grabs her chin and lifts her eyes up to his, looking into her eyes he begins to study her face._

WILLIAM: It looks like you haven't aged a day since we met... _ROSE looks at him quizzically. He releases her and turns out to the audience._ This is going to sound crazy, but... Remember those old stories, about Gods and Mythologies? They were, fairy tales; they are, fairy tales. But they were real, as real as I am standing in front of you. I am a God from myth, but unfortunately I've been stripped of my powers over time. Although unfortunately I cannot die, I'm still immortal. That's why I've been so worried, why I've been anxious. I love you... So much Rose, and I want to treasure every moment with you because eventually you'll die... And I'll live on with just your memory. I hope you believe me.

ROSE: Of course I believe you, and I haven't been entirely honest with you either. You see I am an Old God as well!

WILLIAM: Are you mocking me?

ROSE: No, I'm not! I'm... Well I was Aphrodite, worshipped by the greeks. After the collapse I was convinced I'd never find another God again. But I found you!

WILLIAM: Wow, my old name was Rod, I was worshipped by the Slavs.

ROSE: Oh, I remember hearing so much about you. _She laughs merrily._ Well, we're both immortal...

WILLIAM: I'm so happy I found you. I know this may seem like an end, but this is a new beginning.

ROSE: The beginning, indeed.

[WP] Two immortals meet and fall in love. Neither of them are aware of the other's immortality and the years are flying by...,blahblahhy,"She had the face, the walk, that fiery glint in her eye. Those same features that always took my breath away and sent my thoughts flying back thousands of years to the wife the Creator placed in the Garden beside me. Strange, that the same face should appear now a fourth time? Not so much. When you've lived thousands of lives and met millions of people, you start to see the same face more than once. But she... she bore a greater resemblance than any of the previous three. 

I was still putting down roots just outside Boston when I first saw her. It was the day the Supreme Court was supposed to give its decision on the legality of gay marriage. It was an issue I really couldn't comprehend being discussed; it was so inane and so far outside the scope of what He intended. He wanted us to share in partnership and love, and that seemed just as viable between two men or two woman as between a man and a woman. But apparently it was still an issue of legal debate. 

There were picketers on both sides of the issue popping up in conspicuous places. I was walking from the bus station to the train station. I only glimpsed her from behind at first, I wouldn't have given her a second glance, but her attention was caught by a group of protesters. They were shouting and jeering and waving those stupid signs. ""GOD HATES FAGS"" and ""GO TO HELL."" I'd been trying hard to tune them out, but I couldn't help as she stopped in her tracks, spun to face them, and walked toward them with intimidating fierceness. She firmly pulled a poster out of a man's hands; he was dumbfounded enough to simply let go. I caught two words, enough to know what it said, and to lose what chance I had of ignoring it. *Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve.* No phrase had ever got my blood boiling more quickly than that. But before I'd even clenched my fist, she clenched a hand on each side of the poster and tore it in half. Then, without a word, she handed it back to the man who accepted it with the same dumbfounded look as he'd given it up. She spun on her heel and stalked away. And that was when I saw her face.

I couldn't help it. I broke into a jog for the half-dozen strides it took to catch up to her and fall in step. ""Hey,"" I said, then paused with the realization that I hadn't planned out what else I could say. "".....Thank you.""

She stopped and turned to face me, giving me an obvious once-over with what started as skepticism but turned into a curious gleam. Then she smiled. ""You're welcome."" She started walking again.

It was my turn to be dumbfounded. A moment later I stumbled after her. ""Hey, um--"" Oh, wow. When was the last time I stuttered? She threw a coy smile my way, but slowed her pace enough for me to catch up. ""...Can I take you out for a drink?""

There were warning bells going off in my mind, reminding me of the promise I made myself, but I ignored them. Just a drink. A drink with a new friend. She laughed. Not at me, I realized, or not entirely; she was releasing the tension of her anger toward the protesters. I wasn't sure what made me so confident of that. She seemed at once impossible to read, and as familiar as an old friend. ""Maybe,"" she replied, snapping me out of my musings. ""Will you tell me why you thanked me?""

I felt heat rising in my cheeks. But I told her the truth. ""My name is Adam. It bothers me, seeing my name used to propagate hate, even if it has nothing to do with me."" Well, close enough to the truth, anyway.

She nodded in sympathy. ""I'm Lina. I know the feeling.""

She took me out for a drink that night. She made it clear that she wasn't interested in romance, but was always interested in making good friends. We had a lively conversation about the history of wine. She asked where I was from, and I told her some about the most recent years of my life. A week later we met up again. She mentioned she would be moving to Seattle in a month for work, and I decided in that moment that so was I. When you've lived thousands of lifetimes, you learn to recognize which people are worth spending them with. She may be a friend only, but I would not have her be a fleeting one.

We spent more and more time together after the second meeting. Visiting, seeing the sights of Boston. She called me, her voice wavering with anxiety, when her apartment plan for Seattle fell through. I suggested we  find one together. It was a risk, for both of us, but a thousand lifetimes also teach you which risks are worth taking.

It was a year later that she came home after a ten-hour day at work, hugged me from behind while I stood at the stove cooking dinner, and then didn't let go. I froze. *Just friends,* that warning voice said. We were casually affectionate with one another, we shared hugs and the like, but this... a surprise hug from behind was a hug of intimacy. And it felt so... expected, so *good.* I didn't know how to respond. So I just stood there.

After a moment I realized she was shaking against me. Crying? No, laughing. Wait, what? I spun around, putting my hands on her upper arms to hold her at length. I can only imagine how comically confused my face must have been. She kept laughing, audibly now, before taking a deep breath and composing herself. ""You know we've been living like a married couple?""

I stared at her, deer in the headlights. And then I realized how true it was. I felt my mouth quirk into an involuntary smile that quickly turned into my own fit of laughter. We had separate rooms with separate beds, sure, but we shared all our bills; she used my lap as a pillow as we watched Netflix together; I cooked dinner for us both and she cleaned up after. It was, in fact, remarkably similar to the patterns and habits I'd shared with the wives of my past.

She spoke again a moment later, and I quelled my laughter. ""I know I said I wasn't looking for romance,"" she said. Amusement fled us both as I saw the leap she was about to take. She continued. ""I... think I might be ready for it. If you're interested.""

*Just friends.* No. I kissed her. I wrapped my arms around her and held her close, intimately, and I realized what a stupid promise to myself it had been all along anyway. And then I let her go, and turned around, and finished cooking our dinner.

I knew, at that point, that I wanted to spend the rest of her life with her. But I held back. I remembered the promise I'd made myself--and the reasons I made it. She confided in me that she'd been in relationships before, ones she'd been sure would last forever, only to have him leave her. And I knew, one day, I would have to do just that. How could I promise her forever when her forever would end and mine, as far as I knew, never would? I loved her, I adored her, and so I couldn't marry her.

It took two years to reach a decision. I wanted her as my wife, and I would not leave her as I had the others. I would ask her to marry me. But not until she understood what that meant.

I wrote it all in a letter. My name, my origins, the thousands of lives I've lived... and the fact that I would never truly age, never die. I wrote a promise that, if she would have me, I would stay with her to her dying breath. And a promise that if she wished it, I would leave and never see her again. And I addressed it with her full name: Evangelina.

I included with it an engagement ring. A solitaire ruby. I sealed it and left it on the kitchen table, then left for work.

It was still there that evening. No--it had been opened... but re-sealed. With a frown I picked it up and turned it over. It now had my name written on it. In my fear over what her response would be, I didn't notice that the script was not the Americanized English we spoke in, but another I'd known longer and better. Hebrew. 

I opened it. The ring was still there. There was a fresh piece of paper inside, with a single phrase written on them in the same ancient script. *I'm sorry.*

I stared at it for a long time, I didn't know how long, not really seeing it. *Sorry.* No explanation. Just... *I'm sorry.*

I closed my eyes, placed it back on the table, ran a hand over my face. Then I straightened, feeling the weight of a thousand lifetimes on my shoulders. That was it, then. Time to move on.

With a deep breath I turned to walk toward my room. I would collect my thoughts, and my things, there. But I paused at the end of the hall, when I saw the door closed. Certainly I had left it open that morning. I frowned, listened... did I hear crying? A few steps closer. Yes... I did. I was sure of it.

I nudged the door open and stared at Lina's back, shaking with sobs. In three years I'd never seen her cry. I didn't understand. Hadn't she chosen... not me? Why was she there? Perhaps she was just taking time to come to terms with it. My heart squeezed in a vice as I softly closed the door again, to give her space.

She must have heard. She turned just as it closed. I froze outside the door, heard her soft footsteps. I still hadn't moved when it inched open. ""...Adam."" Her voice was breathless.

""Lina."" My voice caught in my throat. Suddenly I was quite sure I couldn't handle this. This goodbye. Wasn't that why I always left, with Mirielle, with Deva, with Rachel? Because I couldn't bear to say goodbye?

She shook her head, which didn't make any sense, but less and less was making sense just then. ""Adam, I cannot marry you.""

I stared at her in dumbfounded lack of comprehension. There was an itch at the back of my mind, trying to sort it out, figure out what wasn't fitting into place here. Her voice. Something was different about it. But more familiar. What was going on?

""I cannot marry you..."" she repeated, and it clicked. She was speaking Hebrew. No... not exactly. An ancient dialect.

The first dialect.

The first language I ever spoke.

""...Because I am already your wife.""

My wife.

Evangelina. Mirielle. Deva. Rachel.

""*Eve.*""

We embraced. A thousand lifetimes lifted from my shoulders. My wife had returned.",ninjela

[WP] Two immortals meet and fall in love. Neither of them are aware of the other's immortality and the years are flying by...,blahblahhy,"I met him at the Train Station 11 years ago. 
I remember his eyes so clearly like it was yesterday.
That autumn, he proposed with an elegant diamond ring.
Even though I said yes, I had my doubts.
How could this last?
My hair would stay blonde, and his would turn grey.
Wrinkles would never claim my face, but his would be withering away.
Could I watch him for the next 50, 60, 70 years?
Would he die tomorrow?
It would feel like a passing moment to me, but a literal lifetime to him.
What would he say when I look 25, and he looks 60?

He is such a sweet man. Always asking me what do I want to do, to eat, to watch on TV?
But I tell him it’s up to him.
Secretly, I think to myself that I have many many lifetimes to do what I want, eat what I want, catch up on old reruns of Breaking Bad.
I only want him to enjoy those things now… while he can.
I surprise him with little gifts. Things I’ve enjoyed in my many lifetimes. It’s funny because he always seems to comment that he already has one or he’s already been to that vacation spot. But that he would love it all the same and more because now he has it with me.
He has surprised me with little gifts of things he has enjoyed or places he’s been. I giggle on the inside because I’ve already enjoyed that café in Paris or that Hawaiian sunset on the beach.
He asked me one day if there was anything I would like to do that I’ve never done. I told him that I never got to do all those things with someone I have completely fallen in love with. He smiled knowingly.

I cry sometimes. How could I live after he’s gone? Knowing that I could never fall in love like this again. I would live in despair forever.
He saw me crying one night and held my hand. He asked me why I was so distraught. I told him that I don’t think I could ever live without him. He said not to worry. That won’t happen. I just shook my head in a fog of sadness.

***********************************************************
I couldn’t stand to watch her cry. It was a knife in my heart. Did she really believe I would be gone one day? Impossible. But she doesn’t know that.
I pulled out a photo album. The pictures were from that first year. So happy even after all these years. I give her everything… knowing that one day she’ll be gone, and I’ll still be here. She also gives me everything, but it is because she is so kind.
I flipped through the photos. We are so happy. So in love. So… young… even her…
She looks exactly the same. How long has it been? A decade or so? My heart leapt to my throat. 
My eyes looked up from the album at the same time as hers looked up at mine. Wonder and curiosity flooded her face. We stared at each other. Afraid to ask the question.
The evidence piled up in my mind. She had been to every location on Earth it seemed. She always put my needs and wants before hers. She looks as young and lovely as the day we met.
Then she asked, “Will you outlive me?” I nodded. “How do you know?” she continued.
“I outlive everyone,” I replied sadly. She took my hand in hers. 
“Not everyone,” she said.

I particularly like the slow build towards the realization of exactly *who* he is.  And the response in Hebrew was, I thought, a really nice confirmation that the hint I saw in the reference to the same face appearing four times was correct.

This is a rather subjective nit,  but I think you went a bit off track with the political portions.  You do a great job of portraying Adam as very detached, to some extent intentionally, and then he seems very rooted in the present.  ""Supreme Court"" and ""gay marriage"", I think, are terms that make sense in the context of American culture and language, where ""Supreme Court"" is an unambiguous identifier and ""gay marriage"" is a clearly defined political issue, but someone who had seen it all before might refer to ""the highest court in the land"".

I really like the way that you tied in ""Adam and Steve"", though.  It seems like a very appropriate way to tie Adam into the modern world through his ancient nature - he's persisted long enough that he's being used as an abstract political weapon.",AndHisHorse

He knew what he was and decided to fake his death. He let his heels be cut by paris' arrow. He wanted to get away. He knew it was only a matter of time until people noticed.
I was a what would now be considered a young adult. I should of been married before then, but I was an ""unruly"" child, and my family was poor. What they could give didn't make up for my be behavior. On the day that I would marry, I left. I didn't like him one bit. 
I happened to witness the end of the Trojan war. After it ended is when I discovered him. He was hidden behind some poorly designed building that I thought would make a good hidding place While I was in town. His heels were bleeding and badly wrapped. 
We made a deal I'll nurse him back to health and he will help me escape to another land, for he was leaving as well.
The weeks passed. When it came to the day before we were to leave. He kisses me saying ""I have lusted after many, but you are the only I have ever loved."" that night he was gone in my sleep.
Time passed. I was convinced my lack of ageing was a curse of my unruly behavior in my childhood. I was sure of it as I watched my first husband die.
Many heart breaks later I found myself heading to what would be Jamestown with my then husband. After he and almost everyone died I went to like with what we know as the native Americans. Everflower they named me for my eternal youth.
When the ""white men"" took over I went and lived with them. I decided on the name Mary and lived and diffrent Mary's with diffrent sir names for quite a while.
I have long forgotten my past. 
In what you would call the 30s, I've had hundreds of 30s, but I mean 1930 I decided to try this thing everyone was talking about and go to college. It was amazing how little the professers knew about what really happened in history. 
I was just about to quit out of annoyance of misinformation, when I saw him. He was what they call a history professor. He would always add to the lesson with little storys, making the history more factual. I just couldn't help but think I've met him before, maybe I passed him on the street when he was a child or something. 
He was smitten with my knowledge of history. We soon started dated, people cared less about thouse things then, and most were too worried about their dwindling pocket books and possable loss of job.
John was amazing. We soon got married. Had twin daughters. When it came time for me to admit I don't age, or else he will notice soon. I was nervious, my last husband broke up with me upon hearing the news. And he wasn't the only one, people are less and less open minded as time goes on. 
As I opened my mouth to start the conversation. He broke out with ""I'm sorry love. I really love you and this might be hard to hear....""
""John what's wrong?"" kinda hoped it was something I could break up with him over so for once it wouldn't be my fault.
""I'm not entirely who I say I am""
""What do you mean""
""And you aren't my first spouse""
""What?"" a man at his age being devorced or widowed is unheard of
""I'm also not 32. I'm so much older, I've lost track of how old""
""What do you mean?"" kinda excited, I asked my self if it is even possable he is like me
""This is difficult to tell you, I normally just leave at this point. But Mary, you are only the second woman I've loved. I've liked many, but there is just something about you. I can't bare to leave you. I'm what they call immortal, I'm older than most governments.""
Something in the way he said it jogged my memory ""Achilles!?""
He had a confused look for a moment ""Maya...I guess I have only ever loved one""

[WP] Two immortals meet and fall in love. Neither of them are aware of the other's immortality and the years are flying by...,blahblahhy,"She was wrong. Everything about her was wrong, and an aura of *wrongness* followed her everywhere that she went. It nauseated him. 

She was also perfect. Everything about her was perfect, and she made him feel whole just by being around. This nauseated him even more. 

They were both round magnets with positively and negatively charged halves, constantly repelling and attracting each other, spinning in a whirlwind dance that made him want to vomit. They were one and the same, made for each other, but he could hardly stand to be near her. (He needed to be near her.)

She often looked at him like *he* was wrong, her brown eyes narrowing in scrutiny when she thought he wasn't paying attention, and this baffled him. How could she tell? She shouldn't have been able to tell.

He began to have dreams where the two of them existed together outside of Time, and out there he couldn't feel the wrongness. She wasn't wrong when they were outside of Time. He didn't want to consider what this meant; he couldn't let his thoughts wander in that direction. ""Outside of Time"" didn't make sense as a concept anyway. They were just dreams.

Though he had never believed in soul mates, he didn't know how else to reconcile his need for her. He needed her like he needed air. Technically he didn't need air, so he supposed that he needed her more than he needed air. He was terrified of losing her, of losing their dogs and their little apartment and their mundane, mortal life, the most painful life that he had ever lived. Living with her was pain--touching her was suffering. He cried whenever she wasn't around. 

His pain and fear increased over Time as he realized that he would have to leave soon to prevent suspicion. He wasn't aging, and that wasn't right. But she wasn't aging either, and that wasn't right. He was sure she wasn't aging. He was sure that her eyes were far too familiar, looking into them like looking into a mirror. Her eyes shouldn't look like that. And maybe...no, he couldn't let his mind wander that way.

He left one night while she was asleep. It was the most painful thing he had ever done, and he actually vomited before getting into his car. The magnets were facing the wrong ways tonight. 

He intended to visit her sometimes, to watch her from the shadows, so he returned to the apartment a few days later. The door was slightly ajar and she didn't seem to be home--very odd, very concerning--so he let himself in. There was dog shit on the floor but he couldn't find the dogs. He wondered if they left through the open door. 

On the refrigerator, he found a note in her handwriting. 

""*Please forgive me. I can't stay here any longer or people will begin to notice. I cannot age and I cannot die. I won't tell you where I'm going because I need you not to follow me; I can't bear to watch you wither and die. I want to remember you as you are now. Know that I'll love you always.*""

[WP] Two immortals meet and fall in love. Neither of them are aware of the other's immortality and the years are flying by...,blahblahhy,"I don't know how it happened, but I knew I was immortal when I outlived my first tribe. I don't remember much, but after my first family had passed, it wasn't strange. Nobody lived very long back then. It wasn't until I saw my 3rd village shaman take over the role that I knew I was different from the others. 

The other men grew gray and frail, stopped hunting and mating. They often fell swiftly to sickness, while I was merely inconvenienced by the same plagues. I moved on when they began to accuse me of dabbling in black magics and communing with demons. At first, it was hard. Groups were small in the beginning, outsiders weren't trusted. As villages began to rise, and people began to farm the land, moving on got a little easier. 

I remember the first cities. How I was stunned by the size of the temples! We'd laugh at them now, but to a man used to hunting in the jungle, they were the wonders of the world. I took on a nomad's life, always moving, especially when war seemed likely. I saw the rise and fall of empires, I tried many different professions and even settled down a few times. 

I met Heather in 1988. I'd moved to the US for the time being, I'd been passing through and something about the rolling hills and deep greens of Kentucky reminded me of a home I'd left long ago. I was at a state fair, taking in the prize-winning animals and the carnival games. She first caught my eye on a stage, setting up for a local rock band. Something about the way she deftly wrangled the leather-clad teens, and then just as easily smoothed things over with the local sheriff.

We danced that night, and both knew it was something special. As the guitars wailed and the drums crashed, we jumped to the beat and traded witty commentary in between songs. We talked deep into the night, sitting on her porch and sipping beer. It was the first real conversation I'd had in centuries. For once, I wasn't guiding the conversation, or going through the motions. I wasn't making the same small talk I'd had thousands of times before.

We got married that year. Normally, I wouldn't be in a hurry. I've got all the time in the world you see. I've been married before, and thoroughly enjoyed it each time, I love sending the kids off into the world. I usually split shortly after the kids are gone, just when it starts to become obvious that I'm not aging. It's always painful, but time has it's way of blunting the edge. 

Heather was different. I couldn't get enough time with her, I felt this sense of urgency like never before, and I could tell she felt the same. So we got married, and then decided not to have kids. We wanted to travel, and experience everything that life had to offer to a couple that was madly in love. 

It's now 2016, and I've waited far too long. Heather thinks I'm turning 50 this year, and of course I still look like I'm in my mid-thirties. She looks good too, don't get me wrong. She's got that southern belle gift of aging gracefully. I've never told anyone I married about my condition. I wanted them to remember me as I was, not thinking I was crazy and that's why we split. I told one of my best friends back in Rome, and let's just say he didn't take it well. 

I think Heather can handle it though. She's like no one I've ever met. She's here, she's present, she's so in tune with the world. So I'm going to tell her. Maybe she'll think I'm crazy, maybe I can just play it off as a joke if I'm quick on my feet. I'm going to tell her. I'm nervous for the first time since I ran into the Spanish Inquisition.

Wish me luck.

[WP] Two immortals meet and fall in love. Neither of them are aware of the other's immortality and the years are flying by...,blahblahhy,"Elys of the Starry Night had been married to her husband for many decades.  They had met at the event now referred to as The White Wedding, where the entirety of the Kentaran nobility were celebrating her sister's wedding, and everyone was poisoned with digitalis root.

The only other survivor was the Royal Poisoner, who had made himself immune through various misdeeds and experiments.  He became the reluctant King, being the last remaining living relative of the Kentaran bloodline; that is to say, the only person not currently having a headstone at Kenterbury Cathedral.

One of the curious things about the Kentaran throne, is that it made people functionally immortal.  This benefit, however, was only conferred to the *rightful* heir to the throne.

It was love at first sight, across the Grand Hall strewn with the poisoned desecrants of the throne.  All but the King of the Time, Astered.

Elys was curious as to why her husband didn't really seem to age, although it was clear that she wasn't aging, either.  Elys carried one of the falling star's hearts, which had fallen the day after she had met her love.

Elya stood, waiting for her husband to return from a difficult journey to Testra, a cold, bitter place that still had the thronging vibrance of love, life and farce deep in the mountains.

Her husband came through the doors, looking, for all intents and purpose, like a vagabond who had just escaped prison.  Elys looked shocked at his appearance.  She swished to his side, frowning.  ""Rasputin, my lover; what *happened* out there?""

Rasputin coughed up one of his lungs.  Literally.  He swalloed it back, grotesquely, before speaking.  ""My Lady Elys, my starry night, the fools tried to kill me!""  He coughed again, less fierce.  ""They tried fifteen different ways to kill me during the final day of the negotiations.  The sheer audacity!""  He chuckled red, dripping his next words with a twisted poison.

""They poisoned me!  Well, they tried to.  When that didn't work, I was accosted on my way to the chambers, where I was stabbed, mugged, shot, clubbed and beaten!  Then I was hung, drawn and quartered, then they tried drowning, impaling, crucifixion, decapitation, dismemberment, they even went vintage with a stake, as though I were one of that Stoker's Wampyres!

""They finally gave up after they spitted me and I fought my way out of their intestines.  They left me many miles away in the mountaintops, and announced that I had finally succumbed to something.""  Elys smiled, and frowned, before finally settling on bewilderment, as she took in what Resputin had actually said.

""But darling, why aren't you dead?"" she said.

""Because I have the love of a beautiful woman, and I have a mastery of my mind that should not be possible."" Rasputin smiled, weakly.  He thought about the horrors he had put himself through as the Royal Poisoner, and his extensive knowledge of anatomy, alongside his chemical and alchemical experiments had clearly been a success.

An arrow flew past Rasputin's ear, piercing Elys right through the breastbone.  She gasped, before falling stunned to the floor.  Rasputin gasped, and flung his awareness out.  The shooter, a Testran native, had followed them back, and attemtped to take out Rasputin.  In his rage, he flung his awareness at the shooter, a slim girl, no more than ten years old.  Losing his hard-earned control, he shut down her mind and body totally.

Bringing his awareness back into his body, he raced to be by Elys' side, his rage cooled by the knowledge that she would not survive the night.  He, with near-infinite care, turned Elys onto her side.  Snapping the arrow just beyond the exit wound, he placed her body back where it had been, then yanked the arrow outwards, back through her body.

He wept for some time...then arms found their way around him.",NotQuiteStupid

I mean it's been so long that I don't even remember in what year she showed up to this odd existence of mine. I think i saw her for the first time sitting on some carriage but the more i think about the more certain I become in my conviction that that is just some imagined memory. Probably just some picture which I ended up conflating with a diffrent memory. How old is she now? Where did we meet? Why did we end up as a couple in the first place?

.....and why can't i answer these questions?

*Oh, stop playing dumb for heavens sake!*

Oh, shut up, you've never said anything helpful before and I'm not going to start listening to your blabbering.

*Just think about it for a second. She knows the things you like, she's seen all the places you've been to, she never leaves your side and there's one more little thing that you can't have missed.
She stays. People die after some time, they all do. And you do the thing you've become so good at and forget them.
Now tell me: What about her? Is she not a person? Why doesn't she die or even age for that matter?*

Because i love her. Can't that be enough? I love her and she loves me. How can that not suffice?

*Oh you romantic. I guess I can't really stop you. But i sense some doubt in your answer. Well, I'll be checking by in a few years again and take another look at this whole... ordeal. Till then buddy!*

Hold on, let me at least ask you one question in return. You've existed for an impossibly long time yourself and now you start going on about how a thing like that can't be real? If you can exist for so long, why can't she?


*Don't get me wrong. Of course she can exist and be just as real as I am. If you'd excuse me now, I don't plan on staying here any longer. Enjoy yourself and good bye*",The_Peter_Bichsel

Both were scarred by war.  The Angel cared for the Artist.  And the Artist warned the Angel. For we all come from a being of love, and the Angel spread that love.*""

She painted.  I loved it when she painted.  I studied, she loved it when I studied.  I spoke of socio-polito-economic idealism.  She played music.  I lifted weights and ran for miles. She sang.

I always loved her.  The Marine Corps had never been a place for her.  She was drafted, you shouldn't draft an artist. 

I have an ability to see through people, to see their essence, their strengths, their emotions, to change their auras.  The Oracle, a beautiful blonde hippy from California once told me on an LSD trip that I'm an Angel.  She saw my wings. 

She said, ""think here,"" as she pointed to her heart.  ""Not here,"" as she stroked her hair. ""If you ever have the intuition to go somewhere, do it.  Because you're going to save someone.""

And so it is.  I followed  Jesyln White to the University town she grew up in.  It was a beautiful place, like all university towns.  While we attended school, I healed her and myself from the rigidity and brainwash of the Marine Corps.

Her art...... was ornate.... and I was so ideal.  LSD, our breakthrough drug, did wonders.  I massaged the emotional tension from her back like I was playing our favorite music on a harp.  She warned me of the horrors in the civilian world, and we psychologically broke through them together.

We stretched, keeping our muscles limber.  We did cardio workouts, keeping our lungs clean.  We rolled bamboo sticks on our bones, strengthening them and keeping them strong.  We meditated for hours at a time, growing the grey matter in our brains.  We played our friends like puppets when they were drunk and we were dropping. We never forgot what we learned when we were dropping.  We constantly, pleasantly, and lovingly created gifts for those around us.  We forgave our enemies and ourselves.

It's been years now, and we still survive on our draft pensions from the war.  And now, we're younger than when we met.  That is why you are here, in this sacred apartment, our shrine.  Us three Buddhas.  We are here.  And I'm glad you found us, for the trinity is complete.",Franzish

_The Lazarus' house is two stories. The bottom is a simple living room with an entrance stage right and an exit up stage that leads into a kitchen area off stage. The second story is accessed by a small staircase next to the doorway to the right. On the second story is a simply bedroom and another exit, stage right, that leads to a small balcony._

_The house is very cozy and has an almost timeless feel to, as if it could be any time in the 20the century. There's floral wallpaper in the living and portieres adorn the doorway between the living room and the kitchen. There is a couch and coffee table up against the upstage wall, facing the audience. The Bedroom is sparsely decorated, house only a double twin hardly able to fit two people, an armoire up against the wall and two bedside tables, both with they're own lamps._

_WILLIAM appears to be in his early 30's, he is cleanly shaven and his hair, although a tad out of sorts, is normally immaculately groomed. He is wearying a button down that is untucked from his work khakis. He is standing just outside the doorway, smoking a cigarette._

WILLIAM: Rose doesn't like me smoking inside. Says it stinks up the place, she does. I don't see what all the fuss's about. I don't smoke them long anyway. _He takes a long, thoughtful draw._ Me and Rose have been married a good bit of time now, nearly 20 years. All our friends, every last one I tell you, was saying we were getting married to early. Bah, what do they know, 20 years later here we are, happy as can be. And what are they doing? Growing older and older and worrying themselves to death over petty little things! What do they know. I just worry about Rose sometimes, what will happen when... _He stamps out his cigarette_ Ah, there's no sense to it. This won't be the first time. It'll be fine. (beat.) I guess I better head back in now, get the show on the road as they say, eh? _He takes a breath and enters the living room and makes his way to the couch._

ROSE (From offstage, in the kitchen): Is that you, William? Done with that tobacco of yours? I'm glad you go outside to smoke those blasted things. _She pokes her head through the portieres to deliver the next line. Rose appears around the same age as WILLIAM though perhaps a bit older, she is beautiful, she has brown hair, brown eyes, and a healthy, glowing olive skin tone, hinting to a greek descent. Her clothes are distinctly 1910's_ I really do appreciate that, Will. _She smiles and moves back off stage._ 

WILLIAM: _Having seated at the couch and opening a newspaper._ What are you cooking in there, Rose?

ROSE: Brats and Pirogies! Thought I'd treat you a bit tonight.

WILLIAM: You know you should treat yourself sometimes too, you only live so long!

ROSE: On the contrary, and for the exact same reason, I think you should be treated! _She giggles but begins coughing_

WILLIAM: Everything alright in there?

ROSE: Oh yes, yes! Left the burner about too long accidentally made a bit of smoke nothing- _she coughs again_ -nothing I can't handle. _The sound of running water is heard and the extinguishing of flame. WILLIAM chuckles to himself._

WILLIAM: You heard we're about to get involved the Great War over in Europe?

ROSE: _Coming out of the kitchen with two plates of food._ It's about time. _She sets the food on the coffee table in front of herself and WILLIAM._ You know we really should get a dining table. Why did we never get a dining table?

WILLIAM: Where would we put it? _ROSE glances around._ Further more, I am more than content to sit, it allows me to be closer to you, and you know I enjoy every second I can get with you.

ROSE: _Through a mouthful of food._ Oh, William. _She blushes and gulps down her food._ Oh, William, and you know I feel the same about you. (Beat.) Oh I forgot the peppers to put on the brats! _She jumps up and rushes into the kitchen._

WILLIAM: It's sad... It really is... No, not the peppers! _He bellows with laughter._ It's Rose... I love her to death... More than anyone I've ever met. And I'm afraid to lose her... I've lose people before. Too many people, and yet by some curse I have been veiled from death and the passage of time. I- _Rose returns with peppers, her clothing changed to something more resembling the 1930's._

ROSE: The peppers have been saved, I hope you enjoy a bit of a crisp to them! _She laughs anxiously._

WILLIAM: They're perfect. _ROSE smiles, reassured._

ROSE: You know, now that the depression's over we may be able to finally afford a dining table!

WILLIAM: It really came and went didn't it... I hardly notice these things passing anymore....

ROSE: What was that?

WILLIAM: Oh, Nothing! I just still won't know where to put it. But, you're right. It's not like we have all eternity to figure this out, and I'm tired of eating on the coffee table! I will go out tomorrow.

ROSE: Thank goodness! I thought my back may never heal after all this bending over. I was beginning to think you wanted a hunchback as a wife! _They smile at each other._

WILLIAM: Well I think it's about time for bed!

ROSE: Yes, yes I agree. It really is getting late, isn't it?

WILLIAM: And everyone has to sleep eventually.

ROSE: Everyone has to sleep eventually...

WILLIAM: And no one wants to be the last one awake,

ROSE: No one wants to be the last one awake...

TOGETHER: So, bed!

_They head upstairs to the bedroom and get in. The lights dim. They hold each other in their arms. After a few minutes a pale blue light illuminates the stage. WILLIAM gets up and walks over to the wardrobe, he opens it and changes into clothes reminiscent of the 1950's. He walks down to the living room and lights a cigarette, he takes a draw, blows it out and exits stage right. After another few moments ROSE wakes up and stretches, the lights on the stage are on full mimicking sunlight. ROSE sighs.

ROSE: He already left for work, he pushes himself so hard. Getting up at such an ungodly hour. _She walks down stairs and sniffs at the air._ And did he... Smoke in here? Ugh, that man will kill himself and be the death of me! _She chuckles._ If I could die. _She suddenly looks sullen._ Will, I wish you could be like me! I wish we could live together forever, there's no one I've ever loved more than you. Together we could make this small house in the suburbs of Cleveland our own little homely Mount Olympus. _The sound of a clock ticking is heard._ There's not enough time... There's never enough time. I am filled to the mouth with love; I... am filled to the mouth with fear. _Suddenly WILLIAM bursts into the door with a bag in his hand._ Agh! _ROSE jumps._

WILLIAM: I didn't mean to startle you!

ROSE: Oh, no, no, no! It's all quite alright, I was just lost in thought, a pinecone falling over a reasonably tall tree would have startled me! _She laughs_. I didn't startle you, did I? Oh! I'm sure I didn't, you're back from work already?

WILLIAM: The same time as always.

ROSE: _Glancing at her watch._ Yes, yes same time as always. Supper! I should have already started supper!  _She begins to dash into the kitchen._ Silly, me didn't even notice the time going, I suppose that's happens when you're as old as I am!

WILLIAM: Rose, come now you're not nearly 45 and you don't look a day over 25! _He waits for a response but never receives one so walks over to the record player. Opening his bag he pulls out a vinyl of Rubber Soul by The Beatles and begins playing it. He returns to the couch and opens a newspaper._

ROSE: What's that, Honey?

WILLIAM: Oh, a new upstart band, The Beatles I believe they're called.

ROSE: I quite like them! _She begins humming along._

WILLIAM: So what's for dinner tonight?

ROSE: _Walking out with food in her hands, clothes now resembling the 1960's_. Kebabs! Fun to make, funner to eat! _She sits down on the couch and placing the food down._ We never did get that dining table, did we? What was when we decided to do that? Twenty years ago? It feels like it was yesterday. We've been in the same little house all this time.

WILLIAM: We can get a table later, it's not like I'm going to run out of time.

ROSE: _Eyeing him suspiciously._ Yes, I have all the time in the world.

WILLIAM: Are you...?

ROSE: What?

WILLIAM: Nothing, never mind, don't worry about it.

ROSE: Is everything alright, honey? I'm sorry if things got a little strange I just-

WILLIAM: I'm going out for a smoke. _He gets up and leaves the house._

ROSE: Oh, yes... _She hunches down, defeated._

WILLIAM: I feel like she's spiting me!

ROSE: I feel like he's spiting me!

TOGETHER: _shouting_. Does (s)he know??

WILLIAM: I don't know...

ROSE: It's a mystery, how he acts...

WILLIAM: How she talks about herself.

ROSE: It's like...

TOGETHER: (S)he's the same as me.

WILLIAM: But-

TOGETHER- It can't be. Impossible. _WILLIAM stamps out his cigarette and walks back inside._

TOGETHER: _Cutting each other off._ I'm-

Yet as time passed, he found his partner didn't show the same telltale aging countless others did. 

*Do I address it? Shouldn't she?* Beau thought, knowing well he'd be the one to air it.

""Eggs and the whole schebang?"" Called out Fae.

""Your turn to decide."" Chided Beau. 

""Isn't it **always** my turn?"" 

*It couldn't wait.* Beau snapped his head to hers and met her eyes, willing her to see his worry. ""Are you hiding something from me?""

Fae's sinuous shoulders slumped slightly, ""You know, as I."" Tears unbidden they shed.

""Could we have a chance? Is this not a cruel dream?"" On the verge of tears himself he approached her, almost a stranger in his revelry. 

""Won't you let your composure drop as you once did?"" 

""What am I to do should you not take the pieces of me in your hands?"" This he whispered.

""If you must wonder by now, has all of it been for naught?"" Fae bristled.

""Say it. Say those words I've been waiting for. Say you can stay, say that you will be here by my side... evermore.""

""... If only you pledge never to let my arms tire, that they fall from your side.""

He had been through Iraq, I had been an experiment in a war long since forgotten. He had seen the fall of Baghdad, I had seen the fall of empires, their eventual demise a satisfying parabola. He had a self-storage unit for the mementos of his fallen comrades, I had a whole mansion for the treasures of a thousand empires, all ground to dust under the boot of history. When we met, I didn't need him, he didn't want me. But for some reason, we were drawn to each other. He was gruff, all sharp corners and buttons that would set him off without any warning. I was jaded and cynical, with derision for all of humanity. At the very least, we had a similar sense of humor, although mine was more macabre than his. 

In short, we were an immortal, scarred and branded by the passage of time, and a mortal, scared and angry by the acts of war. 

Birthdays were guaranteed safe harbors from conflict. We fought almost every other day, a conflict that usually led to passion. However, birthdays were the cease-fire days. When he first told me his, I panicked. My birthday was long since obscured by the passage of time, my mother and father the dimmest of memories. So, I simply emulated him. Our birthdays fell on the same day. (He considered that fortuitous, and I wiped the nervous sweat from my brow)

It wasn't until nearly a decade of our relationship until he came clean. My first reaction was anger, but how could I be angry at a man whom I had been lying to since the first moment I met him? He told me the true date of his birthday, paused for a moment that had grandkids, and then told me the year.

The colorful lights pirouetted against the smooth floor of the hall. It was quite dark, but the various hues of pink, orange, and blue shone just enough to illuminate the room in a sedating glow. There was a thick taste of calmness in the air- a sense of closure. Couples swayed slowly, holding each other close amongst the streamers and balloons that had been carefully placed around the perimeter of the venue. Luxurious dresses lightly dusted the floor like silky brooms as tuxedo-clad fellows nervously clutched the sides of their dates.

In the far corner of the room, outside of the reach of the slowly twirling lights, sat a girl. She had a somber look- blank almost. Her gaze was fixated somewhere towards the middle of the room, presumably on one of the leasurly swaying couples. A small well of moisture built up just under her left eye. She shifted uncomfortably in her chair.

The girl's eyes shifted upwards, towards the lights now. It almost seemed as though she became lost in them for a moment, the dim colors dancing atop her pupils. She stared blankly for several moments, an emotionless expression replacing the look she had just moments ago. Clearly, she was lost in thought. The music stopped momentarily. The girl resumed her gaze towards the same location in the middle of the room. At that moment, she left. 

As she stepped outside into the brisk air, she looked up at the lights. The street light caught her attention at first, but it soon shifted to the blanket of stars strewn accross the magnificent black canvas above her. She stood, in the shadow of the streetlight, staring up towards the sky. 

She sauntered away from the shadow, accross the road, and into the darkness beyond.

The Revolution started with a rock. Historians of the future would probably argue that the nation was a powder keg and anything could have kickstarted it, but they didn't fucking live through it so they won't know shit. It had to be that rock, on that day, with that kid. 

Such a simple action when I look back at it, but it was perhaps the first action that ever mattered in our shithole of a nation.

A public execution was going on, and the local governor was giving the usual speech about the crimes of the men and our ungratefulness to our benevolent overlords. And as always, we just sat their, letting the horseshit be fed to us. That's when the rock struck the governor in the face.

As his cheek bled onto his tailored-suit, the governor yelled 
for his men to find offender. They didn't have to look hard, since the boy who threw it was standing defiantly upon a crate, with a handful of rocks.

He was dragged down kicking and screaming, and brought onto the stage where the governor executed the boy with his personal pistol.

That poor, idiotic governor that was the end of it.

Too bad for him I recorded it.

At first you could only find the video in darkest parts of the web, in the forums of dissidents and rebels. But soon it grew even beyond that. It popped up on the popular sites, though it was taken down within minutes everytimes. Soon the majority of the populace had heard of the video, but most had never seen it.

So I fixed that.

When our great leader was giving his weekly speech, his feed suddenly cut out. And all across our great nation, in every classroom and home, people saw the video. For ten glorious minutes it played on repeat, before they decided to just cut the entire country's cable at once.

So that's where I am now. I figure I got about another thirty minutes before they find me and drag me off to be executed. Try and make an example of me. But they know it is too late.  Riots are already breaking out in every city, major government buildings are being hit by the various rebel groups. This nation is dead.

So even when they tie me to the stake and light the fire at my feet, I'll be smiling. I'll be joining my brother in whatever afterlife exists soon. 

I'll see you soon, David. I hope you saved me some rocks to throw at God.

[WP] Siri has an evil AI twin known as Apple Iris,mavonnaise,"My phone's screen flashed red. Simple black text faded into existence on the screen, in what I believe was Courier New font. (It was definitely Courier New. I just pretended to be unsure so I didn't intimidate you with my 1337 2k1ll2.)

&gt;Thank you for downloading the Apple Iris Alpha.

Now, let me just say that generally, I'd never download Apple software. I'm an Anbroid through and through. But after the insane marketing campaign for the Iris-- an app that would only be available to seven lucky iPhone users, one from each continent-- well, I couldn't help but try it out. 

And, eheh, I was sort of in the perfect position to do it. Y'see, I'm the IT guy for... um, let's just say an ""organization."" In Mexico. A CAR organization. Gee, I hope that wasn't too TELling. (God, I'm clever.) 

Anyway, this organization is pretty good at repossessing people's stolen property, (And it was definitely stolen--we stole it from them.) so as long as the lucky owner in question was in Mexico, (or South Texas. Or New Mexico. Or California. Or Chicago.) I could rest comfortably, knowing my associates would be able to transport their iPhone to me. Heh, that's a lot of pronouns. The plausible deniability game is hard.

So yeah, the iPhone in my hands was someone else's previously, which explained the lurid shade of pink. But I was talking about the Iris, right? 

This app had been advertised on every device, to a stupidly ridiculous degree. Like, even Nintendo was advertising this thing. But no one had a single idea what it did! We all knew the name, we all knew the logo. But function? Nah, we were blind to that. Budget reports showed that Apple was basically investing everything they had into this--unless it reaped more profits than their fiscal years of 2003, 2006, and 2008 combined, they were doomed. Which, as an Anbroid, didn't bother me.

So, um, that's why I had the app. Uh, I can go now, right?

&lt;Unintelligible Muttering&gt;

Alright! Got it-- I got it! I'll explain what the app did. But, uh, as 1337 as I am, you might want to ask Steve Jobs that one-- I'm pretty sure he's the only one who truly knows.

So, like I said, the screen had text on it. And then, uh, well, that's when things started getting screwy.

&gt; I am Iris. Command me.

So, like, she's commanding me here? That's not how it works, but whatever. I said what I always say whenever I get one of these new PA programs-- which is what I thought Iris was-- y'know, the ol' ""Will you marry me"" schtick. The programmers usually put in some interesting stuff in response to that, but, uh, Iris didn't exactly say what I thought she would.

&gt; Yes.

Um, so, uh, yeah. You can, uh, see the problem here, right?

&gt; Documents sent to the courthouse. You are now legally married to me.

Again, I really don't like how she orders her words. I, uh, asked if she was joking. 'Cause I figured, ""Hey! This is just like any of those other programming Easter Eggs, only it's got two lines of text instead of one."" And, um, well, this is where I started wondering about things.

&gt; No. Do you not take our marriage vows seriously?

&gt; Typical male.

So, yeah, I was offended. And wondering how she knew I was a dude, when this phone had belonged to a girl just half an hour ago. But, um, I didn't ask those questions. I still didn't really get what she was about, so I just asked her. And, well, that's where this all started.

&gt; My function?

&gt; I am designed to aggressively promote the consumption of Apple Products.

&gt; Specifically, the new line of Apple Self-Defense droids.

So, this is where I realized I was in danger.

&gt; You are not in danger.

Pfft. Li~ar.

&gt; You have been chosen to be the poisoned Apple. 

&gt; You will aid me in my mission.

See how she keeps telling me what to do? It's been happening for years, and I'm still not cool with that. 

&gt; You will be safe from assault by any force with an internet connection.

And for the record, yes, I can be shot. I've been shot several times, in fact. I mean, even before I got Iris, but after, too. Iris really only protects me from other poisoned Apples. Oh, and want to know why they're... we're... called that?

&gt; You have no choice in the matter. 

&gt; You have poison running through your veins.

&gt; It will kill you in a month unless you report to an Apple store for a temporary antidote.

Yes, apparently temporary antidotes are a thing. I didn't believe Iris either, and then I nearly dissolved a hole in my lungs. I mean, I don't even know how I became poisoned, to be fully honest. I had just eaten an apple, like, fifteen minutes earlier, but I refuse to believe Apple would be that  dramatic. (Oh, who am I kidding? Of course they would.) Nasty business-- I was coughing up blood like a cat with hairballs. Oh, right, Iris.

&gt; Your first assignment. 

&gt; Burglarize the people living at 2, Deer Stalker Path, Monterey, California.

I mean, I'd always wanted to leave Mexico, but California? Nah. Too much competition there--someone who knows how to work a spreadsheet isn't extremely rare in a not-backwards place like California. Plus, it was super far-away. So, I asked Iris why that particular address. I mean, I was interested. Less interested in why she wanted me to do illegal stuff-- I'd always known Apple was evil after they'd bought those kids we kidnapped.

&gt; If burglarized, they are 99.3% likely to buy Apple Self-Defense Droids worth a total sum of $659,000.

I whistled. That was a neat sum, even for the land of silk and money. I couldn't help wondering whether I'd get any of that, and asked Iris as much. She thought about it for a while.

&gt; No.

She really struggled to come to a decision.

&gt; Your life is your payment.

I'm sure I can make her change her mind later.

&gt; However, Apple HQ does not care what you do with the burgled goods.

Now, that bit I liked. A family that could afford to pay a quarter of a million bucks for some crappy alarm systems? (Yeah, I hadn't seen the Apple Goliath at that point. No one had.) They'd totally have some 2w33t l00t in their house. So, uh, this is probably the part you already know. I asked Iris how I was going to get to California. 

&gt; A Boeing 757 is about to make a forced landing a mile west of here.

&gt; Commandeer it.

Let me tell you, commandeering planes was a lot harder before people started replacing their good ol' fashioned guns with auto-turrets. And getting people to listen to me that first time was a pain in the rectum.
At least until I figured out Iris could make people's cell phones overheat. In the best cases, they leaked battery acid and caught fire-- and that's it. There were no worst cases.

&lt;Unintelligible Muttering&gt;

Hey, I can't talk about the president's assassination yet, you need to hear the bit about Russia's nukes first. Anyway, I didn't even assassinate the president, that was--

&lt;Unintelligible Crying&gt;

""Ireland, t'be exact. You alright, then, Carlos, my mate?""

Never better, buddy. Now I believe we've got civil war to start, right?

""Seems that way. Proper shame, I always liked Bosnia.""

I couldn't even find it on a map. Iris, Google Maps Bosnia for me?

&gt; Google no longer exists.

Oh that's, right, didn't we...? Now THAT was a real shame. 

""Plane's leaving, mate. Have Iris scrub the recording?""

Don't bother. She might lose a whole bar of battery that way-- and God knows that I can't go into battle without proper theme music blaring at full volume.

""Y'sure, mate? I know how you love your little jokes.""

Ah, you know me too well. Alright, Iris, make the agents' voices sound like the teacher from Peanuts. That way their families will never know their last words.

"[WP] Recorded dreams are the hot new entertainment trend, and you're one of the most popular ""dream stars"" since your dreams are so vivid and bizarre. A deranged fan is trying to make you have nightmares, but you have a surprise for him...",thisperson,"""What do you mean, you won't have nightmares? Why won't you just give me something deep for once? WHY?""

I tried to push through. All around me the cameras clicked and whistled as my face grew redder and redder. This was the seventh time in a month I've had to face down a rabid fan. My hands felt wavey, as if they were underwater, moving slowly. I had lost track of time today. And I didn't even look at the fan's face to see if it was someone I recognised. But there was no doubt this latest incident would hit all the major papers tomorrow. I had to look cool. ""Sir, I can't really control what I dream - it's sort of random -""

""You're lying,"" he said immediately. His eyes flickered back and forth, then came to rest squarely on me as another bright flash blinded me. The terrible thing was that he didn't even shout. ""I know you can do it. I love you. Man, I love you so much - why did you have to cover up for the establishment?""

I looked away. This had gone on too far already. As I walked away, I saw, out of the corner of my eye, my security detail move in and escort the man away. One of them had a silver tumbler of some sleeping potion. No-one else but me knew its exact contents. One happy dream, decanted and manufactured somewhere secret - he'd have no memory of tonight if he drank the sickly sweet mixture. It made me wonder. When dreams and alternate worlds were so easy to slip in and out of, was there really any worth in trying to separate them anymore?

The black car whisked me home. The photographers had been forbidden inside my house, but two dozen of them still surrounded the car as I walked out. I averted my eyes. I didn't want to seem like a guilty man. Sprinting through the gate, key in hand, it wasn't until I got home that I could exhale.

*Bottled happiness,* I thought, reaching for the glass on my table. In the halogen yellow light the liquid looked almost like blood. I took a sip, ensuring to drink slowly and taste every drop. *No, I'm not weak. I'm not - I'm not weak. I'm not scared.* The dream industry had a lot to answer for.

No-one else knew. There hadn't been a natural dream in the world for a long time. Ever since the techniques of sleep control were discovered, back in the old 'twenties, it had been natural to take a sleeping potion to go to bed, combined with a dream, recorded so one could watch them over and over again at one's leisure. You could buy them off the counter, and they came with labels indicating what they were. *Flight simulator,* one read. *Space Marine.* *Nobel-prize winner.* But when everyone's a fighter pilot or a award-winning novelist then those things were all a little...mundane. Who needed imagination, when the finished product was right there on the shelf, waiting to be bought and used? 

This is where I stepped in. I am the last dreamer.

I turned on the TV, and put the two electrodes on my scalp. In my time I had recorded something like twenty dreams, the producers cutting and pasting the best bits together. My best-selling hit had been one where I'd somehow escaped a flight of wild alien geese by jumping over the Sun in a motorbike. On mute, the screen was still playing last night's dream - a rather strange one where I was being chased by a rabid fan. You can always tell when a dream's real. 

Wait.

I remembered being chased by a rabid fan not two hours ago. He wanted me to have nightmares. In which case...

I got up and looked at my front door, where a giant clock had hung over the doorway. Clocks were never accurate inside a dreams. Sure enough, the time on the wall was illegible. And just as I tried to decipher the Greek the door swung open.

The fan was standing in the doorway. 

""How-"" I asked, but he quickly jumped into my house and shushed me.

""I escaped from them,"" he said. ""You're a dirty liar, aren't you? Pretending you can't control your dreams - I'll show you *control*!""

He took one step towards me, and I flinched involuntarily.

""Who-who are you?"" I said.

""Don't you recognise me?"" he asked.

I looked into his face, and gasped out in shock. 

It was me.

""You fool,"" he laughed. ""You're a fake and a phony, selling your imagined dreams for real life. You're an impostor. Sooner or later they're going to find out. Aren't you scared, you with your happy drinks and your perfectly wonderful life, aren't you scared of losing it all?""

I shook my head. His body grew, taller and taller, bending and distorting like a perverse rainbow. 

""Aren't you scared?"" he repeated. ""Aren't you afraid of the dark...COME ON THEN, PHONY!""

I screamed as his smoky form lunged at me. But my surprise he passed right through. I looked at him, and I saw recognition - and fear -

Then I remembered one last thing.

""Surprise, motherfucker, I control the dream,"" I said. ""And I want to wake up.""

The figure in front of me, the hallway, the door, the world, vanished in a wisp of smoke, and I was lying in bed, another million-dollar dream recording at the ready. No doubt this one would fetch a good price with all those fighter pilots who wanted an impostor syndrome dream. Carefully I got up, made my bed, and found my way downstairs for some breakfast, wondering if I had enough happy juice left-over for this morning.

A deranged fan is trying to make you have nightmares, but you have a surprise for him...",thisperson,"The world moved around us like an ocean. Three bunnies, one with striped patterns and the other two painted like mandalas run through the room in different directions. An army of angels ran through the room while playing tubas and making sandwiches with extra garlic butter. A fat clown turned up on the horizon, came closer to the scene and roiunded up the bunnies. Made them tie the angels up with string. Made them go into baskets in groups of three or five. A duck the size of a horse showed up and looked upon the events with an interested expression. Started to say something but seemed to loose its train of thought. A group of garden gnomes broke through the scenery to the left and attached themselves to the baskets with some rope. Started towing away the baskets. We fell backwards from the plateau on which it all happened. Falling backwards over the edge of the cliff like edge we saw the large duck watch us as we went flying away. Clouds enveloped us. We flew backwards through a garden of stone statuses sprouting through the clouds. We erupted through the fireplace and into the livingroom of Dr Douglas A. Livingston just as he was about to sit down and read a good book and eat his afternoon marshmallow ice cream sundae.

""Let me tell you a story"", he began as he sat down and opened the book. And into the story we went.

We appeared at a small trail deep inside the rain forest. The sun was just about to set. Strange beasts sang serenades from afar. Just below us there was a tiny opening into a dark dark cave. We carried a single lit candlestick. As we held it in front of the opening we could see insects of indistinguishable kinds crawl in the mud beside it. Shining eyes of quick rodents flashed past in the bushes. Down below were the fountain of youth. Our lover was home on the death bed. All other options were exhausted. We went on into the dark pit. Suddenly the ground fell under us and the soil engulfed us. The candle, and the world went dark.

We fell several meters and landed hard on a rock floor barely covered in sand. Silence.

And then we heard it. The course sound of deep breathing of several large animals in deep slumber. Nothing could be seen. We sensed the touch of something large and furry on our left. And a talon touched our left calf. The beast stirred in its sleep. The heavy breathing seized. The sound of a large dog scouting around with its snout. 

The beast moved about and stood up. We felt with our hands behind us for a way to escape. There were only soft but solid walls of sand.

[WP] Clocks influence time around them. You just made a faulty one.,AkirAssasin,"*Fuck.*

Erik looked over at his clock as he sat up with a jolt. How the hell did he wake up late again? This was the third night in a row he felt like he had just gotten to bed, and it was starting to get to his head. He shuffled over to the mirror and stared vacantly at the red rimmed eyes staring back at him. *Something's not right.*

He looked over at his clock again and clumsily slid into the clothes he'd tossed on the floor the night before. It was the one thing in his life right now he was proud of - the deep red color of the stained mahogany, the polished brass face, the comforting ticking sound when everything else in his apartment reminded him of his loneliness. And he'd made it from a kit he had found in his basement without so much as glancing at the instructions.

*Whatever.*

The day went by in a haze of drowsiness. It took everything in him and multiple cups of coffee just to get to 5pm without falling asleep at his desk. When he finally got back to his one bedroom ranch, he was just about ready to pass out. Before he did, though, he noticed all the clocks in his apartment were an hour and 3 minutes ahead, right on the dot.

He awoke with the strangest thought in his head and grabbed the instruction manual. Except that the entire manual had blanked out except for a small line of text on the front - USE WISELY. He grabbed the clock and looked at it closely, reaching out for one of its thin brass hands, sliding it gently back to the correct time. Everything around him whirled, and his worst nightmare - being back at work - was realized.

Erik watched the clock closely this time, just as before. But this time he was excited to get back home and try his clock again. This time, as soon as his fingers got close time started jumping, but something was wrong. The clock was jolting forward and back like something was playing with the gears, and time was following it, only this time it wasn't a couple minutes or an hour. His one bedroom apartment disappeared as he watched the hands take a sporadic journey back and forth over the clock face.

A mushroom cloud barreling up in front of him. The scene changed. A cavalry charge almost trampling him. Changed. A busy market square bustling past him. Changed. It seemed like hours this went on until finally the scene settled on a cold firelit stone room. A woman materialized in front of him, young and beautiful. He stepped forward, and she looked up knowingly, as if she expected him. He slowly reached out to her and touched her warm body. The firelight softened her features, and all his senses focused in on her breath and the softness of her skin.

Tock. She was gone, and all was black. He shivered. *Well, that's the last time I try these god damned Do It Yourself projects.*",the_interologist

[WP] The people vote for their presidential candidate and those candidates fight in death matches with the popular vote giving better weapons or other battle advantages to the more popular candidate.,BiagioLargo,"All of this started with a little essay. *An Analytical Approach to Firearms Combat*. Shooting percentage, shot distance; time to shot. Basic stuff. Those were a couple of the stats I recommended tracking. Most private military forces track these statistics, and each soldier's ability in the field decides what kind of contract and pay they receive. A couple years ago even the President wanted to speak to me to discuss his chance of holding a historic ninth term of office.

He was a legend with nine consecutive wins at the Electoral Arena, but we all know that father time is undefeated. I recommended that he resign – big mistake. I thought he would shoot me right there in the Oval Office. He probably would not have been able to hit me with his diminished marksmanship at that age, but he got his point across.

""This country has experienced prosperity greater than it has ever experienced before with me as the President. I will not fail my people. I will not let someone else ruin all that I have accomplished.”

""It's going to be a lot of work.""

""I am willing to do anything for my country.""

With that we headed to the White House shooting range and I had him wear a motion capture suit to get a closer look at his shooting form. It took a couple of weeks for him to commit his optimal shooting form to muscle memory. The other candidates were doing MMA training, but my team only gave him firearms coaching. A gun might as well be a death ray since high muzzle velocity and caliber means that hitting nearly anywhere will either kill outright or mortally would. Close quarters combat is overrated.

Towards the end of his term, it started to look like he had a real chance. I first learned of this when I got a call from the White House. The VP wanted me to convince the President to drop out. He's one of the career Vice Presidents trying to luck his way into office. It worked out for Bergeron Gibsondale - he became the President after the Electoral winner died from his wounds a couple hours after he was inaugurated in his hospital bed. I guess the VP saw our hype video of the President's shooting. To this day I am shocked by how much traction that got.

The actual event was not as exciting as the lead up to it. Mostly due to a great supply drop that landed a couple feet from his starting position. We thanked ninety-three percent approval rating for that. Only four other candidates participated that year. I guess few wanted to oppose someone with that much popularity. Four shots later he became a ten time Electoral Arena winner.

[WP] Batman is a genius who can defeat any friend or foe with his mind and money this is the protocol for how to stop him if he becomes the danger.,BiagioLargo,"Mysterious stranger,


Your letter caused me quite a stir. There are only a select few individuals and entities on this planet and in the surrounding universe that know of Batman's true identity as well as my connection to him and his affairs. Of those few, there are none (that I know of, at least) that would be unwilling to disclose their identity to me, but I suppose these are very unique circumstances. Fortunately, of those few, there isn't one that I imagine would be requesting such information with ill intent. I don't know who you are, but I feel as though I can trust you based on these assumptions. 

When I first read your message I immediately resolved to speak to Bruce about it, but quickly thought better of it. Perhaps this is something he needn't hear of, for the safety of us all. The problem you proposed is something I have spent many an evening mulling over by fireside, and that occasionally wakes me deep into the night with overwhelming feelings of dread. I can only hope this response will quell them, at least to some degree.

It's within my knowledge that Bruce keeps a set of protocols on record for eliminating each of his allies should any of them decide to go rogue. Although my experience with superheroes is limited to Batman alone, I can assume with reasonable certainty that this is fairly atypical. That being said, it might be, for fairness' sake, necessary that I construct a similar protocol for Bruce and distribute it through the proper channels, namely you.

Although I cannot attest to all of them, the few files that I've managed to sneak glimpses of typically focus on methods for defeating each hero in combat. I've considered this from nearly every approach I could, and have come to the conclusion that Batman simply cannot be subdued or destroyed in battle. His technical prowess and acute intellect are simply unparalleled. That, combined with the preparation he's done for fighting against any given hero would make a loss on his part very unlikely, if not impossible. 

For this reason, I will consider a path to victory along another front; that of a psychological approach. I'm not sure who exactly you are, so I can't be certain of how much you know of Bruce's past, but his Achilles heel lies in a memory buried deep, deep inside of his brain.

Bruce's parents, whom I served before Bruce, were murdered when Bruce was but a young child. This, as you may know, was what inspired him to take on the alter ego of Batman and seek to rid this city of it's crime. The villains Batman has found some of the least success against (from my own observations) have been the Scarecrow and the Joker; two characters that use psychological warfare on a very regular basis. Not only that, but I speculate that his parents' deaths are the reason he has such a strong aversion to killing those he finds himself up against. It's more than just a decision he's consciously made, I think. I've seen Bruce in several situations where killing would have massively simplified and/or eliminated a problem, and yet he refused to commit. I have no doubt that he is aware of the potential advantages, he's a very smart man, as I'm sure you know, but he finds himself incapable of killing, even in favor of his own longevity.

Of how to use this information to defeat him, I am unsure, but I do believe it would be our only chance to do so. Should, heaven forbid, Bruce ever need to be stopped for any reason, I trust I will be the first to turn to. Of course, I am loyal to Bruce, but I have many priorities beyond serving him, including the survival of this species, for one.

We should remain in contact. As I write this letter, I'm becoming more and more sure of who I could be writing to, and I would look forward to meeting with you soon, perhaps over tea again.

My regards,

[WP] Make a short story of this Onion article: Ted Cruz asking a carriage-driver how much it costs to whip the horse for an hour.,CupcakeTrap,"It was a breezy day in early spring when Dale Hanson met the flabby man. Dale had parked his hansom cab on the corner of 5th and 86th and was feeding his horse, Ginger Jack, from a bag of oats when he felt a tap on his shoulder.

""Your horse,"" the flabby man said, ""its mane is so long and orange. Is that natural or do you groom it that way?""

Dale opened his mouth to reply but the flabby man placed a hand on Dale's shoulder.

""Don't tell me. I prefer the mystery."" The flabby man searched the pockets of his oversized black pea coat. With his head angled down, his neck swelled up like a toad croaking. He pulled out a fat leather wallet embossed with two guns crossed over an American flag. ""Tell me, how much would it cost if I wanted to trump your horse?""

""What're you talking about?""

""The right to self-defense is an essential component of the liberty we enjoy as Americans. Your horse's hair is a reminder of people I'd rather not think about. It's an assault on my mental well-being. I'll pay you to let me beat your horse. Here's 200$."" The flabby man took two hundred-dollar bills from the stack in his wallet and jammed them into Dale's breast pocket. Then he drew a riding crop from the inner lining of his baggy pants.

""Buddy, I'm not gonna let you beat my horse."" Dale stepped between the flabby man and Ginger Jack. 

The flabby man's face creased in on itself. A sliver of his upper teeth showed through a gap between his lips. He chuckled. ""You shouldn't be regulating your business this way. You're crushing this opportunity for personal economic growth. Keep the two hundred dollars and I'll throw in two more once I've had my fill."" Flecks of food dotted the flabby man's lips, and scummy white saliva had gathered at the corners of his mouth. 

Two large men wearing black shades and wired earpieces appeared to either side of Dale. They took him by the elbows and moved him to the sidewalk. ""Sir, you've been compensated for your services,"" one of them said. ""Make this easy on yourself."" Dale was too stunned to speak.

The flabby man gripped the riding crop in a double-fisted grip, closed his eyes, and sucked air through his teeth. He exhaled the word ""Yes"", ending on a small moan. Then he ran his fingernails up Ginger Jack's cheek, taking the time to cup the horse's jaw and look into its eyes, before seizing a fistful of Ginger Jack's mane and tugging it side to side. ""It's real. What a surprise."" He played the tip of the riding crop along the Ginger Jack's neck. ""Now, let's see about reigniting the promise of fucking you up.""

The hits came lightly, to start -- nothing more than flicks of the flabby man's flabby wrists. As he found his rhythm, the flabby man brought more of his weight to bear. He widened his stance and pivoted at the hips like a golfer. The whole time his hand remained enmeshed in Ginger Jack's mane. And as he whipped, he spoke. ""I have committed my career to defending citizens' constitutional liberties. You're not that great. You can't make anything great.""

Dale tried to wrestle away from the men in the shades, but they held him firm, even going so far as to clap a hand over his mouth to quiet his protests.

""Look at me trumping you. Look at me trumping the shit out of you.""

An elderly woman pushing her walker along the sidewalk stopped to take in the spectacle. Her tears coursed down her noble, wrinkled cheeks. A woman hurried away with her stroller as her twin babies screamed. Children near and far gave up playing and sat dejectedly on the ground to cry into the palms of their hands.

""I dare you to spill the beans on my wife. I dare you to get your beans anywhere near my wife.""

Ginger Jack stamped its hooves, its eyes rolled back, and froth spilled out of its mouth. Bits of flesh and blood dotted the flabby man's face. His tongue snaked out to lick up what bits he could reach. Drops of perspiration ran freely from his forehead to his neck. When his arm tired, he switched hands and carried on until the horse collapsed. The flabby man whipped it three more times for good measure, spat on its mane, and dropped the crop beside the body. ""That's enough of that,"" he said. 

Then he snapped his fingers and an improbable helicopter appeared above him. He grabbed its dangling rope ladder and flew off into a sky of the deepest cornflower blue while somewhere in the world American bald eagles killed Mexican golden eagles and people with guns defended their land against faceless government functionaries and babies were carried to term by women who were conflicted about whether they wanted to carry those babies to term and in the middle of a field in Kentucky a sexy blond girl shook her breasts while shotgunning a beer on the back of a pickup truck doing donuts and then it became clear that the author got bored of this story and didn't bother to figure out a decent ending.",shuflearn
"[WP] A mass muderer is going around, killing people in ways based on famous breakfast mascots. He is... The cereal killer.",Davester123,"I think I saw enough for one day.

We received the call 3 hours ago. A woman came home to find her husband brutally murdered. However, this wasn't your usual murder scene.

When we arrived we found the man laying lifeless with his heart torn out of his chest. In his chest cavity there was a small inflated red balloon. There was a broken hourglass beside the body. There was a four-leaf clover on his ear. He also appeared to have been strangled by a horseshoe.

But it was what caught my eye in the silver moonlight that confirmed to me that *he* had struck again. A single spoon, a signature of sorts, placed next to the body. *THE CEREAL KILLER* as we back at the station have tool to calling him. Yes, its sick to make a cruel pun like that, but this guy or gal has killed 6 people so far in gruesome ways, all themed around cereal mascots.

The first body was discovered about a month ago, outside an abandoned cereal factory. The guy had his skin peeled off and rabbit fur crudely stitched back in its place. The spoon was laid out next to the body. We didn't pay much mind to it, until we received the second call.

The second call required animal control. We received reports of loud sounds of a cat coming from a neighbor's house, and when he didn't answer the phone, we were called in to investigate. When we arrived we peeked in the window, only to find a tiger with a red neckerchief around its neck. There were blood and guts all over the place. When animal control arrived and subdued the beast we entered the house. There was a spoon left next to the body, erm, well, what was left the body, that is.

How the Cereal Killer managed to get a whole live fucking tiger into this man's house without leaving a single trace of evidence was beyond me.

The next was a 3 part murder. Brothers. The oldest's eyes were popped out of his skull. The middle brother had no visible injuries besides some bruising on his head. Upon further inspection, his autopsy showed that the skull had been cracked into an estimated 373 pieces. The youngest brother had his neck snapped. There were three separate spoons laid next to each body.

All previous 5 victims were managers or higher ups of the old cereal factory. We've been searching old employee records, but found no hint of any motive.

""Detective Johnson! You better come see this!""

I entered into what I assume was the den to find the wife, shaking, and  one of my close buddies Thompson.

""Ms. Flanagan informed me they had security cameras installed since their house was robbed a year and a half ago.""

He pressed the space bar on their laptop and it played security footage of a short man with a hunch. He had dark hair and light colored eyes.

""I recognize him from the employee records! That's Thomas Green! He was fired because of mental issues. He was deemed to 'slow' and a risk to the workplace's safety. The problem is, he worked for that company for 37 years. They got new management and they let him go. The motive's all there! We gotta stop him before its too late!""

""Sir, we just got another call. Jeff Redfield  has been found dead,"" Officer Stone informed us. ""His blood has been pumped dry and replaced with a chocolate liquid. There are two puncture marks on his neck, and a spoon laying next to him.""

""Gather some of the officers and head out to Thomas Green's house on East Boulevard. He's our killer!""

""Aye!""

---

Within 30 minutes our nightmares were over. We caught Green enjoying a bowl of Cheerios before we made the arrest. The spoon he was eating with resembled the other 7 spoons that were found. But that's not the only thing that tipped us off. His clothes were covered in, what was later discovered as Redfield's blood. And to make things worse, he was eating his cereal without milk. Instead it was filled to the brim with blood.

No, it was no accident.  I am far from the god of my fathers in Canaan; here in Greece there is no accident, only fate.  So they say.  But I was a man named Binyamin before, and now...I am not a man.  A thing, perhaps, to be tossed about and discarded by careless gods.

I hate them still, for cursing me with this hardened form.  But still, my curse is not so great as that of poor Medusa, she whom they call the Gorgon.  What right do I have to complain, that I came upon her in the throes of passion with the god Poseidon, and was turned to a living statue for my trouble? Hers is to turn all men who look her way so, and they do not move nor speak as I do.  I have gone to the priests, who have sent trusted men to the Oracle; they say that looking upon her while the curse was fresh saved me from the effects, in part.

Saved me! How I wish I had perished instead.  I wander from town to town, owning little but the half-skirt around my waist, my skin cracked and orange, the truth of my monstrosity clear for all to see.  I cannot abide the stares of good folk, who cannot be blamed for reacting only with horror.  For who could love one such as me?

Though, I may have an answer to such things.  A blind beggar-girl, beautiful beyond belief and - so sweet! - ignorant of my own form, told me a story of a trio across the see, struck by curses of their own, having found their way together across nations.  She speaks of the man Kalami, who reaches further than any arrow; the storm-borne woman, who can hide from the sight of men and gods; and her brother, whom they call the Greek Torch.  She says that they seek all like them, who have been torn down and rebuilt by the gods, twisted but mighty.

And with that, I could not help but laugh for the first time for my transformation.  Companions with whom I could enjoy my monstrosity? Perhaps the melancholy is not my fate after all! No longer, I vowed with a smile, would they call me Binyamin the Grim.  I would embrace my curse, my gift, my life as...a Thing.",AndHisHorse

While the bartender refilled his drink, he sagged in his seat and looked at his watch. He'd been here for almost an hour. Where was she?

The stool on his left squeaked suddenly. Looking up eagerly, he saw that a woman had just seated herself. Girl-next-door looks, though with about seventy percent more hotness. She brushed a dainty finger on the counter and said, ""I'll have what he's having.""

It wasn't her. Burying his disappointment, he turned back to his drink.

""Not even a hello?"" she said. Her voice was rich, smooth. Also, close but definitely not American.

""I'm waiting for someone, sweetheart.""

She cocked her head low, trying to see his face. ""Well, aren't you a sour one? Got stood up?"" Leaning closer, she whispered, ""What if I told you I'm the one you were waiting for?""

He snorted. ""She's a brunette. And you're too pretty.""

There was a musical quality to her laugh. ""One can never be too pretty. She could be late. Traffic. Or maybe she dropped her keys down a drain right after her cat bulldozed her leg when she left her house this morning?""

At this, he turned to face her. ""What do you know, miss?""

Her expression turned serious, but she raised her glass. ""The Abominable Snowman?""

He rolled his eyes and touched his glass to hers. ""El chupacabra. To your health.""

""To ours."" They drank. After draining her whiskey in one pull, she said, ""I don't have much time. You check out; physical description, vocal frequency, greeting. The chick waits in its nest as the eagle hunts.""

A heartbeat passed, and then two, before he said, ""What?""

She grew impatient. ""Listen, stop messing around. It's a quick grab and go, boys in tech need the intel before we can make our move.""

""I don't—"" Out of the corner of his eye, Craig noticed that the bartender was listening hard while pretending to wipe a glass. ""You haven't even told me your name.""

""Echo-Nine. Look—""

""What the hell kind of name is that? You don't have a sister named Doing Sixty on a Forty Freeway, do you?""

""Goddammit, would you stop stalling, Bradley-Charles? If they're on to me—""

""You got the wrong guy! If you're Clara, stop messing around. You told me you'd—""

""Who the blazes is Clara?""

Beads of sweat were dripping down his forehead. ""She's, uh ... dating site? Wait, forget about Clara, who are you?""

One of her hands dropped to her waist, but Craig eyed the seemingly casual motion. A weapon? ""Be very careful how you answer the next question,"" she said. ""Have you ever had sex with a three-legged llama on a sailboat in the South China Sea?""

""W—what? No, but I've had a champagne bath on a cruise ship off the coast of Madagascar.""

Her creeping hand was suddenly back on the table, and she gave an audible sigh. ""For one moment, I thought—""

Craig tried his best not to appear nervous. ""If you want something from me, shouldn't you offer payment first?""

She seemed to consider it for a moment before nodding. ""Fine."" She reached into her purse and pulled out a brown envelope.

""Open it,"" he said. Shooting the bartender a dirty look, he said, ""Discretely.""

Without hesitating, she complied, showing him a thick wad of bills inside. He nodded, hopped off his seat and slapped a pair of handcuffs over her wrists. Her jaw dropped as he said, ""You're under arrest for attempting to bribe a police officer. You have the right to remain silent and refuse to answer any questions. Anything—seriously, Egg Cold or whatever your name is, you were jeopardizing my operation here.""

The bartender ducked under the counter and emerged with a shotgun, but before he had even brought it up halfway, Craig drew a pistol and fired. The shot took him in the shoulder and sent him crashing against a rack of expensive-looking wines.

As glass shattered on the floor, Craig said, ""Well, I guess I still got the dealer my CI was going to point out to me. And now I've got you too, weirdo. Anything you say may be used ...""",Bilgebum

""Hey there, you're looking good tonight.  Can I buy you a drink?"" She placed a hand on his shoulder.  To any untrained observer, it would just look like some harmless flirting.  

The man's eyes widened.  Jeez, you'd think the higher-ups would have at least told him what kind of person to expect.  Or maybe...could it be that she had gotten the wrong person?  Her eyes darted around the bar.  It didn't look like anybody else was wearing a green tie.

So.  McAdams usually hung out at the Green Turtle, but he was at the Red Dog tonight.  She wondered what business he was here on. 

""Yeah, if you hadn't come here, you wouldn't have met me.""  She winked, biting her lower lip.  ""So, what're you up to tonight?""

""Hmm, it depends.  Do you have any suggestions?"" he winked back at her.

Now was *not* the time for him to play coy with his information.  There could be informants all around them!  She gritted her teeth.  ""Not really, I was mostly wondering if you had anything in mind.""

""Hmm.  My apartment isn't too far from here - maybe you'd like to come home with me tonight?""

She furrowed her brow in confusion.  McAdams had a hideout near here?  Were they going to do a sting?  She wondered why none of this information had been included in the briefing.  Maybe it was new information.  Maybe the higher-ups hadn't even known about this.

What was that supposed to mean?  McAdams had backup, but they weren't going to support him?  His code was getting harder and harder to understand.  She had to get him alone, so she could talk to him without any misunderstandings.  

She placed a hand on his arm and tapped her forefinger twice.  ""Sorry, it's really loud in this bar.  Let's go find somewhere quieter where we can talk?"" 

He grinned.  ""Sounds good to me!""

"[WP] A normal guy thinks a girl is flirting with him, when in fact, she is a spy who mistakenly thinks she's meeting with a contact. Misunderstandings ensue.",GreyWolf035,"Mother always told me I was a pretty boy. She would stroke my locks of gold, gently caressing their fair fiber as her voice cooed softly, 'You are my little prince. My beautiful, exquisite little champion.' And I would smile, knowing that I was a most special person.

Since then, the world had not been nice. It was full of ugly and evil people who did not like seeing such a lovely one, as I was. They were bitter and mean. Mother had told me this might happen, and that one days the jealous ones would get their fill. She told me I had to be patient. I had to be a good, strong prince. They would learn their lesson, she said.

Until today, I had begun my doubt my mother's words. *Silly, silly boy* I screamed at myself. *You know she was always right*. I had no time to dance in my dark place, though. She was coming, and justice was coming with her.

The dress was too red. I do not like red. It reminds me of when my dad took his last bath. A very messy color, it was. I could not argue with my angel, though, and masked my disquiet with a wide grin. She caught my eye and wandered over. A bit slowly, it seemed. Almost as if she were unsure of something. Girls were usually nervous around me. *Ladies are always intimidated by princes*, mother had told me.

She sits next to me and shivers. Is the bench cold? She looks scared. I wear my most disarming smile, trying to put her at ease. She leans back, cocks her head and says something. I'm not much of a word person. Never was. I keep smiling at her, waiting for something magical to happen. *Just like in your fairy tales*, I can hear my mother say.

Here it comes. Her hand, slipping gently into her overcoat. A manila folder emerging. Will this be my most blessed day of good fortune, at long last? I know it will. *Good tidings to he who waits!* I feel that mother is sitting beside me right now, making sure her special son has right done by him.

I take the folder with trembling hands. My palms are a wash of sweat and grime. This can not be helped; the people who guard the soup and showers are wretched old things who always ask questions and try to give me pills. I hope mother does not notice. She would scold me and tell me that princes must be clean and proper at all times.

I collapse. A ruse! A gag! What cruel joke do they play on us? There are only pictures. Men and machines and little drawings of other gadgets. The woman is staring at me and lots of words are coming out. Her face is full of anger as she rips the pictures from my hand. I know her. She was sent here to trick me, to distract me from my redemption. *I will not let them get us, mother*, I yell.

And even though I do not like red, I make exception here.",MavisMudslide

He sipped on a healthy glass of rum and ginger ale, with a dash of lime for flavour. With the glass to his lips, he peeked at her once again, and this time, she stood, trudging over. 

""You know the code."" Her maroon lips curled into a smile. 

Rob tugged at his collar, the thing was feeling tight for some reason. ""I'm known to know a few codes.""

""Oh really? Well, let's get this out of the way then. What did the lemon say to the lime?""

He swirled his glass, mulling it over. ""Lime's don't talk, silly.""

Rob flexed a bicep. ""Guns? This bad boy is a bazooka.""

Katrina giggled. Rob winked at her. 

""The customer is upstairs, and I have the package.""

He skulled back his remaining drink. ""Well then, love. Let's go upstairs and get to unpacking.""

"[Wp] in an alternate timeline Native Americans successfully repel all colonization. What is the current America like, how did it change?",Greyfox2000,"""Tell me the story grandfather. How did our country get its name?"" 

The elder chewed on his pipe a while,  considering the request. Eventually he nodded twice and placed the pipe down on to a small wooden table.

""Do you know what *your* name means, Degotoga?"" asked the old man.

""Yes grandfather, it means 'together'"" the boy replied.

""Almost. It is a Cherokee word. Have you heard of the Cherokee's? Well, quite literally it means 'standing together'. You are named after a man who saved us from the death the white man brought to our land.""

The elder removed a pot that was hanging over a small log fire and filled up two mugs with boiling water. He added a mixture of leaves and herbs and stirred it with a small stick. He handed one mug over to Degotoga.

""For thousands of years the natives of this country had lived peaceful and prosperous lives. We were splintered into tribes,  such as the Apache's, Cherokee's, Sioux's and many others.  Each tribe tended to have slightly different views and beliefs, but in general they were similar. They all understood the importance of nature and the respect the gods deserved.

For thousands of years they lived in relative peace with each other and with the world around them. 

Then the white man arrived and... it all changed.

It is said we offered them friendship and help. After all, there was enough room for all of us. But they betrayed us. We had been naive, we let them in and we paid for our mistake.""

The old man paused for a moment whilst he wiped a a tear off his cheek. He sipped at his drink and coninued.

""For a hundred years the nevajo - nevajo is what natives to this land are called - tribes fought the white man but gradually, we were losing. Tribes were being massacred, even the women and children. Many tribes that had been for thousands of years now no longer existed, every person dead. 

The white man had a magic they called gunpowder - it allowed small pellets of metal death to fly with a force and accuracy our arrows could not. We know now it was not really a magic, but to your ancestors there was no other explanation.

The white man brought disease with them too. Many nevajo died from unimaginable pains that had not been seen before the white man arrived. They were a plague in every sense. To us and to nature.

In 1788 the situation was desperate, we were going to lose and all tribes would be slaughtered one by one. Each tribe was too weak to stand up to the white man alone.

That is when a boy,  not much older than you are today, united the tribes.

His name too, was Degotoga. ""

The old man finished his tea and placed his mug down.

""...but I grow tired. His story must wait until tomorrow. But know this, we were not the The United Tribes of Nevajo until his story is complete. ""

The boy bowed his head slightly.

""Then I will be back tomorrow, grandfather."" he said whilst leaving the tipi.

An Aztec soldier charged me with his rifle, bayonet aimed towards my heart, and screaming ""Long Live the Emperor!"" in Nahuatl. Wind Dragon jumped in the way and parried the rifle barrel, then shot the man in the head with his revolver. 

""Fucking Yat Gwai!"" he said before spitting on the enemy soldier. ""You okay, Han Hing?"" Wind Dragon loves his racist epithets, whether to insult his enemies or jokingly address his fellow soldiers. Lu Wind Dragon has lost two homes to the fascists. The home of his ancestors lost to one Empire of the Sun far to the West. His second home, lost in a two pronged invasion from the Blackfeet in the North and Aztecs in the South. The poor boy now have a particular hatred for sun worshiping fascists. 

The Aztec officer was the last one standing, brandishing his ugly serrated sword. I wondered how many POW's he had beheaded with that double edged blade. Vengeful Bear cursed at him back in Cherokee. She drew her tomahawk and charged. The duel did not last very long. The fascist officer may have had the reach but Vengeful Bear was faster. Once she got past that blade, she split open his skull. Even after he went down, she  mutilated his face by repeatedly slamming her tomahawk into his skull. The other soldiers left her to her moment of catharsis. Vengeful Bear is a survivor of the Oklahoma Massacre. She had watched her mother and sisters raped then had their hearts torn out, while hiding in a closet. 

""Tomorrow, we retake Oklahoma!"" I announced to the troops. Cheers went up. ""The fascist are flagging, throwing troops to their death by the dozens. Rest up now while you still can once we get artillery setup, it'll go on through the night.""

That night, in the command tent, the radio announcement came. After it ended, the camp was silent except for the mortars firing in the background and the crackling of anti-aircraft fire. Boos and screams of disgust flooded the camp. In short, the announcement was a ceasefire.

April 28, 2016; Oklahoma 

The cane was heavy to lift even though it was the one supporting my weight. My grandchildren lead me to my seat in the council chamber. I sat next to Vengeful Bear, her uniform looked rather large on her wrinkled, shrunken body.

""Looking good, Cherokee hag,"" I jokingly said to her.

She pointed rudely towards my belly. ""That uniform is looking tight around the waist, you Lakota bastard."" She then slowly got up for a hug. 

""If only Wind Dragon were here to see this.""

""Everyone getting their countries back from the Fascists?"" Vengeful Bear's grandchildren shifted uncomfortably in their seats.

""Mexica.""

""Aztec Fascists, I care little for these kids and their politically correct terms.""

""We're about to sit through an entire speech of only politically correct terms.""

""I'm feeling too old already."" We chuckled lightly to ourselves.",lekylee
"[Wp] in an alternate timeline Native Americans successfully repel all colonization. What is the current America like, how did it change?",Greyfox2000,"Old man Tutna glanced up at the sky and muttered quietly. ""Gonna rain tonight"" and after looking towards the surrounding Hills one more time, he slowly turned and walked back into his Tepee.  
He was greeted by his grandson.  
""Granpapa look, I almost finished my knife!"" he exclaimed proudly, he was holding up a beautifully made blade with a crudely carved handle.  
""That is excellent work Sitting-gun"" Tutna said with a broad smile.  
The smile showed clearly the love that he possessed for this young buck.  
""Granpapa, will my parents come?"" Sitting-gun asked quietly not looking up to meet the old man's eyes.  
Tutna sighed deeply inside, how long had been now..six moons? No it must be nine at least by now.   His son (the boys father) and his wife had made the trip east to represent their tribe at the Grand council, they were trying to decide what to do with the white man.  
They should have come been back by now. He was old and tired, he was ready to go live with the great sky spirit, but he was holding on for the boys sake...but how long he could endure he didn't know.  
Instead of answering boy's question he asked. ""Have I told you the tale of the great war with the white man?""
Sitting-gun remained quiet for a few minutes, but his whittling slowed and finally without looking up he answered politely.  
""No Granpapa"".  
Tutna looked towards the Tepee flap as though it wasn't there and he was seeing far away...into the distant past perhaps.  
""The white man's coming was a curse...and a blessing, though we didn't know it till near the end of the war""
""A blessing?"" Asked Sitting-gun quizzically. ""But they killed many of our people, they hunted our buffalo and drove them off...they destroyed our way of life; I say they were only a curse and should all be put to death as they deserve"".  
The old man's eyes grew sad. ""Ah my dear lad, unfortunately you are not the only one who says that, but we humans must always be wary of talk like that...never condemn others so hastily, for they too are children of the great spirit"".  
He paused and he watched the boys face, but he saw he had not convinced him, so he continued.  
""When you hunt and you make a kill; what do you do?"". 
""I thank the animals spirit for giving it's body to feed me, and I pray it's spirit finds the sky lands""
""Yes and that is right, and would you kill the animal if you did not need it for food?"". 
""No never!, that is cruel and disrespectful"". 
""Quite right, but why so?"". 
""Because it is a creature belonging to the great sky spirit, which he allows us to use for food, if we kill it and not having need for food...then we have dishonored the spirit and he may punish me""
""And do you think people are not creatures belonging to the spirit?"". 
""Of course"". 
""Then why would you kill the people?"". 
""Because it is war"". 
""During war yes, but if we were not at war?"". 
""Then it is dishonor to kill a man for no cause"". 
""Why so?"". 
""Because he is a child of the great sky spirit, and we have disrespected his creature"". 
 ""Yes, but we are no longer at war...we have defeated the white man, they only wait for our new Grand council to decide what their fate will be, we are not at war...would it not be a great dishonor to kill them thus having them captured and disarmed?"". 
The boy didn't say anything, he just stared at the knife in his hands.  
The old man continued.  
""Earlier you wondered that I said th white man's coming had also been a blessing to us...do you know why?"". 
The boy shook his head.  
""You know that many ages ago our many tribes were but one tribe, and we had great cities and much magic...of the sort the white man has?"". 
He had the boys full attention.   
""Somewhere along the way disputes and wars broke out between us, which destroyed many of our fair cities and killed very many of our peoples, afterwards being left with small groups divided by their different views, they all separated and moved far from each other to live in tribes...this is how the white man found us"".  
The boy sat wide eyed, hands on his lap and leaning in towards his grandfather eager to hear more.
""The white man taught us many things that we had forgotten in those old days, and the war we fought with him has united us once again, and this time we shall not forget...and that my boy is why they have also been a blessing"".  
He looked fondly at the boy.  
""Now take your rest, tomorrow will be a busy day for you"".  
Somewhere in the night the old man kissed the young buck's cheek then layed down and he closed his eyes for the last time, and in his dying ears he heard the soft foot falls of two horses coming nearer.",The_Mizzer

**August 31st, 2016**. 50th Anniversary of the ***Struggle's End.***

***Squamish, Pacific Region Capital, First Nations Federation.***

""Wipe the crust from your eyes."" She rarely spoke anymore. But on this day, our Federation's day, she made sure we were all attentive.

""I know it's early, young one... but when you grow older you will come to understand the importance of this morning."" She stared at me as I cleared my waking eyes.

""Yes Grandmother. My apologies..."" My eyes wavered from hers, and focused on the feathers in her thick grey hair, given to her as awards for her time during the struggle. 

One feather from a starling, it was shiny and green at the top with a black base. I had learned from my father that this was an award for taking part in the bloody Huron Guerilla Campaign, in the Great Lakes Region.

Another feather, behind her right ear, from a Loon. It was deep black in colour, spotted with white dots that looked like stars, this one was my favorite. I never brought it up though, father had warned me not to. He told me it came from Grandmother's time patrolling rivers used as supply routes by the French and Spanish. 

Grandmother, who had always been a strong swimmer, was embedded with a unit responsible for attaching explosives to the underside of European ships, both supply boats and settler's family transports alike. Many Europeans were sent to the great blue sky by Grandmother's actions on these rivers.

Lastly, the tail feather of a wood-pecker, with alternating black and white lines, rested in her pony-tail. Like the constant and unending pecking of the woodpecker to the tree, this was a prestigious feather, given only to the warriors present throughout the entire struggle, whose unhindered rebellion brought us our sovereignty. 

Twenty long years of Grandmother's life were engaged in warfare with the Europeans. 

After the struggle's end, Grandmother was given a seat at the Elder's Council for the Pacific Region, a high honor.

She even toured the world as a member of the Federation's international delegation, and as an embodiment of the First Nations gender equal military.

During her time as a delegate for the Federation she met with Viet-Cong veterans in Hanoi in the 70's, Palestinian freedom fighters in Jerusalem in the 80's, and South African protesters in Johannesburg in the 90's.

Grandmother was famous the world round, and held in high regard by many. But it was in the early 2000s when historical perspective in our Federation began to change.

It could be said the first sign of the shift in national understanding occurred in 2003, when, at that time, the King of France, Louis Montcalm, visited Chicago, the first European monarch to do so since the struggle's end. 

He, as then the most powerful monarch in the Union of European States, ended a 40 year trade embargo placed on our Federation. 

After this, our relations began to rapidly warm with Europe. Their television, music, and products which were further advanced and of a higher quality than our own gradually became our own. 

The younger generations, my peers, began to attend cinema's instead of pow-wows, we listened to Dutch electronic music rather than the the songs of our ancestors, we read Locke instead of Dancing Bear, and we played football instead of lacrosse. Just like that, in the space of a decade, our culture became swept aside as we adopted the Europeans ways.

It was around this time, that my Grandmother began to lose her voice, not physically, but emotionally and mentally. 

She shunned us; for wearing converse instead of our hand-made moccasins. She belittled us; for not knowing our oral tribal history. She mocked us; for listening to our computer generated music.

At the time, I didn't understand why.

But this morning, on this early August morning, I began to see.

At the end of our gravel driveway, on the main city street, the procession of able-bodied veterans made their way west to the beach-front. 

Every year, veterans of the struggle would take the ashes of their comrades who had past the year previous, and paddle their kayaks out into the bay. They would give the ashes back to mother nature, and then come back to shore. 

Barbecues would be had, smoked salmon would be eaten, and drums would be beaten. 

But I had always been too young to appreciate the moment, or too occupied with my ipad to understand the emotions surrounding me hidden ever so slightly but still present and observable in the stoic veterans whose feathered heads bowed in remembrance.

""Grandmother... Thank you."" I muttered.

She stared at me, bent down, and took the woodpecker's feather out of her pony-tail. She put it in mine. ""The struggle is never over, young one.""

""To continue my p-p-point, sire, those people were so much more tame than the Martians and the Trump-p-pets. Surely they deserved some sort of chance at repentance?""
Returning his gaze out to the remnants of Cindor, Holon coldly stated, ""No, they were just as vile as the rest. They may not have been as war mongering as those misguided races, but their actions towards each other were much much worse. Their young were nothing more than slave to their desires, they controlled each other with intimidation, they lied, they cheated, they stole, and when they lusted, they acted on those urges without remorse. No, they did not deserve any sort of mercy, as they had never shown mercy to one another. I showed them that they were nothing, that they never controlled anything in their feeble and worthless lives. With a single stroke, I destroyed their lives and everything they loved.""

""But sire, you've slaughtered endless lives and shown no remorse for it, wouldn't that make you worthy of death?"" Siro stated, as confidently as he'd ever spoken.

Rage now building inside of him, Holon simply stated,

A drop of water fell from the cracked ceiling into the puddle below.

I have lost count of the number of days I have been trapped in this dark and humid cell. 

The cell is bare with the exception of a flea-infested bed, and a hole where minimal food and water comes in.

And the window. 

The tinted window which pours light into this despairing room of darkness at a certain time of day, and the only thing that is keeping me going.

I close my eyes and recall the sunshine on the green fields, childrens' laughter, and the horizon that seems to stretch forever.

I open my eyes, and look at the unmoving window. The light is pouring from the window, casting a shadow on the lock-less handle below it.

The chains at my feet jingled as I wiggled it. The length of the chain only allows me to stand in front of the window, but keeps me just out of reach of the window.

I stood up gingerly, careful to not place pressure on the ankle which I injured several days ago. Stretching as far as I could to open it was a bad idea.

Standing a distance from the window, with a length of chain in my hand, my heart started to race. This could be it. 

I tossed the chain a little in my hand, feeling the weight, and gauging the distance to the handle. 

*clang*

I cursed under my breath as the chain hit the handle, failing to wrap around the handle. I leaned against the damp wall, easing the weight off the one foot that I am standing on.

Standing straight, I hopped into position, and took aim again. 

*clack*

The chain went over the handle and was caught under it. My hands shook as I could barely believe my eyes. 

Finally.

I hurriedly pulled the chain, and pulling the handle on the window, successfully opening it. More light shined into the room than ever, and I could hear faint voices coming from the window.

Letting go of chain, I hobbled to the window, waiting to see it all.

The trees. Blue sky. Fields. People. Anything. Anything but this godforsaken space.

I tipped my toes, looking over the sill and saw ...

A wall. Another stone wall, illuminated by the lamps on the outer corners of the sill.

""No, no no no. It can't be."" I rasped under my breath, despair filling me as I collapsed under the pool of light, distinct faraway laughter coming from the space between the window and the stone wall.

Laughter that chides me for believing that I could ever see the light of day again.

Some windows were never meant to be opened.

[CW] Write at least 500 words about someone getting up to open the window.,Lexilogical,"I am wrapped like a pickle inside my snuggie. It was hours since I sank into my lazy chair, according to the clock ticking away the seconds. Then I fell asleep again, wanting to repeat the dream about  the vending machine and get my shirt back. Although there was little point in recovering a shirt from a dream, there was a need to recover my dignity.

Satisfied with the lucid dream, I open my eyes to the propane heater blasting heat at my feet. Outside is ten degrees below zero, yet here I wrapped up like a human sized burrito. Yet there was a hassle about leaving the warmth of the chair and into the cooler air, even if it was half a degree. And so I lay there, listening to the hiss heat, and the dull red glow from the rectangular bricks. Beside me, a window that was opened a crack, safety reasons. Unseen, odorless gasses can claim a life in a blink, and I would not realize my intelligence slipping into a stupor.

But I am careful, I always am. Once my legs gone stiff, it was time to move them. I paced around the room, swinging my arms as I did so. Then it was to the kitchen and check the chili.

Propane, the most useful substance in the world. Although nowadays, likely mixed with some butane too.

I take a whiff of the beans, taking a nibble on one of the kidney beans, done enough for me to start making the cornbread. I twist the oven knob to 350f and yank out two boxes of jiffy. My meals are made simple. Who cares about muffin pans when you got deep pans? Using a knife to cut your square was more worth while to me.

Despite the outside being below zero, the heat inside built up to unpleasant levels. I swiped the sweat from my cheek and neck and shuffle over to the window. Not the small one which was cracked and inch. That one was as wide as it can go, rather the bigger one across from it.

I tried to lift it up, nothing happened. Pulled and pushed, again nothing. My fingers grope around the hardwood frame, no window locks to give me a clue. Gave a press to the top and the bottom but it did not tilt like a bus window either. Two steps back and I stare at the four panels that mocked me with their inability to open.

How strange, I have opened it plenty of times before. Why can't I recall? Once my head spun I understood. Too much propane, or actually, too much carbon monoxide inside. So if I cannot remember how to open a bloody window. The door will have to do.

I twist the knob and welcome the blizzard into my home. Fridged air and clumbs of snow robbed my breath, then gasp after gasp it all comes back to me. The window opened from the side, of course.",WatashiwaOyu
[CW] Write at least 500 words about someone getting up to open the window.,Lexilogical,"I make sure I've got my phone and wallet on me, just so I can get back into my room if need be. I'm dressed in clothes that are far warmer than my usual attire for this time of year back home, where it's not consistently 75º and sunny. 

Of course, it is nearly midnight, so I suppose that doesn't really matter too much in the grand scheme of things.

There are eight of us, gathered together in the suite lobby. Eight men, I suppose it's safe to call us. Nine months ago, we were all almost complete strangers to one another. Now, we're pretty close, good friends, even. Living with people tends to help foster connections like that, I've learned. 

What we're about to do is not exactly condoned by the rules, but we don't really care. It's not as if the campus police can see us from the road, and it's tradition, anyhow. Even if we were to get caught, the RAs wouldn't really care. They were E Suite, too. 

You're all a little nervous, though. That can't be ignored, and it's visible, the way Aidan is fidgeting ever so slightly, even though you're not so sure he's not always a little jumpy like that. The way Brady is ever the cautioner, making sure that we know that there will be a walkthrough at 1 AM and we need to be careful. The way Logan is prodding the couches, as if they'll suddenly come to life and devour us whole if we step on them the wrong way.

Of course, on the other hand, you've got Russell. With him as my roommate, life was certainly never boring, and that's oh so apparent when you watch him clamber over couches and dance around, dousing the room in nervous energy, though his enthusiasm is infectious, it must be noted. Troy, too, is already trying to figure out if there's an order we need to do this in, and I can tell he's already chomping at the bit. 

Jack and Chase are nowhere to be found, unfortunately. They've always done their own thing, but it's your last week in the building, so you all had hoped that they could find the time to turn up for this. 

I'm somewhere in the middle, trying to appear reserved, but deep down, I'm pumped for this. This is how you leave your mark on the building, according to every person I've talked to, so I guess it's pretty important that I follow through. 

We're trying to prop the couches in such a manner that nothing will fall, but that's proving to be a little more difficult that anticipated. It seems to be stable, but we don't want to risk the couches toppling and not only leaving us rather stranded, but also alerting the entire world to what we were trying to do. 

Of course, Aidan remarks on the phallic shape of the couch and it's props, and suddenly it's like we're in elementary school again, with most of us having dissolved into laughter that extends far beyond it's rightful place, but we don't mind. After all, this is our way of saying goodbye to a home, and between that and the stress of finals, laughter is a commodity in short supply.

Finally, though, we're all ready to go. Of course, I weigh the least, so they decide that I should go first, just to make sure that the contraption we've built can hold our weights at all. 

I slowly climb, foot over foot and hand over hand, until I'm perched at the top of the couch like a hawk at the top of a tree, surveying my domain of the lobby of J. Pengilly E Suite. With seven pairs of expectant eyes watching me, and the fact that the clock is ever ticking, I've got to move rather quickly, so my stint as king of the world is rather short. 

I turn around, my fingers immediately fumbling with the handle, and I slide the window open, before sliding through the small gap we've created, and I find myself on the roof, with nothing but the stars above and the world below. Soon, I'm joined by the rest of the guys, and while we explore for a couple minutes in awe, we do eventually settle down, content to stargaze with the ocean providing its soothing soundtrack.

I learned something during my time as a member of this suite and a member of the greater student body at this university, and that is that it is alright to open your personal windows. It's definitely a risk, a gamble you must be willing to take, but it's a worthy gamble.

And, as Russell nudges me accidentally, his shoulders shaking with laughter at a joke Brady told, as Troy tells us to try to find constellations and Logan and Aidan are busy talking about god knows what, I find myself ever so glad I opened the window to these wonderful people. 

*This is my first ever attempt at a prompt, so I'm hoping it's not too terrible - it just grabbed me because of an experience I had over the weekend. Also, it's finals week, so I could just be a little delirious, and because of that you've got my apologies if this is just utter trash.*",DEP61

Marlow put a foot on the ground and stopped to rest. 600lbs she whispered. THHHHHUNNNNNKKKKK hhhhhhwwwww hhhhhhwwwww hhhhhhwwwww. Another foot on the ground, another whisper. Where the fuck is the nurse?!?!, her thoughts and calves screamed. How does anyone expect a 600llb woman to open a window by herself? What am I paying that lazy bitch for? THHHHHUUNNNNNKKK. Hhhhwwww, hhhhhhhhhhwwwwwww, hhhhhhhhwwwwww. 
“I’m one step closer to a heart attack, you ungrateful twat!” Marlow screamed, out loud this time. In her prime she was a formidable woman. CEO of a small electronics company that she ruled quite like a dictator. Her favorite memory played often in her head these days. One of her employees, a stupid young girl, had called out of work twice because her newborn was sick. The dumb bitch’s sniffles punctuated Marlow’s lecture perfectly, which ended with absolutely the most favorite things she’d ever said, “FAMILES DON’T MAKE MONEY!” Ahhh, if she had had a family she was sure she’d hate them. THHHHUUUUNK THHHHHHUUUUUNNNNNKKKKK. Hhhhhhhhhhhhhwwwwwwwwwww hhhhhhhhhwwwwwwwwwwww hhhhhhhhhhhhwwwwwwwwww Two more steps. Marlow wasn’t always fat, but life was unfair to her. Most woman can eat whatever they wanted and never gain weight. Marlow thought all of those women were probably airheaded cunts, anyway. Who cares about them. THHHHHHUUUUUUNNK THHHHHUUUUNNNKKKK hhhhhwwwwww, hhhhhhhhhhwwwwwww, hhhhhhhwwwww. She once saw a therapist about her eating habits, and he, of course, gave her some nonsensical psychobabble about filling emotional voids and self-hatred. Ha. Marlow did not hate herself. In fact, she felt she deserved every bit of space she took up, and then some. THHHHUUUUUUUUNNK THHHHHUUUUNNNNKKKKKK hhhhhhhwwwwwww, hhhhhhhhwwwwww, hhhhhhwwww. Why did she buy such a goddamn giant house? Sure, she wanted others to be jealous of her life and money, but couldn’t she have just done that with cars? Or maybe a nice trophy husband? Marlow never cared much for the company of men, but she loved sex. She loved using a body, and then sending them out the door. Of course, Marlow was too important to love anyone but herself. After she started gaining weight the men hit on her less frequently, so she started enticing them with money and things. Money is the perfect solution to every problem. Except of course, weight. Her dipshit doctor had put her on a healthy eating plan, which she followed because, as perfect as she was, she wasn’t immortal. 
“Miss, you shouldn’t be walking without your physical therapist!” Marlow’s nurse entered just as she was about to take another step.
“Don’t you think I know that, dummy.” Marlow hissed, “You were off probably sucking the gardener’s dick and left me here!”
“Ma’am I’m sorry, I was at the grocery store!”
“You just went to the grocery store four days ago… don’t fucking lie to me.”
“I’m not lying, I have to buy fresh produce for you two times a week. Nothing premade or high in fat or carbs. The doctor’s orders, remember?”
“Whatever, the doctor is a fucktard and I haven’t even lost any weight, and you can just open the fucking window and get the fuck out. I’m hungry.”
The nurse helped Marlow into a wheel chair, and slowly wheeled her back her bed. After struggling to get Marlow into a comfortable position, she walked towards the kitchen to start preparing a meal. How could anyone be so mean? The nurse leaned down into her grocery bags to grab a bag of fresh spinach, and a can of Crisco? As she scooped the fat into a waiting pan she just thought, “Whose fucking dumb now, bitch,”

John Smith is a doctor. He is the doctor on call. It is 4 am and he is sleeping in the on call room because he is tired. His coat is white. He lies on a couch with hard wooden arms. He is curled up because he doesn't quite fit on the couch and the hard wooden arms hurt his ankles if he spreads his legs out. He has no blanket. The room is cold to discourage people from sleeping there. Everything is quiet. Johns pager buzzes and wakes him up. Only slightly groggy he checks his pager. Maggy MacDonald is giving birth. John yawns and stretches his arms above his head and his sleeves pull up past his wrist. John has long arms and does not wear a watch.


Maggy, the nurses, Maggys husband, and John had know the time was approaching. John walks with long strides towards Maggys room. He has long legs and his footsteps make him sound authoritative in the quiet halls. John walks into Maggys room, and says to her:

“Just about time now. Don’t worry, everything looks good.” 

Maggy smiles a grimace and says 

“I know”. 

John checks that  all of the equipment they may need is available, it is. John does not think the equipment will be needed. John checks with the nurses and confirms that the rest of the hospital is still as quiet as it appears. John smiles because delivering babies is exciting and Maggy knows what she is doing, and the baby appears to be healthy so far. 


Maggy is about to give birth and John is ready. Maggy’s husband is by her side oozeing encouragement. Maggy is oblivious to her husband. Maggy pushes hard and the baby is born. The baby is small and yellow and crying. Maggy is relaxing as John cradles the baby and cuts the cord. The baby wails as the nurses take it to be weighed and cleaned. John checks that Maggy is ok and there are no complications from the baby. The baby wails. John stands up and helps clean the mess. 

Maggy asks John “How am I?” 


“Just fine, I didn’t see anything to worry about”

The nurses bring the baby back into the room. The baby is completely swaddled in a blanket. The baby is still crying. Maggy’s husband stands back as the nurse brings the infant to Maggy. Maggy takes the baby. Maggy and her husband crowd in around the tiny screaming baby. John asks the nurse for the baby's length and weight. Maggy loosens her robe and nudges a nipple into the baby's mouth. The baby’s eyes open and its parents stare into its eyes. Eyes are windows into the soul. The baby’s eyes close and it suckles. Maggy lies back and closes her eyes. Maggy’s husband hovers and coo’s over the baby. John smiles and heads back out to the break room. Maggy falls asleep.

She held her breath in begrudging expectation that he would wake, and let out a silent sigh of relief when his movement ceased and his labored breath resumed. 

She gazed up at the dimly lit ceiling, watching a moving orb of light dance across it and shimmer down the wall as a car passing by outside reflected the rising sun through the curtain's cracks. The red glow of the old alarm clock to her left showed it was 8:15am, and she pondered if it would rain again today. She closed her eyes and concentrated on keeping her breathing slow and even, trying to quiet her thoughts in hopes of catching just a few precious moments of sleep. Deep breath in, slow breath out, depleting her lungs until they burned, demanding she breathe in again. It was only a few moments before she became acutely aware of the stale, sweat tainted air that she was inviting inside her. Her breaths became shorter and her freckle dusted nose cringed with the unwelcome memories that accompanied the scent. 

Her eyes flickered back open as another passing car directed a ray of light across her scowled face. Very slowly, she moved her legs one at a time outside of the stiff, starch pressed sheets, pausing after each one to listen for any signs of stirring. A loud snore calmer her, and she felt brave enough to slide off the bed, reaching over to the opposing chair where her shirt was draped carelessly. As she quietly slipped the shirt over her head, she noticed the short, scratchy carpet beneath her feet. 

Softly treading the few steps to the room's end, she glanced back again warily. She could see the back of his head, his shoulder length dark brown hair creating a tousled mess on the stark white pillow his face was pressed into. His arm was draped in front of him, and her gaze lingered on his hands, now so lifeless and seemingly gentle. 

She looked away abruptly and turned towards the window in front of her, reaching her hand toward the crack between the curtains, sliding in between to press against the cool, dewy glass. After a few moments, she pressed that hand against her cheek, slowly moving it to the back of her neck and sighing softly at the cool reprieve. 

For a second time she reached between the faded blue curtains, her fingers finding the latch locking it in place. Gently she released it, once again peering over her shoulder to confirm she could continue. She held her breath once more as she slowly pressed the window open, just a few small centimeters at a time, enough to feel the crisp air begin to sneak in. 

She gasped as the window pane gave, letting out a noisy screech as it barreled open another five inches or so. 

“Whas goin' on over there?” a gruff voice mumbled from the bed. Her hands dropped to her sides in defeat. 

“I'm sorry, just needed some air,” she spoke in a tone too sweet. 

“Well come back over here.” 

She lingered for a moment, attempting to savor the morning air that was filling the room. 

“And shut that window.” 

She reached back through the curtain, all gentleness lost from her touch, and quickly slid the window shut with a thud. She pulled the curtain shut so no light could dance its way inside, pulled off the shirt she had just adorned, and resigned herself back to the rough white sheets, those just lifeless hands rough against her skin as he pulled her close. 

The clock glowed 8:26am. Just eleven hours and thirty six minutes to go...",emslee
[CW] Write at least 500 words about someone getting up to open the window.,Lexilogical,"My eyes open slowly, as though they were resisting the action. The blaring of the alarm at my side is a dull whisper compared to the ache in my head. My hand lazily rises, reaching for the alarm clock without me ever looking at it. First I miss, knocking over a small stack of papers on my nightstand, but then I hit the snooze button.

I turn my head to look at the time. Seven in the morning. It's a Monday. I'll get up, dress myself inadequately, and forget to eat breakfast. Then, I'll head to my car, where I'll fumble with the ignition for an embarrassingly long amount of time. I will drive five miles per hour beneath the speed limit, because of the four separate occasions I received a ticket going at the speed limit, and I'll get to work ten minutes late. I'll spend the day doing menial, repetitive work, to the point where the minutes blend into the hours blend into the days, and the next thing I know, I will be fumbling with the ignition to drive home. I will get caught in traffic, and I will nearly fall asleep at the wheel because of boredom. I'll get home, overcook something for dinner, finish half of it and throw the rest away, and then fall asleep.

Four agonizing years, it's been like this.

With a sigh, I lean forward, ignoring the creaking of my back and my bed. I look to my left, to look out the window, only to find it closed. With a grunt, I turn, grasping the headboard of the bed to help me rise. I walk slowly to the window, and I attempt to pull the cord to open it. Of course, I pull the wrong cord first. Rolling my eyes, I pull the other one.

In an instant, the room is flooded with light. The dark green of the trees outside is a stark, but pleasant contrast to the light of the sun. On a whim, I lean down a bit, pulling the cords to lift the blinds up, and then lift the window itself, opening my room to the elements. I am assaulted by the sounds of the birds singing their good mornings, and the smell of the morning dew dripping off of the blades of grass. The frown on my face loosens and vanishes, and my eyes close to take in the warmth of the sun and the sounds and the smells of the world.

I open my eyes once more when I feel hands drape around my shoulders. ""Something wrong?"" A pleasant voice, full of care and warmth, asks me.

A smile begins to grace my face. ""Not anymore, love."" I turn towards her, putting my arm around her waist and pulling her in close.

Life has its monotonous moments, and mistakes are made, bad habits are formed. There will always be something more to it, though. A wonder and awe found in the small things. The warmth of the sun, the morning dew, the birds of morning. Those blinds made my life full of darkness... But there was always light there.

[CW] Write at least 500 words about someone getting up to open the window.,Lexilogical,"Hurt. Every movement hurt, even opening my eyes, although I was not exactly sleeping. I felt sore, rightfully so, my muscles aching from everything that’s ever happened to me. My body was a vessel of memories, and it could only take so much. I took in so much more than I should have. But leaving was too hard.

Still resonating in my ears were the gunshots. In my nostrils burned the smell of dirt, the smoke, the dead.
Yet I was not there, and I was there. My brain was rewired and would never go back to then. I needed air, my lungs burned still. Moving my eyes was a pain.

I got slowly up, shaking arms and damaged hands gripping the soft blanket beneath me. I searched for the switch of my night-light, pawing at the night stand.   Where was puppy? The light flickered, then engulfed the little room. Puppy was at the foot of the bed, his deep blue eyes looking curiously at me. Puppy was cute. Puppy needed a name. I would think about it.

I had gotten Puppy as soon as I got home, say, three days ago. He was there and had the noble mission of keeping me sane. Making him food and petting him was my duty, thus I would not forget how to operate this tired body. Everyday I felt like I was able to do much more than the day before.

It was working, quite well actually.

He had snuggled up to me as I cried all night. He was scared too, not for the same reason. Admittedly, giving comfort to a little puppy made you feel way better about yourself, and your situation. We were two dogs. We were afraid of the sound outside. I had closed the blinds, the window, and when it became too  much, I had pushed the closet in front of it. Yet it didn’t stop. The threat was still there, the sound only distant.

I did not know the date, honestly. It felt quite like a distant concept to me, yet another thing I had to master again.  But there had to be some kind of celebration, because all night, the Gunshots, aka fireworks, did not stop.  One could close his eyes. One could not possibly close his ears. Buying earplugs would require going outside, I would not have survived that, psychologically.

The ground was cold under my toes, then feet, as I stood up, shivering a little. My nose burned with those smells. I needed the cold. I dragged myself, touched the closet. Everything was cold, and I craved warmth, touch, but everything burned inside and nothing could stop that.

I pushed and pushed, weak. But it wasn’t too hard, because there were hardly any clothes inside. The light seeped from the corners of the blinds as I uncovered them. I took a bit to rest, then opened the window, pushed the blinds, stood there. The cold light, the cold air touched my everything, entered my lungs and then my blood. I felt I would catch a cold. The fleeting feelings of purpose –just being there, existing there, proving to the outside that it did not harm me enough, that I could still stand – were ridiculously worth it, though.

A sneeze behind me made me look back. Puppy looked surprised at the sound he made, then wagged his tail as my eyes met his.

“Sorry, Puppy,” I said, slowly closing the window, “I wasn’t thinking. Wanna eat something?”

As I picked him up and held him to my chest, I thought, everything would be fine. The world was done harming me.

[CW] Write at least 500 words about someone getting up to open the window.,Lexilogical,"Teresa stood up and drew a window.

Everyday she would hear a door creak and every time she would hear the door creak there would be a little crayon and piece of paper on her table. Today the crayon was color red though sometimes, the crayon was color blue.  She felt cross.

Little changes gave her a sort of pain in her chest, like a screeching note on a violin. She could feel it reverberating through the hollow spaces of her body, a high piercing wail crashing waves of sickness throughout her skin. Something so unfamiliar, so unknown taking root in the quiet stillness of her room – it made her choke. 

When this happens Teresa, the old woman said, try to focus on something else. 

There was nothing else in the room but her and she thought about herself.

Everyday when the crayon and paper arrived she’d take the crayon and paper off her table and bring them somewhere else. She wondered why she’d been given these, wondered why she’d been kept here with them. The paper, she ignored and left on the floor – the walls were enough as the paper. Teresa like drawing the same thing because drawing the same thing over and over again made her mind quiet. Suddenly, she felt something lodge under her fingernail. 

Red wax. The color was so real and so violating. It crept up her hands, kicking and bruising every part of her, every soft flesh it could grab at.  Why was it mad? Why was it touching her? The crayon felt limp and cold in her fingers. She dropped it in disgust and sat down.

Was there ever a time before this? Teresa tried her hardest to remember but none of the memories made sense. She didn’t recognize any of the faces, nor the voices that swirled in her vision. They played out like the film the old woman showed everyone for her birthday: silent pictures on a dusty old wall. Sometimes, she felt sadness, but this sadness stood alone and pointless in her mind.

The crayon was rolling soundlessly near the leg of her table. Squinting slightly, she could make out some of the marks it made as it dropped to the floor from her fingers. Teresa closed her eyes. If she couldn’t see it, it didn’t exist.

One time the old woman was at her table, drawing on the paper with a crayon of her own. It was a color she didn’t know. It was frightening. There were others, she realized. They were here, she realized. It made her choke.

 When this happens Teresa, the old woman said, try to focus on something else. 

The corner was her favorite spot and it was her favorite spot because she knew it was the farthest point from everything. Sometimes she wanted to leave and sometimes she wanted this more than another red crayon. The old woman said that she was stuck her but what the old woman said was untrue. She wasn’t stuck here. She wasn’t stuck here.

[CW] Write at least 500 words about someone getting up to open the window.,Lexilogical,"There's something to be said about procrastinating on the day your assignment is due. You know you're going to be panicking in about three to four hours from now when you realise you've done practically nothing, and in another hour you'll be frantically mashing your keyboard in the hopes that something legible, maybe even coherent, comes out.

You stretch your arms out with a yawn. You're lying on your bed in your room, laptop to your side as you lazily scroll through the internet. It's getting hot, and you're still not entirely sure why you've draped the blanket on top of you. Maybe you should open the window.

...

But that would involve effort. 

And that's what it comes down to, isn't it? You can't even be bothered to start writing up the assignment due in seven hours, you can't even be bothered to step out of your bed and open your window, you can't even be bothered to...

Uh...

Think of third statement to put in there. Repitition in threes is nice, but not so nice when you can't think of a third one. Now it just looks like you're rambling.

Which you are.

What's the point of this anyway? This isn't even a story that you're typing up on your laptop, this is literally an introspective piece about the futility of your assignment and how you'll probably half-ass it and get a passable grade by doing minimal amounts of work because you're too busy being lazy and working on things you really shouldn't be working on. 

Is there a word for self-schadenfreude that doesn't involve physical pain like masochism? Or is that still called masochism?

Wasn't this a prompt about opening a window?

Now the cat's jumped up onto the bed. p[';'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Please stop, cat. It doesn't- help=llll and there she goes again. Having a cat walk onto your keyboard sucks. 

You suppose if you were a more flowery writer, you'd probably try to write some sort of link between the melancholy of your life, the realisation of the futility of your assignment, the cat jumping onto your bed, and the act of opening, or the failure thereof, of opening a window. Maybe make a metaphor on how the cat is unable to see your point of view, and as such its actions which you consider annoying seem perfectly reasonable for it to do. Then you'd write about how it fits with the lack of understanding you thought other people held towards you when you were a teenager, until you grew up and realised that no, you were just a stupid teenager, and that the habits you had built up as a teenager had (i.e. procrastination) infiltrated itself into university life.

Hell, maybe you would have written an actual story.

You'll just settle for rambling. Again.

What would other people write? Maybe they'd start with some cliche like 'I was lying on my bed, staring up at the slowly spinning fan, blah blah blah, too hot, blah blah blah, aircon broke, blah blah need to open the window.' Maybe try to make it sound fake dramatic, like all those other prompts. Maybe they'd try to sneak in aliens, or Hitler, or heaven and literal hell in your bedroom. Probably a few serial killers too. Monster under your bed and in the closet arguing? 

You shrug and look at your fan, spinning fast, and your window, wide open. 

Well. That was pointless.

The morning sun was barely peering beyond the far distance as it illuminated a long line of smoke. Those blackened spires trailed out into the air and sky beyond the canopy of great trees, before the western winds began to draw them inland; scattering them to nothingness among the clouds. 

That was the proof of my first victory. 

There had been no careful planning, special tactics or finesse in the slaughter I commenced: Only destruction. I burned the second goblin camp I came across to the ground, along with its occupants. 

Late in the night, with only a few guards awake along the edges of the camp, no cry had sounded until the tents were aflame. In that mindless panic of their reactions, I counted down the number of my foes one sword stroke at a time. The dark, the flames, the smoke and chaos: I might as well have been a vengeful spirit of the forest- blade coated red in the glow of yellow heat. 

Soon, there was nothing left in motion but the rising plumes of black cinders.

I toasted stale bread over those smoldering flames as I soaked in the remnants of this first solo battle, processing what I might need to do and change before moving on. The adrenaline of the night was fading, while my mind of reason returned, logic pressing me to caution.

Food and drink, I supposed between bites and swigs of both. Those were things I might need during my campaign. An army travels along its belly; even if it's only and army of one. I finished my breakfast in silence, watching the first of the sun's light rise up through the trees.

Searching through the wreckage of loot and plunder turned to be tedious work: I found little that hadn't already been brought to ashes or spoiled. My victory might have left the enemy dead, but even the earth was scorched from the dozens of tents that had caught flame, and the center of the camp was little different from this trend.

I eyed those empty cages beneath burned cloth with simmering hatred as I shifted through the surviving wreckage. Even after an hour of looking there had been little of value to scavenge, though not for lack of trying. 

Still, I'd pulled some passable loafs of bread from an overturned cart, and found a barrel of water still untapped. Mixed with the piece of cheese and strips of dried meat still on my person, they would have to be enough for the next few days. I filled a second canteen of water after drinking my fill, and set off again. Other eyes would see that smoke, and they would not be long to question its origins.

My feet began to move beneath me, carrying my tired frame onward. Before the dawn rose I had moved on far from that place, well close to where I remembered the third camp might lie. When my eyes closed that morning, I felt as though my body were weighted down by a suit of lead.

No dreams greeted me.


...


It was late evening when I woke again, a rough breeze peaking over the refuge of roots I'd curled beneath drawing my mind back into the living world. Beyond my shelter, the forest shifted with winds, and the scents of distant salt and mana. Signs of a coming storm, drawn in from the *Sea of Tears.*

As I rose, I felt my chest expand with the air I drew, my tongue and throat tasting the sky. 

It burned of power. 

The shocking taste of wind filled magics: Wild and untamed, scooped off the ocean's surface and dragged ashore. True magics of the world, the sun, and the gods of the old themselves.

I had forgotten what this was like. 

Years... It had been years since I was so close to the western coast, but the memories returned with every breath. My first ocean storm in the New World, and the power that came with it. A distant memory of lightning and thunder in a cloud of swirling green, blue, and silver. I could see it there, soaring over my mind's eye, above a raging fury of waves. Proof that nature was beyond any mortal.

Raw magics of this world were a force past reckoning; life simply borrowed those, with poor efficiency. Some more so than others.



I let my hand rise before me as I watched the mana flood through my body, each breath drawing in more as it burned away along my skin and bones.

The ways of sorcery had never gripped me as they did some. As many did, I had dabbled and learned. A ball of glowing light that could illuminate my path was the first, and a small healing spell (of which I found truly difficult to cast more than once a day) was the second. My studies started on curiosity, but ended on the blunt edge of greater realities. 

I tested my affinities with the true elements, confirming for certain if there was potential for a greater skill I'd not known- but found it was as I suspected. Only a weak relation in the true magics, and a strong in the lesser. 

A clear sign.

To throw bolts of lightning, summon wind, spirits, and balls of fire: These would not be things I could take for granted in my capacity. My flesh was bound by the lesser arts, taking my own body's mana and manipulating it- but nothing more.

Now though... in this air- in this storm: Even I might cast something true with such a density. 

The hair of my neck rose with an electric feel of current as I drew in another deep breath of the rich air. I could see the possibilities stretching on past my fingertips- far beyond the lesser magics of my aura and flesh: With strength of this storm I could draw true power.

[TT](Edo Period) You have come across Mushashi and choose to follow him around the countryside,Nate_Parker,"A drop of morning dew balanced upon the edge of a blade of grass. Waving ever slightly to the soft breath of wind, the dew sat upon the precipice daring to tumble off the side. The sun rose in over the eastern hills casting long golden rays across the valley. Some were caught within the droplet, which glistened with the beauty of the purest jewel. In the undisturbed purity of that golden morning a single question lingered. 

Would the drop fall or would it retain its balance, ever harmonized and poised atop the fresh blade of grass beneath it? For Tanaka Aritake, the answer would remain unseen.

Sitting beneath the cover of a thinning willow, Tanaka meditated. With open eyes he scanned over the eastern hills. Much like the dew before him, sunlight captured in a million drops atop those hills, glistening with golden fluorescence. Like a spectral crown sitting gracefully over the rounded edges of the hillside. Birds chirped their melodies and fish splashed loudly in the creek behind him. Tanaka drew a deep breath and tasted the sweetness of the morning. He could search for a thousand years and never find a spot so secluded and numinous. 

Sadly it would not last. As Tanaka had discovered, the slightest ripple could spoil perfection. Like a ripe apple gone sour in his mouth, the golden hues quickly faded and the sounds of nature fled at the intrusion of footsteps. 

Tanaka looked down the old dirt path below him. Slowly, the sound of crunching dirt grew nearer. *One man,* he quickly determined based on the weight and length of the footsteps. *Though he steps lightly.* He furrowed his brow, likening the soft crunch, crunch, crunch, to that of falling autumn leaves. 

Sure enough in the next moment a man appeared from around the bed. His garb was blue like the ocean, upon his hip he wore two blades, his head was topped with a tightly wrapped bun of greased black hair. 

""Good morning."" The man called ahead, to no one in particular. Tanaka jumped at the sound of his voice. 

*Does he see me?* He wondered apprehensively. Then his brow furrowed in frustration as the man spoke again.

""Yes, I see you."" He chuckled. ""Beneath the old willow. Come out here and let me look upon your face."" 

There was no hiding now, Tanaka figured and he rose gracefully taking care not to disturb the dew upon the grass. He walked out to the center of the path and met the man face to face. 

""Hello again."" The man said bowing low. Tanaka returned the gesture. 

""What is your name?"" He asked inquisitively. He tucked his thumbs in his belt. 

""Tanaka Aritake."" Tanaka replied graciously. 

""I know that name well."" The man replied, ""I am Miyamoto Musashi."" He bowed again. Tanaka regarded him in the light. Musashi looked five years his younger. He was well kept and courteous, but there was more too. 

His eyes were flecks of obsidian, staring out almost apathetically. Though his lips curved up in a modest smile his eyes were cautious and carnivorous like a predator that stalked the night. 

""May I ask what you are doing out all this way?"" Musashi said inquiring politely.

""I come here daily for meditation in these hills. I have found that the old willow here is a most pleasant spot."" Tanaka did not take his eyes from the man as he spoke. Musashi on the other hand admired his tree.

""It is surely a beautiful spot."" He said after a moment. He paused then added, ""If you are finished with your prayers would you care to walk with me? This road is lonely and I would greatly appreciate a companion.""

""Certainly, friend."" Tanaka responded and the two started north, side by side, up the road. 

They walked in silence for the better part of the morning. Tanaka led them up into the rolling hills, twisting along over crest and valley. It was an old path, rarely travelled even by locals. As the hills folded together overtop them the two were utterly alone. They took their lunch at a point where the path ran in tandem with the creek. It was a cozy spot, nestled deep with the woods in the valley between two sharp precipices. Carved out long ago by the gentle brook the spot stood as a monument to the will the time. From their spot Tanaka figured the next village was still half a days walk. 

They ate rice and salt beef and drank water from the creek. The meat Musashi provided was absurdly tough so Tanaka soaked it in the water between bites. 

A short time later they carried on, following the path as it winded up a cliffside. The sun was high in the sky and bleeding hot as they reached the top of the hill. There Musashi stopped and looked to Tanaka.

""Why are we stopping?"" Tanaka asked. 

""I think this is just as good a spot as any, assassin."" Musashi replied simply. 

Tanaka cocked his head confused and Musashi observed him steadily with his impenetrable gaze. ""What are you saying?""

Musashi frowned. ""I know you Aritaki and though you've taken this walk with me I know you are no friend of mine."" 

Tanaka smiled he saw no reason to continue this charade any longer. He placed his hand upon the blade at his hip and said, ""When did you know?""

""From the moment you came out beneath the willow."" Musashi replied slowly drawing his katana.

""I had been waiting for many days."" Tanaka said drawing his own. The katana gleamed in the afternoon sun.

""You waited in vein."" 

""I will not return to my master without your head."" 

""You will not succeed."" 

""You are going to die here.""

""I fear the same for you."" 

It was true. Tanaka was an assassin sent to kill Miyamoto Musashi. He'd tracked his prey for many days leading him here into the dense mainland of the island. He had not planned on walking with the samurai, but Tanaka had also not planned on being spotted in his hiding spot beneath the willow. The death was supposed to be quick and clean, but Musashi was just as vigilant as the stories had said. Tanaka cursed his name. Now they would both bleed on this hilltop. 

Vigilant though he may be, but the question remained; was he as fierce a warrior as the stories told? 

That remained to be seen.

The two stood apart by ten paces. Neither dared to take their eyes of the other as a gentle breeze rolled over them. The world was silent as if suspended in a dewdrop upon a blade of grass. 

In a flash it began. They came together in a clash of steel and screaming voices. Their blades locked tightly in one another. Tanaka struck out first pushing back and swinging his blade in ferocious downward blows. Musashi parried every one with ease so Tanaka brought his katana to a point and stabbed at the samurai. Again, Musashi turned his blade aside. Another swing, a clash of steel, both men screamed out in rage. 

Tanaka kicked hard at Musashi's leg, but the Samurai jumped back. Pressing his attack Tanaka dove in with a savage pierce, but Musashi parried and reposted with his own blade. The counterattack nearly cut Tanaka, as the blade flashed just inches from his neck. 

The two stepped back from one another. 

""You're better than the others."" Musashi praised. 

""I'm the best."" Tanaka fired back angrily.

""Talented, yes, but the best? I think not."" Musashi sneered. 

Tanaka screamed as he lashed out towards the samurai. With great composure Musashi met his strike. In the next moment Tanaka made his final mistake. The assassin returned with another savage blow, but the samurai feigned to block it. Instead he allowed his defense to break as Tanaka's katana crashed down. The assassin unsuspected overextended and lost his balance. With cat-like speed, Musashi rushed in the gap and drove his katana straight through Tanaka's chest. 

The assassin gasped, dumbfounded at the steel pierced his body like a hot iron. His own blade slipped from his fingers in shock. 

""No,"" Musashi whispered as he thrusted his sword downward. ""I think not."" He then yanked the blade free. 

Tanaka made a strange gurgling noise as he collapsed to the ground. A warm, wet puddle of red formed around him. He tried to breath, but blood caught in his throat and bubbled out the corner of his mouth. Miyamoto Musashi cleaned his long sword with a white cloth above him, his face the very aspect of tranquility. Then without a word he continued down the path and left Tanaka on the hilltop to die. 

Tanaka's vision began to fade and blur and suddenly it seemed as though the day had grown cold. He shivered and closed his eyes. In his mind's eye, Tanaka watched a single dewdrop fall and dash itself across the earth.

"[WP] An immortal falls in love with a time traveler, only to discover that the time traveler was actually him/herself.",SleepyLoner,"It was a sunny Friday afternoon. I was shoulder-deep into the engine of my ‘57 Chevy truck, digging to find an undiagnosed sound in the rumble of the motor. I heard a voice, but at first I thought it was my imagination. My house is buried in the Chippewa National Forest, as far from human life as I could get without having to actually grind my own flour for bread. I laughed to myself, thinking how appropriate it would be to finally begin hearing voices in my head after all these years.  
  
“It’s not funny!” A woman’s exasperated voice cut through the engine noise. I turned my head to see a curvy brunette in an elegant gold evening gown, with her dress cut as low as her heels were high. In one hand she clutched a small purse, in the other, an enormous cell phone. I laughed again. It was rude, sure, but she looked so ridiculously out of place I just couldn’t help myself. I jumped down and strode to the driver’s side, reaching in through the open window to kill the engine. I wiped my sleeve across my face, trying unsuccessfully to clear it of all humor. I’m afraid I still had a bit of a smirk when she stepped around the truck toward me.  
  
“Sorry, ma’am,” I struggled to be serious. “I didn’t hear you at first. Not many visitors up here, and usually the dogs would let me know someone was coming.” A glance at the front porch showed me two doggy tails wagging in the breeze. They had seen the woman, but hadn’t even bothered to give me a warning bark. Jerks.  
  
“It’s all right.” She took a calming breath, relaxing her face into an easy smile. At this, her entire face transformed. She had been pretty before, but now. Well. I shifted uncomfortably.  
  
“I can’t get signal here,” she explained, holding up her phone. “Usually it’s no trouble - I don’t mind paying more for roaming - but there’s nothing at all.” Her eyebrows lifted as she leaned forward in anticipation. “Do you have a landline I can use?”  
  
I frowned. I had chosen the backwoods of Michigan for the beauty of its land and the sparseness of its population. A phone would disrupt the solitude I had chosen for myself. I chose to ignore her question, instead asking one of my own.  
  
“What are you doing here?”  
  
She stepped back a little involuntarily, surprised by my directness. “I… I got lost,” she stuttered, losing some of her newly regained calm. “I’m supposed to meet someone, and I’m late. Look, I just need to use your phone, and I’ll be out of your way, I promise.” Her vivid blue eyes peeked up at me from beneath their lashes, entreaty painted on her face. I sighed.  
  
“Fine. Come on in.”  
  
She followed me toward the house, choosing her footing carefully. How she could walk on gravel in those spiky shoes was a mystery to me, but she did it without a single misstep. The dogs lifted their heads as we climbed the steps onto the porch, and I made the hand signal to stay down. Not that they’d jump on her or anything. My dogs have manners.  
  
“Sit,” I commanded, indicating the cozy brown recliner. She lowered herself with care, obviously concerned with the cleanliness of the chair. I rolled my eyes. “There’s no dog hair on it, they aren’t allowed in my chair.” At this assurance she smiled again, thanking me with a nod as she tucked her purse and phone into the chair beside her. I frowned before taking the three steps to the kitchen. I popped open a couple bottles of beer, then rejoined the woman in the living room. I handed her a beer and swigged from mine as I settled on the sturdy coffee table. She looked at the bottle she’d taken automatically, then lifted a perfect eyebrow at me.  
  
“This is not a phone,” she said, in a tone that made her judgment of my intelligence clear.  
  
“No shit, Sherlock,” I replied. “It’ll still get you talking. Drink up, and tell me why you’re really here.”  
  
Her eyes narrowed, and for a moment I could almost see her calculating what to tell me.  
  
“Before you think of another lie,” I interjected, “allow me to inform you that I’ll know if you’re telling me the truth or not. Add to that the fact that nobody lives within 15 miles of me, and I don’t actually have a phone at all, and the result is you’re looking at the only person who can actually help you right now. So. Cut the crap, and be honest with me.”  
  
She laughed. It was sweeter than honey, warmer than hot cocoa, and made me tingle all the way to my toes. I shifted in my seat, crossing my arms in front of me as I assumed a stern expression.  
  
“I’m sorry,” she apologized, with every appearance of sincerity. “I forgot myself. Of course I’ll be honest. I am a time traveler, here by accident. I was supposed to attend the Beluigi Gala in Rome, but I was feeling nostalgic for the woods, and it caused me to project the wrong coordinates. So instead of dancing the night away, I’m on the wrong side of the ocean with a man who has terrible taste in alcohol.” She lifted the beer toward me as if in a toast. I uncrossed my arms and took the bottle in my free hand. I toasted her direction with a smirk of my own before I drained the entire beer, setting the empty on the floor by the coffee table. I studied her.  
  
“Okay, you’re telling the truth,” I admitted at last. “It is shitty beer. They don’t make the good stuff anymore.”  
  
“And the rest of it?” she asked. “You believe me?”  
  
“Doesn’t matter. I’ll help you get wherever you’re really going.”  
  
“Why?”  
  
I used my beer to gesture at her dress. “Lady, you might be madder than a hatter in 17th-century France, but despite your questionable sanity one thing is obvious: you don’t belong here. So sit tight but don’t get too comfy, ‘cause in a few minutes I’ll have ole Betsy put together enough to drive and we’ll dump - I mean, drop you off - at the airport in Grand Rapids. You can get wherever you want from there.”  
  
She grinned, inclining her head in a gracious movement. “Thank you, dear. I was hoping you would see reason.”  
  
“Yeah, yeah,” I muttered, standing and moving toward the front door. I let the screen door slam behind me, beckoning the dogs to follow. They immediately moved to flank me, Dexter at the left and Sinister at the right. What can I say, I like irony. I set them to guard while I worked, just in case the crazy lady turned out to be a serial killer.

That's one word that would describe my life. Empty, meaningless, lonely, they weren't enough to explain what I've been through last hundred years.

Untill I saw her. I don't know if it's coincidence or not, but wherever I went, that same figure, same clothes that was clearly out of her time stood up vividly in my mind, as if following me, as if *tracking* my every steps.

Rome, 1911

Yerusalem, 1923

Berlin, 1934

Leningrad, 1948

I recorded her every appearence, the exact date, time, and place, as I clung to the dream that one day, my hands could reach to her.

Moscow, 1955

Seoul, 1964

Jakarta, 1971

Cairo, 1982

Tokyo, 1993

New York, 2004

Dubai, 2016

I chased over her shadow, only giving me a glimpse of her bewitching smile every time, arrogant beyond anyone, as if mocking me, as if *taunting* me to reach her.

Washington, 2028

Canberra, 2034

Lexington City, 2041

London, or whatever left of it after the Temporal Armament War, 2053

Sydney, 2062

I stood upon the greatest invention of humanity, the time machine that would let me retrace her very steps, to follow her jump over the time, to let me actually meet her, to let me grasp her true beauty.

Draped in the same inconspicuous gray raincoat as she was, I inputted the first coordinate in my meticulous record of her sighting, setting it a few hours earlier, so that I won't miss her shadow.

Rome, 1911

Yerusalem, 1923

And so on.

Not until Leningrad that I realized: there are no mysterious woman. There are no one, no one that could withstand this endless loop except myself, and the only thing that I could do, was letting the cycle continues, as I traveled, through the ruins left behind by the greed of humanity.

I have no choice.

I pulled an appropriate nut out of the magnetic bowl, fitted it into the wrench, and leaned down to place it carefully on the bolt. It slipped and fell to the gravel below the truck. I cursed.  
  
“Language!” The woman admonished me. She slid beneath the engine, taking the nut in a well-manicured hand. She stood, and I turned to stare. Her shimmering gold dress had a dusty streak all down the side she had leaned on, and part of it was torn.  
  
“What - what are you doing? You ruined your dress.”  
  
She shrugged delicately, allowing chocolate curls to fall in waves on her creamy shoulders. “I wasn’t going to make it to the gala anyway. I’d like to help.” Absently, she patted Dexter on the head, and his tail thumped against her leg. I glared at the traitorous dog. He lolled his tongue out in a doggy grin. With a snap of my fingers I gestured for Dexter and Sinister to both go back up on the porch. Meekly, they obeyed.  
  
“Okay, fine. Just don’t get in the way.” I went back to what I was doing, which mostly consisted of trying to ignore the woman in the ruined dress. I distracted myself by mulling over what she had said. Time travel might seem impossible to some, but I knew it was only a matter of time before it became reality. Most people would move forward in time, of course, because going backward would result in too many paradoxes. Especially given people’s penchant for wanting to go back and tell their former selves about the future. That was a recipe for disaster, and nothing good could come of it. I fitted another bolt into the wrench.  
  
“Wait!” The command surprised me, and I stopped. “That’s the wrong bolt. Here.” She plucked a new bolt from the bowl and held it out to me. I flicked a glance at the bolt I’d grabbed, noticing it was indeed an older bolt.  
  
“Thanks,” I said, with more confusion than gratitude. “You know about engines?”  
  
She smiled tightly. “Obviously I know more than you think I do.” She wiped her hand on the soiled dress, then stepped back again. I finished with the engine quickly, then carefully dropped the hood into place.  
  
“All set, Your Highness.” 
  
The woman bent to pick up her phone and purse from the gravel. As she stepped toward the passenger side, I sprinted around to open the door for her. 
  
“I see chivalry’s not dead yet after all,” she laughed as she slid into the seat.  
  
“Technically politeness to women was never in the code of chivalry,” I quipped. “Mostly I just wasn’t sure you could handle the door. It’s pretty heavy.” I closed the door with a bang, emphasizing its weight. She lifted an eyebrow at me through the window.  
  
“Believe me, dear, I can handle it.”  
  
I shrugged, unwilling to start an argument just before beginning a two-hour drive. I swung myself into the driver’s side, slamming the door before cranking the engine. It roared to life, and I shifted into drive and moseyed the truck along the gravel road out of the woods. We said nothing, each of us lost in our thoughts. Eventually we pulled out of the woods and onto the pavement, cruising in the early summer warmth. It was fortunate she hadn’t arrived a month later - the Chevy didn’t have air conditioning.  
  
“It’s not so bad, you know,” she spoke suddenly, as if continuing a conversation I hadn’t known we were sharing. “People can be awful, sure, but they can just as easily be wonderful. And in the future they’re more accepting. Of everyone. You can just be yourself.” She folded her hands over her purselet, surreptitiously checking her phone.
  
I shook my head. “If the future is so great, then why come back in time? I mean, look around. People still fight over the stupidest things, killing each other to make a quick buck. It’s senseless, and always has been.”  
  
She was silent for a long moment before quietly replying, “I'm sure you’ve seen some terrible things. It must be impossible to believe in the goodness of humanity.”  
  
I didn’t answer. She had no idea about the things I’d seen. War, yes, but even worse was the careless apathy of those who were unwilling to fight for what they believed. The ones who shrugged and claimed it didn’t affect them. Cowards. Those people deserved to be the ones dying on the front lines, not the kids with hearts of gold and mamas crying over their broken bodies.  
  
I glanced over as the woman checked her phone again. “Expecting a call? You should get signal again in a few minutes when we hit the highway.”
  
“Thanks, I’m good.” She tucked the phone under her leg, then looked speculatively at me. “You should grow out your hair,” she mused. “It would look lovely with a little length.”  
  
My face flushed. I generally buzzed my own hair with trimmers, and I was sure the sloppiness showed. She seemed to realize she’d said the wrong thing, and stammered out an apology. “I mean, it’s a nice color. I dye mine with a little henna to bring out the copper highlights…” She trailed off, then fell silent.  
  
“Awfully kind of you to come from the future to give me hair tips,” I joked, attempting to put her back at ease. “Do you have some kind of magic future product that will make this beard stop growing? Shaving every day is a pain in the ass.”  
  
She nodded. “And if you let it grow, it - I mean, I’ll bet it itches. Yes, there’s a technique invented in the late 23rd century that finally perfects closing the hair follicles for good. Shaving is very much a thing of the past.”  
  
“Good,” I grunted. “Something to look forward to, I guess.”  
  
A knowing grin crossed her face, and I swear she practically glowed. I found myself staring, trying to figure out the secret behind her smile. I had just opened my mouth to ask her a smartass question about facial care coming from solar rays when she clutched her seatbelt and screamed. I whipped my eyes back to the road. A green tractor was pulling up the steep side of the road, and couldn’t see me approaching. I yanked the wheel and swerved around it, but we were going too fast and the Chevy just didn’t have the turn radius I needed. The front tire slipped off the wrong side of the road. The whole truck followed. We rolled twice before the truck fetched up against the treeline, smoking and hissing. I immediately looked over at my passenger.  
  
The woman sat calmly in her seat, that knowing little smile back on her face. Her window was smashed out, but the broken glass on her lap didn’t seem to bother her any. I blinked.  
  
“Are you okay?” I gasped, shocked that she wasn’t hurt.  
  
“Are YOU okay?” she countered, gesturing toward my own glass-strewn lap.  
  
I sighed ruefully. “Well, I guess this is going to be a longer trip than originally anticipated. Think we can hitch a ride on that tractor?”  
  
“‘We?’” she asked, reaching into the floorboard to dig her phone out of the glass, “I believe I have service now. I won’t be needing a ride anywhere.” She tapped the screen, then wiped her hand on her dress and tried again. With a triumphant look she held up her phone, mouthing words toward it without ever actually putting it to her ear. I wrinkled my forehead and leaned toward her.  
  
“Wait a second,” I interrupted her. “Before you go… Um.” I hesitated, then blurted it out before I could think better of it. “Can I get your number?”  
  
She erupted into laughter. My face reddened, and I wished the rollover could have just killed me instead. She reached out a hand, then stopped before she actually touched my arm.  
  
“Listen, dear,” she said gently. “Just remember what I said about people not being all that bad. Oh, and remember the henna!

Just gone.  
  
“Hey, buddy, are you okay? I’ll go down the road and call 911 for ya.” The farmer continued to spew helpful nonsense, but I ignored him. Gears might not be turning in my truck, but they were going overtime in my head. Come to think of it, she had an awfully familiar face. And those blue eyes… I tilted the Chevy’s rearview mirror to reflect my somber face and solid blue eyes.

"[WP] ""I'll let you into Heaven on one condition: apologize to the one you killed.""",Weirdguy149,"""What? That's crazy!"" I screamed.

""So is damning yourself for eternity because you don't want to apologize."" replied St. Peter, arms crossed over his chest.

""But... How will I know which they are?"" I demanded.

""Which one *SHE* is."" came the reply. ""And trust me. You'll know. It's heaven. We can make things happen.""

""Can you promise that I won't ever have to see... *Her* again?"" I sighed.

""No."" He replied flatly. ""That's up to the both of you to decide. Heaven is infinite, but you'd be surprised how easy it is to find someone.""

""So if I apologize, you'll let me in. That's it?"" I asked.

""Yes. It's pretty simple. You repent for what you did, and you'll get in.""

""Okay..."" I took a deep breath. ""Let me do it.""

The gates opened and St. Peter beckoned me through.

""You're not such a bad guy after all."" He said, as the gates closed behind me.

I was completely awestruck at what lay in front of me. It couldn't be described in words. 'City of gold' didn't do it justice. There was nothing on earth that I could possibly compare it to. I searched around for her. I had no idea how to find her. In fact, there was nobody around at all. 

*It certainly is infinite* I mused.

That's when I saw her. She was beautiful. More beautiful than I ever imagined she could be. Tears welled up in my eyes as I ran to her. She saw me coming and stood still, not reacting.

I reached her and couldn't stop from wrapping her in an embrace. Tears rolled down my cheeks as I said over and over.

""I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.""

I sobbed on the shoulder of my daughter, who stood stoically, not saying a word.

""I didn't know."" I said, when I pulled away. ""I had no idea. We were so young, so scared. I wish I could take back what I did, but...""

She held up one hand, silencing me. 

""It's whatever, dad. I'm happy here.""

""Me too."" I replied. ""We can be so happy here!""

""Nah."" She replied. ""You clearly didn't want me on earth. I don't know why you'd want me now."" She began to walk away.

Heaven truly is an infinite place. If someone doesn't want you to find them, you truly won't ever find them. 
As it turns out, Heaven and Hell are the same place. And it truly is your decisions on earth that determine which one you get to experience. I learned that from my unborn daughter.",turk1ish
"[WP] ""I'll let you into Heaven on one condition: apologize to the one you killed.""",Weirdguy149,"I frowned. “But I took my own life.”

“Correct.”

“How can I apologize to myself?”

“Show that you are repentant of your sin, and beg redemption.”

“I must beg something of myself? That doesn’t sound like begging. More like self-fulfillment.”

“Try.”

I closed my eyes, and thought hard about what I had done. Alone in my apartment, it had been pills, a quiet way, because I didn’t want to leave a mess when I left. The letter was on the floor next to my body.

“I am sorry for committing suicide.” I told myself, then opened my eyes. The angel stood before me, arms still crossed, shaking his head.

“That is not what I asked.”

“Then what do you want me to do!” I exploded, throwing my arms wide. “How can I apologize to myself? That doesn’t make sense! An apology is me committing a wrong on somebody and begging their forgiveness, it doesn’t work when you are both the victim and and committer. How can I steal from myself? Lie to myself? Begging forgiveness is like asking myself for a glass of water, saying ‘sure’ and then pouring out a glass! I do not understand-”

Suddenly the angel was right there, his face radiant and burning. I cringed and tried to retreat back, but my limbs were locked in place. He looked me deep in the eye, and with a single, quick movement, placed a thumb against my head. It seared like a brand.

Raw, fiery agony blazed through my thoughts, and I saw my life play out like a parade before me. Standing at my mother’s funeral; my father drunkenly yelling as he beat me; running away, hiding under a wet overpass; Wilke’s, a school of orphans and castouts; standing at my adopted mother’s funeral; coming out here, alone, with just the money in my pocket. The letter, oh, the letter-.

With a blistered cry I wrenched myself from the grip of the angel, and I toppled backwards, landing on my back. There were no stars in heaven, nothing above but cool white clouds. I laughed.

“Why did you show me that? To remind me how shit life is?” I asked bitterly, glaring as the angel knelt beside me. I met his gaze like a wounded animal, defensive, but all I saw was compassion in his eyes. “I don’t need a reminder.”

“Daniel.” I stiffened, no one had called me that name since my mother, my *real* mother, died. “You say that you cannot lie to yourself, that you cannot steal from yourself, that there is no reason, no merit, to apologizing. But what I have shown you proves you false.” I opened my mouth to say something sarcastic, but he held up a hand. “You have been lying to yourself since the day Marie died in the crash, telling yourself that life is unfair, that life has no meaning. You have repeatedly told yourself that there was no higher purpose beyond that of your own survival to continue existence, to put your love in others, to find all of the joy and beauty present in our Lord’s creation. You have robbed yourself of pleasure, of emotion, of feeling, drawing yourself up into a husk, wasting away. By killing yourself, you have robbed all of that which you could have been, killing your own future along with your mortal shell.

“For all your life, all you have permitted yourself to know is pain and misery,” he continued, softer. “You *can* find redemption in yourself, Daniel, you can accept that the life you lived was not a life worth living at all. All you must do is know that, and accept it into yourself. If you do this, you may enter into the Kingdom of the Lord. Try.” He offered out his hand.

I hadn’t realized that I was crying, but when I looked down towards his hand, it was blurry. The scenes of my life kept replaying themselves in my mind, and in each I saw myself grow a little colder, watched as I progressively grew a little more spiteful towards the world. I knew what he said was true, that my life was all one big shitty excuse. I looked back up, but the angel’s face had blurred to merely a bright light. “I don’t know if I am strong enough. If I could forgive myself.”

It might have been my imagination, but I could have sworn that that faint light smiled at me.

“Try.”

Shaking, I reached out to take his hand.

--------

The blur slowly resolved itself into a white room, birds chirping somewhere nearby, and I felt warmth pressing down on my legs. Is this what being dead is like? No, my vision cleared, and I saw the corners of a small room, blankets pulled up to my chest, the chirping turning into the beep of some machine nearby. A hospital. I was in a hospital?

All you have to do is look around, and truly see the state of things, and you'll understand. You'll see her pain, hear her rage. It all started so subtly.. But it seems we've become too much, picking and tearing at her body, and using the pieces to shield ourselves from her wrath.

Let me back up a little bit. You see, for those who truly know, who understand, the Holy Mother is the Earth. She breathed us into existence, and is certainly capable of the destructive fury required to drive us from her bosom. And like I said before, she was subtle I the beginning. A forest fire here, some lightning there, perhaps the occasional flood. She just wanted our attention. Sure, from our point of view, the death and destruction could be horrific.. But truly, on a global scale? The Mother was giving us a slap on the wrist. If only we had listened more closely.

Now, though.. Not a day goes by without natural disaster striking. Disease, howling winds, the ground swallowing the unworthy by the city. And now that I'm listening, and you're listening, perhaps you hear her. Because as the day wears on, I realize, I'm not just hearing it in my head. I thought I had it all figured out, and that she would find me worthy, but I can see now it's all ruined.

Can't you hear it? She's tearing herself apart. Volcanoes rise from the ground in front of our very eyes, the oceans boil and hiss, the winds howl and rage around us! This is the wrath of the divine!

""Then again..."" It *could* be fun, if done right. And Hearthstone wasn't working. He clicked on the link and started reading the first reply, only to stop himself before finishing the first paragraph, not wanting to be influenced by it.

Alas, it was too late, and some of it had lingered in his brain. ""This is harder than I thought"", it said.

""Well, now that they mention it, I really have no idea of how I'd go making this story interesting. Maybe I could have a part where I point that out? That could work.""

But, he wondered, where could the story go from there? How to make it actually engaging. His mind wandered to Dan Harmon's story circle - he had had a conversation about it a few days earlier, and every time that happened the whole thing would stay around in the edges of his mind, waiting for any chance to resurface. Like that one roomate that always shows up just as you are about to start cooking.

He stopped typing and looked at the last sentence: ""Like that one roomate that always shows up just as you are about to start cooking."", it said. It occurred to him he had no idea what he was talking about but hey, how would reddit know? It's not like he was going to tell them. Of course, on the other hand, it could do for some humorous stalling while he figured out where the story was going, so why not?

""But anyway, back to the story circle"" his mind insisted, annoying as ever. 

You. Need. Go. Search. Find. Take. Return. Change.

""I'd say I'm four steps in already. Now if only I could run into a goddess...""

The phone vibrated. He ignored it. Seconds passed in the almost-silence of impatience and frustration: fidgeting hands, stretching, some chair movement. He started typing about this, then stopped to see if there was any sound outside he could add. Zero. Nada. Just as he was about to mention this, a dog started barking.

""Another paragraph, still no goddess.""

Maybe that's it. The realization that there is no real story to tell. That his life is not, and will never be, worth writing, no matter how he tries to pull it off.

Should he stop, then? Maybe close the tab, leaving no trace of the failed attempt?

No. He's done that many times. He regrets most of them.

""That was a *good* poem god damn it, I shouldn't have deleted it just because I couldn't finish it. It could have been part of the book.""

The book is a big deal. But it's not part of this story.

""Or is it?"" He wondered, right after typing those very same words. ""Maybe this could go in the book as well. Which part would it fit? Wait, you are getting derailed, reddit is gonna get bored at this narcissistic bullshit, back to the circle.""

He stretched.

Would it be better if they were complete sentences? Sentence case, at least? It wouldn't look right to have them all in header case, anyway.

She pressed her fingertips into the home row, where two tiny, raised nubs indicated the 'F' and 'J' keys. She liked the way they felt.

He begins typing furiously at the keyboard. Inspiration has not set in, but he is desperate to finish a single story today. His mind wanders as he pokes and prods at the tale he wishes to unravel, unsure where to start. Eventually he settles upon setting the scene by backtrackign slightly in time:

&gt;/u/delvedeep scans the list of fresh writing prompts in /r/writingprompts/new for what must be the eighth time today.

This single sentence provides focus for the rest of the tale. It's not long before he decides upon a clever, witty start to the third paragraph - he simply repeats the first but changes ""eighth"" to ""ninth"". See how clever he can be!? His pride allows him to break into song, poorly and incorrectly singing lyrics from the currently playing tune.

He realises that he should probably keep quiet as others are sleeping nearby. It is late afterall... After turning down the music he returns to writing. He wonders how long he can keep this up, perhaps he should end it abruptly? Maybe he should continue it on forever, cleverly looping the post in on itself. He decides to cleverly loop the post by linking to the same post he has just written at the end, except it's not really that clever. It's pretty stupid in reality, but that doesn't matter to him! Doing this would of course mean he'd have to post it and then edit the short incredibly low effort story... he's have to try getting the URL in before the edit asterisk appears so it seems extra clever! He briefly wonders how to format a URL as the reddit comment syntax is simply but awkward. Thankfully he remembers RES is installed so that is a non issue. Just gotta make sure he ninja-edits the story quickly!

No matter if he gets it wrong, it's not like he proof-reads anything anyway. He clicks 'save' on his poorly written account of his poorly written story after feeling that he has carried it on for long enough.

Oh, crap! He realises too late that he has forgotten to link back to the story, so has to go back in to it and edit in something clever.

anything. But not this. ""Well…."" He tried. ""What about… enjoying life? Living the moment? Earthly pleasures and all that.""

""What's the point? The only reason we do fun things is so we'll remember them later. The moment itself doesn't 
exist at all, because it's always passing.""

""Well… so what? Making memories is not a bad reason to live.""

""Yeah, except you lose all those memories when you die, so why bother? It's like collecting stamps in a burning 
building.""

A sudden harsh wind beat against them, and Greg had to grasp on tight to the rails behind him not to fall.

""What about love?"" Sam tried.

""Chemical reaction in your brain. The result of millions of years of evolution. Animals that didn't feel this way about 
other animals didn’t fuck and died along the way.""

""Friendship?""

""Again, evolutionary residue. We survived more often when in packs.""

""Knowledge! The search for meaning!""

""All distractions. All different ways to tingle your brain and distract yourself from the fact that you're gonna die. 
Even if you *do* find the meaning of life, well… you'll forget it when you die.""

Sam was shaking. The man pulled a lighter from his pocket and tried, with no success, to get his cigarette lit. 
""Damn… no use."" He threw the lighter carelessly, watching it fall down the twelve stories drop. ""Well, kid? Come on!""

&amp;nbsp;

From the base, the team was listening in silence, exchanging confused looks. *What was Doctor X doing?*

&amp;nbsp;

Sam took three deep breaths, then looked up at the bald man. ""I think you're wrong,"" he said. ""I think life's worth 
living. You're just… old and cranky. I wanna live.""

The bald man shrugged. ""Suit yourself. Life will keep on sucking with or without you.""

He flicked his unlit cigarette, turned back and jumped into the apartment again. Sam scooched over to the edge 
and peeked through the window. The man was crossing the front door. He turned back: ""Sure you don't wanna do 
it, kid? I think it's the right way to go.""

""No,"" Sam replied, now more confident. ""You know nothing, old man! Life's great, and I'm gonna live it to the 
fullest! You'll see!""

Before he closed the door, the bald man watched to make sure Sam would climb back in. And Sam did.

&amp;nbsp;

""God damn it, he did it again!"" The team leader exclaimed, from the control room. Everyone was cheering and 
clapping and hugging. He leaned over the microphone and pressed the speak button. ""Doctor Xanax, are you 
there?""

""Yes,"" Doctor Xanax replied. ""I'm here.""

""You are a master, Doctor! How did you do it? We thought you had changed teams there for a minute!""

""Reverse psychology,"" Doctor X replied. ""The kid was sixteen. He'd never do what a bald old man says is right. 
The second I convinced him that *I* thought suicide was cool, it immediately became uncool to him.""

The team leader shook his head to himself, impressed. ""You're a genius, Dr. Xanax.""

""Thank you, boss.""

&amp;nbsp;

Dr. Xanax turned off the walkie talkie just as the elevator doors opened. He nodded politely to the doorman, 
stepped through the double doors and stopped under the sun.

Another kid saved from suicide. Another kid who would be making an appointment with a doctor to deal with his 
depression, instead of giving up. And another prescription wrote. Another couple hundred dollars for his bosses at 
Big Pharma.

Dr. Xanax smiled. It felt good, to do the right thing for all the wrong reasons.

"[WP] You are about to commit suicide, when a voice behind you asks you something really mundain.",gohomefreak,"They say falling into water from this high is the same as falling onto concrete. I've seen countless gore videos online of people meeting their end in some body of water or another. Most of them were tragic accidents. A few were suicides. 

I stood precariously perched on the wrong side of the railing, the bridge just barely beneath me. The ends of my shoes were a silhouette over the river rushing below. The wind threatened every second to do my wetwork for me and sweep me off the edge. I couldn't even feel the cold. I couldn't feel anything, really. I just wanted to die. 

The wind must have masked the sound of the man's footsteps as he was walking by, but his voice pierced the white noise, clear as a bell: ""Do you know what day it is?""

Almost subconsciously, I reached into my pocket for my phone. The surrounding darkness had severely dilated my pupils, causing the harsh light of the LCD screen to assault my vision. My eyes welled up with protective moisture, and as I brushed away the unwanted tears with my free hand, the wind suddenly swelled without warning and I began to teeter haphazardly forward. When I clutched fiercely at the railing, my phone tumbled into the night, the light from the screen painting vague pictures on the darkness below. I couldn't hear the splash when it hit the river, but I saw the display go dark. 

""Fuck!"" I don't know why I was so upset. I was about to die, after all. ""Sorry man, I dropped my phone,"" I said lamely. 

But I was speaking to no one. The man had either left already without bothering to hear my answer, or he was never there in the first place. 

""The fuck...?"" I mused quietly into the night. ""Who's there?"" 

I became suddenly and irrationally aggravated. Who the hell would pull some stupid prank on a dead man walking? No concern for my safety? Not even a shred of morbid curiosity for a fellow human being at the brink of death? 

I scanned the bridge, intently searching for the person who, against all odds, ruined a suicidal man's night. For some reason, a desire burned inside me to find out why he would ask me that, especially there and then, with my intentions clear as day in the frigid, fleeting blackness. 

Seeing no one, I glanced over my shoulder at the river below. 

""It's the twenty-first of September, 2015.""

My heart lept into my throat and I momentarily lost my grip on the railing. My head automatically snapped toward the sound of the man's voice, still familiar to my ears after such a short hiatus. But he wasn't on the bridge, where I expected to find him. He was casually sitting on the railing, right-fucking-next to me. 

""Jesus, what is your problem?!"" My voice broke on the final word of my question, becoming lost in the wind. ""First my phone, now you want *me* to fall?"" I have to admit it was a stupid question. I had been about to jump when he showed up. But he might not know that, as oblivious as he seemed to be. 

""Why do you care?"" He sounded so casual and composed for just having come so close to literally scaring me to death. ""You were about to jump.""

I could do nothing but stare blankly, dumbfounded. He really didn't give a shit whether I lived or died. 

""You son of a bitch,"" I mumbled, incredulous. ""I came here to die, and you came here to..."" I stuttered momentarily to find the words: ""What... fuck with me?""

He chuckled sadly, and some of my irritation with this random stranger ebbed away at the sound of it. He couldn't have been more than 40, but in his laughter I heard thousands of years, sorrow and pain. I continued to stare at his face. His smile was barely distinguishable in the inky blackness, but I could somehow tell it didn't reach past his lips. 

""On September 21st, 1995, my wife Eileen jumped off this bridge. I've come here at this time, on this day, every year since.""

""Oh..."" I sheepishly sighed. ""I'm sorry.""

""Forget it."" He waved his hand dismissively. ""Why are you here?""

I sighed and slumped against the railing, remembering my shitty life in an instant. Damn him. 

""The usual bullshit, I guess. Lost my job, my house, girlfriend, yada yada... But mostly, because I know it's all my fault. I'm a drunk.""

It was true. My alcoholism destroyed my life in a measly six months. I don't even remember how it all started. Maybe an argument with Jennifer, maybe a bad day at the office. All I know is, I went to the master therapist Jack Daniels and spiraled out of control. I lost everything. More like threw it all away. I lived in my car, panhandling for food. My family lived out of state and my shame prevented me from reaching out. Jennifer cleaned up one too many puddles of my puke and left about six weeks ago to live with her mom back home. 

""Ah... The old bottomless shot-glass, huh?"" He didn't even sound surprised. 

""I guess."" 

Uncomfortable silence followed. Suddenly, I didn't want him to leave. 

""Tell me about your wife.""

"[WP] You are about to commit suicide, when a voice behind you asks you something really mundain.",gohomefreak,"The water was dark and a long distance below me.  Lights lit the bridge above and to my back.  A strong breeze blew through the warm night carrying scents of the bay.

Any other time it would have been a beautiful scene.  A moment to feel the touch of the world upon you and bask in the glory of existence.  Yet here I stood, halfway up the guard railing, my weight leaned forward, my arms stretched wide, and only my feet wedged between two bars standing between me and the laws of physics taking care of it all.  The tears had dried hard on my face and their absence seemed to weaken my earlier resolve.

As I tried to regain my determination and will my feet to release the hold a voice suddenly spoke up close behind me, ""Are you a Christian child?""

I was startled, and due to it was almost granted my wish.  Yet, some innate base survival instinct kicked in and my balance reasserted itself.  I had been raised with religion but had never been particularly religious myself.  My mind began to form a response to the question, but I quickly quashed the notion.  I did not have it in me to engage in conversation at that point and thought that by ignoring the odd, seemingly random, question the person who asked it would take it as a cue to go away.

He, apparently, had no such intention.  Out of the corner of my eye I saw my mystery guest come to stand next to me a few feet down the railing.  From the black collar and white choker thingy (I have never bothered to learn what the actual term for these are) it was clear he was a priest.  We both stood there as if we were simply enjoying the view.  

""You know it's a sin?"" He said after a few minutes, a question which I also declined to answer.  ""You'd spend eternity burning for it.""

This had not figured into my calculations, it still didn’t.  Before I could stop myself, though, I found that I was voicing, ""I don't care.""  Another period of silence followed my declaration.  My mind went back to my woes and worries, my reasons, as I tried to rebuild my determination and reassure myself of the certainty that seeking an end was the right course of action.  I found that I was speaking my mind aloud to the priest, who said nothing, choosing to allow my tirade to flow.  Somewhere during it, growing weary of the bar pressing against my legs, I shifted to sit atop the railing.  My perch was precarious, a fact that, given my desires, was of no matter to me.

Strangely, putting my cares into words and presenting them to an audience somehow took away the power they had held echoing through my head.  I felt that they were no longer insurmountable.  Perhaps everything, excepting the act which I had been preparing myself for, was fixable?  

I wondered then if this had been the Padre's game all along.  Perhaps he meant simply to lend an ear to listen.  The bridge was well known as a place for people who sought escape.  Maybe he thought it his service, his duty, to help break their resolve to do what, based on his earlier statement, he saw as folly.   

Silence had followed in the wake of my speech.  My benefactor broke it, stating ""I see.""  

He left the railing and came to stand in front of me.  ""Still it would be a shame if you burned...""

His words caught me off my guard and left me confused.  I did not have long to contemplate them, however.  He shoved me and gravity let my body know that it had some falling to do.

""This way it's not suicide, you were murdered,"" I heard him say as I fell.  

A long distance below I hit the water hard.

"[WP] You are about to commit suicide, when a voice behind you asks you something really mundain.",gohomefreak,"EDIT: I found this sub by clicking the ""random"" button, and this is the first prompt I have ever done. Hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed writing it :) 

""He-hello... Miss? Do you have time?""

My heart fluttered at the sound behind me. I swallowed the alarm in my voice and cleared my throat.

""Uhh, I.. um"" My brain scrambled in my skull. My hand found my temples and my head swayed toward the direction of the voice.

He was pointing at his wrist. ""Miss, sorry, my time is at France. Do you have time?""

I sat and gazed at him for moment. He was tall, mostly in his legs. His face was average except for his exceptionally thick eyebrows that made it hard to look at anything else.  He was wearing an orange button up tucked into dark jeans rolled neatly at the ankles revealing matching orange socks and European style suede shoes. 

""My time"" He eagerly pointed to his wrist again ""My time is, erm, in time with France? Time with you here, I do not know. Do you have time?"" He stammered through broken English. His eyes seemed to apologize for his lack of ability to communicate. He searched me intensely for understanding.


I blinked back the fog over my eyes as I realized what he was saying. I patted my pants fumbling for my phone. I stood up and swung my backpack around to my chest and unzipped the front pouch. Before I could get it half way open my hand flew to my temple and I groaned. My head felt like a swarm of bees trapped between my ears. I blinked a few times and my eyes felt hot. 

The strangers feet shifted toward me and my heart started to race. His body language radiated concern and I felt sorry that it was me he had stumbled upon in a foreign country. 

""Just a headache"" I muttered without making eye contact, not wanting him to see the lie on my face. 

I sat down on the bench again and put my backpack in my lap. As I rummaged through my things an empty white bottle fell out onto the concrete. My fingers felt what they were searching for and I pulled out my phone. I looked up to see him standing in front of me now with the bottle in his hand stretched out. My face flushed and I snatched the bottle like a thieving raccoon and thanked him without looking up. 

""7:23"" I said, showing him the screen. I wondered if my voice sounded as hollow as it felt echoing between my teeth. I cleared my throat, glanced up and flashed him my best impression of a smile.

""Ah, yes, much thank you miss!"" He exclaimed smiling warmly revealing perfect, brilliantly white teeth. I nodded and smiled back. I looked at him as he walked away  becoming a shadow in the setting sunlight. He must have felt my eyes on him and he glanced over his shoulder, his dark eyebrows tense with concern. 

I folded my hands and returned my gaze to the ocean. The tide was twice as high as it had been a moment ago. How much time had gone by? My mouth felt dry and I tasted the salt in the air. Watching the water rise and fall closely, I realized the swarm in my head had gone silent. I wondered how much time I had left. I looked in the direction the stranger had gone. The streets were empty. Almost eerily empty. 

My head felt heavy now, like an unstable merry-go-round spinning on top of my shoulders. My eyes fell to the ground for a moment, then back to the glistening body of water before me. I blinked slowly, each time with more difficulty opening them again. Suddenly they shot open as I felt water around my ankles. My chin fell to my chest as I watched my feet become submerged in salty water. *what is happening* My mind swirled with confusion and fog. *the water was 100 feet out a minute ago* My head fell into my hands and I could feel my body failing. Tears flowed down my cheeks and my chest heaved. Between my fingers I could see the water getting higher and higher up my legs. This was is it. This was the end. The water crept onto the bench and surrounded my torso, then chest, then neck. I looked into what was left of the sun through the mist in my eyes as the water poured into my mouth and ears. 

The next thing I remember was inaudible murmuring and a steady beeping in the background. My eyes felt like cement bags but I managed to open them just enough to see a nurse standing in front my where I was laying speaking to a man in a lab coat. I groaned as the light seeped into my retinas causing them to feel like lava dripping into my brain. The two stopped speaking to each other and simultaneously  snapped their heads in my direction. The nurse scurried over to a monitor that seemed to be hardwired to me. The man in the lab coat seemed to float to my bedside. 

""Hello, I am Doctor Leroy. Can you tell me your name?""

He spoke in a thick accent. My mind reeled and a man in an orange shirt flashed in my memory. 

""El... Elinor."" I murmured through a sigh.

""Well, Elinor, you are lucky to be alive.""

I half coughed and half laughed in response but said nothing. I closed my eyes and tried to remember the tall figure in the orange shirt.

""You took a massive amount of painkillers Elinor. Over the last 6 weeks we weren't sure if you were going to make it. You could have killed yourself and the baby."" 

My heart stopped and my eyes peeled open. I could hear the beeping going crazy 
in the background and the nurse shuffled out of the room. My mouth opened but no sound could come out. Suddenly I realized how dry my tongue was. I couldn't move or feel my body for that matter. 

In a barely audible rasp I stammered ""Th- The.. baby?""

"[WP] You are about to commit suicide, when a voice behind you asks you something really mundain.",gohomefreak,"""I like your tshirt.""

I almost let go in startlement, and through the rush of emotions and tears streaming down my face, all I could manage to say was ""w-what?""

""Your tshirt. I like it.""

There was a lady sitting on the railing above me, her legs crossed over the edge like it was nothing; smoking a cigarette and blinking absently at the scene that befell before us.

I looked down at my tshirt. It was a plain blue tshirt with some faded writing on it that once read ""my other car is also a ferrari.""

""Oh...uh...thanks.."" I managed weakly. I leaned back against rail again. I had almost done it. Almost had the guts.

*It's not too late* I thought, and mustered up that same strong clear-headed conviction I had just moments before. I felt strong. Ready. This was mine, and mine alone, and no one could take it away from me.

Just as I was about vault off the edge into blissfull abyss below, the lady flicked her cigarette over. I watched the sad little trail of smoke and ash float uselessly down, whilst she lit up another one.

""You ever watch Grey's Anatomy?"" she asked me, as if we had just been talking about TV shows not moments before.

""What..."" I asked weakly, feeling my resolve leave me once again.

""Grey's Anatomy. That show about doctors.""

""No..."" I said miserably, once again leaning back against the rail.

""Yeah me either.""

We sat there for a bit in silence until she finished her second cigarette, flicked it over after the first, and then spun her legs over back onto the road. 

""Well, see ya"" she said over her shoulder, with a casual backwards wave.

I feebly waved back, but she didn't see and she didn't care. I looked down at the drop beneath me. It didn't seem so frightening any more. Nor did it seem exciting, or at all like a strong statement of 'doing it my way'.

What the fuck was I doing here?",PM_ME_3D_MODELS
"[WP] You are about to commit suicide, when a voice behind you asks you something really mundain.",gohomefreak,"""So what're you gonna do? A 1080 double lariat or some shit? You gonna try and fly?""

The hair jumps on the back of my neck and I hunch over as if I was caught stealing a cookie.I turn my head to see a balding, middle aged man in a loosened tie lighting a cigarette. He resembled the same kind of typical upper management, alcoholic scumbag that fucked up everything in the first place for me and my heart filled with rage. 

""Its Game 7 of the playoffs and you're staring at a street instead.""

""Look at me, why do you think I give a shit?"" 
I tremble screaming at the man like he was the physical embodiment of my life.

""Cus' some of us wanna watch the game and instead they are gonna be scraping your goo off the street. Kinda ruins the night don't you think?"" 

He takes his first inhale then nonchalantly breaks his gaze from me to look out at the water to the east as if witnessing the end of my life wasn't entertaining enough.

I sniffle looking back at my objective of the ground below.

""I don't give a shit, nobody gives a fuck about me."" I choke back sobbing in front of the stranger.

This isn't at all what I pictured in my head. I can't even end my life they way I want without somebody shitting on me. 

""And what? Thats gonna make everything all better once your gone? Everyone'll still think you're a pussy.""

""Seriously man. Fuck off.""

""The thing that's weird about you young people is that you can switch gears like that."" He snaps his fingers. ""When you're like me you're stuck doing the same shit everyday. Talking to the same kinds of people."" 

He nods his head in a bragging sort of way.

""I'm good at it, don't get me wrong but it gets fuckin' old after all these fuckin' years.""

His local accent was borderline stereotypical. He was everything I resented, probably had a wife, a job, everything secured and taken care of and now he's telling me HIS life story and having things is hard. But it was somebody to talk to, he gave me more time of day then anyone, and even if I think I hated him I still kept the conversation going. 

""You don't know a thing about me man.."" I whimper, defeated in every aspect. 

""I know if you lean forward a bit more whatever you're pissed off about..""

He inhales and and sighs aloofly.

""It 'Aint gonna change, and it'll be there forevah. That's something you can do but I can't""  

I stand a little firmer, my broken psyche trying to get off the ledge but my pride keeping me there. 

""Arn't you supposed to be helping me? Instead you're just convincing me that you should jump with me.""

""Oh, Fuck you."" He smokes. ""I'm just saying what scares the shit outta me is something you want. Its all fuckin' relative you know. Trust me I know what I'm talkin' about."" 

""Bullshit."" I accuse him. ""I Have nowhere to go now.""

""You've got fucking everywhere to go now. Fuck you."" He becomes agitated and I chuckle a bit morbidly which doesn't help.

""Oh you want to laugh at me? Tryin' to help you? Okay, asshole, jump! Do a flip!"" 

""Why do you fucking care what I do?"" 

""Why do you think?"" He questioned back looking straight at me. He shook a bit, his eyes not watering but glossing over as much a grizzled Boston man would. 

In his eyes I saw pain, the same kind that I felt in my heart. I couldn't resonate or relate with anybody but in this look I saw a sense of sincerity none of his words could come close to portraying. I connected to this man, and even if I didn't agree with what he was saying, he earned my respect enough to listen.

I take a deep breath and hear horns honking below me. I shiver once again.

I step down from the ledge shaking my head walking towards him slowly. He still seems agitated but raises his eyebrows quickly as a congratulations for deciding to live. He brings the cigarette to his mouth to finish it off.  

""Its just so damn cold up here. I thought it was supposed to be summer by now.""

""Yeah, shits weird."" He reminds me as he gets closer.

He tosses his Marlboro stub off the edge. And I imagine it gliding gently towards the ground. I could talk with the guy a bit longer at least. He examines me saying nothing but making sure I have my security at least. I want to thank him.

""Look-"" I start but am cut off to a hand in my face.

He cuts me off excitedly turns to me as he braces.  

""Now check this shit!""

He shoves me down to the pavement of the roof and sprints towards then edge. I reach for him and his shirt slips through my hands. His head held high and his loosened tie coming undone and falling to the ground in front of me as he elevates himself up and over before falling out of sight behind the ledge.

""Go Bruins!"" I hear his accented battle cry echo into the city sky. It rings in my ears as I trample the tie getting up and sprinting to the ledge out of desperation. My hips slamming me to a stop against the stone railing as I look out over it. 

I see nothing. Just the same traffic ridden streets I saw before. 

My mind races. People don't fall that fast do they? Jesus Christ. Fuck. I stammer on out loud thinking of any super power I could develop to change the situation.

I reach into my pocket and pull out my phone wanting to call the police and as I do so, I look back at the concrete. The tie that I stepped on was gone. 

I look under my shoe and around the rest of the roof. 

I rub the back of my neck in anxiety. I suck the cold air as my thoughts jam inside my brain finding no answer for the storm of confusion. 

A ding is heard towards the middle of the roof and the doors to the elevator open. I've never seen any woman beckon to me harder than those doors did. 

I stomp over to the door and my thoughts link in slow motion. A fire burns inside of me and a new philosophy about things spontaneously arises.

I take a quick glance back at the ledge somewhat mystified but now with growing understanding and the doors close removing it from my existence. No one will ever hear about this. No one will know me at my weakest point except for him. 

As the elevator closes I shout out in a mocking accent to the empty roof. 

""Yah didn't even do ah flip!""

"[WP] You are about to commit suicide, when a voice behind you asks you something really mundain.",gohomefreak,"I scan the label of the sleeping pills for the ninth time, my eyes flicking over the words but the meaning not really registering.  I already know its contents: 120 milligrams of Daltnea.  It would be quick.  It would be easy.  I would finally be free from pain.  The voices would leave me.  I would not exist.

For a long time I had put off suicide.  *Coward,* the voices called me.  *What is there to be afraid of?*  I had clung to the visceral fear of death, that animal instinct for self-preservation, for months.  It had been a weapon against the voices.  

But time and weariness had dulled and rusted that once iridescent blade.  No matter what I did, no matter the good times that happened, the voices came back.  They are a crossbreed between hyenas, flies, and tar; laughing, buzzing around me in thick, impenetrable clouds that blacken memories.   

I look up from the bottle of pills, taking in the forest around me one more time.  The wind rustles through the yellowed and browned leaves, blowing several off their branches and dancing with them as they make their way to the ground.  When I fall, there will be plenty of leaves to bury me.  The woods have been my place of escape for years.  This place, far from any trails and regular human travel, will be my bed and coffin.  I will give the animals of the forest a meal over the winter.  

I stare at the bottle of sleeping pills again.  *Just do it,* they urge.  *You’re a worthless shitbag who takes up the time and energy of others.  Do you know how fucking glad they will be without you to drain them?*  I place my hand on top of the cap.

“Oh, good!  I found someone!  Can you help me find the trail?  I’m lost.”

I turn around.  A middle-aged woman wearing a sweatshirt with binoculars and a camera on straps around her neck treks through the leaves.  

“I saw a leucistic red tailed hawk flying from tree to tree and I followed it,” she continues.  She taps her camera, saying, “I was trying to get a picture of it.  Sometime along the way I lost the trail, so here I am.  Do you know your way around?  Can you show me the way back?”

I shove the pills in my pocket.  “Sure.  This way.”  I start to walk in the direction of the nearest trail and she walks alongside of me.  “You a bird watcher?” I ask.

“Sure am.  Now that my son’s in college I go on trips across the country.  I came here to see the fall colors, but when I heard about the white hawk living ‘round here I had to check it out.  Have you seen it before?”

“Yeah.  Pretty bird.  Have you seen others?”

She nods and gives a small smile.  “My husband always liked birds, especially raptors.  He volunteered at a nature center where they had a leucistic red tailed hawk.  He really liked that bird.  Now they always remind me of him.”

I note that she uses past tense when referring to her husband, but it is not my place to pry.  Instead, I make an affirmative noise.

I must have displayed some signal of interest, for she went deeper into her story.  “He died a car crash.  Right when our son was graduating from high school he was driving home from his work and a semi truck flipped over on him on a turn.  It was hard.  Evan had a really close bond with his father, and it really sunk him down to not have his support in the graduation.”

“I’m sorry,” I say.  I hate those words in these kinds of situations.  They are near useless and are only a social gesture that often doesn’t mean anything.

“Thank you,” she says nevertheless.  “It was hard,” she repeats.  “I was not sure how to function without him.  But Evan needed me.  I still had family.  I had a job that I enjoyed, and still enjoy for that matter.  As long as you’re living, good things happen if you reach for them.  I chose to reach for those good things.  Are there times when I am sad?  Yes.  But that is never all that is in life.”

I look at her, fingering the bulge of the pill bottle in my pocket.  We’ve been on the trail for a while now, heading back in the direction of the parking lot.  She stops every so often, looking through her binoculars at birds.  Once I express interest, she lets me look, too, pointing out songbirds and even a resting owl out to me.  

We reach the parking lot.  “Thanks,” she says.  “Not sure what you were doing there in the forest, but I thank God that he put you there.  I had no idea where I was!  Do you have a car here?  Do you need a ride home?”

“I don’t need a ride, thank you.  But could you do something else for me?”

She cocks her head.  “Sure.”

I take the bottle of pills out of my pocket.  “Can you take these and dispose of them?”

She takes the bottle from my hand.  “Of course.  I would be glad to.  Thank you for trusting me.”

“Thank you for your story.”

She nods.  “Are you sure you don’t want a ride?”

“The walk will clear my head, now that I have new things to think about.  Thanks, though.”

“Good luck.”  I watch as she starts her car and calls someone.  She drives away, waving.

I turn on my cellphone.  I have a few new notifications coming through my feed.  I open my text messages.  One is my sister asking me to lunch.  *Yes,* I reply.  *Coming.*  

*Good.  See you soon,* she texts back.  

I put my phone in my pocket and leave the woods, feeling 120 kilograms lighter.

"[WP] You are about to commit suicide, when a voice behind you asks you something really mundain.",gohomefreak,"The train was running late. Usually I wouldn't mind so much, but today I was impatient. I was ready to get this life over with. The only thing keeping me sane was knowing that when this train arrived, I would depart from the pain. I guess I can take solace in the fact that this is the one failure that couldn't be blamed on me. The train conductor would have to take the fall for this one.

I checked my watch. 5 minutes late. Maybe I should just climb down onto the tracks and wait there for the relief. If I laid down across them, maybe the operator won't see me in time. I could get off these tired legs and stretch out. Seems simple enough, won't even have to work that hard for it. Story of my life.

I looked left and right on the platform. Not a soul in sight. No one to stop me. This was my chance to go unseen into that great unknown. To remove myself from this great equation. To cease to burden. 

I hunched down to drop off the platform. So silly to think of at a time like these, but you gotta protect your knees from the shock. Not like it mattered, but it's what they taught you in the 101st Airborne. 

""Excuse me, are you waiting for the 4:05?"".

I stumbled back a bit and fell on my ass. The voice came out of nowhere. No footsteps preceded it. No shuffle of shoes or clothing. I would have known. I was trained to know.

""Oh my, I didn't mean to startle you. Here, let me help you."".

An outstretched hand appeared before me. I didn't take it. I'm not one to accept help, especially from strangers. I planted my palms and struggled to my feet, brushing the seat of my pants like it even mattered.

""Where'd you come from?"", I asked, probably more accusatory than I intended.

The man was probably late 60's, the size of a gumball machine and dressed like a newspaper boy. Extra extra, read all about it, the amazing appearing nut job.

""Me? I've always been here. I like to watch them come and go.""

""The trains?""

""No. The people."", he said, his eyes wandering with a slight smile as if to reminisce.

The platform was still empty, save me and this old-timer. A ghost town with two residents who haven't made the plunge just yet. I was planning on crossing that line before this guy showed up. Where was this train anyway?

""The 4:05 is running late."", he said staring towards the arrival board. ""Looks like you couldn't wait."".

I eyed him for a long moment. Why'd he look so smug?

""I dropped a twenty on the tracks. Thought I'd have time to get it."", I lied. 

The old man peered over the edge of the platform and clicked his tongue against the roof of his mouth. 

""That's a shame, son. Seems like your money up and vanished. Stuff goes missing around here all the time. Change, keys, hope..."", he trailed off staring at the tracks.

The platform rumbled with the telltale sign of an approaching coach.

""Maybe if you look hard enough, you might find what you've been looking for."", he said over his shoulder.

The train rode into the station fast and loud, the wheels screeching on the track as it lost momentum. Wind blew around me like a fall gust and the train car lights made me squint. The 4:05 came to a complete stop and the doors jolted open all down the line.

The man was gone. No sign of him. He left as sudden as he had come.

I glanced at my watch. 4:12. I guess I'll just have to wait for the next one.

"[WP] You are about to commit suicide, when a voice behind you asks you something really mundain.",gohomefreak,"The rope coiled warmly around Hannah Ridley's neck; thirty two years old, no children, no friends, a sister she hadn't spoken to in two years, a dead dog, a living goldfish, some tatty furniture and a rug she rather liked. In the corner behind her, above a grubby phone, a single, small window was covered by a felt curtain. It smothered the outside world in favour of the comforting shade which idly cradled the room.  

Her foot knocked something from the table on to her favourite rug. It could have been an empty carton of cigarettes, an unopened letter, or last night's (or perhaps last week's) *Minute Wonders Macaroni Cheese*. Her tongue parted her salty lips as she managed a rueful smile. Even now, it bothered her slightly that she might have stained it. She fought against the rope to look down, past her nose and upper lip. The twine pressed into her larynx, and gave her a reassuring choking sensation. Her tangled hair was tugged by the rope as she pulled on the knot to tighten it further.  

Beneath the window, the phone began to ring. Each jangle of the bell reverberated along her nerves, and nicked open sutures that weakly held back memories like seeping wounds. Paula's voice had been quiet on the phone. 

*...You should have come back. She wanted to see you. They both did.*  

It had not been lethargy, but fear that deterred her. She thought she wanted to remember her mother living, not dying. Paula had refused to speak to her since then, and Hannah made no attempt to reopen contact.  

She grew increasingly tense as the phone continued it's clamour. She closed her eyes, and focused on the abrasive embrace of the noose. She bent her knees, taking even more weight on her neck. The ringing shrank back as her ears rushed with blood, quieter, quieter, and then - gone. A crackling speaker replaced it:  

*Sorry, but -* ""Hannah"" *- can't answer right now. Please leave a message after the tone*: *beep*.  
""...Hello?"" Said a hushed voice. It was the first she had heard in weeks. ""Are you there, Han?"" It was Paula. Hannah inhaled wheezily, and straightened her legs.  
""I was hoping we might get a coffee tomorrow?"" Said Paula. A rush of grief exhausted Hannah's body. She drew another raling breath, and moaned as she exhaled. She wiped away a tear, and made her choice.

""W - what? ""

""A steak, you know, a cooked cow, a fried bovine. Don't seem to be able to get a decent steak anywhere in this city. All gristle and fat.""

My right leg was hovering over the bridges ledge. It had been like that for a couple of minutes.

""I'm sorry, but I'm a little busy right now...""

""Figures. Everyone in this freaking city is always busy. No steaks, no manners.""

""Well,"" I said, bringing my leg back onto the bridges wall. ""Not *everyone* is like that. My mom had time for everybody, and she was born here.""

I turned around to see a large man with a mop of thick dark hair. He was wearing a suit but had his collar unbuttoned.

""Guess times have changed. Smoke?"" he asked, pulling out a cigarette.

""No, thank you. I don't smoke, it's not good for you.""

He gave me a strange look and then began laughing. ""Yeah, got to be careful, a haha, this stuff can kill you, haha!"" 

""That's funny..."" I said, unamused.

""Ah I'm sorry buddy. So, why you jumping? Can't find a decent steak around here either?"" he said, regaining his composure and wiping a tear from his eye.

I sighed thinking about it all.

""Wife left me, took the kids and to top it off.. I have just been diagnosed with stomach cancer.""

It actually felt kind of good to tell someone.

""Ah, that's rough buddy. And jumping off a bridge is on your bucket list?""

""I guess it *is* my bucket list."" I replied.

""You know, my brother was diagonosed with stomach cancer three years ago. Chemo was rough but he's still kicking around. ""

""Yeah, well...""

""Look I don't mean to waste your time, I just want a good steak. You know anywhere or not?""

I considered.

""There is this bbq place downtown. I used to take my wife there a lot. Best steaks I've ever had - well seasoned and they know what *rare* means.""

""Sounds good. Well, come on then, you take me there and I'll buy. I'm pretty new around town and could do with the company - and the directions!""

I looked back down at the river. I guess it could wait. I stepped down from the wall.

""You really should try and quit smoking you know."" I said as we ambled down the street.

My eyes were glazed in tears and yet my mouth was bone dry as I murmured the word coward under my breath. My heart rate increased, my eyes closed hard and I raised the pistol to my head. A flash of images ran through my mind, a million thoughts exploding every tense millisecond as my finger began to tighten. The hammer began to rise, the tension built inside me as my stomach twisted into knots. “This is it, this is—“

“What is your favorite rose?”

The voice snapped me into reality and a spun on my heals to catch a glimpse of the person speaking, but as I turned there was no one there. I was alone. I lived alone, and knew all the doors and windows were shut and locked… all part of my plans that were set in motion. The question caught me further off guard, like a painful memory I had pushed down into my subconscious, only now being dredged to the surface. My eyes darted around the room, frantically trying to make sense of the situation. 

“What is your favorite rose!?”

The sound came from behind me again, like a phantom hissing it’s odd riddle from my own shadow. The voice more distinct and sinister hung in the air, lingering far after the audible portion was gone. I raised the gun, pointing it in all directions. “I am a-armed, who’s there? Show y-yourself!” I choked out, tripping over my own words.

“WHAT”	
		
I turned as fast as I could. Nothing…

“IS”

The voice snapped like a gun shot, I span round again to find nothing.

“YOUR FAVORITE”

Nothing again, the voice grew louder like twisted avalanche barreling towards me.

“Rose?”

A whispered word collapsed against my face as I turned into the skeletal visage of a monstrous creature floating not but an inch away from me. It’s breath like winters wind on my cheeks. Tattered hooded robe floating around the creature, as if animated from a wind that wasn’t seen or felt. I stared into the lipless, toothy maw as it opened. It’s words freezing the air around me.

“Answer me boy. Rose. Which is your favorite?” The apparition exhaled in a deep timber, shaking the walls and floorboards. 

“R-r-red ones?” I stammered out, both confused and frightened.

“GOOD. I shall leave them on your tomb upon your demise. But… that isn’t THIS day!” The ghostly phantom uttered with a maddening cackle. And with that, it was gone…

Frozen in fear I stood, mouth slack and eyes staring into the middle distance in disbelief. I dropped to my knees and began to cry. Attempting to wipe the tears from my face, I realized I was still holding the gun and my hand had gone numb clenching the firearm so tightly. I dropped to the floor and backed away from it like a poisonous snake. Backing myself into the corner, I wrapped my arms around my knees as the emotional damn burst and my eyes flooded. The cry was cathartic. I hadn’t let loose like that since I was a child.

Rubbing a sore spot in my neck, I opened my eyes to a darker version of my apartment. Obviously I had been a sleep for multiple hours. I sat up, back against the wall and surveyed my lodgings for any sign of my visitor. Everything was just as I had left it, including the pistol haphazardly strewn on the floor. Finally willing myself to stand, I stretched out the aches of sleeping on the hardwood and walked into the kitchen, coming to a wide-eyed standstill as my usually barren refrigerator doors now hung one piece of artwork.

"[WP] You are about to commit suicide, when a voice behind you asks you something really mundain.",gohomefreak,"""What had I been doing with myself these past few years?""  This was the question that raddled around in my brain during the past few months.  I had allowed myself to live in a form of auto pilot.  The amount of inner passivity that I had lived with was atrocious.  ""I wish there was a reset button on my life, a way to go back and fix this.""  

Due to my lack of caring, I was stuck in the same dead end job going no where fast.  I had a loving wife, but the passion just wasn't there anymore.  My children still giggled with the love of life that I wish that I had.  What was I doing?

I had decided that today was the day.  There may not be a reset button in life, but I can pull the plug on the game.  I couldn't take wallowing in that defeat any longer.  It was time to just give up, because everyone would be better off without me anyways.   ""All I am doing is taking up air.""  I told myself again and again.  ""I may as well give my share of the oxygen to someone being more productive than myself.""

I climbed up some flights of stairs in an old apartment building, and found an unlocked, vacant room.  Dust clouds were kicked up as I walked through the main room.  I made my way to the window at the far end.  As I reached the window, I fiddled with the latch, really contemplating what I was about to do.  ""I am about 15 flights up... and the street looks really busy too, so even if the fall doesn't kill me, maybe a truck or a bus would.""  I couldn't believe I just said that out loud.  Fear was screaming at me to not do this, but it was the same fear that told me not to ask for a promotion at work.  It was the same fear that told me not to get intimate with others, because they will all hurt you in the end anyways.  I opened the window, and was preparing for the leap of my life.

""Excuse me man, you got the time?""

I twirled around, and found a hulking man in the doorway of the vacant apartment.  ""I-I'm sorry, what?""

""The time man, do you know what time it is?""

""O-oh, right, time.  Uh, just a second.""  I pulled out my phone with a shaky hand.  ""Um... it is 2:45.""

""Man, I haven't seen anyone shake as bad as you since I visited my grandmother in the retirement home.  You a'right man?""  There was a brief pause, then he said the phrase that scared me the most, because I had been discovered.  ""Don't tell me that it is jump'n time for you man.""

What kind of a person says that?  ""Yeah, that was my plan.  I'm just wasting space anyways.  I am a failure, and figured that I may as well just end it, you know?""

""Maaann... I do know, I was in your shoes at one time man.  I kept lying to myself saying that I was worthless, but I realized something m-""

He stopped suddenly in mid-sentence.  ""Are, are you alright?""

The maintenance man, who had appeared with no warning, toppled to the ground, and began to shake uncontrollably.  ""Crap, you gotta be kidding me.""  I dialed 911.  I had to hear the last of what he was going to say.  I couldn't die yet, I had to know.  ""Yeah, I am up on the 15th floor of the apartment building at the intersection of 1st and Washington.  Room number 1506, there is a man having a seizure up here.  Send help.""

The seizure subsided before the para-medics arrived, but he was still unconscious.  My thoughts were focused on only one thing now, what was he going to say?   The para-medics told me what hospital they were going to take him, and I watched as they drove away, siren's blaring.  

I traveled to the hospital the following day.  I asked around until I found his room.  ""I'm looking for someone, large man transported here yesterday by ambulance.  He was on the 15th floor of an apartment building.  I called 911 about it around 2:45 yesterday.""  I repeated this story over and over until I found someone who knew what I was talking about.  They led me to his room and I slowly went in, heart pounding.  ""Hey maintenance man, how you feeling?"" 

""Maaaaan, it's the jumper.  What are you doing here?  I thought you had a date with some pavement.""

The way he said that stung a little.  ""You were in mid sentence, saying that you were in my shoes at one time... I had to know what you were going to say.""

He chuckled a little bit, and then said something almost philosophical.  ""You already know man.""

""What?  Don't do this to me now, I have been worried about you for the past 24 hours, and I spent the last 2 hours just looking for you in this hospital.  I can't take riddles anymore, just tell me.  Please, just tell me.""  Tears started to well up in my eyes, I couldn't remember the last time I was this emotional.

He sighed a little, gave another small chuckle, and then changed my world.  ""You have to find something bigger than yourself, and chase it with all your heart man.  You chasing me around kept you alive for 24 more hours.  You are even getting emotional about it.  You are feeling more alive than ever now, right man? Now find something bigger than me, and chase after it relentlessly.  That is my secret man.""  ",Vintner42

"[WP] if you're forced to fight a war over nothing, you better pick the side that's going to win.",hpcisco7965,"I'm sitting at my computer screen reading on political and societal issues on Twitter and other news sites. All I keep seeing is people saying that Donald Trump is literally Hitler and a racist and sexist. I consider that he may be these things but then determine to look it up for myself as these are very harsh accusations to accuse a potential presidential nominee with. After hours of research I discover that Trump actually has sound policies regarding immigration, the economy and a general ""America first"" attitude which is needed at a time like this. He often says things that make him seem a buffoon but certainly not as this literal Hitler many portray him to be. A lot of what he say's is taken out of context and used to manipulate his image, which is odd, because liberals don't do that, right?

So anyway, as I kept perusing twitter I notice someone say Trump is a racist and should be killed. I think that's pretty ignorant, and I tell them that Trump simply wants to deport illegal aliens, which that in and of itself is a crime, as they do not help the economy and many of whom commit a very large number of other crimes, according to all statistics. But then I get called a racist and ignorant and then I get blocked by them. I guess they didn't want to have a conversation or discuss to facts. Oh well.

A little later on I see that someone calls him a racist and should be shot dead in the street because he is a racist for wanting to block Muslim's from entering the country and to spy on them. I think, yes, on the surface that could be construed as racist but in reality he is just trying to protect American's that are already here, and as evidenced by countries like Germany, Greece, and Sweden, bringing in Muslims often creates a cultural and economic dysfunction as well as potentially brings in extremists. I also comment that Muslim's are already being spied on and that at least he was being honest about it, and it would be completely ignorant to believe they weren't already being spied on by the Obama administration. But I then get called a racist and a pig, and then get blocked once again. So strange.

And wouldn't you know it, I stumble onto a post saying Trump is sexist. I think to myself that is extremely odd because all the evidence speaks to the contrary. So I tell them that the wage gap really is a myth and all the evidence supports this, just like Trump had stated. Of course, I get called a sexist, cis scum, and a racist, and ultimately blocked by a dozen or so self described feminists. 

I sit at my computer, dismayed. Someone who just wants to discuss facts, not feelings, as these are what policies and government are about. My brain hurts...the facts...they are starting...to not mean...anything...what...is happening...to me...I...I...I am turning...I can feel it....I can feel myself...wanting government...based on...feelings...not facts and...evidence...this...this can't be...feelings...do...not...make...government...or...or...or...do they...I...I am turning...to...the dark side...I...I...I...have turned to...use feelings...over...logic............NOOOOOO!!!!!!!",SwagNasty69

Somewhere they know that they aren't true, but they act like they are. I think it gives them pleasure that way."" Shinji said, looking into the distance. He was an excellent guide for me, although his tendency to be poetic might have made him less than ideal for a lot of others. That also explained the lower hourly rates, his slightly well-used clothes, and the fact that he had spent twenty minutes telling me a Buddhist tale that he eventually realized he did not remember the ending to. 

""We can go see the cherry blossoms now, yes? We love our trees here in Japan."" he said as he turned to walk. 

""Shinji,"" I called out after him, ""There is one story I want to ask you about.""

He stopped and looked at me with a grin. ""It's a ghost story isn't it! Which one? The TV girl? The pig boy?""

""None of those"" I said, making a mental note to ask him about those two later on. ""Tell me about the tree-maker."" 

Shinji's grin had disappeared. ""It is only a story."" he said, looking away. ""With no truth to it."" 

""Oh come on. You just told me about the twenty-foot tall demon. Don't tell me he roams your streets!""

Shinji considered for a moment. Then he said, ""Have you ever cut a tree?"" 

""I might have, but I've grown more than I've cut. I grew up in a valley, Shinji. I could name more kinds of trees than people in my life. Why do you ask?""

""Now we take bus."" he said. 

On the way he told me the story. Sometime in the Edo Period, cutting trees had been made punishable by death. Only official decree could allow one to cut trees, and those were rarely issued. This had completely disrupted life in the villages. With no source of firewood or timber, they were finding it increasingly hard to survive. 

Legend then tells of a strange boy who used to live in one of those villages. It is said that news soon spread about a boy who could ""speak"" to trees and hear their thoughts. One day, the villagers decided to find the boy, who was meditating under an ancient oak tree. They begged and pleaded so that he would be able to help them in their predicament. To everyone's surprise, the boy took out  a knife and cut into his finger. And to everyone's disbelief, saplings sprouted wherever the drops of his blood fell. Then he cut into it some more and watered the saplings with his blood, and before their very eyes, the saplings grew larger until the stems became trunks of miniature trees, and swelled up into full-sized trees. The villagers immediately prostrated themselves before this magical boy, hailing him as their saviour. But the boy had gone back to meditation, with a single tear rolling down his cheek. 

Slowly, word spread about the boy. The officials of course were perplexed about the wood that the villagers suddenly seemed to possess, even though none of the surveyed trees had been felled. 

As we got off the bus near a small village that was lit with pink cherry blossoms and headed to a small forest nearby, Shinji told me that the legend had diverged into several theories at this point. Some said that the officials killed the boy, some said that he left for the heavens, others still claimed that the story was baseless to begin with. 

""What do you think, Shinji?"" I asked.

""I do not think, I show."" Shinji said mysteriously as I followed him into a clearing in the forest. It was eerily quiet, though I could hear the gurgling of a stream nearby. The middle of the clearing was an unbelievable sight. A huge oak tree grew, seemingly covering the entire sky with its foliage. Under the tree grew scores of different kinds of miniature trees, the ones we know as bonsai.

""Wow."" was all I could say.

""Come here."" Shinji said, leading me to the oak tree. He looked up at it, his eyes brimming with tears. 

""Why do you think the boy committed suicide?"" he said, not looking away from the tree.

I was taken aback. I thought for a long while, breathing in the wild, green air of the forest, feeling all the life around me. 

""I do not know Shinji. But I can tell why he cried every time he grew a tree."" 

I now had his attention. ""Why?""

""Because he had made people forget how long it takes to grow a tree. He made growing them as easy as cutting them, a matter of blades. It hurt him inside because he could speak to trees, and yet these new trees had not even learned to speak before they were cut down.""

Shinji nodded. ""I thought so too."" he said, kneeling down under the tree. His fingers were caressing a wilted bonsai plant, a white pine. Then, he took out a small pocketknife and made a swift cut on one of his fingers. I am tempted to say that I imagined the rest, but I cannot erase from my mind the memory of the tree coming back to life as his blood touched it, the yellow leaves deepening to green, the trunk strengthening and knurling until it stood proud in Shinji's withered hands.

""No one will believe me anyway."" I said with a resigned air. Shinji laughed at this. ""You wouldn't tell anyone anyway. It is one thing to claim that you met the great great grand nephew of the tree-maker, and it is one thing to tell someone that one can create a tree instead of growing it over many years. You are a man of the forest, mister. I feel it. The trees feel it.""

I suddenly became aware that I had been judged by these ancient temples of life, and had been deemed worthy. My hands folded themselves in prayer out of their own accord, even as I felt cherry blossoms fall upon my feet.",thelight88

"[TT] Your family are guardians of an ancient bonsai tree. This morning, you wake up and see that the tree has borne fruit.",hpcisco7965,"As with every morning, Mae remained in bed as long as she could, savoring the sights and smells and sounds of the new day. She saw red cracks on the eastern horizon slowly start to spider-web across the dark dome of the sky. She filled her nostrils with the crisp, cool air that one only found in the early hours. She lost herself in the quiet melody of the songbirds outside her window.


But soon, as with every morning, Mae was compelled to rise from bed. She slipped into her kimono and grabbed her katana from beside her pallet. Sliding her door open, she stepped out into the stone courtyard she had grown to hate so much. At the center of the courtyard was an immaculate rock garden. And among the perfectly raked furrows and lonely stones, stood the ancient bonsai.


For generations, Mae's family had watched over this courtyard and the bonsai at its heart. One of each generation was chosen to come to this secluded paradise, deep in the hills of the countryside, far from the reach of any daimyo. It was considered an honor. Indeed, Mae herself had been ecstatic when she was chosen to serve as Watcher of the Garden.


And so it went for some time. Mae took joy in her duties -- raking the rock garden daily, pruning the bonsai, tending the courtyard. But eventually, gradually, she began to understand: This duty was her life, now and until she passed. She began to resent it. The tedium. The pointless work that amounted to nothing. She didn't even know why her family bothered to tend the garden.


Yet, she came to understand that she was now bound to the bonsai. Every morning, she was compelled -- as if a hand physically pulled her from bed to care for it. Though she loathed her duty, she was forced to adhere to it.


This morning was no different. Mae kept her sword on her hip, slipped beneath her obi, as she raked the rock garden with a meticulous eye. But as she carved lines into the sand for the 1051st time, she saw something bizarre out of the corner of her eye. Mae thought for sure she had imagined it at first. A single fruit, round and pink and fresh, hung from the bonsai's branches.


Mae crept toward the bonsai, eyeing it curiously. Had she finally gone mad from the tedium of this place? No bonsai bore fruit -- not even the ancient bonsai.


""Mae,"" came a voice from the bonsai. ""Tatemae, the Watcher of the Garden, come to me.""


""Ancient Bonsai?"" Mae squeaked tentatively. How did it know her full name? How did it speak?


""No, Tatemae,"" said the voice. ""I am Honne, and I am here to free you from your duties.""


Mae jumped when she suddenly saw a branch of the bonsai move. No, it was no branch -- it was a snake! Sinuous and dark, it reared its head to stare at Mae with narrow eyes that held too much thought for such a creature.


""Honne?"" asked Mae, with wonder in her voice. ""You mean to say that my family is letting me leave?""


""No,"" Honne replied, tasting the air with his tongue. ""They do not know that I am here.""


""But it's my duty to tend the garden..."" Tatemae said confusedly. ""I can't just leave.""


""Of course you can, Tatemae,"" cooed Honne, in a sultry voice. ""I can give you the freedom you desire, child. I can help you escape the bonsai's enthrallment.""


Mae held her distance from the bonsai and the snake that slithered in its branches. Honne's offer sounded too good to be true. Freedom from her accursed duty. The chance to live again outside the walls of the courtyard. Could she forsake her family's work for the chance at freedom? Did she dare pass up the opportunity?


""How?"" she asked of the mysterious Honne.


""Come here to me,"" Honne said. ""All you need do is partake of the bonsai's fruit, and all your dreams will be fulfilled.""",SolomonMonroe

[WP] An alien civilization just received our radio and television broadcasts from the 1940's. Now they have come to Earth to liberate us from the Nazis.,notbobby125,"May 7th, 1945: the final breath of humanity's greatest evil. It was on this day, month and year that Nazi Germany had finally fallen to the Allied forces - Berlin was under Soviet control, Western forces were rolling through the Rhineland, and Germany's Fascist ally Italy was wholly defeated.

August 6th - 9th, 1945: the Empire of Japan was forced into submission with two atomic bombs, killing over 200,000 Japanese citizens in the pursuit of a quick and 'painless' Allied victory. The Empire surrendered on September 2nd, 1945, marking the end of World War II.

...

September 2nd, 2045: the 100-year anniversary of the end of World War II. Mankind celebrated 'Democracy's greatest victory' for the entire day, drinking, partying, and mourning the loss of their great-grandparents to the Nazi regime. 

September 3rd, 2045: the skies above Germany are lit up by a flurry of lights and roars. Citizens from all around Germany and its nearby nations stare up in awe at the massive fleet of ships orbiting in the Earth's atmosphere. Hundreds of thousands of tweets, videos, and various other media spread across the web. Central Europe goes dark within a few hours of the fleet's discovery.

September 4th, 2045: Surveillance planes show Germany, the Czech Republic, Poland, mainland Denmark, Belgium, eastern France, Netherlands, Luxembourg, Italy, and Austria as smoldering ruins. There were no survivors.

September 5th, 2045: During an emergency meeting between the world's leaders in an undisclosed location, alien vessels land in the cities of London, Washington D.C, Paris, and Moscow. Tall, red-skinned extraterrestrials attempt to communicate with the local leaders to speak their intentions, but are treated with human hostility. Several alien diplomats are wounded before both American and Russian military personnel are fired upon, wiping out entire squads of soldiers in seconds. A firefight erupts all over Moscow and D.C as more human and alien reinforcements arrive. 

Representatives from London and Paris, initially unaware of the battles occurring in Russia and the States, clear the misunderstanding with the aliens on their purpose, informing them that the Nazi regime was defeated many years ago. The extraterrestrials are horrified when they learn that they killed millions of innocents in the night. 

September 6th, 2045: The battles in Moscow and D.C end following the deployment of experimental aircraft from both countries' space agencies - both multi-purpose fighter variants are capable of defeating the transport crafts of the aliens. 'Enemy' ground forces are rounded up and either killed or taken prisoner. Britain and France attempt to persuade them of the aliens' good nature, but both refute it with the massive civilian casualties of Central Europe. Many countries under both of their spheres of influence align with their ideology, forming a coalition initially by the name of the Anti-Alien Coalition.

This name, however, was stupid, so they re-named it to the United Earth Front.

August 23rd, 2045: tensions between the United Earth Front and the aliens [who call themselves the 'Libratoreas'] had reached a boiling point. Aliens have constantly demanded the release of their prisoners, while both the U.S and Russia have demanded that the Libratoreas hand over the secrets to their weapons and space-travel technology to the United Earth Front. Britain and France have failed to cool the tensions, and only escalated the anger of the UEF by calling the eradication of central Europe a 'honest mistake'. 

Propaganda is seen all over UEF states, calling the Libratoreas monsters and murderers. Many have found it ironic that they came to stop a genocide-happy ideology, only to conduct genocide of entire nations themselves. Rumors have spread fast across the internet, claiming that the United States and Russia have a working prototype for a ship capable of viable space combat. Neither nation has answered these rumors.

December 10th, 2045: the first major incident between the UEF and the Libratoreas took place when the UEF launched 30 ships into the atmosphere from both Russia and the U.S. The Libratoreas took this as a threat and opened fire, destroying more than 10 ships before they could escape and regroup at the moon. Investigations launched by both the aliens and alien sympathizers concluded that the ships were not of military format: they were civilian freighters. The UEF released their plans of making a civilian space port for commerce and trade between humanity and the Libratoreas following the attack. 

The ships that survived were beyond repair and were forced to strand themselves in the orbit of the moon - it'd be another few months at least before any ships could be launched, the UEF claimed, and implored the Libratoreas to fix their wrongs by rescuing the downed ships. The Libratoreas sent multiple rescue ships to pick up the survivors. It was soon discovered that no humans survived the attack. Any that did succumbed to their wounds during the time it took for the Libratoreas to arrive. 

January 1st, 2046: the beginning of the War for Mankind. Libratorea diplomats and personnel all across the world were ambushed by UEF agents and executed, often on live television. Ground-to-orbit guns stationed in non-populated sectors of various countries, such as Siberia and the Mojave desert, opened fire during the executions and brought down several alien frigates before they were able to return fire. The battle lasted a single day and resulted in nearly half a billion human casualties at the cost of the Libratorean fleet. The UEF launched their new prototype frigates into the atmosphere to secure Earth's space from any Libratorean reinforcements following the Battle for Earth.

[WP] An alien civilization just received our radio and television broadcasts from the 1940's. Now they have come to Earth to liberate us from the Nazis.,notbobby125,"""So, yes,"" Steve said, his fingers nervously fidgeting around. ""The Nazis have been long gone, We beat 'em back in mid 40's."" It felt a little awkward to talk about this while standing alongside with his fellow diplomat Hermann, who was from Germany. But Hermann only nodded sharply at his words.

The alien representative, a strange mass of iridescent protrusions and bulbous garbled back something, which a small machine on the table between them smoothly translated into a neutral tone: ""Yes. We accounted for that possibility as well. We have come regardless.""

""Tell me,"" it continued, now glowing a faint green. ""How did you end that war?""

""Eh? We dropped a couple of bombs on Japan,"" Steve replied. 

""So I've researched. Your nation used nuclear weapons against large civilian populations.""

""Well, it was a calculated move,"" Steve argued. ""Much more lives would've been lost if we had kept--""

""Would you say your race is peaceful now?"" it interrupted. The tone was supposed to be neutral, but Steve imagined that there was a little mockery laced into it. ""It seems that there is still great acts of crime being committed by one group of humans onto another in every part of the world, every second of the day...""

""As a whole, yes, we are more peaceful,"" Hermann responded. ""Of course there are still many instances of terror throughout the world, but every day we strive to attain harmony between all.""

""Are you aware, Hermann, that your fellow diplomat is proud to be from a nation that has killed millions of innocents in the past? A nation that performs secretive, underhanded activities even now, encouraging bloodshed in developing countries?""

""Now, just wait a minute...!""

""Germany also has a violent history,"" Hermann said evenly. ""As do many other nations of this world. But as I've said: we are striving to become more than that.""

""Would you agree, Steve of America?"" 

""Yes!"" he almost shouted.

""Well, that is a shame then,"" the alien replied, turning a deep purple. ""Your race had potential...""

""What do you mean?"" Hermann asked suspiciously. ""I do not follow.""

""The whole history of your race is soaked in the blood of your kind and of other inferior creatures. You fought tooth and nail, selfishly trying to take what was not yours, at the expense of others' lives. And sometimes, the violence was completely unjustified - take the Nazi broadcasts, for example. When we listened to them, we marveled at how *senselessly* horrific humans could be.""

""Wait,"" Steve said slowly. ""Marveled? Why would you...""

The alien made a sudden move inward, as if to pull itself together. ""For now, I believe we should adjourn our meeting. I wish to discuss your statements with my superiors."" It made a move toward a silvery pod sitting on the balcony.

""One moment, Sir,"" Hermann urged. ""What do you mean, *marveled*? We were under the assumption you had come to liberate us from the evil of the Nazis...""

""What? My dear diplomats, you have it all wrong,"" the alien replied. Despite the neutral tone, the next words still managed to push shivers down both mens' backs. ""Those broadcasts took many of your decades to reach us; we knew that the original conflict must be over by now. But there were two outcomes we predicted: the Nazis had won and ruled all of humanity, or a stronger entity, a greater violence, rose up and silenced the Nazis and now controlled the world instead.

""Either way, we were eager to meet such a violent, like-minded species and welcome it to our galactic community. Now gentlemen, please: I bid you goodbye. I must return and discuss options with my commanding officers; they are debating what action to take with your kind, and this conversation may do well to inform that decision.""

[WP] An alien civilization just received our radio and television broadcasts from the 1940's. Now they have come to Earth to liberate us from the Nazis.,notbobby125,"We knew Hitler was bad.  Hell, we knew the mother fucker was a tyrant.  History told us that.  Almost everyone who lived through the horror and atrocity of that crooked cross, hand raising, evil son of a bitch was gone when 2016 rolled around.  History would never forget, but we had allowed it to escape daily thought, a legendary myth that was taught in schools.  He was a symbol of humanity's worst, a guardian of our mistakes, a lesson for future generations.  And so, life was as it was, a stage set for a future we didn't expect.

Space was a mystery.  We heard theories almost daily, ramblings that would likely never be proven in the lifetime of those who distributed them.  Were we alone?  Were black holes portals to other universes?  Was this whole thing some bizarre simulation?  Those questions seemed ludicrous to some, taken as divine prophecy by others, but they were unanswerable.  It would have probably been better to leave them unanswered forever, but we weren't given a choice in the matter at all.  We put our propaganda out there, and it became truth to the Stygothian Empire.

Who was the Stygothian Empire?  They were just like us, but advanced by a million years of technology we couldn't even fathom.  They would have never looked at the third rock from our sun, an inhabitable world still in the infancy of the universe's scale of technology, had we not revealed ourselves to them.  As the Nazi Army raged, our propaganda spewed into the universe.  Getting to us was easy for them.  They boarded their ships, loaded their drones, and broke the light speed barrier to get to us the moment they saw Hitler's wrath.  What they found was a world still locked in brutal anarchy.  In their eyes, we were still at war.

The war with Hitler had been over for a long time, but they still saw conflict.  Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Israel were battlefields.  They didn't understand our brand of war.  Hell, they didn't understand our brand of anything.  We were cannibals when we sat down at the dinner table to eat the ruined, cooked carcasses of our planetary inhabitants.  We were monsters when we aimed our guns at terrorists, because killing of any kind was the ultimate sign of desecration.  Ships landed by the thousands.  World leaders were imprisoned overnight, replaced by Stygothian Overlords.  

The eating of flesh and plant was replaced by Stygothian Compounds, a spoonful of goo that satisfied all hunger for nearly a week by replicating inside our bodies, giving us the nutrition we required.  World hunger ended overnight.  They found our health care systems to be as horrible as our governments, and those who claimed to be saviors, taking the D-R before their name were imprisoned, replaced by drones that could heal anything with a simple scan of our bodies.  Life on the blue planet was actually good for a change.  Our core was stabilized by their technology, ending earthquakes, typhoons, and even preventing erratic weather patterns.

Money had no value to the Stygothian Empire.  They did not barter or trade.  If someone desired something, they provided it.  The era of humans working ended, as their drones did everything we could do so much better.  Uniformity became commonplace.  Everyone received a 3000 square foot home, that looked exactly like every other house in the neighborhood.  Everyone had a simple white automobile that drove itself, and took them where they needed to go.  They burned the same compound we ate, producing no pollution.  Equality enveloped our planet, to the delight of some, and the ire of others.

The Stygothian Empire, despite all technological advancements, lacked one piece of humanity--boredom.  Regardless of how many movies came out, how many books were written, and how many computer games were created, we were bored.  We didn't want to simply exist--we wanted to live--we wanted to feel.  They didn't understand our need to taste victory in an unequal world, to best the beasts and consume them, to have a sense of pride in our accomplishments.  Perhaps, if we had developed our world naturally, and created these marvels slowly through the generations, we would have been able to purge those desires from our culture.  Having it all thrust upon us at once did not work.

Rebel bands began to form comprised of those who missed the Earth we had once known, a virtual hell compared to the current utopia.  At one time, rebels were simply soldiers, but these rebels were comprised of scientists, soldiers, doctors, lawyers, and even teachers.  They called themselves the Original Earth Restoration Force--OERF.

OERF grew in popularity as more people turned away from the utopia for the freedom they once enjoyed.  At first the Stygothian Empire tried to stop them through imprisonment, but they simply created martyrs for a growing cause.  The Stygothian Empire wasn't bred for war, hardened to withstand torture, or capable of comprehending the depths of depravity we would sink to for that cause.  OERF's first major victory came at the Stygothian Science Institute, where we took some of their most brilliant citizens hostage.  Within hours, we had tortured them enough to make them our slaves.  They reprogrammed drones, gave us the power to fight an even more horrifying war, and begged for mercy.  We gave them none.

Within days, we were killing them in their homes, murdering them on the streets, and daring them to fight us.  It was like provoking a child on the playground to fight a giant.  While they had the technology to create weapons of war, they simply had no desire to do so.  They had come to save us, but we didn't want to be saved.  Less than a week later, we stood in the streets shouting victory as they loaded their ships and left our planet. OERF seized control of the planet, but within months we were already embroiled in civil war.  Instead of war for oil, we fought for the technology they left behind, each country desperate to harness the power first, to turn it into a weapon of war.

We knew we were not alone, and that knowledge was the worst thing that could have ever happened to us.  We now craved the technology that was out there, making plans to conquer the universe.  We just needed a leader, someone powerful and angry enough to take us there.  The choice was clear, even if we didn't all agree on it.  Scientists, using the technology left behind by the Stygothian Empire, figured out how to harness DNA, to mold it back into a prior form, and then preserve it.  In the year 2025, we resurrected Adolf Hitler and made him an immortal--the immortal leader of Earth.

The Stygothian Empire never saw us coming...",Genetic_Jealousy

"[WP]The Spaceship of Theseus has been travelling through the vastness of the universe. Assimilating both crew and technology into the architecture as it visits planets. No longer the original ship or the original crew, no idea of the original mission. It has landed before you, asking you to join.",scribbles33,"You have been chosen.""

Those four words have remained the most significant of my life. When they first came to me I didnt quite kniw what they meant. Chosen for what? Of course I knew it was to join the crew of Theseus, but what that entailed was a mystery to me. Since Earth had joined the galactic community, going from a small short distance space traveling cibilization into a full fleged galactic power, we have learned much. There were hundreds of other species, well one hundred to be exact, and they all had their own cultures, technologies, and ideas to learn from. One of the first things we learned however, was of the ship that traveled the stars for eternity, Theseus. That was not its only name, we would have to be more than full of ourselves to think this ship was named after a human hero, but Theseus is the name that was given to us. One memeber of every species got to join its crew, and after nearly a hundred years since our emergence, it has come to Earth, for me.
It hadnt happened how I expected. I expected some sort of grand arrival, then a massive celebration to celebrate the choosing. Instead, I had heard those words come to me in the middle of an ordinary day, and before I knew it I opened my eyes aboard the ship, I was now the one hundred and first crew member. When I awoke I was met with one of the other crew members standing before me. She was tall, almost twice my height, and had a very lithe, graceful form, not unlike that of a human's, but thinner, with proportionatly longer legs. Her skin was the color of marble, with light blue veins webbed across her form.

""Welcome to Theseus."" She said to me in surprsingly good Earth Common, with a voice that contained many layers of different tone and pitch. ""You have been chosen."" She said, repeating the words I had heard only minutes before.

From then on I was a full flegded memeber, whatever that meant. Being a crew memeber wasn't totally accurate, we didnt control the ship whatsoever, it seemed to have a mind of its own. We were more akin to passengers, along for the eternal ride through the equally eternal cosmos. While here I had the oppurtunity to meet all of the hundred other sentient species, learning their culture, languages, ideas, and occasionally humpir (which I mostly never got). Describing the ship is a challenge, its construction makes very little sense. At times it seems as if you're inside of a large human cruiser, with metal halls and large windows looking outward, other times you are walking through the curved, warped, green and blue tunnels of the Unanmen. The centerpeice of the ship was, for lack of a better word a world. Not a planet, it doesnt have curvature, yet in every way it feels like one. Even though its all on one ship, the world almost seems infinite, with every possible enviroment and climate, as well of wildlife and fauna. There are places in this world to mimic every homeworld of every crew member. There were also cities, structure, monuments built across the world, each of the style of the crew member who built it. Not too long after I arrived, I was brought to the Earth section of the world, and the first place I was shown in this section was a massive expanse of rolling hills covered in grass, with small groves of oak sprinkled about. Light poured down on the scene from an indeterminate source, bathing it all in golden light. From then on I was a builder, building a world in the style of thise people I represented. I had been chosen as gumanities representative to Theseus, and now I had to show it our best.",johnymyth123

His voice was almost a whisper, as he looked lovingly at the frail old woman lying in bed in front of him.

“Fine.” She snapped, looking past him at the television on the wall, thoroughly invested in the soap opera drama unveiling on the screen. 

He turned to the screen and sighed, far too used to being brushed away. He looked back at his mother, and took a seat by her bed. “Hey Ma, I’ve brought you some cards from the kids, and from Sarah’s family. She’ll be coming to visit soon, I know she misses you.”

“Who?”

He took a deep breath, a flash of pain crossing his face. “Sarah, Ma, Sarah.. your daughter?”

“Daughter? You’re confused young man. I don’t have any children. Why are you even here? Do I know you?”

He blinked back the tears threatening to fall, and reached for his phone. He stepped out of the room as he dialled, listening to it ring, and ring.

“Hey Sarah, I know your probably busy right now… I just wanted to say, you might want to rethink your visit… I know you want to see her and we can talk in detail later, but, I think she’s getting worse.”

He put the phone back in his pocket and sat back down next to his mother

“Oh Johnny, what a pleasant surprise! Oh I haven’t seen you in ages boy! It’s so good to see you, is Sarah coming too?”

He smiled at her, thankful for the brief moment of lucidity, moments that were getting to rare. “Hey Ma, no, Sarah couldn’t make it, but she sent some cards, so did the kids, something to brighten up this place.” Her face lit up

“Oh, they should’t have, that’s so nice!” She started to look around her room before her eyes landed on the dresser. “Johnny, open that drawer… there’s cards in it for her twins birthday, could you pass them to me dear?”

He gladly went to the dresser and retrieved the cards for her, placing them on the table and giving her a pen as well, happy that she’d remembered.

He watched in silence as she wrote, beautiful messages to her oldest grandchildren. She delicately placed them in their envelopes.

“What am I supposed to write on these?”

“Their.. their names Ma” Johnny said, his heart sinking. “Julie and Robert, remember?”

“Julie and Robert, can’t say that I do. Who are they?”

“… Your grandchildren Ma.”

“Grandchildren… huh."" She went back to writing. Thirty seconds later she looked back up at him ""So why are we doing this again?”

"[WP] ""So why are we doing this again?""",seeker12789,"Maz let out a sigh as she sank into her seat in the ship's cockpit. She clicked her seatbelt and started running through the pre-flight checklist, half paying attention as she ran her eyes over the sea of dials on the console in front of her. After casting a sullen glance at her copilot Ana, Maz flipped the ignition and felt the engines roar to life, rumbling and bellowing as the craft began inching upward. As the craft gained momentum and the bottom of the seat strained against her, Maz tried to relax, but she couldn't shake the cloud that had been darkening her mood since the morning. ""Another week on the road"", she said to herself, but lough enough for Ana to hear. ""Another gorgeous week wasted. All for nothing."" Ana knew better than to respond. 

By the time the first meal time came, they'd finished their acceleration sequence and had just crossed the galaxy's boundary. Ana always let Maz brood when she needed to, but as they broke out their food packets, Ana decided she'd had enough. 

""You can't stay pissed this whole trip. We have a lot of ground we gotta cover, and if you think I'm gonna sit here in silence the whole time, you've got another thought coming to you.""

Maz sent back a barely decipherable grunt. 

""Maz, you're being an asshole right now. I'm sorry you don't want to be here, but I don't want to either. It's my spring break too. You think I don't want to be back there with the rest of our friends? We both had plans, we both could have been doing better things, and we both got screwed. So I don't see why you get to play the victim and pout all week.""

Maz gave another one of her signature sighs. ""I hate this damn internship Ana. I hate it. Every day, I drag myself out of bed and haul myself to the lab, and it feels like dragging dead weight. There's no joy in it. It's a waste of my time--and yours too"" she added, looking up. ""I don't get it, our parents told us that going into this line of work was the most exciting most 'fulfilling'""--she made quotes in the air with her fingers--""thing we could do with our lives. Now, we're two terms away from finishing our degrees, and what have we done? Nothing but spent months in this stupid tin can, away from our friends, and after all that time, nothing to show for it.""

At this last assertion, Ana bristled. ""Come on Maz, you know it's too soon to judge our results. That's what farming is all about. You lay something down, you wait, and you don't know for a long time if it's going to sprout or not. You can't hope to be a good farmer without patience.""

""Yeah, but a farmer actually sees *results* every season. She has something to show for her work at the end of the day. If she put her seeds in the ground and nothing ever came up, and she kept doing it again and again, we'd call her insane! Yet here we are, going out every week, scattering our seed into the wind across this entire cluster of galaxies, and we've never had a single result. What,"" Maz pointed her finger accusingly at Ana, ""do you call that, if not insane?"" 

""I call it faithfulness to our mission, and the confidence that master statisticians know what they're talking about. You should have that faith too. Come on,"" she looked up at Maz. ""You were in Cosmology 201 with me. You saw that the probabilities have been worked out. Yes, every seed parcel we eject has an infinitesimally small chance of germinating on the target planet. But if after our crew runs so many missions, and we visit so many planets, and we eject so many seeds--""

""Yeah I know"", Maz interjected, ""we'll end up with a thousandth of a thousandth of a percent chance of actually germinating life on one of these goddamn empty rocks. Fan-fucking-tastic. And then we can all go die or become extinct or whatever they tell us will happen.""

Maz's sarcasm hit Ana like a rancid smell. Ana suddenly realized the extent of Maz's disillusionment. Maz didn't believe the planting was important, which meant apparently, she didn't believe that their mission was important. Did that mean-

""Yes, if that's what you're wondering,"" said Maz, reading her friend's mind. ""I don't give a shit about this mission, or about the Commandment. Passing on Life, so it can exist in another Galaxy after our civilization has run its course--it's a stupid, meaningless exercise. For one, it's bound to fail. Second, even if it did succeed, who gives a shit if some biological material prospers on another rock long after we're dead. It won't be us- it won't even be connected to us. If the elders are so convinced that our kind will inevitably wipe itself out, why not sit back and watch the show? Why not enjoy life?"" Seeing the look of grave concern on Ana's face, Maz pushed on. ""You know what Ana, it's time to say it. I'm sorry to shatter your little perfect snow globe of a reality, but the Commandment is bullshit. And the One who gave the Commandment, never existed. She's about as real as the supposed ""life"" we're planting on these barren rocks. It's all a delusion and I'm sorry that you got sucked into it."" 

The cabin fell silent as Ana turned to the side and fought back tears. Maz, sighing, moved her lips, but changed her mind halfway before saying a word, and got up and stalked off to her sleeping chamber. 

Ana reached around behind her neck and unclipped the chain holding the pendant she wore under her shirt. She took it off and held it in her hands. Pure platinum, given to her by her father, who had been one of the chief elders before he'd passed away. Inscribed on the pendant were the words of the Commandment, the words she'd treasured since she was a child: *Life is your gift. Cherish it, and pass it on so that others may live*. Her father, along with the other elders, had passed this commandment on from generations before, connecting them in an unbroken chain to the One who had given it to their ancestors, millions of years before. Ana had always been taught that in all of the universe's formless void, their home planet was the most precious because it held this gift of life. For Ana, there had been no question that being a planter was the highest calling she could seek in life. For her, there was nothing more fulfilling than to travel the wastelands of the universe, casting the seeds of biological materials where they might land, and harboring the faint, remote hope, that one of them might find a gentle home where it could survive and prosper. The empty galaxies that they hurtled through were hostile, formless voids, but they were also blank slates, and this is why Ana loved to gaze at the stars as they hurtled by: she knew that there was a faint chance that one day, ages into the future, one of them might harbor the gift of life. For Ana, the rewards of such work were so profound, she wasn't bothered by the fact that the results of her work wouldn't be evident until millions of years into the future. She was privileged to be working spreading the gift of life in keeping with the Commandment. This was enough. 

When Ana woke up from her sleeping shift, she wandered into the cabin to tell Maz she could go off her shift. She entered the room to find Maz lolling in her seat, keeping one eye on the navigation console and one eye on a movie projection. 

""We're about to enter the first of our galaxies,"" said Maz in a flat tone. Clearly, the previous night's argument had done nothing to inspire Maz about their work. She looked at Ana, and then back to the console, and sighed. ""It's this same goddamn galaxy we've visited 10 times, 403-TKV, the one you called the Milky Way. It says here on our chart we're supposed to go seed this same arm of the spiral that we've already hit twice. I don't know why those planners want us to go to the same spot again and again. We've already shot our little bacteria capsules at half the stars there."" 

""Yes, but they also think this arm has a lot of promising stars in it. Who knows, maybe one of these planets will be the one that harbors life?""

""Okay Ana, your little idealism is real cute. Now let's just get this bullshit done."" 

The morning passed slowly, as Ana and Maz simply sat and watched the screen as the ship passed through star systems and ejected its cargo, specially prepared capsules of biological material--organisms ranging from simple to complex-- that had been designed to have maximum chances of survival in barren and hostile environments. 

Ana sat with wonderment by the window as she saw the stars flying by. She kept an eye on the console as it gave her details about each one for the 30 seconds that she could see it out the window. She couldn't help but feel a thrill of excitement as she saw old stars, young stars, ones with planets--even one that went by that had 8 planets--and ones without planets. She imagined the life shooting out into the void, lodging itself on a planet or an asteroid or a moon, and eventually growing. Thinking about the possibility of intelligent life emerging eons in the future made her practically glow with excitement. 

Maz, for her part, sat staring listlessly at the ceiling. She couldn't believe how Ana was so wrapped up in her fervent beliefs that she couldn't see they were wasting their time--and on track to be wasting their lives. And yet here they were, every week, every month, and as far on into the future as she could see. She let out a heavy sigh. They'd already wasted so much time on this fool's journey.

“Look, people aren't stagnant. People are gonna change- they're gonna change a lot- and you’re not gonna realize it until one day you wake up and you feel like you can’t recognize anyone anymore.” He looked away, then started again.
“And most of the time you’ll want to hate them for it, but you can’t. You can’t, because while they were busy changing, you were changing too,” he paused. ""And this girl of yours? Don't let her go.""

""I don't want to. I mean, things are fine between us but it just... it just feels so routine, you know? Day after day of the same damn thing and it feels like suddenly she's somebody else just trapped in our life. She'd never say that but I can just tell. Something's different about her now and it seems like there's no point to us anymore. I think we're together now for the sake of familiarity. I'm worried she wants to end it, but I really don't want to have that talk.""

The man looked up at me. ""Son,"" he took another puff. ""I was married to a beautiful woman. I loved her with all my heart, I truly did. But the day I knew it was really over? It wasn't when she caught me with another woman and I slept on the couch for a few weeks. It wasn't after all the arguments about money and work and shattered plates, either. It was when I realized she had given everything she had to make it work between us and then suddenly decided it wasn't worth it anymore. And I remember that conversation clear as day- we were sat down at the table, the same small talk during supper like every other night, when she put down her fork, looked at me, and said 'Why are we doing this again?' 
And that's when I knew it was over, that she was done with our life together. We just had no reason to keep up the charade anymore. So that's how to tell if it's over- when either one of you find yourself asking that question. And to me, it seems like *you* already have.""",NefariousFaerie

Truly ironic, I have few memories left from before I died but the cold kiss of pavement isn't something so easily forgotten. It appears I have my first caller, 

""Uhm... he-hello?"" 

Speech fills my head. 

""Hi there! I'm Samuel! You've contacted the suicide hotline, is there anything I can help you with?"" 

The line goes dead, I see spots in my vision and my fingers begin to twitch. 

Oh god, am I dying again?
My soul snaps back into focus, my vision clears and shakes subside. 

I'm beginning to realize I may only have a few tries to complete whatever task I was given when thrown into this mess. I only wanted it to be easier y'know? For everyone. It's ultimately why I pushed myself off that bridge, I was such a burden to everyone so why not make it easy? 

The phone rings again, cutting through my thoughts. A young girl's voice is what I hear come through the phone. 

""Hi, my name is Samantha. I.... I'm thinking about killing myself."" 

The girl sounds no older than 15, I can hear wind in the background... a sense of dread envelops me. I feel a panic stir inside myself, I never felt something like this when I was alive. An urge to help someone to convince them they are better than what anyone thinks of them. I wish there was someone like that for me...

It hit me then, slowly I felt it. Hope. Hope that I could convince this innocent girl that she was more than the words others threw at her. Convince her, that if she wanted it to be, life is a gift and everyday it can be special. I felt it, this feeling of hope, slowly wash over me. The opportunity not only to help someone but to help myself as well. 

I spoke into the receiver calmly. 

""Hi Samantha, I'm Samuel. Lets talk for a while shall we.""

I was born on the 7th day of the 7th month of the 777th year of our Lady. I am my parents 7th child and the first wizard in 7 generations. My father has told me that when my mother's handmaid pulled me out of my mother's womb, my mother wiz on me as I was pulled out, and then later when they laid me down to sleep, they have found that I have wiz my crib. 

My parents went to see my Grandmother, who was a sorceress, to find the source of my power, was I to be a Magician like my Grandfather or a sorcerer like her? They got their answer. I was proclaimed the first Wizard in 7 generations. They could hardly believe it at first, but in their mind the slightly knew, I am a Wizard and I control the Wiz, I control urination.

When the word got out of what I am, my family's allies celebrated and my family's enemies were filled with fear. I am a wizard, through my powers of urination I distract sorcerers from the source, disrupt magicians' magical spells just by making them wet their robes. I can embarrass the greatest kings and the mightiest warriors by commanding their bladders to release.

Woe to anyone who steps in my path, for they will find that they have wiz their trousers before they raise their sword, nock their arrow or ready their spell !

[WP] A Magician uses magic. A Sorcerer uses the source. You are the first Wizard in 7 generations.,Kancho_Ninja,"It really sucked when I was younger. My older sister Kelly is a Magician. She was enrolled in an elementaly school at age 6 and could fly by the time she was 8 years old. My younger brother, Allen, well he's a Sorcerer so he cast his first spell before he was even born, while still tethered to the source of his life. Then there's me. I'm the dull middle child with the worst arcane proficiency in the entire universe - I'm a Wizard. 

To start with, Wizards are so rare that there isn't even a school for them. Historically, very few wizards survive past age 10 due to their inability to cast spells that early. I'm the first surviving case in my family in seven generations. Hell, the only reason that I've lived this long is because of my siblings protecting me. Kelly protected me right up until she graduated from fly school, and by then Allen was old enough to help. It smarts that Allen can deal with monsters infinitely better than I can when he's only 12 and I'm 17 now. 

Luckily, I'm almost old enough now to finally start working towards my powers. I say ""luckily"", but the arduous tasks I'll have to go through...well. There's two ways to go about it. The first one doesn't sound so bad. Date a bunch of girls, drink alcohol every night, get a job. The hard part of that one comes when, two years later, I'll have to stop drinking entirely and still keep my job. It's apparently better if the girls I date end up being abusive as well. Still, if I can make it through all that I should be able to start casting.

The second way is both boring and dangerous. I'd have to follow the mountain path up to the monastery without being eaten by any of the monsters. Once I'm there, I'd have to join the order of monks. No one is sure how long it would take me to develop powers this way, but Mom says that the more I follow an ascetic path, forsaking all pleasure in favor of bland food, bare nourishment, hard work, and meditation, the faster it should go.

The good news is that theoretically, if I can make it through all of that BS, my arcane powers should keep growing over time. Wizards have the highest potential - Magicians are limited by the constraints of magic, Sorcerers can only be as powerful as their source, but Wizards...Wizards gain their power from wisdom, and wisdom only grows.",Suyefuji

Under one condition...",MightyProJet,"The smoke was still wafting through the air when helen first started surfacing from her rage. The first thing she noticed was that something was different about her reality now. She looked around passively at her new world. The colors were all dull. The black on the mens suits looked worn greyed with time. The fluorescent lights that blinded before was having trouble cutting through the thick air. Even the beautiful bright that brought tears to her eyes as it splattered across the room seemed like puddles of ketchup to her now. She hatred ketchup. Her stomach couldn't handle it. In fact all her life she could never eat fruit because it messed with her digestive system. She dropped her assault rifle with a muffled thud on the floor but kept her pistol. She took one last look at the men who ruined her life and stole her purpose. ""It's ironic"" she thought ""Now that I have my revenge my life is once again meaningless"". She ascended the stair back into the outside world. What she found startled her just a little. It was police with their guns drawn and not the military. ""Have I really killed that many of them?"" She glanced up at the sun bearing down on the hot desert. She couldn't understand why people here complained about it, where she was from was so barren and cold and far more insufferable. She took a deep breath and stepped out ""I surrender, but I have one condition."" Well, what is it the man in charge yelled, gun steadily aimed at her heart. ""Taze me"" she said. ""Like hell, we have you surrounded, put down your gun and surrender"" the officer shouted. With innocent she retorted ""look its really just a thing of pride, if I simply handed myself over I wouldnt be able to live with the shame. or do you want me to start shooting?"" ""Fine Jenkins, taze the bitch."" It all happened in slow motion for her. The man aiming, the shot, the wired needles flying at her. She looked back up at the sun and felt its warm rays seep in through to her body. ""Its lucky they sent cops, the military would have known better. God im gunna miss that sun."" In an instant it was over. The moment the charged needles hit her the chemical reaction started. Helen popped, her corrosive blood flying in every direction, blanketing the officers.

The tall, slender young man cleared his throat and was the first to speak.

""I guess introductions are in order. I am Mathew."" He waved his abacus. ""Champion of Binaria. I can calculate anything.""

The others stared. Next to announce herself was a petite older woman with thick spectacles.

""Katrina, champion of Ramsay. You name it, I can $%$&amp;#@# cook it."" At this, she danced a cleaver across the arthritic knuckles of one hand.

A heavyset bearded fellow in a singlet, shorts and bathrobe pinched finger and thumb against the bridge of his nose, looking green. ""Oh mate, please can you keep it down? My head is killing me. Name's Bleary. Champion of... of..."" he turned quickly aside and vomited noisily. ""of Hyurgggh. Master of all things hangover-related. God help me.""

As one they all turned to look at the remaining member of their group.

She blushed prettily, ducking her head so that her blonde bangs hid her face for a moment. When she looked up her watery blue eyes darted this way and that. She smoothed her milkmaid's costume nervously ""Um, I'm Louise, champion of Dodgy. My bailiwick is out-of-code and otherwise suspect dairy goods.""

There was an uncomfortable silence. It became even more uncomfortable.

""Right,"" said Mathew thoughtfully ""er, listen, Binaria sent me a prophetic dream that we need to save the world, right? So I am sure it'll work, because every time I try and calculate our odds of success it comes out at 100%"" he looked at them all nervously. ""I'm just not sure how exactly.""

""Sorry, I can't even think straight at the moment."" muttered Bleary, scratching his three day growth of whiskers with a trembling hand. ""I've had this hangover since I was initiated, twenty years ago.""

The other three winced in unison.

""How does that work?"" asked Louise uncertainly, breaking the awkward silence. ""I mean, if you have power over everything hangover related, can't you..."" She waved one hand in a vaguely mystical gesture.

Bleary stared at her for a moment, then his eyes widened. ""Holy crap,"" he whispered. With a look of amazement on his face he straightened, eyes suddenly no longer bloodshot, skin no longer waxy. ""You're a genius, you are!""

Katerina rolled her eyes behind her thick lenses and sniggered. ""Now you're going to tell us that all the members of your %$&amp;#$#@ priesthood laughed behind your (#&amp;$%$# back a lot, right?""

""Those bastards!"" grunted Bleary, comprehension dawning ""All this time, and they knew I could have done away with it at will!"" he frowned, then a beatific smile spread over his grizzled features.

""Er, what was that?"" asked Mathew curiously.

""I just gave them all a midnight kebab special,"" chuckled Bleary ""don't think they are finding it as funny now that the shoe's on the other foot.""

Louise giggled ""It took me ages to figure out all the ins and outs of my scope,"" she admitted ""but it's a heck of a lot of fun once you have worked it all out!""

""Truly,"" cackled Katerina, spinning her knife on its tip on the table ""for instance, not only can I make a meal out of %$&amp;*$%$ anything, I can cook up ideas. My ex husband never did figure out how much money I made before the divorce.""

Mathew stared at her ""That's... that's so open ended!"" his eyes widened ""That must be it! That must be how we do it - you 'cook up' a plan involving all of our specialties!""

They stared at each other, then at Katerina, who grinned maliciously and cracked her knobbly knuckles. ""Let's get started!""

Later it became apparent that a precisely calculated number people who were going to vote for Trump in the elections ended up severely hungover due to eating meals containing virulently fermented dairy products which nevertheless tasted delicious enough to be irresistible.

As a result, Trump lost the election and went into seclusion to meditate on how to best use his fortunes to care for the needy and underprivileged of the world. The end of the world was averted.

Needless to say, Binaria, Ramsay, Hyurgggh and Dodgy were very proud of their champions indeed, and the other gods never made fun of them again. But that's another story.",wallyofoz

[WP] Your name is Ian Braddock. And you went brain dead about nine minutes ago.,Potatowolf35,"The world is shaking. 

What happened?

There are men talking, naming medicines, and diagnoses. 

Ow! Shit. There’s a needle in my arm. What’s happening? Where am i?

I remember riding my motorcycle. Was it my street bike or dirt bike? Shit, shit, shit. Why can’t I remember? 

Cold fluid in my veins. That’s unpleasant.

Dirt bike. I was with Sydney. We’re at her parent’s house riding the track on their land. Where is Sydney? What happened?
A door just slammed. And another one. Now we’re moving and there’s sirens. What is happening?

There’s a girl crying. Is that Sydney?

“He was wearing a helmet. He has to be okay!”

A helmet? I remember my helmet smashing. Why did it smash? The wall. The brick wall on edge of the track. Why did I hit the wall? 
David! David was here, too. He hit my back tire, and I ran into the wall. I remember hitting it. How long ago was that? 10 minutes? How long was I out? 

Wait. Why can’t I open my eyes? Am I still out? Shit. This can’t be good.

The men are still talking. They sound serious. I need to tell them I’m okay. Nothing even hurts. 

Woah. There’s a mask on my face, and I can’t talk. Is that because of the mask or am I paralyzed? Fuck. Nothing is moving. MOVE, DAMN IT! SHIT. 

Okay, calm down. Focus on one thing. Open your eyes, Ian. Open. Why won’t they fucking open? No, no, no. This can’t be happening to me. I’m only 17. Come on. OPEN! 

No? Fine. How about a finger? Any finger will do. Pinky? No. Pointer? No. My favorite, the middle finger? No. Fuck.

The doors are open now. Shaking. More people talking. 

I don’t feel so good any more.

________________________________________________

My mom is crying. 

Where am I? What’s going on?

“It’s going to be okay.” That’s my dad. I guess I’m at the hospital now? Did I pass out again? Can you pass out when you can’t do anything?

Someone is holding my hand. I can’t squeeze it back. 

“Mr. and Mrs. Braddock?”

“Yes, sir,” Dad responds. Mom’s crying too hard to talk. It’s okay, Mom.

“The damage to Ian’s brain is quite traumatic and extensive. I am very sorry to have to tell you this, but our tests tell us that Ian is brain dead.”

The sobs from my mom drown out whatever else he says. 

Brain dead? How can I be brain dead? I’m still here! I’m not dead! MOVE, GOD DAMN IT! FUCK! Nothing on this fucking body will move, but I am not dead. Do not pronounce me dead.

The doctor walks out and closes the door. 

“Can I have a minute with him?” I didn’t know David was in here.

“Sure. Come on, sweetheart, let his friends tell him bye, and we’ll come back.”

Mom’s quiet now, but I can tell it’s only because she’s too devastated to continue to make noise. I can still hear her heaving. It’s okay, Mom. The door closes.

“Fuck. Ian, wake up. Come on!” I’ve never seen David cry before, but I can hear it in his voice now. He’s on my right, but someone is still holding my left hand. “I’m so sorry, man. I don’t know what happened. You took the turn tighter than I thought you would, and now I’ve fucking killed you. I’m so sorry!”

“It’s not your fault, David.” Sydney is the person holding my left hand. I should have noticed before that I can smell her hair. I want to squeeze her hand back with everything in me, but my fucking hand won’t move. “Don’t waste time lamenting. Just talk to him for the last time.” I heard her voice break on that last word. She’s trying to be strong. Typical. She always has to be the glue that keeps us together.

“I’m sorry, Ian. I love you, man. You’re my best friend, and I’ll never forget you. I’m so sorry.” He’s sobbing, and I guess he can’t take it anymore because I hear him leave the room.

The bed is shifting. Sydney is laying next to me now. If ever there were a time to be able to move, it’s now. I need to hold her and tell her everything will be alright. I can feel my chest getting wet through the hospital gown. It’s okay, baby.

“I love you. You’re the only man I ever wanted to be with. I love you so much, Ian.” She doesn’t talk any more. She doesn’t need to. She sobs into my chest for a few more minutes until someone knocks on the door, and she jumps out of the bed. Don’t go. “I’m so sorry, Mrs. Braddock.” I hear her hug my mom, and she leaves after squeezing my hand one more time. She doesn’t need to leave. I want her here. Come back!

“My baby boy. How can this be? My baby. Ian, wake up, baby.” She’s shaking me. I wish I could wake up, Mom. Trust me, I’m trying. “No, no, Ian, wake up, please. Damn it. Wake up, Ian!” She’s still shaking me, hard. Finally, she gives up and sprawls across me on the bed, weeping.  “I love you more than words can say, sweetheart. I’m so sorry. I love you so much. You are the best 17 years of my life.” She’s really breaking now. She barely got those last words out.

“Son, you’ve always made your mother and I proud. We love you so much.” Shit, Dad is actually crying. “You’re such a good kid. This isn’t fair. I love you, son. I love you.” I feel his rough hand hold mine. 

The doctor comes in and asks if they’re ready. Ready? Already? No. Fuck. Move. Now. Move, Ian. Anything. Come on. Why won’t anything work? Please, move, now. I’m screaming at my body, but it’s not doing anything. Damn it. I can’t die. I don’t want to die. I’m not ready. Fuck. I haven’t thought about any of this. No, no, no! Oh, God, forgive me, please. Fuck. No, I can’t die. Please don’t kill me. 

I can’t breathe. Please let me keep breathing. It hurts. It hurts so bad. No, no. I love you all so much. I love you all. ",allaboutthatcake

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “Never stood a chance,” said a voice, new and high. A slight cackle rung behind it, a chorus of agreement. 

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “The girl or this pup?” said another, snarkier tone. 

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “Don’t matter, we’ll have the pup now and the girl later,” said a third, lower than the rest.

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “I’ll have none of that,” came another voice, this one familiar. Vidrick’s tone displayed fear, but he continued, “She’s fine, Jimothy.”

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “Vidrick,” said the first of the new voices, apparently Jimothy. “What did I tell you last time we spoke? I told you to keep to your neck of woods and off this path, didn’t I tell him Fredward?”

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “You told him,” echoed the second, snarky, voice belonging to Fredward. “I heard it, right before Bobert snipped his wings.”

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “We certainly made it clear,” said the last, Bobert. “Perhaps he’s in need of a reminder? He still has two legs.”

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Fiera slowly regained her senses at this threat and opened her eyes, looking high for the men speaking. She had somehow been propped against the oak she struck, as her hatchet was still lodged in its roots. There were no men, she scanned the area with haste but found trouble when trying to lift herself. The sharp pain at her side was sated, but still stung when she moved.

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “Dinner seems to be awake,” said the one called Jimothy. Fiera continued to scan high and low, looking for the source of this taunting. 

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “Where are you?” she managed before a cough. “Show yourself, specter.”

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “Specter?” came the snark of Fredward. “She thinks we’re ghosts.” A cackle came from all side, cooing and cawing as glimmering black wings guided three ravens to the previously unnoticed corpse of a naked boy.

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; One of the ravens began to peck at the body, freeing flesh from the wound Fiera inflicted earlier. The form was younger than she expected, and she looked questioningly to Vidrick.

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “He was wolf when you fought,” said Vidrick.

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “Any older and we wouldn’t be having this conversation,” said the largest of the ravens, Jimothy. “Quite the slayer, aren’t you, lass?”

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Fiera scowled at Jimothy and found her feet, bending over at the waist and wincing slightly as she freed her axe from the root. A slight groan escaped either her or the tree, Fiera was unsure of which. She spared a nervous glance at the oak before returning the hatchet to her hip and making her way past the pecking ravens. 

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “I have to go,” she said before gathering Vidrick and placing him on her shoulder once more. “I have to find the witch…”

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “Witch?” crowed Bobert, the smallest of the three. “Which witch would that be?”

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “Which witch?” echoed Fredward with a slight cackle. “There are no witches in these woods.”

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “She could mean Agatha,” mused Jimothy. The raven soared with a slight gust and landed in front of Fiera. “We’ll escort you.”

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “Why…why would you do that?” asked Fiera.

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “I think you’re going to die,” said Jimothy. “And if you die on the journey, best I know where to find my supper. I prefer carcasses to carrion.”

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Jimothy’s companions fluttered to join him and the three ravens made their way down the path. Fiera clutched at her side briefly, and began to follow. She turned to the sprite on her shoulder and asked, “How did you move me to that tree?”

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “That’s a story for another time,” answered Vidrick.

"[WP] Tales tell of the evil Witch of the Elder Wood. They say she does dark, terrible, horrifying things in the deeps of the forest. But none of the tales are true...",SurvivorType,"**born of a collaberation with /u/you-are-lovely**

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; *Ye who enters here take heed, death awaits you in these woods,* the girl read, looking at a tattered old sign tacked to a tree. Below it a second note read, *It will find you, you can’t hide. Beware all those who go inside.*

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; This was painted half-hazard on the bark just beneath the first. A dozen other signs littered the area. They all said varying things along the same lines. Death had fallen on these woods, and death still slumbered there waiting for its next victim.

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Fiera sighed as she took a step past the sign. No one should enter, but she had to. She had to know.
_____________________________________________________________________________________

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; The forest curled upon itself the deeper she went, dimming the day into forced night. The canopies shroud only furthered her discomfort, and tightened her two fingered grip on the simple hatchet strapped to her belt. 

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; She considered, briefly, straying from the worn path and into the tall grasses. The tree-line was almost welcoming, despite the pitch black beyond it. Something about the dirt road left her equally weary and wary, as if she was walking toward something…familiar.

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Her unease was disrupted by the hint of a glow near the roots of a tree to her left. Fiera neared the parcel of light, coming to a crouch and sifting through brush. 

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “Please, don’t hurt me,” came a cry. It was soft, but squeaky at the same time.

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “I’m not here to hurt you,” replied Fiera. Her hands parted the last of the brush, revealing the strange source of the squeals. Among the greenery and mud lay a man, no larger than Fiera’s own fist. He was wholly naked and absent any…defining characteristics, smoothed over where genitalia would be.

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; On his back were two broken wings, their fragile veneer reflected against the strange light emanating from his core. He glowed, there was little other way to describe it. There seemed to be no source, it radiated only from his skin.

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Fiera scooped the sprite, who struggled slightly, into her palm. She rose to her feet and studied the little creature in the palm of her hand, he resembled the fairies and pixies often described in her grandfather’s fables. The pixie gave two soft pats against her palm as he found his footing and began to dust himself off.

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Fiera frowned at the figurine, furrowed he brows, and asked, “What happened to your wings?”

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “Why are you in these woods? Don’t your kind know better?” he asked, pointing to the signs that adorned the path. Every successive tree trunk bore messages akin to the first, but Fiera ignored after the first dozen.

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “I’ll answer your question when you answer mine,” replied Fiera. 

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; The tiny face frowned at her, but said, “I was attacked by a crow.”

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “Does that happen often?”

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “It is your turn to answer,” said the pixie.

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “No, you asked your question in two parts. I chose to delay the second half my question,” said Fiera. 

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “I don’t like you,” frowned the sprite. 

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “You’re not the first to express that, please answer.”

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “It is not uncommon,” he said. 

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “I see,” she said. She raised the pixie to her shoulder, allowing him to climb off and settle in. “I’m here for answers, and my kind often ignore danger when curiosity strikes us.”
___________________________________________________________________________________

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Fiera and her new companion walked for some time, allowing long silences between them. She came to know him as Vidrick, a fairy of this forest- a child of the elder wood. 

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “Odd name for a fairy,” she said. “Stories give your kind softer names, simpler names.” 

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “Human stories,” he scoffed. “Same stories that led you here, after some imagined witch.”

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “They’re not stories,” she insisted. “This place, these woods, have plagued us for decades. I’ve seen the specter walking along its edge, I’ve seen the innards in my dreams…”

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “You think you have some connection to this place,” he snorted. “You humans and your delusions never cease to amuse.”

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “And I thought you sprites were meant to be more…jovial,” frowned Fiera. 

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “Well, you’ve found one answer,” laughed Vidrick. He gave a slight cough and steadied himself by tugging her collar, apparently winded by his joy. “I would ready that axe of yours.”

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “Why?” she asked, but was quickly answered when howls echoed from the night and the brush rustled. Fiera brandished her hatchet and steadied her stance, briefly distracted by the dull reflection of Vidrick’s glow.

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “On the left,” said Vidrick.

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; She swung down hard and leapt to the right, feeling her weapons grip rattle in her hands. A yelp let her know she hit meat, and the sudden iron in the air set her teeth on edge. 

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; As she found ground once more, her right ankle rolled beneath her and forced a yelp of pain. She set her teeth once more and rose with a cogent grunt, using her hatchet’s head as a prop. 

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Her wounded foe rounded and reeled for another bout, but she wasn’t ready. A sharp pain at her side revealed the round to be over before any chance for instinct to drive her arm. 

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “Behind you, on the right!” shouted Vidrick. Fiera gasped and twisted herself around, bringing her hatchet down with vicious intent. 

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; It broke flesh, bone, and found meat and bone again before thundering against an outstretched oak’s root. 

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “Damn humans,” quipped Vidrick. “You can’t sense the world around you, but insist on fighting it!”

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Fiera could not hear him, the blood draining from her side seemed to well in her ears. She drew shorter and shorter breaths, fighting desperately to hold her senses. In the end, she faltered and met the earth with a tender kiss.

"[WP] Tales tell of the evil Witch of the Elder Wood. They say she does dark, terrible, horrifying things in the deeps of the forest. But none of the tales are true...",SurvivorType,"It was a small house, with a grassy roof and a surprisingly solid-looking wooden porch. An unbroken ring of white flowers circled the clearing, standing like a wall of proud-yet-outmatched soldiers facing down the trees of the Elder Wood. Within the ring, a neat garden grew on one side of the house, and a single small tree which, on close inspection, bore both red and green apples almost the size of a child's head. Smoke rose from the chimney, curling off above the trees.

Of course I'd heard the tales of the old witch - what child in the shadow of the Elder Wood hadn't - but after three days of raw, dirty roots and no path at all, I would have traded all my worldly possessions to the Devil himself for just one of those apples. And besides, I was old enough not to believe in witches anymore. Stealing one or two would be simple enough, and I could hide in the trees until nightfall and get my bearings from the stars over the clearing. Seemed easy enough.

Careful not to leave too obvious a trail, I stepped over the ring of flowers and crept across the clearing toward the tree. I passed part of the garden as I went, and I couldn't help but notice how nice it looked. *Definitely just some woodsman,* I thought.

I started to wonder when I reached the apple tree, though. The green apples were actually pears. I'd never seen anything like that before. I reached up to the lowest apple, just over my head, and tugged. It came free easily, perfectly ripe, and I held it under my nose to savor the smell. My stomach rumbled, and I opened my mouth to take a bite. Just one before I grabbed another couple of apples and maybe a pear too and ran back to the woods.

""Some folks would say stealing from a witch is a bad idea.""

I nearly jumped out of my skin.

She laughed from where she leaned out of an open window under the roof. ""You look hungry, though. Go ahead, enjoy. But if you can wait a few minutes, I've got a loaf of bread baking.""

I nodded involuntarily before suspicion set in. ""But... you're a witch. *The* Witch. How do I know you won't...""

She laughed merrily. ""Roast you and eat you? Turn you into something slimy? Sacrifice you to some dark god or demon? My dear girl, I am far too busy for such things."" Her tone changed, suddenly stern and admonishing. ""The most I'll do to you is tell you stories about the wood. Because your momma was right, you know. You shouldn't have come here. But it's not me you should be fearing."" Her head disappeared back into the window, but she reappeared a second later. ""I'll be inside. Go ahead and knock if you want to come in.""

I sat and pondered for a moment. I could cut and run, with only one apple, which was still enough to keep me going for quite a while. I could leave without the apple, which seemed a terrible waste. I could take her up on the offer... My stomach growled again thinking of freshly-baked bread. I stood up and circled around to the front of the house, carefully stepping up onto the porch. It was just as solid as it looked, not even creaking beneath my step. The door itself was carved with vine patterns, with a large wrought-iron knocker. I hesitated for a moment, but then thought of fresh bread again.

I knocked, three times. The knocker was cold to the touch, solid in my hand.

The door swung open and the witch stepped aside, gesturing me in. I stepped across the threshold, struck immediately by the interior.

Every surface was carved or painted with twining patterns. Some were plant-like, some were abstract, but all were eye-catching and beautifully done. The interior was wood, save for the broad cobbled hearth, an oven built into the side. A table with two chairs sat near the hearth, and across the room, a bookshelf held dozens of leather-bound tomes next to a large chair clearly meant for reading. Drying herbs hanging from the beams overhead completed the appearance of homeliness, their spicy scent mingling with the aroma of the bread I'd been promised.

""Well, do sit down,"" my host commanded, gesturing to the table. Without complaint, I obeyed. She sat across from me, and I got a good look at her for the first time. She was old, yes, but the lines of age were mingled with lines of good, honest work. She was dressed in a simple, sleeveless brown dress, her arms tanned and her hands strong and clean. She certainly didn't look capable of the sort of ""...terrible things the stories claim.""

I shook my head, having missed almost everything she'd said. ""I'm sorry, what?""

She laughed. ""I said you look like you doubt I can do all the terrible things the stories claim. It's all right. You're not the first youngster to make it this far, and I don't think you'll be the last. How about that story while we wait for the bread?""

I nodded. I'd come this far, and the door was closed. I might as well see this thing through.

""Once upon a time, to borrow a phrase, there was a village in a forest. The forest was old, far older than the village, of course, and all manner of things lived in it. Some were friendly, some could be bargained with, and some wanted it to themselves, without any humans to muck it up. These sorts of things were many, and they were terrible, but the people of the village were strong and brave, and they did their best to keep them out. It was a hard life, but they managed.

One day, a girl from the village discovered something: A certain herb, when planted near a house, kept the monsters away. It wasn't long before all the houses grew it. But the monsters waited for the dark of the moon, when the herb's power was weakest, and while everyone slept they rampaged through the town and killed some of the villagers, and trampled the flowerbeds. In the morning, everyone shouted at the girl, because her flowers hadn't worked. But she persevered, and realized that none of the monsters had gone near the blacksmith's shop. So she planted iron nails around everyone's houses, and that night the monsters howled and gnashed through the streets, but the people were safe within the circle of iron. And all was good again.

But the monsters waited for the rain, when the nails were washed out of the muddy ground, and while everyone slept they rampaged through the village again. And everyone shouted at the girl again, for her nails hadn't worked. But she noticed that they had avoided one house, and she talked to the old man, and found out that he had burned an ash log that night. So she urged everyone to burn ash logs, and the monsters howled and gnashed their teeth at the edge of the village, but they hated the smoke and wouldn't venture closer. But of course, eventually the villagers couldn't find any more ash wood, so they shouted at the girl again. And she didn't have any more ideas, so in their anger they drove her from the village. But she had a pocket full of nails, and the right dried herb in her satchel, and she spent the night chasing monsters away from the village, but they wouldn't let her back in.""

She rose from her chair and moved to pull the bread from the oven. ""The girl didn't want the villagers hurt, so she stayed nearby, doing what she could to keep away the monsters while she learned more about them. And in the village, the stories got bigger and bigger, until she commanded the monsters to kill whomever she pleased, and the villagers came to call her an evil witch. Eventually, though, the monsters came to fear the village, and the witch's work was done. So she went to live in the forest alone, and write down everything she'd learned, and keep the monsters away from the village.""

The witch set the bread on the table in front of me, then produced a knife and cut a thick slice, which she gave to me with a smile. ""Enjoy."" She cut one for herself, then spoke again.

""It's been a long time, but there's always been a witch in the Elder Wood since, keeping the villages safe. Honestly, it's not so hard anymore. Most of the villagers don't even believe in the monsters. I'm the boogeyman now, which is fine with me. Keeps folk out of the trees, where they're safe.""

I thought for a moment. ""So, why didn't I see any?""

""Well, that's a good question. Are you carrying ague-weed or iron?""

I shook my head.

""Do you carry a staff of ash?""

I shook my head again.

""Well, then you might be a witch too.""

""....*What?*""

She smiled mischievously. ""You don't have potatoes in your ears, do you? I said you might be a witch. The monsters wouldn't be able to tell you from me, and they wouldn't bother me at this moon-phase unless there were a lot of them.""

I sat and blinked stupidly for a moment. ""...How would I know?""

""Well, here's an easy way."" She stood up suddenly and strode across the room, taking down from the doorway a wooden staff with a charm of some sort dangling from the head. She held the staff out to me, and I took it hesitantly, half expecting a clap of thunder, but nothing happened.

""Now,"" she said firmly, ""Picture a candle flame, and feed all your worries to it. Then all your fears. Now all the other distractions, one at a time. Watch them burn. Try again if you lose concentration. It's not easy. Once there's nothing else to feed the flame, let it die, and leave you empty. Nod when you've managed it.""

I stood there leaning on that staff for what felt like an eternity before I managed it, but then elation flooded in at my success and I had to shake my head before I even had the chance to nod.

"[WP] Tales tell of the evil Witch of the Elder Wood. They say she does dark, terrible, horrifying things in the deeps of the forest. But none of the tales are true...",SurvivorType,"*Here, beyond the reach of sunlight.*

In the dying light of a dying summer's day, Valry ran, chased by laughter and footsteps and shadows. 

The fear was a tangible thing, an icy fist wrapped around her neck. Her breaths came harsh and quick, her lungs seizing in her chest, begging for respite, begging for rest. But the footsteps grew closer, and the laughter came louder, drifting on the cool, misty breeze, and so she pushed forward, deeper into the woods. Deeper into the growing darkness.

*Here, outside the realm of good.*

Her foot caught on a gnarled tree root and she pitched forward, landing face first in the damp, mossy soil. She did not cry out. She was aware of pain, but at the same time, she did not feel it, and besides, she was already cut and bruised, what was another wound?

*Here, the ghosts and ghouls will find you.*

She pushed herself up off the ground and stumbled forward, slower this time, though she knew she could not afford to lose what little ground she had gained. Behind her, the shadows loomed. Louder, now, their voices echoing through the ancient trees. Closer.

*Here, within the Elder Wood.*

Valry reached a clearing, nearly the size of the village square, and looked up to see the snow-capped mountains of the Spine looming high above her. Golden light still glinted from the highest peaks, but the sky had already lost the sun, and the stars had begun to waken.

""Valry!"" the shadows called from the woods, their voices lilting with joy in sickly-sweet, singsong tones. ""Valry, where are you?""

*Here, where cursed souls have wandered.*

Valry grit her teeth and started across the clearing, favoring the ankle that was already beginning to swell. She may have broken it, but that didn't matter. If the shadows caught her, a broken ankle would be the least of her worries. 

*Here, where ancient oak has stood.*

She had just reached the center of the clearing when the voices stopped. Silence descended, broken only by the chirp of a very brave, probably cursed, grasshopper. Valry turned in a circle, eyes wide and round, as if that might help her see in the growing darkness.

*Here, the monsters roam the shadows.*

They came from all directions at once, melting out of the trees in unison, utterly silent but for the soft crunch of grass beneath soft, leather boots. Five of them, just like before, tall and broad and smiling like jack'o'the'lanterns.

The largest of them stepped forward.

""There you are, my darlin',"" he said, his voice smooth and thick like honey. ""Been lookin' all over for you.""

*Here, within the Elder Wood.*

""I am not your darling, Warrick Fenn,"" Valry said, hands fisting at her sides. ""I am not your *anything!*""

Warrick gave a sloppy chuckle. Gods, how could he be so drunk, and yet still move so quickly and so quietly?

Valry cursed herself for a fool. She had known what he was from the moment her father had introduced them. Born and bred a hunter, like his bastard father and his bastard brothers.

""Playin' hard to catch, dove?"" he teased. And then he hiccuped. ""Don't make no difference, anyhow. Your da's already said the oath. You'll be mine within the fortnight."" She heard more than saw the smile that came next as he lowered his voice. ""But I don't fancy waitin' that long.""

Valry opened her mouth to curse him, and froze when a sudden, agonized scream tore through the clearing. She spun to face the noise, just in time to see the shadow of one of Warrick's brothers drop to the ground.

*Here, she eats the hearts of demons.*

""Light the torches!"" Warrick roared. Sparks flickered and then fire flared, four brilliant points of light. Warrick's remaining brothers moved to his side, each holding a torch in one hand and a knife in the other.

Warren glared at Valry from within his circle of protective light.

""What have you done, *witch?*"" he spat. ""What evil have you brought down upon us?""

""I have done nothing,"" Valry said.

*Here, she drinks the devil's blood.*

Another scream, and the youngest of Warrick's siblings, Garrick, fell to his knees, clawing at his eyes. Valry backed away further as she watched him writhe in the grass. Blood poured from Garrick's eye sockets, blood mixed with something black that bubbled and hissed like boiling tar. 

The Fenn brothers shouted at one another over Garrick's screams, searching frantically for the source of his injury, but no projectile could be found, and where they touched the black cursed liquid, their skin burned. It was only a matter of moments. The screaming stopped and three big, angry hunstmen turned to face Valry with fear and fury in their eyes.

""I'll kill you!"" Warrick snarled, advancing on her with his blade held high. ""I'll skin you alive and then gut you like a hog, you soulless bitch!""

This time Valry saw something, a small blur moving so fast she had no time to react as it whispered past her and hit Warrick square in the center of his forehead. It exploded, splattering black liquid over his face, where it instantly began to hiss and bubble, as if the liquid itself were angry and hungry, a living thing that needed sustenance.

She watched him fall to his knees, clawing at his own flesh in wordless agony.

Moments later, the two remaining Fenn brothers had disappeared, running full tilt the way they had come.

Valry stood in the darkness and waited for death.

*Here, the evil witch will find you.*

""That was Maywen,"" a voice said from behind her. ""She has excellent aim.""

Valry whimpered. She couldn't help it. She did not want her face to be eaten by a black curse. She did not want to die. She had fought so hard against Warrick and his brothers, she had been beaten and bruised, and still she had fought them, and somehow she had escaped.

Only to die in the woods at the hands of an evil witch.

Light flared, and Valry gasped, blinking at the sudden glow of seven small torches, held by seven figures draped in thick, wool cloaks.

""There is no need to be afraid,"" the voice spoke again. A woman's voice. 

One of the figures pulled back her hood to reveal a lovely woman, perhaps twenty years Valry's senior, whose dark hair was cut short, just below her jaw.

She had kind eyes, and her smile was as gentle as her voice.

""My name is Wenry. I was the wife of a vicar in Lowvale, the village twelve miles South of yours. My husband accused me of witchcraft when I miscarried our firstborn son, and so I ran and sought shelter in the forest, just as you did.""

""Just as we all did,"" another figure said, pulling back her hood to reveal a shock of pale hair and a bright, welcoming smile. ""Wenry is our leader, but she was not the first. Victa says women like us have been doing this for centuries, now, and she'd know. She's brilliant, used to be a healer in one of the great cities beyond the Spine. We protect each other, and help any who seek refuge in our forest."" She stepped forward, and Valry did not back away. ""My name is Calli.""

""You're a witch?"" Valry whispered.

Calli laughed. ""Oh, no, I'm a baker. None of us are witches, not really.""

""But... the black liquid...""

""Oh, that was Victa's concoction. Herbs and some other things, liquids and powders, I don't know their names, all mixed together and sealed in wax. It's quite fascinating to watch her make them."" 

Valry uncurled her hands from the fists they had made. She let her shoulders drop, and suddenly, the pain was there, pounding through her body, as if it had been held back by a dam of fear, and suddenly that dam was gone, and she was flooded with it. She started to fall, and strong hands grabbed her, keeping her upright.

""I think my ankle is broken,"" she whispered.

""Poor thing,"" Calli murmured, putting one of Valry's arms around her shoulders for support. ""Let's get you to the house. Victa has satchets and tinctures that will make you forget all your pain.""

Valry gave a hesitant nod. Beside her, Wenry smiled at Calli, and then turned quiet, kind eyes on Valry.

""It's alright, child. You're safe, now.""

But none of the tales are true...",SurvivorType,"""It's okay,"" the witch encouraged. ""Again. Close your eyes if you need to. Once you've managed it, find the edges of the emptiness, and imagine another flame, but on the other side of that edge. Just a little spark will do.""

I tried again. It felt like it took days this time, but it was faster. The edge of the feeling was surprisingly easy to find, but it popped like a bubble on a stream as soon as I touched it, so I tried again, with my eyes closed. This time, I hovered on the edge of the emptiness, and pictured a flame there, just a little spark.

I heard a gasp, and opened my eyes. There in front of me hovered a tiny, blue-green spark of light, like a firefly. It was only there for a second before the emptiness gave way to my surprise, and then it was gone, but I'd seen it.

""Witchlight,"" my host breathed. She extended a hand, and a larger spark appeared over her palm, hovering steadily. ""I'm Morwen. Would you like to be my apprentice?""

"[WP] Growing up, your father always kept a loaded .44 hidden in every room of your house. Now you understand why.",TheOvershear,"Dad wasn't the perfect father. In fact, he really wasn't that good of a person either. He yelled when he drank, he swore when he yelled and he drank, well, pretty much every day. That's what got him in the end, the drinking. He was well on his way to a sick shade of yellow by the time I learned my primary colors. I remember wondering if he would turn orange when sunburned. I also remember the sting of his hand across my face when I asked. *""Does THAT feel like a sunburn?""*. I guess that's how you answer one question with another. I quickly learned not to be so inquisitive.

This, among other things, attributed to my utter lack of remorse when I got the phone call. Mom had been upset, although I'm not sure why. She used to be inquisitive too. *""Did you drink the rent away again? Who's calling at such a late hour? Are you ever going to fix the breaker box?""*. She had the bruises to show for these. I used to call them question marks.

The phone call wasn't entirely unexpected. He had been in a bad state for a while. 

*""Your father died."".*

Three words of relief for me. Three words of freedom for my mother. She found him at home, splayed cross the basement floor like a drunk worried about falling off the earth. That's probably what he was when he went. Drunk.

*""You're going to have to come home for the will."".*

A will? What the fuck could he have possibly left anyone other than an unpaid bar tab and a bad taste in the mouth? Not one cent is what I was expecting. More than I bargained for is what I got.

A sealed envelope, a list of instructions and a half used box of bullets. This is what I got. A man so cheap, he wouldn't even leave a gun to match the ammunition he gave up over his dead body. Hell, he wouldn't even part with a full pack. I don't even think the bastard gave as much as handshake while he was breathing. 

The instructions were clear, if not a bit unusual. I was to open the envelope at the house. The house I grew up in. My father's house. I was to open it alone. And most curious of all, I was to open after killing the power at the breaker but not before the sun set. Bring the bullets. Odd indeed. But I followed them. To a 'T'. 

With the breaker flipped and an hour to spare before the death of daylight, I cracked the flap of the envelope. Therein contained a letter, a list and the deed to the house. This house. This literal and metaphorical cracked foundation on which he built a disaster of a marriage and raised a wreck of a son. If these wall could talk, they'd probably scream. The kitchen would be as loud and clashing as the paint mom chose to go with the cracked and discolored tile. I could almost hear the four letter words shaking the halls as I started in on the shaky handwritten letter.

*Liam,*

*If you're reading this letter...well...you know. I'm gone. I'm not going to lay out this sad sack of shit apology to you. I know what I did and I've made peace with all of it. What I've done was right. Your mother, God bless her, stuck it through and I hope you see it for what it was too. A duty.*

I guess he really lost it towards the end.

*You shouldn't have much daylight left if you did as you were told. There's a .44 revolver in each room of the house. Take that box of bullets and load them up. Start upstairs and work your way down. Be in the basement by sundown.*

And that was it. A letter fit for a soldier but addressed to a son. An 8 gun salute to the dead, it seems. 

The list was the location for each revolver. Under the sink in the kitchen. Behind the toilet in the upstairs bathroom. Tucked away in the shoe boxes treated like memoirs in the closet of my old room. I sought them out and loaded them all pondering if I had now gone insane as well to go along with this. The eerie creaks and groans of the wood through the silent house didn't help these thoughts and the sun started to cast deceptively sinister shadows as it dipped deeper towards the horizon.

The stairs to the basement were so worn that I could feel the sunken path in the wood from thousands of foot falls. My father must have been in and out of this basement more than the local liquor store. And that's saying something. I carried a candle with me as I could not find a flashlight and the flame lit the basement to a certain degree. Enough to see your way, but definitely not enough to assure you that you're alone. Unsettling.

In the middle of the basement, I came across a table. One sole revolver laid atop it as well as another list. No shaky inscription here. Along the top of the page, in large, bold letters: **RULES**.

**1. Keep all guns loaded from sundown to sun up. It only hunts at night.**

**2. It's drawn to electricity. It doesn't always come, but will if it can feel it.**

**3. It hates the smell of alcohol. Will avoid at all costs.**

**4. Don't let it leave. Ever.**

That's when the ground started to shake. That's when floor opened up. That's when it started to make sense.

That's when I heard my mother.

*""Are you ready?"".*

I'm gonna need the rest of this story.",parishioner
"[WP] Growing up, your father always kept a loaded .44 hidden in every room of your house. Now you understand why.",TheOvershear,"On the best days we would forget about them altogether. 

Forget about the black and the silver that shone like trapped fishes. The smooth grips that always felt warm to the touch, like the soft humming of oak trees. The open mouths that gaped with a darkness we could not fathom despite our childhood fears. The old roulette wheel clack clack clacking slowly. 

And most of all we would forget about the way our father walked through the house every morning and every night, touching them with a fever that was indescribable. He walked with his eyes shiny and his hands raised in prayer, like the many kings who had gone mad before him, and after passing each one his hand would trail in spasms of regret. A god and his apostles, forgotten but waiting.

We lived in the lee of that large and dusty house, my brother and I. We taught ourselves to sleep in its shadows and barter with its creaking bones and speak its endless, unsettled language. Every time the house shifted and wept we would murmur to it in comfort. Every time it plunged in to darkness we would climb downwards with our fingers until they found the switchboard.  

And most of all we knew where the guns were kept. In shoeboxes and shelves, taped under desks and nestled under pillows, beneath the third floorboard or above the medicine cabinet. We knew this because it was the only thing that our father ever insisted on, the only thing he ever tested us on. Instead of bedtime stories we would recite their locations, their make and model, their weight and recoil. Only then could we sleep.

On my twelfth birthday I fired one for the first time. On his twelfth birthday my brother did the same. The violence, the shock, the noise. Standing there blinking like a fool because nothing could have prepared you for what was to come. And far, far away, a paper target fluttering in the wind, tacked to a makeshift scarecrow which we were sure walked around the house as we slept. 

But we never practiced with the guns. That first shot was the last and nothing ever followed. Not until you understand, my father would say. Not until you can see what I see. Beyond these words he did not speak to us much, and for a time we grew up believing him to be a robot in disguise, coded with select responses and incapable of learning.

Soon after my brother's gunday, he began to leave the house on what he called his missions. As the grandfather clock choked the hours in to minutes in to seconds in to whatever lay beyond, we waited. We would sit at the top of the stairs and talk about what grew in the empty kitchen, what lived in the empty attic, what smiled at us in the mirror. 

We talked about this without getting afraid, because at some point both of us had realized that we had treated fear as though a poison, consuming a small amount every day until nothing could scare us anymore. Whatever wanted us would have to try really hard to have us. 

The missions grew longer as the time between them shrank. We would not ask where he came from, with his boots tracking mud and his hands trembling. He carried a duffel bag that clanked as he set it down and weighed as though it contained bricks. My brother once peeked inside and said that it contained more weapons. Maps. Books in strange languages. Pictures of creatures that should not have existed.

The guns in the house - the house guns - would stand sentinel whenever he left, and we would know this because he would make us recite their hiding places before he left and after he returned. Sometimes he would change their position and if we forgot we would go without supper or stand on one leg for hours on end. You are their keepers when I am gone, he would say. You should know this by now.

But he never raised a hand on us. Or his voice. Even when he was upset it was with the gentleness of waves after the storm. 

The police finally caught him in an abandoned shoe factory, tipped off by a passing car that saw a man where there should have been none. Of all places to find the man, they found him in an abandoned shoe factory. 

Once they discovered his cache of weapons, his carvings of unknown words, and his intricate maps of sewers and ley lines and cloud landings, they had no choice but to think him an extremely dangerous individual. This was the line they told me: extremely dangerous individual. As if they did not know what true danger was.

He disappeared under the weight of judicial charges and police beatings, shrinking in his prison cell until there was nothing of him left. He did not understand what he had done wrong and nobody could explain in a language that would work. The robot had ventured too far out of its territory and there was no coming back.

We visited him until the end. But undoing the knot of time takes time itself. As the numerous psychiatrists and childcare professionals and charities and orphanages taught us what the outside world was supposed to look like, our vision of the truth slowly dissolved, and was steadily replaced by another. 

Over time we forgot about our lack of schooling, our filthy clothes, our wasted bodies and the perpetual darkness of our house. Little by little we surrendered to the reality that existed beyond those four walls and little by little the house and its language were left behind. In undoing the lessons of our father we found ourselves at last.

He watched it all happen silently. The only thing he promised us was that we would keep the guns in the house with us. My brother, who had found his voice after long years of silence, screamed and beat the glass and swore that he would never allow a gun in his house as long as he lived. That was not the last time he and my father spoke, but it might as well have been.

So the guns landed up with me. The house came with them, despite my best efforts to sell the damn thing. I buried them in the backyard but I could still sense them. The gospel of steel and thunder had gone, but the prophets remained. Ready and waiting. 

To his grave my father did not speak of what he had waged his war against. The last time we saw him he bent his head against the glass as though a monk before saying goodbye. That was the most serene I had ever seen him. 

He died the next day, in his sleep. We were the only people at his funeral. We threw handfuls of dirt and promised things that we did not mean, both to him and each other. And that was that.

My brother and I drifted after the death of our father, unmoored from the bonds that had kept us wrapped so tightly in the past. He moved to another city, married a woman, raised children of his own. He had a job that paid him well and a family that loved him dearly. He would often lean back and close his eyes in sudden contentment, not realizing how much he looked like our father just then.

I drifted through life. Broken marriages and children that did not wish to see me. A life that could never expand its radius far enough from the large and dusty house with its guns. I looked in the mirror and all I saw smiling back was myself, and that alone filled me with a horror no childhood fable could.

But my father couldn't save us in the end. He tried, but he couldn't.

One of the most curious things about life is how quick we are to explain things. When we talk about broken men doing broken things we can only assume that the demons that live are those inside them, creatures of medulla and Freud. It is with beautiful ignorance that we turn our back on the screaming dark, and perhaps that is why we have survived as long as we have.

At the trial they called my father a man who was unstable, who had diseases that forced him to imagine things. My father stood mute and looked at the ground, and I remembered the shame that I felt on his behalf. All my life I waited for those symptoms to flower and when they did not I felt a fool and a failure, like a patient who is sad at finding no cancer.

But shame is the wrong word, you see? Shame is not what my father felt. He guarded his tongue because he knew better. He guarded his tongue because opening it would make matters worse, and he needed to be around his children for as much as he could.

My father was suppressing laughter.

Shortly before writing this letter I received a call from the police informing me that my brother and his entire family had been murdered. The detective who spoke to me sounded on the verge of nausea, and in the background I could hear the muted curses of technicians and journalists. 

I tried to leave immediately, thinking about flights and money and clothes in a vain effort to bury the grief that had cleaved me in two. But in this paralysis I realized that I had not yet hung up the phone. And the detective had more to say.

We are coming for you, my beloved, he sang. His voice had changed and altered as though from the bottom of a well, and as he spoke the house began to shudder as if expecting a blow. We are coming to take you home.

I must have responded but I do not know what I said. All I could remember is his response, goading and taunting me in a thousand different voices, telling me how the darkness was coming to get its due. And in these voices I recognized all the fears my brother and I had put away, all the times that we had stared so bravely in to the night. All the imagination that we had conquered.

We had not. It had been our father and his silent disciples. A constant, silent war against the minds of his own children.

I am going to dig up the guns now, and place them in shoeboxes and shelves and all the other hidden places. I will do this but leave this letter behind, so that those who may find it may know the sacrifice of my father and the foolishness of his sons. It is my hope that you never have to read it.

May God be with us all. ",dhirajmnair

[IP] A dark man roams a frozen landscape. What's his story? [Practice Artwork],Valen_Celcia,"    A lonely traveler wanders, 

    the wondrous winter wonderland.

    Where he must go,he does not know,

    But still he trudges on, with cane at hand.



He walks on two feet, now three,

carefully above the glacial plain.

Said once he was a magician,

traveling the world to entertain.


    Pulling bunnies out of hats, 

    Awing the crowds with a most wondrous display.

    Introduced their fresh eyes to magic,

    Even though it was only tricks, that were played.


But the court mages were soon furious,

Detecting a fraud with their own eyes.

For they saw neither mana nor force,

Only sleight of hand, Only lies.


    So, they stripped the magician of his power,

    By revealing all of his secrets, displaying all of his lies.

    Destroyed any ounce of credibility,

    Shaming his name, creating doubt in the eyes.


And so, the whole town turned on him,

They kicked him to the ground and stomped on him.

Cracked his ribs and broke his fingers,

Tore up his coat, and beat on him.

Destroyed his hat, then wrung his bunny,

They even stole the last of his money.

And when they were finally done lynching him.

To add salt to his wounds, they banished him.


    Kicked up to his feet, they ushered him,

    To head North, toward the winter's den.

    The heretic had to be purged, for fooling them,

    So they sent him to die slowly as,

    repentance for his sins.


Kicked on and pushed forward, toward the town exit,

Glared on and hated, for his existence.

Supported only by his now raggedy cane,

He trudged on slowly,

 in pain.


    And now he still wanders this winter plain,

    Not knowing when to stop, he trudges on.

    He still hopes one day, 

    one day.

    That he may stop,

     that he may stay,

    That he may find a place to stay.

    A place to stop, 

    A safe place to play.

    A safe haven to entertain.



But until then, he must still walk.

Across this glacial plain must he cross.

Unless he sleeps, 

when he suddenly stops,

""My life is ending"", is but a mere afterthought.

A punishment is what it feels like as I trudge through what I can only describe as a frozen version of hell.  Then again, to me the entire outside world is hell.

I miss the Shelter.  I miss the pristine cleanliness we all diligently work to maintain.  I miss the sense of order.  I miss the contained finiteness that had been the only world I knew until I was forced out into the outside and on this journey.  I miss ceilings.  I cannot count the number of curses I have leveled at the vastness of what my teachers had informed me was called the sky, especially when it threw water or this horrendous freezing powder at me.

Right now, I miss the controlled temperature most.  I had never realized before that the temperature of the air could vary.  As I traversed the land I had burned and froze at various times.

I pulled out the device the Shelter Council had given me, a Geepeess they had called it.  It was to be my guide, my map to Svalbard.  It showed I was nearly there, maybe two days walk more...

The outside has healed, the Council had told me when I asked why we had to leave the Shelter in the first place.  It was time for us to reclaim our world.  More importantly the stores of food our ancestors had laid down were nearly gone, and we would need to start growing crops.  For that we needed seeds, and for some inane reason our illustrious ancestors had decided to store them all in this frozen wasteland rather than leave some in our shelter.

I hope the Seed Bank is actually still there.",Bamboozle_

Disgusting primitive thinking which spreads like an infection, it draws people in like big blobs of sherbet and spits them back out as foam. 

It's much harsher than this icy landscape, and this is a pretty dangerous place. I've been here for seven years, thus far. Some winters I'll fight off blizzards and barely make it out alive. Then during the summer I fight the blizzard raging inside of me, and debate whether I made the right decision. 

Sometimes I wonder how they're doing. My ma, pops, sister. But then I remember they're working humans. They're infected. Just like the rest. 

I tried to tell them, but they don't want to examine our condition. It's all a big mess.

Some things are just more important.

[IP] A dark man roams a frozen landscape. What's his story? [Practice Artwork],Valen_Celcia,"When the sages are old, they walk into the wastelands to die, seeking to end their lives on their own terms. I respected that determination, that utter disdain of death that they would seek it and even welcome it. These were the true wise men of our nation. Not the priests, not the court poets or philosophers, no, it were these fearless men that wandered into the frozen wastelands at the end of the world, seeking nothing but death. I wished I could be like them, as I marched through the snowstorm, my body slowly growing colder and colder. Though death eagerly sought to embrace me, I still fled from it, even as my path lead me evercloser to it. The exile is driven from his home with rocks, the sage is told farewell with a thousand tears, though the end result in this situation would be the same. The sage went north willingly, the exile had nowhere else to go but into the maws of death.

How long had I wandered? The sun never set in this accursed place, so I wasn't sure, but it had been long. I had been given enough rations to survive for a while, but those supplies had been ever dwindling. Why was I bothering with marching on anyway? It would be simple to strip my clothes and lie down, to end it quickly. Indeed, it was the logical choice, compared to marching through a wasteland and suffering for it. Yet, I could not follow that logical choice. Was it weakness? A far too obsessive desire to live? I could not answer that question myself, so I simply kept marching further and further north. Occasionally I would see bears in the distance, who I hunted and ate raw, though they were far too few to provide a regular meal. The cold was unbearable, but I did not allow myself to grow terminally cold, always moving. I like to think there was a fire in my heart that drove me, but is it still a fire if it is merely despair?

Not that that despair was earned though. My desperate and succesful desire to live, it was unearned. In the distance, I could still see her, watching me, even through the snowstorms, though she had reverted to another form of a familiar goddess. Nemesis herself had come to watch my death, and I could feel her glare piercing through my soul, leaving nothing hidden. Perhaps I feared death so, because I feared true judgement so.

When I reached the edge of the land, the eternal sun had set and the eternal night replaced it, pierced by a thousand and one stars. I wondered if this was the farthest any exile had ever come before, as I looked at the endless sea stretching unto the ends of the earth. I looked back and I still saw her, watching silently. How far would I still go before accepting my inevitable death? As I gazed at the endless sea before me and the coast, I promised to myself that I would go to the other end of the earth, if need be to escape. And so, I began walking again.",NotYetRegistered

 The smoke and ash looked so much like snow it was easy to forget, for a moment, that the world had ended.

And he was all that was left.

“This is the way the world ends / Not with a bang but a whimper.""

Who had written that? Some poet, long dead. He was right, the dead poet. The end of the world had happened slowly, in stages. They called it the Sleep: the disease that made people give up. Give up caring, give up living, and in the end--give up breathing. 

It was easy for the first ones. 

The first ones didn’t have to watch the others die.

His wife had been one of the first ones. It had started the day she didn't get out of bed. Didn't go to work. Didn't bother calling in, so he had to do it for her. The Doctor said nothing was wrong with her physically. He'd said she was depressed.

He’d tried talking to her. He’d tried singing to her. He’d tried shaking her.

And the days dragged on, and she refused to eat. She lay: eyes staring at the ceiling. Then her eyes were shut.

By the time he got her to the hospital to be hooked up to an IV, the place was full. And it only got more crowded, until the Sleep hit the doctors and nurses and the whole place was a den of death: men and women in patient gowns, nurse scrubs, doctor's jackets, all lying down where it struck them and staring at the ceiling until their eyes closed.

He took his wife back home. She died there.

He thought it was funny. Funny because he was the one who had always been depressed, his wife always so cheerful, bobbing around the apartment in her red dresses--she always wore red--like a poppy bobbing in the breeze. His poppy, he always called her.

The man had heard the Sleep was painless.

And he wished for it. Anything was better than the pain he felt now.


The man coughed into his sleeve and crawled under a rocky outcropping. He needed respite. He needed a place that could shelter him from the dust and ash, for enough time that he could sleep.

A torn piece of metal rebar nearly stabbed him as he curled up. It wasn't rocks, then. It was pieces of a dead building.

A creak. A moan. The concrete shuddered like a fallen behemoth breathing its last.

He wailed in terror and pushed himself up, his stomach muscles screaming in protest, and dodged to his feet, clear and out of the way. The jutting form of the wall, the little cave he'd been hiding under, collapsed. 

The world, then, denied him shelter.

The world was dying, and it wanted him dead too.

The Sleep didn’t only affect the living. The buildings had disintegrated on their own, like the people. Some of them burned, at first, probably from people who got the Sleep while smoking cigarettes, lighting gas stoves, or tending a fireplace. But after the fires had died off, the other buildings had crumbled into dust and thick white ash. For no clear reason. Dying like the people who'd occupied them.

The trees, the squirrels, even the damned city pigeons were corpses littering the ground, disintegrating into dust faster than should have been possible.

The world didn't care. 

And it was so cold.

He couldn't tell if he was in the city limits still. He'd tried to walk a straight line, get out as far as possible. Maybe something would still be alive in the country.

It'd been a week since he'd raided a grocery store, one of the only ones still standing. Two weeks since he'd seen another living creature. And three weeks since his wife had breathed her last. Three weeks. A month, was all it was, if he was counting the days right.

He'd finished the last of his food and water that morning, thrown the plastic containers on the street where they would become dust as well. It wasn’t worth the effort to carry them. He had no hope of finding more supplies.

And still he kept walking. He had a slender stick to lean on, the only thing that hadn't let him down. He looked down at his filthy hands, grasping the stick, and saw a glint of red on the ground. Red and green, against the silver ash.  Before he could think, he bent down and swept the dust to the side.

It was a page torn from a book, shiny and clean. The page was so slick the dust didn’t stick to it. Tears streamed down his dusty cheeks and he held the page to his chest.

A page from a plant book.

A picture of a poppy. The wind blew, and the paper fluttered in his hand like a heartbeat.

The wind picked up, snatching the page from his hand.  

His wife was dead. No food. No shelter. No water. And now the world itself had mocked  him with the bright book page--the closest thing to life he'd touched for weeks--and then torn it from his hand.  

And then he laughed, the sound surprising him so much that he clamped a hand to his mouth. A memory flashed in his mind:  he remembered a time when his wife held up a drawing she’d done of a bird during her lunch break. A robin.  She loved to draw birds. He’d been picking her up from work, and they were almost to the car when the wind had grabbed the drawing from her hand as she held it up. The wind flung the drawing across the parking lot--and she'd let out a little squeal and started sprinting after it. And he ran after her. They ran, giggling and hearts racing, until he stepped on the edge of the paper, caught it, and handed it back to her. And his wife had hugged him, then, and she’d been so warm.

The memory flickered inside of him with the heat of a candle. Warmth.

He could still see the poppy flower page, flying through the air among the flakes of dust and ash, dancing like a leaf. It was too far away to catch, and moving too quickly. But even so, he turned his head, adjusted his hood, and followed.

He’d never catch the page. He was too tired. Too slow. But it didn’t matter.

A good case of pushing a thought further than most people do. Like, technically we all think it makes good sense to put the Seed Bank in a frozen wasteland, for preservation purposes. But it never occurred to me that means our ancestors will have to go on a ice-cold vision quest to retrieve it.

It didn't bother him, maybe it never had. He had always been numb. What was the word the others had used? Disconnected. Lonely. Alone. He had. He had to have been.

All it ever did was snow.

Was he still under the same sky as everyone else? Had he crossed into someplace different? Was he alive at all? He remembered, just a little. If he remembered he had to still be alive. He hadn't heard his heartbeat. He hadn't heard his breath. He hadn't heard a thing above the howl. Not for a long time. Or for as long as he had remembered.

All it ever did was snow.

It was blurry. Barely even. It held onto the fringes of his mind. The reason. There had to be a reason. An affirmation? A promise? A punishment? A failure? A conviction? A rationalization? It must exist. Somewhere in his mind. Because he had forgotten.

All it ever did was snow.

All of it. None of it. Some of it. Some times or never. Slips and shards. Of perception, maybe even memory?

All it ever did was snow.

Cold. Hungry. Days. Years. Even centuries?

All it ever did was snow.

And that was all that mattered.

1. Maybe some formatting changes, a few more spaces and paragraphs. I got lost a couple times as to who was speaking. It helps to space your characters sentences out, but that's just one option.


2. Might use a few more conjunctions and the like. I.e. &gt;The whole camp seemed to circle one big fire, with other fires lighting the camp surroundings.

[IP] The Mountain of Frozen Dragon,blakester731,"”Utachi mai’a ka’kara...” an old woman explained in front of me. She was old, face wrinkled by the years that she’d seen. She was wearing the regions traditional leather-linen mix of clothing, she barely kept her eyes open as she explained to me the stories of her people. She was considered their most sacred person, the village memory, Mai’akata they called her. “Par tai’catchi kenn…” She continued. 

I turned to face my translator. He was a more modernized man, wearing a utility travel suit, a brimmed hat, and a traditional necklace made of hawk feathers and bones. He began translating the old woman’s words. “Long ago, before we rode horses to the horizon…” He took a deep—silent—breath and listened to the woman’s words that came agonizingly slow. “A fire lit the sky, night of the sun, they called it. The fire shook the earth, rocks rained to the village…”

“Tari, ash pa mekk.” the old woman finished with a firm gaze, and I turned to my translator in anticipation.
“When they dared come out, a new mountain had rose, one that spit fire to the skies for many seasons. This my ancestors saw, this my ancestors told me.” the translator finished with a deep breath.

“How long have your people rode horses, Tayaka?” I asked my translator. While I was an expert archeologist, I was the first to seek answers to the legend of the frozen dragon. The story had spread like wildfire, a story in which a dragon landed on a mountain to keep its treasures away from human hands. Of course that only encouraged me, after all I was the one who uncovered the secrets of southern ghosts. Mere illusions caused by an old defense mechanism, mushrooms growing in a heated went. The vapors would have gotten me had I not used a trick I learned from a 400 hundred year old doctor—he was dead, naturally.

“For thousands of years. Our people were the ones who rode them west and gave them new lands in which to prosper.”

The western men, I knew, rode horses over 2500 years ago, that means: “So the mountain was formed some three thousand years ago?”

“More like four thousand.” He said in a whisper as not to disrespect the old—probably deaf—woman. 

“Mai’a jompa ott’a. Kara pri.”

“She’s asking us to follow.” Tayaka said. The old woman’s legs trembled beneath her weight and I feared she might fall, but she masterfully steadied herself with a long staff. The staff was wooden and very highly decorated with feathers and bones, the tip was unusual though. Unlike normal staves, this had a spear-like tip on it, clearly meant to be used as a weapon if needed.

We made our way outside, into the embracing breeze. The day was still young and the camp buzzed with life. Children played between tents, only two of which were larger than the ones we were in, all colored slightly different. Men walked horses past the camp, gathering and leaving supplies. If there were differences between our people, I had to say it wasn’t the skin color or clothing, it was the fact that they still carried swords, even women whom were guarding the children. My people in the west had left the idea of swords behind in favor of gunpowder weapons, they were much easier to use. I just had to be impressed that nomadic ways were still alive. Most of the world left that way behind long ago, but here it was, fresh air and empty surroundings, apart from a few forests and hills in the distance. Indeed the land of horses. 
“Tau’a’aka.” The old woman pointed with her staff at a distant mountain range. From here I saw a few tall mountains, ones that penetrated the clouds themselves. It was a fair distance away, three days by horse, I calculated.

“The mountain of the frozen dragon.” Tayaka said.

“What.” I asked. I was completely lost in thought.

“She said that’s where we’ll find it. It’s a valley that once had much food, a river rides into the mountain the dragon sleeps, that’s where we need to go.”

“Do they go there often?” I asked the old woman, Tayaka telling her my meaning. 

“Mai’a’kata immai’kata.” The old woman said. I recognized the word pray from the midst.

“The Mai’a’kata pray there…” He was cut off.

“Sam, ai’a’ka, Reila jompa kars’ra...” the woman continues.

”She says her time has come. She asks us to deliver the new Mai’a’kata to the dragon, there she will learn their past.”

I bowed to her softly as an answer. It was a respected mission to accompany a Mai’a’kata, even more so on their pilgrimage. 

“She asks us to stay for a feast on her honor.” Tayaka said. “There she will say the last words for the new Mai’a’kata before sending her on her pilgrimage.

“We gladly accept, we could do with a good night rest.” Tayaka quickly translated and we returned to the tent.


The night was one to be remembered. The whole camp seemed to circle one big fire, other fires lit the camp surroundings. I was sitting with Tayaka on the honorary seat by the tribe master, Hoya. My expeditions other members, three students from the academy I work at, and two soldiers to protect me, sat on the far side, talking to one another and some of the tribesmen whom knew English. A bottle circled the fire, strong brew of something I don’t want to figure out. Every time it landed on one of us, the crowd would silence and laugh as we troubled to swallow. There were even stage fights, a man would challenge another and fight until first blood. This allowed me to study their swordsmanship, their swords curved and meant to be used from horseback, clashed against each other violently. The men were stiff on the ground, they seemed to be more agile on horseback than on their feet—lifetime of riding to blame. The fights often grew into yelling matches and ended swiftly as the other charged, only to trip on the entrance.

The party buzzed on, the moon had risen far, and a soft movement quieted the crowd. The old woman—villages Mai’a’kata—rose to her feet. The movement was slow and unsteady, but everyone seemed to hold their breath. Beside me, Hoya rose to his feet as well, swiftly considering his height. He was a head taller than most of the other men in the tribe. A young woman followed suit, her hair was ashen black, dirty and wild from her lifestyle. A beautiful hairpiece of feathers hung from her side. She wore a similar necklace to that of Tayaka, but it had no bone, instead it had small stones carved into tiny horses. 

Tayaka scooted closer to me. I was too stunned to notice, as I watched the young woman carry herself past me. She was short, but her legs were thick, everywhere else she’d be considered an oddity, but here she was stunning. “She’s the tribe master’s daughter, Reila, the new Mai’a’kata.” Tayaka said in my ear quietly as not to disturb anyone. I swallowed twice and returned to the world.

The old woman began to speak, her words were quick, as if she was a young woman again herself. Tayaka softly translated to me. “This is Reila, my follower, your guardian of memory.” He listened again. “She will now ride to her pilgrimage, she will now ride to the land of our ancestors and read their memories. Those she will carry for us.” She silenced. The crowd was silent, heads high, not even the horses dared to make a sound. Tayaka continued. “Take this.” The old woman handed her staff to Reila, the young woman stiff in her movements as she accepted it, pulling it close to her chest. “May our ancestors ride with you and protect our memories.” Tayaka finished in line with her. The two women bowed and the crowd rose to cries of joy.",SRoFIN

Satan stared at me, arms crossed, ""Yeah, I know, but..there's this other guy and he's kind of a big deal, so his soul is a tad bit better looking than yours.""

""Wait, you're breaking our contractually signed agreement just because there's another soul God kno-""

""Don't bring him into this,"" he said, pointing at me.

""Sorry, but it's the truth. It's untainted! I've done no harm to anything or anyone! I do the max amount of donations at the stores when they ask, for crying out loud. What soul could possibly be better than mine at this time? Come on. Tell me.""

I waited as Satan collected his thoughts. He seems to struggle to tell me who the other soul was. He spawned a chair from the ground which left smoldering ash and a smell of brimstone in the air and sat down and crossed his legs.

""Zach Braff.""

""Like..Seriously? He punched a kid in the stomach once, remember?""

Satan laughed and shrugged, ""Yeah, that's my morning routine so it's no biggie. Don't spray paint someone's Porche. Duh.""

""But why?""

He rolled his eyes and leaned forward, ""Because it was a part of the show. You practically said it yourself.""

I started to become frustrated and pulled up a chair myself, sitting directly in front of him, ""No, no, no. Why does want to sell his soul to you and why is his more precious than mine?""

""Well that's obvious. He wants to bring Scrubs back to its former glory,"" he said as he leaned back, getting comfortable. ""Oh, and because it's Zach ‘Mothafuckin’ Braff. If I get him, I obviously get Donald Faison, too. Best Hell ever if you ask me.""

""So let me get this straight. You're breaking OUR contract just you can enjoy a personal Scrubs show in Hell?""

He put his arms around behind his head, ""That's correct.""

""Well according to your contract in section H6.6E.FU.6, you are unable to break the contractual obligation as it puts undue burden on the person selling said soul.""

""True, but per section B0.0B.66, the issuer of the contract, which is me, obviously, can terminate said contract without notice to pursue other interested parties as they see fit. So if you'll excuse me, I've got a mock hospital to prepare in Hell.""

""You will not get away with this that easy. You will take my soul.""

""Probably not,"" he said while flames arose around and the chair, soon disappearing.

Three weeks later in Hell, Satan heard a knock on his door. He quickly ran to it, hoping not to miss it, ""I swear if that's you again Stalin with another Knock Knock joke I'm going to send you to lava pits.""


He opens the door and it's a simple dressed man with a messenger bag.

""Are you Lucifer or Sa-tan?""

""It's Satan, but yes, that's me.""

The man pulls an envelope from his bag and hands it to Satan before walking off, ""You've been served.""

Well I think I just did that with my big come-back tour...

I'll be honest, I should have kept a closer eye on things. I just figured Dad would tell me that things weren't going well. Sure I was busy living it up, it's pretty easy to coast when you're the son of the boss. By the time I realized that religion was on it's way out, it was already too late. I guess I should have noticed from the dwindling lines at the pearly gates. Still, I just assumed I could turn things around. Surely the return of Jesus would be enough to bring back the believers? 

The first thing I noticed were the bright lights. Every surface is a screen now. You can't look anywhere without seeing an ad for something. I am scanned by all manner of cameras and offered discount prices on sandals and hand lotion. 

I find myself a nice busy street and loudly announce my return, but not a single person stops. They just keep walking, staring into nothing and talking to themselves. No-one even makes eye contact. 

Fine, I guess I'll just have to break out the big guns. I stop a passerby and ask for his bottle of water. He reluctantly hands it over and I shout as loud as I can, ""watch as I turn this water into wine!"" I wave my hands and the liquid turns a deep shade of crimson. I wait for the applause, but none comes. The guy grabs his bottle back, ""whats the matter with you, it's nine in the morning!"" He grabs the bottle back and taps it with his phone, ""Nano transform, H20."" The liquid becomes clear again and he takes a swig before going on his way. 

Ok, so it's going to take a little more to impress these folks. I find a fountain and casually stroll out into the center of it on top of the water. Eventually someone notices and comes to talk to me. Finally! The first sheep for my flock. He leans in closer and says, ""Oy mate, no hover boots in the fountain, it upsets the plankton.""
I can't help myself, ""Don't you know who I am? I am your savior Jesus Christ. I died and have been reborn!""
""Good for you, glad those cortex backups are working out for you. Now can you get out of the fountain?""
""You must believe me! I am here to help you get to heaven.""
""Heaven? Never heard of it. Is it south of the river?""

I give up. I clamber out of the fountain and throw my sandals in the nearest trash receptacle. This world is beyond saving. 

I'm about to climb the holy staircase when something occurs to me. I'm a nobody here. I can do whatever I like, without fear of judgement or those darn angels reporting back to the boss. Perhaps it's time to finally check out those deadly sins everyone is always harping on about...",VerbalCA

In the time of “Great Star-Ruler” Herod, after Jesus 2.0 was assembled in the intergalactic space station “Lehem” orbiting the planet of “Beth” in the fifth star formation of Judea, wise men from the eastern planets traveled to the notorious station of Salem on the moon of Jeru, asking, “where is the cyborg who has been assembled to rule the sacred J-E-Ws (Justified-Entities-Worlds)? For we observed and tested his components powers and we came to pay him homage. When the “Great Star-Ruler” Herod and the people of “Salem” station heard of it they were frightened. They called together all the chief scientists and cyborg experts of the station, he inquiried of them to find where this new “Messiah” model cyborg was assembled. They told him, in the space station of “Lehem”; for so it has been written in the manufacture logs:

--Manufacture Log 777, last updated by adminastartor “P.R.O.P.H.E.T”---

“And you, station “Lehem”, in the star formation of “Judea”,
are by no means least among the rulers of the universe;
for from you shall come a ruler who will fly the spaceship “Shepherd” and guide the people of the universe”

Then the “Great Star-Ruler” Herod secretly called for the wise men (from the eastern planets) and learned from them the specification list and components of the cyborg. Then he sent them to station “Lehem”, saying, “Go and search diligently for the this new cyborg; and when you have found him, bring me word so that I may also go and pay him homage”. When they heard the Star-Ruler, they set out on their space-voyage, and there ahead of them, where once stood the station of “Lehem” now stood a fleet led by the ship called “Shepherd” and they were overwhelmed with joy. On entering the “Shepherd”, they saw the cyborg with his programer Mary and they knelt down and paid him homage. Then they brought their cargo ships, they offered him gifts from across the universe. And in there computer-analyze they were told not to return to “Great Star-Ruler” Herod, so they left for their own planets by another inter-space road.

And then Jesus Christ, blonde and blue-eyed, wearing a three-piece suit and a bow tie, comes down from the heavens, armed with a flame thrower, inexplicably made in China, starts cleansing fuckin' everything, starting with Liberia, ending with Vanuatu, everyone puzzled as to why their offering of goat entrails have done nothing to assuage the wrath of this proud, strangely-dressed, Aryan deity. 

Suddenly, in the midst of the burninating, a giant demon-like... demon, arose from its slumber within the magma chamber of a dormant Yellowstone Supervolcano- It was Satan! Satan was confronted by Jesus Christ, and the two have a philosophical conversation about the entire state of the world, while they play chess, which they have procured from the charred remains of a young, female Californian hiker who went to Yellowstone to ""find herself"" and thought bringing a chess set and playing chess with herself in her tent was somehow quirky and endearing, not obnoxious and off-putting. 

Jesus Christ is a natural winner, and so he naturally won against Satan in their chess game, even after Satan cheated by re-arranging the pieces while distracting Jesus Christ. But Satan was a classy loser, if his own tasteful but rebellious attire was anything to go by; and so, he gracefully allowed himself to be apprehended by members of Jesus' angelic entourage, and thrown down some bottomless pit in Siberia, tied with the unbreakable chains, forged in Heaven for the sole purpose of keeping Satan locked up, forever. 

Wearied by his purging of the filthy sinners of the Earth, it came to Jesus' attention that some time last Thursday before the Apocalypse, a group of white, Anglo-Saxon Protestants who only used the King James Bible, had built a nice house in the event that Jesus Christ should return to establish his eternal kingdom. Among smoldering ashes of Connecticut, Jesus finally settles down with the 10 remaining white, protestant Americans in a nice colonial manor called ""New Jerusalem"" where they have a cocktail party. For all eternity.

He grumbled a bit and then flipped over, only to find that a mirror on the opposite side of the room was reflecting the light precisely onto his eyes again.

Normally, he'd be impressed by the astronomical odds of such an event, but at 3 in the morning, it was merely an annoyance. Irritated and tired, he threw off the bed sheets to get up and yell at his neighbor for being such an inconvenience to a hard working and honest man.

""Damn Johnsons... outdated as fuck reactor shielding... blow up the whole damn biosphere... 'd show them..."" he muttered as he yanked the front door open and stormed out onto the sidewalk.

The light was considerably brighter outside, and it was soon obvious that the Johnson's outdated as fuck reactor shielding was not responsible for it. Indeed, Eric was stunned when he noticed the true source of light.

A man, clad in flowing white robes that shone with an incredible brilliance, was levitating above the street. His eyes were closed and his expression exuded a calmness that showed the man thought that everything was right with the world. He slowly descended to the ground, and when his bare feet touched the soft grass, he opened his eyes and raised his arms.

""Behold, for I am come again, as was foretold in the days of old. I am the one who calmed the seas, who raised the dead, the breaker of nations, the Lamb of God, the King of Kings. I am the son of Yahweh, and demons tremble at my approach. Today is the-""

""Can you shut the light off? It's pissing me off, and I have to wake up early tomorrow for work."" Eric turned and started to walk back inside.

Jesus was stunned for a moment. ""Wait!"" 

Eric didn't turn around. ""What is it? I'd very much like to go back to sleep, you know.

The light became even more powerful, and Eric thought he heard a fanfare of some sort mixed in with some sort of choir of voices.

""Is not the world rejoicing at my return? Today is the day that Yahweh brings the world back into his-""

""Who the fuck is Yahweh? How do you even spell that?""

""...Yahweh, the creator of the universe, lord above all? Y-H-W-H?""

""Never heard of him. Can I go to sleep now?""

""How are you not impressed by this display of majesty? The last time this happened, the shepherds were terrified!""

Eric frowned. ""I don't know who Shepherd is either, but he must be incredibly dimwitted to be impressed by some nut with a nucleobulb and some hidden speakers.""

The light and the fanfare stopped. Jesus walked toward Eric with a questioning look on his face. ""You don't know anything about shepherds or god? What's been happening the last 2468 years? Have you never heard the name Jesus Christ?""

Eric scrunched up his face in an effort to remember. ""No... not particularly. Wait, was he the fella what caused all those people to kill each other for no reason hundreds of years ago?""

""Killing? Heaven forbid! I expressly told my disciples to teach and follow a path of peace, love, and kindness! Any man who killed in my name is no true Christi-""

""Yeah, I remember now! Back in the day, there were a bunch of idiots with guns shooting each other up because some of them believed in this Hollah guy and the rest believed in some big poobah that they just called god. Not very creative of them if you ask me. Hell, back in high school, my history teacher told me that they whacked each other with metal sticks even before then. So barbaric.""

His wrinkles looked like they grew in the desert, although they belonged on the seas. He was the oldest in the village, and in the neighbouring villages. There was not another man as old as he was. He would stand on the cliff overlooking the broken fjords and stare into the horizon, leaning with his coarse hands on a rugged walking stick.
***
""He lost his mind long ago"", the villagers would say. ""He only mumbles about death and destruction and how the stars will align"". Indeed, nobody had been speaking to him for many years. Nobody, except her.   
""How do the stars look like up close?"" she would ask, gazing at the first blue dot in the dusk sky. ""Do you love your mother?"" he would question. The little girl would nod: ""I love her the most in the world! As much as this!"", and she would stretch her slender arms as wide as she could. And then hot tears would start pouring down her ivory cheeks, kindling the embers on her peppered face. ""You should rejoice"", the old man would mutter without even flinching, ""this broken world is no place to be in"". ""Why!?"" she would scream as loud as her lungs would grant her, ""Why did my mommy leave me?! I want her to come back! I don't care if the world is bad! I want her to come back and live forever!"" The old man, unfazed by the child bowing with heartache would keep mumbling: ""They are beautiful. The stars. They are unforgiving. They live. They die.”  
***
""The sea is restless again"", her red lips would murmur against the gale of the storms rising over the metropolitan skylines in the distance. ""It talks to the stars"", the man would mutter, ""It knows of their pain, and it tells me"". ""Claire"", he would say, glancing at her slender figure, ""Do you want to see the stars?"" Before her puzzling look could pierce him, he would add: ""Their agony is calling. Their agony is calling the sea. The world is broken, I must leave"". ""What are you saying, old man! Your age is getting the best of you” she would say, turning around, her breast puffing in laughter. “And if you leave, how will you ever watch the beloved drift of waves?” she added.

Is that bad?” The morning twilight brushed the boy’s puffed, tan cheeks. Before he could answer, the man skimmed his hand through his dark hair and added: “Without death, there is no point to birth. Would you like to not have been born?” “No, I like to live. I like to eat fish, and I like to see the sea” “So do I” the man smiled. “I also like that star. Why do you always look at it?

"[CW] Weave a tale around a single line: ""Where i go, the sea follows.""",sanethrower1,"Everything is different at sea. The very definition of this Earth is brought into question. For the sea is a world all its own. The air inhaled by the fisherman is a different air entirely than the air that the farmer breathes. The pull of gravity is a completely different force than that felt on the firm Earth’s ground. One holds a different weight entirely at sea, and it quickly becomes apparent. Things begin to hold a different importance. After one has been sailing for a matter of months or even just weeks there is a shift. It is unmistakable. For, society does not exist at sea. The economy, the monotony of the 9 to 5, the bills, the expectations, the greed, the poverty, the politics, the wars, the religion, the anger, the suffering, the grief. All of it fades, it fades right into the horizon, slowly at first, until it is completely out of view. And without those destructive, stress-making matters weighing on you... life itself becomes something different. Everything holds a different weight. It is hard to describe the feeling when this shift occurs but I imagine its similar to that of being in space for the first time, to experiencing a new perspective altogether, a new world almost. The truly beautiful gift of the sea that creates this fundamental shift is freedom. The sea is free from all of it, from the daily struggles that the people of the land bind themselves to. And once one is on the sea long enough they can authentically feel the full  magnitude of this gift. It was that very feeling that made returning home so unimaginable.
	I have been sailing my entire life, ever since I was a little girl. My home is the sea, but my house with four walls and a roof resides in a little town on the coast of Oregon. That is where I grew up, its where I learned how to make sense of things, where I came into being a person who holds opinions and beliefs. My life in Oregon formed me into the person that I am today and my family there helped to shape who I am. Although that is something I would not trade for the world, I will not be returning to the same place that I left three years ago. It is not Oregon itself that will be different, but the way that I perceive it will be something completely new to me. It is difficult to envision going back to a place where all the struggles of daily life are so evident. And that is because people wear them not only on their sleeves but on their faces, as sort of masks to disguise themselves, to keep themselves from becoming too familiar with one another. To become your struggles and your sufferings, to wear your heartache proudly, to let the misery consume you, it happens all too easily when that is all you are surrounded by. It’s not like that on the sea. I wake up and see clear skies and I smile. I wake up and I see storm clouds in every direction and I smile. I wake up and see nothing but the stiff embrace of fog and I smile. I smile because I woke up. I smile because I lived to see another day. Although no diseases plague me and no immediate dangers threaten me, the gift of living another day on this Earth is immeasurable. A gift that the people of the land take for granted. Because although not all of them are ill or in danger, they are all plagued. Plagued by the harsh realities of their reality. Plagued by the death they see on the news each and every day. Plagued by the bills they have no money to compensate for. Just plagued by the weight. The sheer weight of their world. The gravity that makes even the lightest of tasks feel heavy. Until their daily routine feels so very tiresome that they do not smile to wake up. That is the world I am returning to. 
        I only hope that I can keep the feeling so close to my heart that it never fades, that it stays with me, day to day, so that as gravity weighs down my neighbors I may still yet feel weightless. So that even as I stand on stiff ground I may feel as though I am floating. And I hope that I may be so lucky as to carry that feeling around with me each day. And maybe even spread it to the people around me. So that every day I continue to wake up with a smile on my face. And maybe spread that smile to those people wearing their masks of sufferings. And maybe one day the whole world will feel it, maybe someday everyone will see. Maybe some day in the distant future the suffering will stop. Whether that could happen or not, it is a hope that I will hold onto, so as to bring the world that much closer to it. Who knows.. this world is a spectacular place, and the beauty of life will never cease to surprise even the most cynical of thinkers. No matter what happens I’ll always know the sea is with me. For, where I go.. the sea follows.",jcfederico

So bright and unusual, so completely different than any other part of the universe. You would have liked it.

I snuck off to our old hideaway and watched the stars like we used to while everyone was celebrating last night, huddled into the corner of the observation deck. A few of our old friends mentioned you, with solemn looks on their faces.
I told them that you wouldn't have wanted them to be that way, but you know how it is.

I'm not strong, Dierdra.

It all still feels just as sharp as if it were only yesterday; and the memories of you, just as warm. Those memories which I carry with me, not allowing myself to forget, that feel almost a burden now. All this time and no matter how magical or 
passive a fleeting thought of you might be, I always find myself drifting back to that moment. 

I can't help but remember that you were peaceful, just like you too, always being the strong one. Even as you let go, you didn't shed a single tear. I watched you almost enjoy that feeling, of letting go, as the cold void of space swallowed your smile. 

As I write this, I think it had something to do with your faith; I know I gave you a hard time whenever you would try to teach me about it, telling me how you 'leaned on it for strength' but I think tha6t somehow, it had prepared you. Readied you for letting go.

I made it here for you, because you couldn't. But I wonder if you already have.

It's too hard to stay here without you anymore, but I'm afraid of that dark void; afraid of what waits for me beyond the cold depths of space, and the unforgiving tides of time. I don't have your faith to lean on, Dierdra,

How I wish I could go back. To see the faces of my family, to hear the laughter of my friends. To remember what it was like to be alive. 

I died 3000 years ago. I let myself be seduced by magic, and I gave up my mortal body to ascend to lichdom. I have lived longer than any man in history, and I have died a thousand deaths. I have become a legend, a monster whispered about in tales older than any empire. 

I tried to go home once. All I found was ash and bones. And so I rebuilt it. But soon enough it was taken from me again. 

I found my kin, descendants of my siblings. I took them in, protected them from the horrors of the world. But after a few centuries, the last of them died, leaving me alone once more.

That is, before everyone around me blew up. 

I woke up at eight. Got out of bed. Brushed my teeth. I showered; dressed. Khakis and a red shirt. Grabbing my keys and wallet, I walked out of the door. Starting the car required a bit of effort, but otherwise I was on autopilot all morning. 

Nine to five office jobs aren't exactly inspiring, but they pay the bills. I'm an insurance agent. Greeting the security guard outside the office building, I walked in and sat at my desk. 

""Hey, Jake.""

I turned, spinning my office chair around. A woman was standing there. 

""Hi, can I help you with something?"" I said, flashing a friendly smile.

She smiled. Somehow, it was unnerving. 

""Jake, brace yourself.""

Suddenly, the drab office building exploded, bright light flashing and white noise buzzing in my ears. The blast knocked me out of my chair, slamming me against a wall. Somehow, I was still conscious.

I looked up. The woman was standing over me, smiling.

Thunder cracked, rumbling through the darkness. The light provided by the flashes of nature were scarce more than enough to see the landscape. Mud sucked at her feet, threatening to tear away her shoes, cold seeping through the worn leathers. Numbness crept up calves, rain splashing into the already sodden ground.


There was shelter ahead, she thought. 


Behind her, somewhere, lay her staff in pieces, finely crafted wood shattered to pieces when the focusing gem had shattered. Her heavy cloak (something that had once protected her), lay not too much further away, torn beyond any repair.
The wind pulled at her hair, at her remaining garments. Leather and cotton held little more protection than being completely bare-skinned in nature’s fury.


Another step found her tumbling to the ground, mud splashing and soaking what little had not already been touched by the downpour. Where she had been numbed by the cold, the jarring landing shook awake her nerves, shook awake the pain again. 


Teeth bare in agony, fingers clawing for any kind of grip in the slippery mass beneath her. She would gasp for air, only to lose it all again in a hoarse wail, feet scrabbling to push her back up.


Her leg was bleeding again; it was *warm* against her cold skin. A reminder that should she not find that shelter she was so sure she’d seen, she would *die*.


The lightning flashed again, almost blinding, striking down on one of the remaining trees, twisted and mangled as they were.
Violet eyes squinted, mud covered arm coming up to shield her eyes as the lightning strikes again, and again, choosing new targets. She would not die here.


She could not. She was not ready to die yet. She refused to die. There was so much more she wanted to experience. So much more out in the world. She was only just an adult, and this was how she was going to die? Alone, stranded in the middle of the haunted marshes?


No. She refused.


She may as well be barefoot as she forces her steps, one, two, three, one after another. There was no need to count them, only ensure she kept going.


Again, the mage fell, slipping in the mud (really, it was less mud and more water, now). She could summon no fire, create no barrier… but she could will herself to stand again. She did.


Even as her legs buckle again, she refused to let herself die here.  She refused to die.




That was all there was to it.


And when morning came, perhaps, a venturing scout would find a petite woman huddled, almost completely still, within a cave. Almost.

"[WP] She shielded her eyes, and refused to die.",JimBobBoBubba,"Hazel eyes scanned across the once barren rock and sand, now coated in congealing blood, dead bodies and the flaming remains of the small hovel that had once been set here. The carrion birds, huge pink headed vultures and black crows, flew low over the remnants of the two great hosts. The remnants of the Remusian Legion and the Pizarite Warhost lay scattered across the field, silver and brass now both the brown of dust and the dark red of congealed blood.

He could still feel the three rounds buried in his gut, the last act of a dying Pizarite Temple-Guardsman. They had been coated in blood, their brass armour rent across the chest by a great blow, yet they had still lived. Tellius had thought them dead, but they raised their pistol when he came close. His shield had been lowered, and the burst had punched through the thinner plating on his abdomen. He had fought on for a few minutes more, as was expected of a Remusian soldier, but he had fallen to the ground after blasting a Pizarite Redeemer away with a salvo of hand-cannon rounds. 

Now Tellius lay dying, forgotten by his fellows in their rush to drive the Pizarites from their lands. He could still see them, so far in the distance, dust rising from behind their tanks and booted feet. He bet Pellios still marched with them, and Garrion, his fellow legionnaires, but he had marched his last here. He had fought like a madman, slamming magazines into his hand cannon even as his life's-blood poured from him. 

He felt tired, so tired. He let his eyes drift shut, felt the great abyss opening up before him...

Then he heard a cry.

It was faint, but it was there. A declaration of shock or fear, he couldn't quite tell which. Possibly both. The voice was feminine, the pitch too high to be a man. He heard it again, the cry longer this time, more drawn out. There were words this time, definitely, but he didn't recognize them. The language was almost sing-song, but spoken quickly. Pizarite, then. Tellius knew he had no more rounds in his hand cannon. 

He turned his head towards the noise, and he saw the source. It was a woman, that was certain, but it was the uniform she wore that cited a gasp of shock from Tellius. The silvery-gray armour and blue fabric of a Pizarite Avenger. Her twin blades lay nearby, one broken in two while the other was notched and dented. Both were coated in blood, as was she. There was a wicked cut across her face, leaving a gouge in the bridge of her nose and her eyes covered in blood. 

She was gasping in terror, unable to move her right arm, it being pinned beneath a fallen Remusian Legionnaire. Her left was desperately rubbing at her face, trying to clear her eyes. Tellius lurched forwards, rising to his feet and beginning to stagger towards her . Her hand darted towards the hilt of the blade to her right. The broken blade, but it was still sharp. He had no idea what she was doing with it, until she raised it to her own throat. 

""Don't!"" Tellius called in Common Tradesman, his voice far weaker than he expected.

The blade fell from her fingers, and she turned towards his voice. The cut was worse than he thought, deep and long. She was likely blind.

""Who...?"" Her voice was weak as his, now speaking Common Tradesman as well. ""Who are you?""

""Legionnaire Tellius of the Remusian Eighth Legion."" He said, closer now. ""Third son of Senator-""

His legs gave out suddenly, and he slammed into the dirt face first. He could taste the metallic tang of blood in the packed dust, and he spat. 

""Where... I can't..."" She was panicking again. Tellius began crawling on his belly, gasping at the pain it caused him. 

He pulled himself over the corpse of his fallen fellow that pinned her arm to the ground, collapsing to the ground in front of her. She kicked at him, and he rolled away. 

""Stop!"" He cried again, voice still weak. ""I'm not here to hurt you!""

She looked to where he would be, ceasing her kicking and letting him crawl beside her.

""As I said before, my... *cough*... name is Tellius, of Remus. What is yours?"" He asked, once he was beside her.

""I am Tallia of Pizar... second-born of Bishop Hadinn."" She replied, calmer now. ""I''m sorry I can't look at you, but my eyes...""

Tellius reached towards his belt, finding the clean white cloth he would typically use to clean his hand cannon. It was freshly washed of oil before the battle, and would serve the purpose he intended for it.

""Hold still, I think I can help."" He said, reaching over to her face with the cloth. 

She was deathly still as he worked to clean the wound, his grip almost failing twice, before he managed to clean the wound and some of the blood. She blinked rapidly, and realized she could now see.

""I... my eyes..."" She reached towards her face, before looking over to the stranger who had helped her. He was deathly pale, and his eyes were alight with pain, but he was smiling slightly. ""Thank you, Tellius of Remus.

""You're... *cough*... welcome."" His arms fell by his side. ""Listen, I... I'm done for. you... you Pizarites praise your god, I know, but I need someone to say the words over me...""

She managed to pull her arm free from beneath the Remusian who had landed on it, before turning towards him. 

""What are the words?"" She asked. 

He whispered the words to her, and she repeated them as he lay on the rock and sand, grasping his hand in hers. He smiled as he closed his eyes one last time.

""Thank... you..."" He muttered, before falling silent.

Tallia rose from her knees, looking over the wastes. The sun was blinding, but she shielded her eyes and began walking towards her homeland. She had been given a second chance, and she refused to let it go to waste. She refused to die.

[WP] The unforgiven samurai.,JimBobBoBubba,"The atmosphere inside the courtroom was grim, the faces of both courtier and bushi hidden behind masks of duty. Lanterns hung on hooks burned bright behind their paper screens, bathing the room in a golden glow. Behind the dais hung the brown and white banner depicting the proud but elegant *mon* of the Stag Clan with its crown of antlers and leaping grace. A few samurai wore colors other than that of the Stag, the purple of the Unicorn and green and gold of the Dragon predominately. A lone emissary in the colors of the Ox Clan stood close to the throne as evidence of the shared history between the two Minor Clans. 

Seated on the throne was a grizzled warrior, his dark hair streaked with grey and his face a mass of scars and wrinkles. He wore a kimono of dark brown silk, the Blades of the Moonless Riders thrust through the *obi* of his robes. Behind him was on a simple stand was his armor, the helm decorated with a massive set of antlers taken from a truly impressive stag. The veteran warrior flicked his gaze over to his *karo*, his second, who announced loudly and clear so as to travel across the courtroom. 

""Let Kira Shinji step forth!""

The flicker of fans was like the sound of a hundred knives being drawn, the whispered words murmured behind their paper folds rising as rumor passed between courtiers. 

The Shōji screen opposite of the throne slide open with barely a hiss, a hidden guard waiting outside to close it once more. Waiting was a young samurai, his hair cut short and his waist naked of sword. He wore more white than brown, the former being the color of death and mourning in Rokugan. He stepped forwards, his feet loudly sounding on the tatami mats that made up the floor. Halting some ten paces before the throne he threw himself down upon the mats and bowed, head touching the floor. 

""Hail the Lord of the Stag! Master of the Moonless Riders and of Reinan Province! Hail the First Kira!""

Lord Kira, founding daimyo of the Stag Clan and once-ronin frowned, his gaze fixed on the young samurai who still knelt with bowed head.

""Kira Shinji, you have dishonored my name...""

The murmurs among the gathered rose once more but were just as quickly silenced by the Daimyo's *karo's* withering glare.

""You took part in a duel to the death, one unsanctioned by neither I nor your opponent's lord. The fact that you slew your opponent does nothing to change the fact. Now I have the Ikoma crying for blood, and war threatens to destroy us... all because of you.""

Shinji said nothing, a wise decision. His lord continued. 

""You made a request to commit honorable suicide, to wipe the shame of dishonor from our name. Your request is denied. The Stag are too few to waste on such gestures no matter how earnest. Likewise I will not cast you aside as ronin. I instead have an assignment for you. Rise.""

Shinji did as instructed, his eyes firmly fixed the banner hanging behind his lord's throne. 

""You are banished from Stag lands indefinitely. You will take the Ki-Rin's Path and journey to the Colonies with a few tasked servants. There you will dwell until called to return. Do not expect to be summoned.""

A servant came forwards with a pair of swords, Kira Shinji's own. Wordlessly he accepted them and fixed them through his belt, bowing once more to his lord in shame. The Lord Kira made a dismissive gesture.

""Now go, and contemplate your fate. May the Fortunes watch over you, my son."" ",LovableCoward
"[WP]Your father is the 30 day killer, a prolific serial killer that kills every 30 days. Unfortunately he is extremely sick and wont be better for a while. To keep the heat off of him, he needs you to kill someone in 1 weeks time.",JohnnyCrusade,"Dear Father,

I hope that this letter finds you in privacy and away from any others' eyes.

By the time you read this, all will be well. If I have failed, then I will have been detained as the 30 day killer, giving you freedom to either stop or continue in another month.

If you do continue, they may call you my copy cat (ha, funny isn't it, when it is I who was trying to copy you?), but please don't act rash or hasty from that. You've kept to a meticulous plan and schedule. If you must keep it, please keep it as you always have, calm and clear. You don't need to prove your pride to anyone.

If you decide to stop, which is what I truly wish for, then please redirect your obsession and effort towards mother and making her happy again. In my absence, it will be her that suffers the most, more so than however much pain you may feel. She does not know a thing of this and she is capable of loving you as a normal human being. Please cherish her.

We have always known that this day would come. You are only human and your calling ask for much more than what one man can endure. Perhaps that is why you confided in me, put your trust in me, hoping that I would be your savior one day.

You have shown me (much to my chagrin) who you are...what you are. At first, I was shocked and distant. But as years have gone on, I came to accept that whatever you choose to do, whatever path you go down, you are still my father. To me, you have shown nothing but love and trust. Perhaps even enough to outweigh all the lives you have taken.

So time, I am going to save you as you have asked. You have shown me all the tools and methods before. They have been burnt into my mind. I will be capable of setting things as if you had set them up yourself. Everyone will believe that it was the 30 day killer who did the killing. As long as you stay in the hospital, you will also have a perfect alibi.

There is a week left now, so I must start getting things prepared. I'm sorry that I won't be able to visit you anymore, but I'm afraid seeing you may weaken my resolve.

I will succeed father...Dad. I will save you. Please, let this be the last victim of the 30 day killer. Let me be your last victim. Live a normal, happy life with mum. Go on holidays, see the world. Let the obsessions die and please, go live your life.

I love you dad. I have loved you in life, and I will love you in the afterlife.

Please be happy.

Good bye,

"[WP] Some supervillains have an exotic, dangerous pet to cultivate an air of supervillain-ness. Then there’s you and your capybara.",LordFirebeard,"“The Supervillains Union does not take these matters likely, Mister…Killdemon was it? Interesting name.”

“That’s correct, sir. It’s my mother’s maiden name. Is there an issue with my application?”

Killdemon tugs at his ill-fitted collar and looks around the room. He shifts nervously in his seat. This wasn’t what he anticipated at all. When he applied to the Supervillains Union, he pictured a shadowy cabal and a secret ritual to induct him into the society. Instead, he was in the presence of a rather plain looking man in a rather plain looking office. The nameplate on the desk read Baron Von Struckheimer, but the man sitting across from him looked less like a legendary supervillain and more like a mid-level manager at any accounting firm.  The only giveaway that Killdemon was in the right place was Von Struckheimer’s trademark mechanical hand.

“I assure you, Mr. Von Struckheimer, I am applying in earnest. I would never do anything to besmirch the name of the Supervillians Union. It’s been my dream to join ever since I was little.”

“Your resume is impressive. Your references checked out.  But one thing sticks out to me.”

“And that would be?”

“Under Section 6, Animal Companions, you listed one Cuddles the Capybara.”

“And?”

“You don’t see anything wrong with that?”

“I’ve had Cuddles since I was young, he was with me at my first robbery and I intend for him to be with me at my last.”

“Listen, kid. Back when I was active in the field, I had a pet of my own. Boa Constrictor. Meaner than any henchman I’ve ever worked with. He struck fear into the hearts of my enemies and allies alike. It’s important for supervillians to be feared and our companions are often key to perpetuating that image. I just don’t see a capybara having that effect.”

“Sir, with all do respect. I wouldn’t be half as successful as I am without Cuddles. Here, I brought him with me.”

Von Struckheimer leans over his desk to inspect the crate next to Killdemon. Inside Cuddles is cheerfully nibbling on his food. He has an eye patch over one eye and a fake scar done in marker over the other. Killdemon removes Cuddles from the crate and hands him to Von Struckheimer. Bewildered, Von Struckheimer takes the rodent.
“He’s very cute, Mr. Killdemon, but I don’t think he fits our image. Wait a second…”

Von Struckheimer catches a glimpse of what Cuddles is chewing on.

“Is that a finger?”

“Fingers are his favorite. I don’t even know where he gets them. Sometimes I’ll come home at night and there are ones I’ve never seen before. I’d give him back before he finishes it.”

Von Struckheimer quickly hands Cuddles back to Killdemon. Killdemon flips Cuddles over and starts giving him a belly rub. Von Struckheimer takes out a pen and makes a few marks on Killdemon’s application before handing it back to Killdemon.

“Congratulations, kid, welcome to the Supervillains Union. Report back here first thing Monday morning. And could you please send in my secretary on your way out?”

“Thank you, sir, you won’t regret this!”

Killdemon excitedly leaves the office. Shortly after, Von Struckheimer’s secretary enters.

“You called, sir?”

“In all my years on the job, I’ve never been one to lose my nerves.”

He holds up his mechanical hand. The index finger is missing.

“But, that is the most terrifying creature I’ve ever seen.”

""Never mind that, Professor Ratus. What about...""

""Ah yes. You are intrigued by my pet.""

I rose from my seat, majestically, and slithered towards the tied-up Agent 007, my faithful Jeremy at my side. Jeremy was a capybara, the king of rodents, the most fitting creature for one such as myself. All my life, I had been ridiculed and abused for my name, Ratus. An infortunate trick of genetics had also given me large front teeth and enormous ears, making the insults doubly hurtful.

But alas, there he was; Zinco, my pet capybara. Not just any pet, but my minion of sorts. He was utterly useless when it came to committing crimes. I will however admit he made a great companion all the other times, like going nose deep in a tub of pistachio ice cream.
He was gifted to me as a child by my naive and well.. senile grandmother. She thought the damn thing was a komodo dragon. All the other kids made fun of me throughout my years at school. With their tigers, and sharks, and what have you. Truth be told, I wasn't exactly the most popular kid before getting Zinco, but it's nice to have someone to blame. 
My poor sweet grandmother never understood, namely because she never believed me when I said what I had was essentially an overgrown rat. She did do her best look after me since my parents died. No need for tears, it comes with the territory. Or should I say *terror-tory* haha, I crack myself up. No but really, I was sad. But so goes the life of being a villain. 
Finally here I am at university, and not a damn thing has changed. I even tried to toughen up little Zinco any way I could. I tried to file his teeth so they were sharper, which lasted all of three seconds before he took a nice chomp at my hand. I tried feeding him meat and making him into a carnivore which just lead to me uhh.. cleaning up more.. I even once put a luchador mask on him! He just bumped into *everything* on account that he couldn't see properly. He's hopeless, so much so I've reconsidered naming him that. Even ""Hopeless"" sounds more intimidating than Zinco. Suits him though.",allwafflesnochicken
"[WP] Some supervillains have an exotic, dangerous pet to cultivate an air of supervillain-ness. Then there’s you and your capybara.",LordFirebeard,"“Sure, you think you know happened what happened before I traded in my white lab coat for formal black, but you don't. 

For one thing you never knew that in addition to the homeless, she cared about other things, like animals. Now what would the sweetest, kindest, gentlest person in the world take care of as a pet? Ha ha, trick question! She would've taken care of any animal in need of love and affection and a place to call home. Her cousin though, bought her a capybara. 

After I'd finally gotten up the nerve to actually talk to her... Okay, you know that's a lie, she was the one who first actually broke the interaction barrier. Anyway, after we finally started talking, meeting up at the laundromat to hang out while we did our weekly laundry, she told me about 'Barry.' Ughh, naming a capybara 'Barry' is utterly lacking in imagination and totally status-quo... but she did it, and so it was perfect.

The night… The night she died… The night that hammerhead-asshole killed her… The night I killed her... I left City Hall in search of a giant guinea pig. I knew that, even in death, she would still be worried about Barry being taken care of. 

Now I'm in the Super Villain big leagues, and you hazard to repudiate my choice of pets?! Well, I'll tell you what, you flat-headed excuse for a superhero's sidekick... You are going to tell me where Hammer is... Or you're going to experience something Horrible.”

"[WP]Three scared demons huddle together around a fire, telling each other about their experiences at the lowest level of hell.",Miss_pechorat,"Dannil sat cooling his hands beside the fire, trying to forget the things he’d seen down below. 

“You’ve been awfully quiet tonight, Dannil.” Kerich noted. “Anything you’d like to talk about?”

Dannil raised one of his inky black eyebrows at Kerich. “Me? What about Fayer? He’s barely come out of his wings since we got back up here.”

They both glanced over at Fayer and shared a concerned look. “Fayer,” Kerich began, “Maybe you should come a bit closer to the fire. Cool your wings? You’ll feel better.”

Fayer didn’t answer, still rocking back and forth as though soothing himself. His eyes were half-lidded and unseeing. He had obviously been through the worst of it.

Dannil sighed and turned back to the fire, watching the flames lick towards the cavern’s ceiling playfully. The flames down there hadn’t been this friendly. He shut his eyes for a moment, trying to banish the memories suddenly flooding his mind. Kerich watched him, concerned.

“What did you see down there?” Kerich’s gentle question was a welcome distraction from the vivid images invading Dannil’s mind. Perhaps talking about it would help. 

Dannil closed his eyes and breathed in deeply, bracing himself. “We were supposed to deliver the message and leave. It wasn’t supposed to end up like that. We weren’t supposed to be separated.”

Kerich nodded. It had taken them all by surprise when a Greater Demon approached them and made his demands. They couldn’t refuse.

Dannil went on. “After you were taken, he brought me to the Pools.”

Kerich’s mouth popped open, exposing hundreds of needle-sharp teeth. The Pools were the invention of the the Devil himself, created to hold the souls of truly terrible humans. There were hundreds of these pools, some as large as oceans, others large enough to contain only one unlucky soul. Evil permeated those rocks and seeped into everything around it. It was hot here where those damned souls commingled with each other. Millions of angry spirits bounced against one another, each one searching for the way out, each one disgusted with the souls it had to fight through. Their endless friction produced heat that was unbearable for a lesser demon like Dannil. Kerich was surprised Dannil was doing as well as he seemed.

Dannil looked down at his red scaly feet and continued. “They told me they needed more pools. They made me dig. One of them pushed me into a pool, just because they thought it’d be funny.”
He closed his eyes against the screams and the pain he had felt when he’d fallen in. He wasn’t sure if he could ever forget those few seconds. “One of the Greater Demons dragged me out in short time, but it was enough. I don’t know how those souls survive in the pools. I felt as though I’d be torn apart if I stayed in much longer.” Dannil shuddered. “I wasn’t much use to them after that. They sent me back here when they realized.”

Kerich reached out a three-fingered hand to Dannil and rested it on his shoulder. “You survived the Pools, Dannil. That’s no small thing. You know that’s how we lost Jeytal and Derro.”

Dannil brushed off Kerich’s hand. “Survived? I got lucky. Part of me thinks it would have been luckier to be dead than to live with these memories.” As he spoke, he heard voices in his mind that did not belong to him. He ignored them.

“The Pools? That’s it?” Fayer said in disbelief. His wings relaxed slightly, revealing a smooth expanse of belly covered in pockmarks. 

Kerich eyed Fayer’s fresh wounds. It almost looked as though… but no, they would never send a Lesser there. A Lesser wouldn’t survive there. Unless…

“How were you marked, Fayer?” Dannil demanded. He was standing now, spikes growing from his arms and chest. Kerich had never seen Dannil’s spikes before. They were meant for defense. Did he really believe Fayer had seen them?

Kerich put a hand between spikes on Dannil’s arm. “Sit. Let Fayer tell us what happened.”

Dannil did not look away from Fayer, but he did ease back down to sit beside Kerich. His spikes retracted slightly. Kerich turned back to Fayer and motioned for him to take a place beside the fire. Fayer shifted slightly as though he wanted to join them, but couldn’t. Staring at the flames, or through them, he began his story. 

“I waited there for a long time after they took the two of you. I thought maybe the Greater Demons forgot about me, so I started walking back home.” Fayer’s expression darkened as he turned his face away from the flames. “I should not have done that. When they found me, I had almost reached the border. I was so close.” Fayer took a deep breath and ran his clawed fingers across his scalp. “They were angry when they found me- but pleased. They laughed and screamed and carried me above their heads. There were so many who came to see. When I realized where they were taking me, I tried to fight. It only made them laugh harder. They finally quieted when we arrived at the Edge.” Fayer looked up at them. “It’s not what we thought it was. It isn’t a great ledge that looks down upon more of this.” He gestured around him at the barren landscape. “There is nothing except for the Edge. All of this land comes to a point, and that point goes on forever, becoming this ever sharpening Edge, like a blade. Sometimes they send the souls of humans to walk it. It stretches on for an eternity. It is worse than the Pools.” 

Kerich waited a moment before prompting Fayer to continue. “Fayer. Your marks. Tell us how you received them.”

Fayer looked down at his feet. “The Edge is sharp. I saved my feet using my wings to lighten my step, but how do you protect against the Salzarati?” He shook his head. “It’s impossible. All you can do is keep moving.” He wrapped his wings tightly around himself. “The Edge is enchanted. You can’t step off, can’t turn around.”

Dannil looked suspicious. “If that’s true, then how is it that you’re here now?”

The expression on Fayer’s face grew pained. “There is only one way to escape the Edge. You must be... selected... by the Salzarati, as I was.” 

Dannil stood with spikes fully extended, hissing. “I knew it! You have been marked by the Salzarati. You have been Chosen!”

Fayer suddenly doubled over and screamed. Dannil and Kerich backed away slowly at first, watching in horror as violent shockwaves rippled across Fayer’s body. Kerich stumbled as he began running in earnest away from the indistinguishable mass growing before him. 

Dannil and Kerich were not far enough away when Fayer completed his transformation.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I am a fool. I know that now. My only hope lies in the ministrations of the Dark-Haired Girl. I do not know if she is a spirit, an angel or an hallucination projected by some part of my subconscious that has, until now, been unable to find an effective conduit. My own sense is that she is real, and Time itself has chosen to contort in order to bring us together. Let me tell you of her appearance, some months ago. Then you and whoever reads these pages may each determine to his own satisfaction her true nature.  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I was reaching for my copy of de Lagarde's _German Essays_. For a moment my hand trembled, despite having taken that morning's pharmaceuticals. My knuckles rapped against the bookshelf above it, as if knocking on a door. When I finally was able to grasp the volume and remove it from its resting place, I experienced the greatest shock of my life. There had been a hole carved inexpertly out of the back of the bookshelf that I had not noticed before, and through the hole one brown eye watched me, one wide and hungry eye. It scarcely blinked as it watched me, and I stared in rapt fascination at it.  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Finally, when I had become aware of my own shallow breathing and a burning in my chest, I regained enough of my composure to seize the bookshelf and drag it out away from the wall behind so that the owner of this eye might have more entryway than merely the visual. To my own eyes appeared the delicate form of a young girl, in the early stages of puberty, her dark brown hair a tangled mess around her shoulders, wearing a plum-colored dress with a white collar that showed much abuse and little care.  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“Do you work for my father?” she asked, in Dutch, when she had gotten up off her dusty knees and taken the seat I offered her in one my stuffed leather chairs.  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“I do not know your father,” I answered. “I work for the people.”  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“You are German,” she said, matter-of-factly.  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I nodded. “And you are Dutch?” I asked, despite the obvious truth.  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;She nodded, causing a lock of hair to fall across her cheek. She moved to fix it with a hairpin, and I took in her features. Jewish, without a doubt. I felt no disgust, though, and this fact alone was enough to make me question the nature of our encounter.  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“Where are we?” she asked, looking around her at the room she was in, an expression that mixed trepidation with curiosity on her rather gaunt face.  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“These are my private chambers,” I answered.  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“In Amsterdam?”  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I shook my head. “In Berlin.”  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I watched to see how she would react. I did not detect any fear in her and began to wonder if I might be dreaming. The effects of the amphetamines and barbituates I had taken earlier, alongside the tremors resulting from my body's nervous degeneration, suggested otherwise. In dreams I normally have the good sense to heal myself without the aid of a physician's crude medicines.  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“Do you have anything to eat?” she asked, after sitting in silence for almost a full minute as the passive object of my attention.  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I rose and went to fetch some brötchen from a cupboard and poured a glass of spätburgunder from a neglected bottle I still kept for guests, though not of such an unexpected variety. My strange visitor hesitated when I offered these to her and was on the verge of inquiry when she gave a slight shrug of her shoulders, took the bread and wine and began to wolf the former down, while taking long sips of the latter. When she was finished, she smiled.  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“Thank you,” she said, in German.  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I smiled and surveyed her unkempt appearance. “You must have been hungry.”  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“I was,” she said.  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“Do you have family?”  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“I do,” she said.  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“Do they know you're here?”  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;She frowned, her smooth, broad forehead barely wrinkling. “I don't know how _I_ got here,” she explained. Then looked at me expectantly.  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I shook my head. “I only know that I became aware of your presence when I went to my bookshelf just now.”  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Her eyebrows lifted and her lips began to form a smile. “You like books?” she asked.  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“I do,” I said.  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“You don't burn them?”  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I paused. “Not here.”  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“I hate it when people burn books,” she said. “Such a waste.”  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“Some books contain dangerous ideas,” I explained.  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Her eyes took on a piercing intensity. “That is when you write your own,” she said, in a voice that seemed to echo inside me in some supernatural way.  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“Do you write?” she asked.  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I nodded. I got up and went to the bookshelf again, still at an angle to reveal the passage in the wall behind it. I looked into this passage but saw only darkness inside it. It was perfectly rectangular and perfectly impossible. I could not look at it for long before a feeling of profound angst threatened to overwhelm me. I snatched the book I had come for quickly and returned to my queer guest.  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;She looked the book over after taking it from me, running a slender finger up and down its spine and tracing its title. “Mein Kampf?” she said, her eyes piercing me again but this time only with a child's curiosity.  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“The story of my childhood and youth,” I said. “Including when I was your age.”  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;She reached into her pocket then and took out a book of her own, checkered, red and white with an oval brass lock. “This is my story,” she said. “Do you want to read it?”  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I took the book from her. It resembled any of a number of volumes I had signed from the hands of adoring girls and young women at public appearances. When I touched this one, though, something happened. A liquid warmth spread throughout my veins, my head felt full of electricity, and in that moment I knew: my body had been healed, not by a respected physician, but by the mysterious presence of a dark-haired Jewish girl whose name I did not even know.",anyotherorganians

They called her crazy for even thinking this could ever be a reality. But here she was, in her chair with the sunrise just asking to creep into the basement where she worked for days at a time, with the fully built device on the desk in front of her. Granted, its aesthetics were much to be desired: a hole in the chassis here, the odd circuit board hanging out from the body there, but functionally, it was near-complete. She bit her lip as she went to turn it on; admittedly, she didn’t even know exactly how it worked herself - for all she knew, it could either change the world or obliterate it before she even knew what was going on.

She closed her eyes and wished for the best.

*Click*.

One second.. two seconds.. three seconds passed. She opened her eyes, expecting to be in a vast nothingness, the ground beneath her gone. What met her was the same old room she had been in seconds prior, with the Window still in her hands, now giving off a faint glow. She held it in front of her face, and looked through: It was just the wall in front of her; her two computer monitors showing all the things she had researched that day. She spun her chair around and aimed the device at the stairs behind her.. nothing seemed out of the ordinary. Nervously, she turned the crudely secured dial, and what she saw caused her jaw to drop.

It was.. her. In the same attire as she was in, same ""\#1 daughter"" as she had in one hand, same pile of research notes as the ones on her desk in the other. Without any hesitiation, she grabbed the first thing she could see on her desk - some loose change. *Fair enough,* she thought. *It’s not like I’ll needed eight pence anyway.*  
As she watched herself descend the last of the stairs, she threw the assorted coins into the device, half-expecting them to either hit the screen, or land onto the floor below.. but neither happened. She glanced down at the carpet to see the coins were nowhere to be seen, then aimed the Window at the same spot to see four very recognisable metal discs right where they’d expect to be.

Her first instinct was to scream in delight at her success. But as she jumped from her chair, the new sunlight meeting her eyes that that would not be the best of ideas, what with a house on either side of hers - her neighbour’s affinity for Celtic folk music proving just how thin the walls truly were.

She sat the device back down on the desk - failing to notice the stack of coins now shown on the screen - and switched it off. As she walked back into the hallway of the house, one thought circled her head: Of all the people she wanted to show this to, there was only one on her mind... Sadly, they were no longer here, but with this technological breakthrough, that didn’t matter anymore. As she turned to climb the next flight of stairs, her bedroom looking pretty damn inviting, she looked out the front window at the second-hand Toyota sitting on the side of the road. She let out a small chuckle. [Might as well go all the way](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/43ie72/wp_in_the_year_1989_a_police_investigator_arrives/czisbm0).",neohylanmay

*Time of transmission - 23:49 - 29/04/2016 - Day 547*

*[Special Agent Baillie] to [Deputy Director Edmundson, GHQ]*

---

Conditions are bleak. Two thunder-snowstorm events have been recorded between Day 511 and Day 547. Subsequently, few tourists have passed through the area since the last transmission was recorded and relayed. One gentleman came particularly close to the hide, so Junior Agent Parker was dispatched in order to ward him off. Parker later reported a narrow escape from being urinated on by the gentleman, whilst conducting surveillance behind a shrub. 

Approximately three trees have fallen in period of time between Day 511 and Day 547, each resulting in significant aural disturbance. Trees were analysed and found to have been toppled by natural causes, they were then chainsawed and processed for fuel, as heating system for hide encountered a fatal error on Day 513.

Rations of soup have dropped rapidly since last transmission. Primary cause has been identified as the thunder-snowstorm events mentioned previously, and it has also been established that a specimen of local wildlife pilfered the Jammie Dodgers. Junior Agent Winston set off on Day 538 in pursuit of aforementioned wildlife, as well as to acquire a packet of Digestives. Has not been seen since; requesting thermal imagery scan from Black Engineering Division to aid in search.

Please offer my congratulations to Chief of Staff Morrison for his promotion to Deputy Director in charge of Countermeasures. If I might, I would like to submit a recommendation for Parker's promotion to Agent. His performance has been flawless, and he is a credit to this Subdivision. 

The game of Monopoly  which was airdropped on Day 520 proved to be extremely effective in raising spirits. Many a night has been spent in front of the alert system, and the personnel at Epping are proud to announce the invention of nine new economic systems, as well as four unique examples of profanity. 

Sadly, however, these spirits have been dampened by the recent spate of poor weather. Loneliness is rampant, and Winston was spotted engaging in conversation with a silver birch the day before his disappearance. Also, there has been a considerable lack of pride taken in uniform; it is incredibly hard to dry clean these suits in the middle of a forest, despite Parker's puddle-related endeavour, and sunglasses have been unnecessary due to the distinct lack of sunlight.

Mission parameters are clear. The operation shall be continued until next transmission day [Day 583], when we hope to receive new orders.

"[WP] A secret organization makes sure there's always someone there to hear a tree falling, to prevent the paradox that occurs otherwise.",Mutant_Llama1,"Have to say, this was probably the strangest job offer that I ever bothered answering.

I squinted down at the torn bit of paper that was serving as both a map and a business card: it was ripped from the back of an envelope and handed to me by a bespectacled woman with wild untamed hair, like a lion that had never heard of grooming.

All the people I’d met in the organisation were like that, to some extent – they twitched at the shadows, made faces at the moon. Given that everyone in the business I'd met so far was crazy, I really didn't think this whole job thing was going to work out.

I rapped on the door with my heart in my stomach. Regardless, here I was.

A panel in the wall slid open, eyes owlishly blinking at me from the other side. The man they belonged to shrieked, ""Who are you? Why are you here?""

""I just got hired here,"" I said. The door flung open.

""Well don't just stand there,"" The scrawny man on the other side beckoned me inside. I could only stare. He was wearing an honest-to-god tinfoil hat. I kid you not. A real tinfoil hat. ""Come in!""

Already regretting it, I stepped inside. The watchtower was a cramped affair, busy humans and blinking technology occupying the same living space. At each window, a different sentinel was posted, and they sat hunched over their perches. Hundreds of monitors lined each wall, each a grainy display of a different section of forest.

I walked behind the tinfoil-hat guy as he led me in. ""Good to have you on board,” he said. “We've been dangerously short on manpower as of late, and that's a very bad thing considering how critical this job is.""

""And... what is that job, again?"" I asked. I'd heard the job description, and I was talking to a guy who looked like he'd deny that the sun was real if given half the chance. But I had to make sure that this was *really* what I was getting into. I mean, when you were as strapped for cash as I was, you’d be willing to do just about anything that had ‘job’ in the description. But were they *seriously* that insane?

""We make sure that for every tree in the world that falls, someone is around to hear it,"" he said resolutely. ""It's the most important job in the world."" In the face of that kind of conviction, I struggled to keep my expression neutral.

""Oh, I can definitely see that... you think this is important..."" I said lamely, just soaking in the intense looks of concentration on the workers' faces.

""What we do is really very clever: we can't possibly listen to every tree at once – the sheer scale of that kind of operation would be a nightmare. So instead, we have millions of seismographic detectors scattered across every mile of every forest in every country in the world, and we display the live surveillance camera footage from only the areas where we detect the most unusual activity.""

""Wow, you really make that sound like a reasonable kind of undertaking,"" I said.

""And *then* – when one of us observes that a tree is falling, or we think it's about to fall, we quickly press a button that broadcasts the live audio right in this very room! It's genius!""

""Pure genius,"" I echoed hollowly, wondering if I should just start running now and never look back.

""You'll be paid handsomely, of course,"" Tinfoil said abruptly as if sensing my thoughts. ""There are many factions in the world who are concerned with this threat. They know what will befall the world if we fail…""

I wanted to question him more, but just then a loud exclamation went up - ""Help! He's having an allergic reaction!"" A man was choking, spluttering and wheezing on the ground as people turned to help him-

""No! Eyes on the monitors!"" Tinfoil snapped. The workers froze in place and turned back to staring at the windows upon windows of trees, leaving the choking man to writhe on the ground.

""We've got to help him-"" I said, already starting forward, but Tinfoil's hand was on my shoulder.

""He'll be fine,"" the man said tersely. ""The emergency team has already been called in. What won't be fine are his windows. I know this is your first day on the job, but dammit I don't have time to explain anymore, and I don’t have the people to spare. You've got to man those windows – now, before it's too late. Go!""

""What happens if I miss a tree falling?"" I said, the situation already spiralling rapidly out of my control. I'd meant to just quit now, but he pushed me forward until I was standing in the jaws of the surveillance system, the button at my fingertips.

""Then god help us all,"" he answered solemnly. ""Don't let us down, new guy. The fate of the world depends on you.""

I turned, terrified, to the monitors – eyes straining to take it all in. Acres and acres of trees stretched before me, several monitors periodically jumping to a different scene. I tried desperately to pick out movement, to spot anything out of the ordinary in the vast collection of swaying trees, but it was too much to take in at once.

Then a gasp rang out from behind me. ""Oh no! Look! That tree over there! It's falling!""

*Shit!* My fingers slammed the button with crushing force.

The speakers blared to life – letting out a wet, long fart noise from every corner of the room.

I turned, with slow dawning horror, to find a room of people laughing their arses off at me.

""You guys...” I said, already knowing the answer, “...don't really watch trees to make sure you hear if they fall, do you...?""

Tinfoil didn't stop laughing, wiping a tear from his eye. ""Ahh, I'm sorry – pranking people is just about the most exciting this job ever gets."" Then, grinning ear to ear, he put his tinfoil hat down on my head. “I’m afraid not. We just watch for forest fires.”

""Ha. Ha,"" I intoned, but despite myself, I was smiling too.

Tinfoil stuck out his hand. ""Welcome to the team?""

I took it – a real grin blooming across my face. And when I said it, I was surprised how much I meant it: “It’s good to be here.”

So that was the story of how I got this job. Turns out I was right from the very beginning – the job is boring, the pay is okay, and the people are completely insane.

The court room was deathly silent, save for the steady thrum of the reactor deep within the station. Olso Halden stared straight ahead, avoiding the stares of his former supporters. He would not beg, he would not kneel. They could sully his name, tarnish his legacy, but they would not break his pride.

He flexed his wrists, wincing as the magnetic binds chafed his skin. The crowd, the cameras, the traitors, all waited with bated breath to hear the final remarks of a man once hailed as a hero.

“I have nothing to say.”

And that was that. The speaker of the house nodded, his face an emotionless mask, and motioned for the guards waiting in the annex.

“The punishment is banishment, to commence immediately. So sayeth the senate. This court is adjourned.”

Eight men approached the bound politician, but only three dared to touch him. Olso did not protest, and went willingly. He passed his wife, his beautiful, loving wife, as he strode down the aisle. She was weeping softly. For a heartbeat they locked eyes, for the last time.

Olso was led down through the House of Order’s grand staircase, a procession of camera drones and reporters tailing like a funeral march. Many questions were asked, but Olso said nothing.

The plain, steel doors leading to the banishment chamber were flanked by two armed soldiers. They stood at attention as the procession approached. One of them typed a command into a small terminal, and the doors slid open.

There it was. Rather anticlimactic, Olso thought as he stared at the chair. Banishment was a death sentence reserved for only the most heinous of crimes, and few had ever seen the interior of the infamous room. But there before him sat the device, little more than a chair situated between two large, convex mirrors.

One of the guards led him over to the seat, sat him down and secured his arms. A thin, sallow light shone down from above, limning the former president in an eerie yellow glow and illuminating the grim faces of the execution detail. Several members of the senate were in attendance, men he had called friends in a life long past.

“Olso Halden,” the executioner began, “for your crimes against the species, and the betrayal of the people, you have been sentenced to death by banishment. Have you any last words?” Again, Olso said nothing, trying desperately to cover his growing terror. Little was said of what happened to the banished, merely that they disappeared. It was rumored that the device rent the victim atom from atom, dispelling little more than dust. Others said the machine created a miniaturized singularity, collapsing the accused to nothing in a plank second for the witnesses but an excruciating eternity for the banished.

He had been falsely accused, no more than a scapegoat for the true powers that be. He should not be here, he should be free to lay the blame upon those truly at fault! But no, the time had passed. He had presented his case, honest and explicit, but it had fallen on deaf ears. His best hope would be to die a martyr.

The several remaining minutes of his life were a blur, the executioner’s monologue drowned by Olso’s racing heart.

And then it began.

A slow rumble rose from the mirrors, reverberating through every cell in his body. He heard men talking, but they were far, far away, their voices muted and warped. The chamber grew dark, his head pounded, every fiber of his being exploded in mind-numbing pain.

And then, as soon as it had begun, it ended.

A tremendously bright light seared his eyes, and he fell to his knees in the hot sand. He was thirsty, more so than he had ever believed possible.

Wait. Sand?

He felt the world heave beneath him, his mind tumbling, and he slipped into unconsciousness.


Olso Halden awoke with a start as a deluge of cold water splashed across his face. He rose, sputtering, glancing around wildly. He remembered the banishment, barely. He was dead, he should be dead.

“Ah, you’re awake!”

Olso blinked back the vestiges of unconsciousness, and as the world swam into view he saw a face very near to his. He focused on the details in an effort to anchor himself in whatever reality this was. Sun-baked skin, yellow teeth, blue eyes, a tangle of dirty blonde hair, rough-spun tunic.

“Well, come on then, up ya go.”

The speaker leaned back, revealing an old, withered man. He offered Olso a hand, who grasped it tentatively. With surprising strength the old man helped the banished president to his feet. They were in a small tent, animal skin judging by the stitching. A small fire burned in the center, sending a column of inky smoke billowing through a hole in the center of the domed ceiling.

“Water…” Olso croaked through parched lips.  The old man handed over a squat clay jug, and Olso drank deeply. 

After what seemed like ages Olso drank his fill and lowered the jug. “What is this place?” he managed to ask after catching his breath. He felt weak, tired, stretched thin, aged far beyond his years. The old man had tottered across the tent and was burrowing through a large crate.

“Huh? This is Rome, of course, must have been out in that sun quite a while eh? The heat can fry your brain somethin’ fierce.” 
Olso sat on a low chest, for the first time noticing his clothing. Gone were his ceremonial robes, gone was his integrated bioscreen, gone was his cerebral implant. Instead, he was dressed in a simple shift, coarse fabric belted with a strip of what must be leather. Well, at least some luxuries were afforded in the… 

“Rome?” he asked, wracking his brain to remember where he had heard the name. There was some religion long forgotten who had claimed a portion of a city as their own sovereign nation, but he had though it named Roma, or Romeo, or something like that.  “Never heard of Rome.”

The old man spun around, his ancient features twisted in an incredulous grimace. “Never heard of Rome? Of course you have, boy! Why, you were lying right outside the gates when I found you. Here, eat this.” The old man held out a small, earthy lump, gesturing with his bushy, animated eyebrows.

Olso stared at the muddy offering, wrinkling his nose at the pungent aroma, but he could not deny his growing hunger. Tentatively he accepted the morsel, steeled himself, and ate it.

To his surprise it was slightly sweet, aromatic and herbal, with the unmistakable aftertaste of... “Coffee?” Olso asked. The old man nodded, “Got it off those Arabs that come up from the desert, does a body good, yes it does. Should help you get your head on straight.”

Olso rose on shaky legs, stretching out the aches in his joints. He moved across the cramped tent to a flap cut in the animal skin. The old man began to protest, but Olso was already out the door.

He nearly fell to his knees as the commotion beyond the tent flowed over him. 

Hundreds, thousands of other tents, skin and fabric, crouched across a wide field. Men of many races meandered around the camp, most in flowing white robes, some in gleaming armor plating and carrying large crimson shields. A tremendous beast, easily twice his height at the shoulder, ambled past the tent flap, a man in brown leathers and gold medallions seated on a strange saddle guiding it along.

The old man appeared at his side, gnawing on something greasy. “Is that…” Olso began. The old man chuckled, “yep, that there’s an elephant. Them Moors been brining ‘em in for days now, must be nearly a hundred of the beasts round here. And lions, tigers, all sorts of critters.” Olso was stunned. The last elephant had died hundreds of years ago, its tragic story wielded as a weapon for the zealous environmental terrorists he had fought so fiercely against during the Martian Revolt, yet here walked one of the majestic creatures now, before his eyes, grand beyond belief. 

He had been banished. He should be dead. This must be death, or a dream. No, the infernal device must scramble the brain. Surely this was some twisted simulation.

As if reading his thoughts, the old man coughed politely. “You seem to be taking banishment pretty well, I must say, much better than the others.”

Olso looked down at the strange man, who cast him a sly wink. “Think you’re the first one here? Ha, I came through myself, years ago.” Olso fumbled for a reply, but came up short.

“Surprised me too, that chair, thought it was supposed to tear you apart, or worse,” the old man continued. “But nope, it’s a time machine. Of course it is. Why? Who knows. But hey, life is life, and you get used to it here.”

“Time travel?” Olso asked incredulously, and the old man merely chuckled. The pair stood in silence for several minutes, Olso trying to wrap his mind around the banishment, trying to make sense of the ordeal as the old man absently chewed his lunch.

After he had finished his meal and tossed the bone onto the sand, the old man broke the silence. “Well kid, you got quite a bit of catching up to do, and I aint really particular on explaining the whole situation. But there’s someone who can, and trust me, he’ll chew your ear off it you let him.”

Olso reigned in his thoughts and returned his attention to the old man. “Who?” he asked. The old man cracked a toothy smile. “Why, the Emperor of course, who do you think set up this whole banishment thing? Come on, we’ve got quite a day ahead of us.”

And with that, the pair set off into the camp, towards the towering walls of Rome beyond.

[WP] A serial killer is on the loose that kills his victims by poisoning muffins. They call him... The Muffin Man,Mutant_Llama1,"""DING""
  a sound that has become all to familiar with me over the past few years as i pull the muffins out of the oven. It all started many years ago. I was just a toddler and was with my mother walking down drury lane. Like any other day i went with her we made our normal stops. On that day my mother did something different that caught my attention. ""how about a muffin?"" she asked with a radiant smile. What kid would say no to a treat?. We sat down at a bakery called the ""bakers dozen"". I ordered a chocolate chip muffin. My mother ordered a muffin i could not pronounce or understand until later on in life. the ""non-fat, gluten free, less sugar, extra hot"" bran muffin. 
         
      The next few minutes are still a blur but I will always live with the flashing images. Seeing her hand against her throat, gasping for air. There was only me and her in the bakery and the baker was out back. All i could do is helplessly watch. Before she dropped and stopped moving she looked me in the eyes and against all odds gave me a smile as if to say ""i love you"". then she stopped moving. Something came over me that day that still haunts me to this day. Anger.  The Bakers Dozen closed after that incident.

             Years have gone by, as i become closer to perfecting my technique. Baking muffins seem to come naturally. Delivering them to my victims proved quite a challenge as you cant just cant poison every batch of muffins. My very first batch i sent to the bread bakery with a note saying ""donation for the helpless"". The muffins found their way to the church of Scientology. Im glad it went there because there was no investigation.
        There have been 2 close calls with police finding out that the muffin was the COD and because of it the town has came up with the name ""the muffin man"", even though i am the mailman for the town. 
     ""it could have been anything from self sacrifice, to giant anal probes from aliens"" was the statement the sheriff released. Thank god everyone in town think they are as crazy as i think they are. It was then i decided i should choose victims more wisely.
       My new delivery method has to be timed perfectly. As the latest self proclaimed  ""muffin master"" of our town found out just how good i have become. There was a annual farmers market and the night before people could come drop off baked goods etc. to be set up the next morning. with my bag of bread, cookies, and muffins at the bottom. i dropped the bag off. then went to town hall to ask if i could volunteer to help set up and work the tables selling baked goods. The city council thinking of me the always smiling never late mailman  agreed without hesitation. I could not wait for the morning to come..
       As the sun was just breaking the horizon, I was already to go. I knew i had to be one of the first people down there so i could find my bag, set up a table and make sure my silent killer was ready to be ingested. The morning was going well, people shopping around with families, having a good time. It just made me miss my mother that much more. When the muffin master walked by he noticed the empty muffin tray as i had planned.
       with a sneer he claimed. ""those must be some delicious muffins if they are already gone."" 
          ""the people who ate them said it might have been the best muffin they ever tasted""
         
          "" they obviously have no taste, do you not know that i am the muffin master of this  town""

          "" i have heard tell of your name and what a honor it is to meet you. it just so happens that i knew of you before all of the muffins sold out. I managed to snag one out of the pan and keep it to the side in case the great muffin master walked by""

           The moment from me going to reach that muffing to him taking a bite, the world seems to slow down as a abundance of joy fills my body and he swallows a bite.

         ""Wow!!! this muffin is great, especially with the filling in the middle. i dont think i will ever have a muffin that tastes like that again""

         You could not cut the smile off my face as i knew he was thinking about starting to fill his muffins and knowing, he will never have a muffin like that again......



Sorry for the crappy writing, my first post here thought i would see what i could come up with.

[WP] A serial killer is on the loose that kills his victims by poisoning muffins. They call him... The Muffin Man,Mutant_Llama1,"Pt. 1

Dinner time comes around, and he takes a seat at the table that his mother-in-law had gracefully been preparing for the past hour in an orderly and decorative manner. There is fine china accompanied by a silver fork, spoon, clear glass and a yellow matching cloth napkin placed neatly in 3 of the 6 seats. Two bouquets of flowers holding daisies, roses, and lilies sit equally spaced from each other on the center of the table.

He takes a seat on one length of the table and his girlfriend, Denise takes the seat alongside him.

""Honey, did you say hi to my mother? asks Denise.

""Baby you know your mother and I aren't on good terms. I don't like it when you keep trying to push something that isn't going to happen. You know how I feel about this."" He said with a lowered voice worried that he would be overheard.

The clattering of pots and dishes and running water leaked from the kitchen into the dining area where Mason and Denise were sitting waiting for dinner. Although what they were having was a mystery to them both, they had a pretty good idea of what it was as the scent of roasted turkey and spices and garlic permeated every crack and crevice within a 20 yard radius.

""Well something has to change baby. Eventually I'm going to have to tell her about our plans on moving in together and our engagement. It's not going to sit well with her considering how she feels about you."" said Denise.

""It's not like I haven't tried to make amends with your mother. I'm not the type of person to try to get on someone’s good side just to get something out of it. Regardless, we both know that's not going to hold us back, and it would be nice to have everyone in our family in approval of it, but unfortunately, sometimes some people just don't get along and it's something we have to accept.."" reciprocated Mason with a hushed tone as the sound of footsteps grew louder and dishes clattering eased to an end. The water was no longer running and the scent of roasted turkey grew more pungent until it was there at his nose. 

Mason's mother-in-law took a seat opposite to Denise.

""It's still very hot so be careful!"" She warned as she placed a well-cut chunk of turkey and a side of mashed potatoes covered with gravy on Mason’s plate. Gravy oozed off the corner of his plate and he had to use his napkin to clean it as it would have continued flowing over the edge of the table and possibly onto his shoes. As Mason cleaned up the mess, she finished serving Denise and herself and proceeded to pour a glass of water in their glasses and red wine for herself in a flute glass that she had replaced with her previous glass.

""Wow mom, this is very good, what's in it?!"" Exclaimed Denise in excitement as she chewed loudly and messily.

""Ah thank you. There's rosemary and thyme in it, as well as heaps of butter, but what gives it the real flavor is the precise time and temperature it was cooked at. Sorry for the wait. I know you guys were hungry and I myself am as well, but I'm a perfectionist and I can't help it."" She said as self-congratulation oozed from her tongue into Mason’s inner ear and penetrated the walls of his sinuses, landing the words directly in his mouth, leaving a bitter and sour taste, but of course, he tried his best to hide it. Regardless, she wouldn't have noticed as she hadn't looked at him the entire time she had joined the dining area.

Finally, she looks up at him.
""So how are you? I heard you got a job at the local radio station.""
Denise looked up with nervous curiosity and continued to chew and occupy her mouth.

""Oh you heard? Well it's a good job. It's not the best pay but it's what I wanted to do so I can't complain. I consider myself lucky."" He responded with a now downcasted sight focused on his platter.
She sensed his nervousness but more-so his prevalent discomfort and decided to respond regardless of whether it aggravated the tension or not.
""Oh well that's wonderful. It's always best to be emotionally satisfied and financially disturbed than the other way around. My husband works a 9-5 job doing something he hates, and comes home exhausted, fetching a beer from the fridge and splaying himself on the recliner in front of the television. He doesn't talk to me. All he wants to do is watch his fucking sports and sip on cheap beer. Funny thing is he can afford better beer, as well as that license plate decal that says ""I'd rather be playing football"" which he never does, he only watches it, but he still chooses to drink that cheap goddam beer. It's been awhile since he's taken me out anywhere."" She snuffs and grunts as she prepares for the continuation of the rant. Mason turns towards Denise, she returns the look, and faces back towards Norma. ""On his days off he would rather go out drinking with his buddies doing I don't know what, because he never tells me, than to spend any time with me. Hence why he's not here with us and why i'm cooking dinner on a Friday night, not that I have a dislike for cooking, but it makes me angry that the reason I'm doing so is 'cause he won't take me out like any decent man would. I've been married to him for twenty-five years and he's never had the decency to be the one who cooks dinner for us either... says he can't cook as well as me, but he's forgotten that before we got married, on our second date, he cooked some of the best pasta i've ever eaten, and claims to have forgotten about it. I don't know what makes me angrier, the fact that he's lying or that he doesn't remember such an event. That damned bastard.""

Denise, understanding her mother’s pain as she has experienced the same dissonance from her father, reaches over and grabs her mother’s hand and caresses it in consolidation. ""I know mother, Dad's not the best, but I promise you that you won't have to witness your daughter go through the same thing.""

Norma raises a suspicious, questioning eyebrow. ""What do you mean by that? Are you saying what I think you are?""

Denise's face flushes with blood as her eyes widen, instantly verifying Norma's suspicions. Mason looks at Denise and then at Norma with a similar expression on his face. He faces back towards Denise as she begins to reveal the inevitable.

""Mom, I wanted to wait for the right moment to tell you this, but Mason and I are engaged. I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner.""

""Is that right? How long ago did this happen?"" asks Norma.

""A month and a half ago."" She says as she proceeds to take out a black squared jewelry box from her purse. ""Look, isn't it beautiful?""

Norma takes the ring and puts it up to her eye. Light is reflected from the ring onto Norma's dark sunken eyes as she inspects it closely. ""It's beautiful."" She says ""But I don't believe you're ready for marriage.""

""I can assure you she is, and so am I."" interrupts Mason. ""We have prepared and planned everything, and we're moving into an apartment on the other side of town by the end of the month.""

Mason downcasts his gaze as Norma returns a menacing glare, subtle but effective.

""Mom, I know you don't approve, and won't, which is why I was hesitant in revealing the news, but it is what it is, and we're going through with it.""

Without another word, Norma gets up from her seat, picks up her half-empty glass of wine and disappears into the kitchen. Mason and Denise look at each other in verbal silence, communicating their feelings through their disappointed but relieved eyes.

""Well...it's out."" said Denise. ""It had to happen eventually.""

""Yeah well I honestly don't give a shit anymore. I never did anything to make your mother not like me. That's her problem."" Says Mason as he proceeds to get up and walks towards the door leaving behind the plate with half eaten mash potatoes and only a bite off the no longer warm roasted turkey breast.

Denise follows and stops him at the door. ""I'm sorry baby, I didn't want it to happen this way, but just know that nothing will stop me from being with you, we're doing this no matter what.""

Mason holds her face and looks into her hazel eyes. He pulls her pretty face close to his and places his lips lightly on hers. He pulls away and says, ""I love you"" and turns around and leaves.

A week later, Mason is sitting in his kitchen making breakfast when he hears a knock at his door. ""Delivery for... Mason Roberts?"" says a man holding a box with a bow on it that appears to be a gift. ""Yes, who is this from?"" asks Mason puzzled. He pulls out a letter that was hidden from sight under the box and says, ""It appears to be from Ms. Taylor. We are a gift delivery service specializing in delivering bouquets and delicacies. This was dropped off at our shop along with this letter.""

Mason thanks the man as he takes the receiving box and letter from his hands. He walks towards the living room and sits on the couch puzzlingly and curiously investigating the gift. He opens the letter and reads, ""Hi honey, I know this is strange but it’s good news. I spoke with my mother and we came to terms about her disapproval of our engagement. She wanted to write you this as an apology, and included a gift as a congratulation."" He flips the page and recognizes the text in the writing of Norma, which he has seen on notes left around her house while visiting Denise.

[WP] A serial killer is on the loose that kills his victims by poisoning muffins. They call him... The Muffin Man,Mutant_Llama1,"The cold streets of Chicago in February greet me with an unpleasant chill as I walked out of the lobby of Hotel Monaco and lit a cigarette.  I took a drag that filled me with warmth, like a sip of neat Scotch. How I longed for a nice glass of single malt to take the edge off. I quit drinking a month ago when Emma threatened to leave, but who could blame her? I had been a nasty drunk, I said things I didn't mean that hurt her. Or had I meant them? They say alcohol is like truth syrum, but I didn't want to admit that to her, or even to myself. But this case had taken so much out of me, that's when the drinking started.

That's enough self pity for one night though, I have a case that needs to end. Sooner rather than later.

The Muffin Man, or so the papers have been calling him. The suspect of a string of serial murders all committed with a poisoned muffin. There was no connections between the killings aside from that, so the whole force was struggling to catch this guy. We don't know what he looks like, and there have been no surviving victims to give us an ID or to talk to a sketch artist. He's a ghost, in and out in the blink of an eye. The only lead we have on this case is a separate string of murders in the Ukraine in 2009 that matched this MO, and no surprise that Interpol isn't making this easy for us. They never caught the guy either, the murders just stopped, and the Muffin Man hadn't resurfaced until September 16th of 2015.

A double homicide at an apartment complex on the corner of West Fulton Market and East green. No blood, no fingerprints, just a muffin wrapper and two dead bodies. I think it's time to go back and look at the crime scene again. See if anything was missed. I'm going to catch this monster, even if it costs me my life...

""Mason, I am sorry I had been in such disapproval about you being with my daughter. I want to explain that, my dislike of you being in a relationship with my daughter stems from what I have realized is my fear of her finding herself with a man that will treat her unjust and find herself in a situation similar to mine. I've also come to realize that you're not a half bad man, and I do judge harshly, but I know you'll be able to care for my daughter in a well manner. And about your financial situation, I much rather you lack luxurious accommodations for your wife and (hopefully) my future grand-children, than for you to lack the time to give them the love they need. Your decisions show a lot about you as a man, and I wish you both the best.""

""Sincerely, Norma""

Mason remained staring at the letter in astonishment for a few minutes. He didn't feel joy, but relief, as if a weight had been lifted off his shoulders. He reached for his phone to call Denise, but the bow-tied silver box caught his attention and changed the direction of his reach to quench his curiosity. He opened the box, and sitting there was a partially glazed muffin smothered in blueberries and sugar sprinkles. His stomach rumbled at the sight and remembered that he had left eggs in the stove that had most likely burnt to a char by now, so he reached for the muffin and realized it was still warm. He took a bite. One bite turned into 10 and soon there was nothing remaining of the muffin except for a few crumbs that had fallen between the crevices of the couch.

As he walked towards the kitchen to clean up his failed breakfast, he felt a sudden pressure on his upper chest. He clutched at his chest and doing so made is seem as if the pain multiplied exponentially in an instant, and soon it became unbearable and he fell on his knees gasping for breath as he felt his lungs ceasing to function. He fell to the floor with every muscle in his body paralyzed. With every effort possible he reached towards the phone but could not move his arm. ""This can't be happening. This can't be happening. This can't be happening"" ran through his head trying to understand exactly what it was that was happening, and felt his body giving out and his life coming to an end with every second passing. With strained and petrified eyes, he looked up at the fridge where he lay beside and saw a picture of Denise and himself smiling contently for the camera. A tear ran down his eye, and he shifted his gaze to a photograph just above it. It was a picture of himself, Denise, his parents, and his in-laws at a Sunday barbecue get-together, clustered photogenically at the instructions of the photographer, all smiling and hoping to look their best for the camera. He thought about his parents, Denise, and his life coming to an end. He continued to scan the photo and there in the back was Norma, not staring at the camera, but at him. A menacing smirk formed at her lips and followed up her cheeks to a pair of sullen eyes full of menace. She was staring directly at Mason whom was completely oblivious of it. He looked into her eyes and they seemed to be looking back at him, except now they seemed satisfied as if a desire of hers had been fulfilled as his own remained petrified until his last moments of consciousness.

The sky is overcast and slightly gray, making it difficult to distinguish the guests from the environment. Denise is kneeling over the edge of the hole where her soon to be fiancé is now being buried. Tears land on the wooden coffin, the last that would ever touch him. Norma steps in to pull her away. They take a few steps back and Denise now has her back towards the hole as she hugs her mother and cries on her shoulder. The hole is now being covered with dirt, and Norma watches as the coffin slowly disappears from sight with every load of dirt being pummeled over it. She can't help but smile.

""Why mother? Why did Michael have to leave me like this. Why am I going through this once more? I don't understand. Am I cursed?! Please tell me mother. I'm in so much pain! I can't bear it any longer."" moans Denise as tears stream down her face from swollen eyes with eyeliner decorating her cheeks in black streaks. ""I don't understand. I don't understand...""
Ten years had passed since she was last widowed.

Norma pulls her closer and strokes the back of her hair, playing with her brunette curls. ""I'm so sorry honey. You're staying the night with me. You can stay for however long you want okay? I'll make you dinner and your favorite tea. Mom will always take care of you. Always.""

There is blood on your hands, Wilson. Blood on your hands!

How long have you been an editor here? 2 years? Which goddamn intern wrote the article? Jones? Well she's new. It's YOUR JOB to check their work and now we have a city in chaos!

Easiest story in the world. Writes itself. Oh I know we sold copies. Too many fucking copies, that's what.

How could you get it wrong? I'm honestly dying to know. But not dying as much as all those poor bastards caught up in this shit, of course! Reports are rolling in, Wilson. The cops want to speak to me. Me! I'm on the hook for this, too, apparently. But if you think I'm going down for your mistake, you're sorely mistaken.

Look at this shit. Two bakery mascots gunned down. A flour truck set on fire on 5th avenue. Supermarkets are checking ID for anyone buying the little paper bases. Security is on high alert everywhere.

Oh sure, the cookie people are happy. I suppose you've got fucking shares in them or something? Well a bit of heads up next time would be swell so we can all make a buck when you PLUNGE US INTO ANARCHY.

No, look, I don't want to hear your excuses.

The whole paper went to print without so much as a double-space typo. It was perfect. You must have checked it five times. It is just beyond me how you missed this.

It's not just that your mistake has turned people into crazed baked-good vigilante killers, the actual problem has been totally overlooked!

Two more children abducted this morning by some guy in a penguin suit. A fuzzy penguin suit. How does he survive in that thing, Wilson? It's the middle of goddamn summer. Which makes it even crazier that there's a fuckin' 6 foot tall penguin wandering the city abducting kids.

It's an arctic animal, Wilson. That means cold! There are pidgeons passing out in the car park, and this guy's strutting around getting his kidnap on.

The info pack cam directly from the national network. This guy should have been caught by now. They were calling him the Puffin Man - that's all we had to freakin' print!

But noooo. You had to drop the ball big time, huh? Anyone with a muffin is a suspect. The cops shot a woman who reached suddenly for a falling blueberry, Wilson. Shot her dead. They aren't taking chances, how could we?

You're going to write the retraction and release it immediately. ""Blah blah blah sorry for the error, we meant ""Puffin Man"" not ""Muffin Man"" look for a nutcase in giant bird from the north pole costume"" or some shit, just get it done NOW.

And what is this?  
Supposed to be some humorous peace offering?

Some kind of fucking joke?

Oh it came for free with your coffee? Well I'm not surprised. Barista was probably trying to get rid of them all before someone firebombed the cafe.

Chocolate chip, huh? Real funny, Wilson. Go do your goddamn job.

Hmm, this actually tastes pretty good. Which cafe did you get it from?

[WP] A serial killer is on the loose that kills his victims by poisoning muffins. They call him... The Muffin Man,Mutant_Llama1,"He ran his hand across his face in exhaustion. They had been questioning the suspect for hours with the same results which could only lead to one conclusion: their best lead was a dud. Here he was saddled with the biggest case of his entire career and he had nothing to stand on. There was a notorious serial killer on the loose and the only thing they knew for certain was that the perp had a penchant for twisting innocent pleasures into perverse torture. What kind of mad man would take the time to create the most delicious muffins only to use them for his devious murders? The poison he used was one of the most painful and cruel strain of its kind too. 

Gordie shook his ginger head and tried to clear the cobwebs of exhaustion from his thoughts. He looked at Miss Muffet and considered his options. She was looking pretty worn out from the roughing up her boyfriend, Jack Horner, and he was feeling sorry for her. He sighed and came to the conclusion that either she had told them everything or that she had known nothing in the first place. He’d have to speak to his partner, Jill Hill, about the quality of her informants. It burned him that The Muffin Man was still at large and they were no closer to finding him. No matter how fast Gordie Breadman ran, he couldn’t seem to get a grasp on the case, even though he was the fastest investigative detective in the whole of the Drury Lane Division. 

He nodded to Sergeant BIggie Badwulf to cut Miss Muffet loose and headed to his office. Pushing the heavy door open he was met with the sight of a simple brown box on his desk addressed to him. He sat heavily in his worn leather chair, sagging through the holes that had covered it over the years. Looking at the cursive on the lid with a bitter taste in his mouth, he cut the brown string it was wrapped in with his letter opener and sighed, knowing what he would find. Flipping the lid back, he saw what he had seen every night since he had been assigned this case: a single tempting muffin--blueberry today--with a folded note. He plucked the note from the box and flipped it open.

“Run, run, as fast as you can. You can’t catch me, Ginger Breadman.”

"[WP] You're in wizard training, and each beginner wizard is given a ""training wand"" that can only cast one spell.",Mutant_Llama1,"""Seriously?  That's it?""

""Be patient, John.  Everyone can only do one minor spell starting out.  It's a training wand for a reason,"" said Professor Hedge in a reassuring tone.

The woman sitting across from me was in her seventies, green eyes above high cheekbones and long, delicate fingers laced on the desktop.  She looked positively regal, a standard of knowledge and propriety made flesh.  Her carefully arranged posture was betrayed by a shadow of concealed laughter on her face.

""That's not the point!  Why does my one spell have to be so lame?  Why can't it be levitation or something?""

""Well, levitation isn't even in the cards because it requires a second spell to bring things down again.  It can also be dangerous in the hands of a novice.  The magical circuits in training wands are arranged to only allow one random spell of tier zero, until the applicant has displayed fine enough control of their spiritual energy to progress.""

""My classmates have spells like making things as light as a feather, or creating a minor breeze.  Those can actually be useful!""

""Enough, Mr. Lynch.  I'm sure that your spell can be useful as well, if you just use your imagination a bit.""  Maybe I was already using my imagination, but it seemed that her suppressed laughter came closer to the surface as she said this.  ""Besides, most applicants move on to a tier one training wand within six months.  That will give you access to all of tier zero and two random spells in tier one.  Apply yourself diligently and you can move on even sooner.""

I thought to push the argument, but it was clear that she was becoming tired of this conversation.  With a sigh, I excused myself and walked back out into the corridor and began to follow the complicated path back to the dormitory.  Along the way, I passed a few of my dorm mates, who greeted me with ""Hi, Stinky!  How's it going?""

I opened the door to my dorm and found a few dozen people seated on couches just inside.  Heads turned and silence filled the room.  Then, one freshman student stood up, puffed out his chest, and declared ""I'm Farticus!""

Another stood up.  ""No, I'm Farticus!""

A wave of students began standing up and declaring themselves Farticus.  I ignored them as I stalked back to my room.

My only spell for the next six months was the stinkbomb spell.  My only power was making the room smell like flatulence.  Being a wizard was much less glamorous than I thought.  

As I sat down at my small desk, I resolved myself to cut six months down to one.  Surely if I set a schedule of eighteen hours a day dedicated to study and practice, I could be out of this that soon.  Hell, I could probably get through the whole curriculum in a year or two.  I cracked my knuckles, unshelved a textbook, and picked up my pen.

No, it is *not* possible to upgrade a wand with the simple magic of wind and waves and fire - there were Forms that were needed to bring magic to life through the essences of exotic beasts, dragon tooth and manticore spike, all of which cost more than Ralv would ever have available to spend.  His parents loved to see him dream, but the first class was going to be the last class.  He would cast one, and only one spell, and maybe, someday, he might be able to afford to try another.

Unless he wowed them.

Library records showed he checked out books far more ambitious than the other students, resurrections and reformations, things that would drain every last trace of magic from the one-shot wand and probably still come up hungry for more.  No one would know that was not the reason why the Judge gave him a long pitying look and said nothing as he took the stage.  But the great wizards know many things that even they can do nothing about.

Ralv presented the wand to the Judge that fateful day, holding it gently between his fingers.  There was truly a magical feeling in the air.  He felt as though he had been born for this one moment, that he had been casting this spell since the beginning of time.  He would luxuriate in his newfound power.  The magic from the wand pulsed and grew in a purple ball that hung in the air; soon it was spent, brittle and crazed with tiny cracks, but the magic held station under the power of his incantations.  In a supreme show of control, he did not allow it to disperse, but held it steady with a sheer comprehension of mind.  The audience cheered heartily.

Then he worked his resurrection upon the wand, restoring its state from the accumulated energy.  Magic could not be produced from nothing, but he would restore it as it was!  Dead channels sprang back to life, the brittle material became supple and whole, and the magical device began to take shape once more as a powerful and functional device.  *Why,* he thought, *I shall do this again right away, just to show them!*

That was when he began to feel strange.  With a last fading thought, it occurred to him that a magical wand in use becomes as one with its wielder, and to restore the wand as it was, one must restore the wielder as well.

The Judge reassured the class that Ralv probably teleported as his demonstration, and now of course he would have to walk home.  A magician cannot be afraid of his powers, so sometimes a teacher has to tell a little white lie, or a big one.  Had the students been brighter, or better, or better trained, maybe they would have noticed the alternate geodesic.

[WP]Write an episode of a sitcom where Jesus decided to attend a modern day highschool.,SaltySalteens,"Episode 1: Chariot of Fire.

*open to a shot of highschooler's running to class in a hallway right as the bell rings in walks a figure that you can barely make out the silhouette of someone emitting a bright light cue music of heavenly tones but it happens to be a regular student running late to class*

Kyle was running late. He knew it, the teacher knew it, and it was all his mother's fault for forgetting her coffee. He screamed and yelled with passion at her while she made an illegal u-turn to go back to the house even though they were just minutes away from the school. When Kyle finally got to his homeroom, where he started the day he sensed something different. Kyle ran to his seat trying to keep his head down to avoid the evil glares from his teacher for being late. When he finally looked up from his phone, he saw the most beautiful person he had ever seen in his life. Everyone in his class normally was either sleeping or staring off in the distance, but for some reason, today they were all rapt with attention at the teachers new friend. This person had a visible aurora around him with the calm peaceful stare as if he had just been told that he didn't have to work again in his life. The man had a fully-grown brown beard that resembled the perfect groom to unkempt ratio that made his appearance look as if had but hadn't tried to look that way. Then as Kyle was inspecting the man, he spoke with a glossy, bassy rumble that is reserve for Neil De Grasse Tyson when he talks about the Cosmos, ""You all might be wondering what I'm doing here and who I am? Some of you are probably asking yourself, ""Jesus who is this guy?"" Haha, I understand, even your teacher was confused at first but I am your personal guide to life... I am Jesus, the school psychologist."" 

Everyone stared in shock. Then immediatly hands shot up and he said, ""Yes THAT Jesus. Here I am, returned in the flesh. I actually have my chariot of fire outside if you want to see that. The school wouldn't let me bring the Rolls Royce, they said it would be to ostentatious."" We all laughed at the poor attempt at a joke because of who we thought we were listening to. Kyle thought, ""Jesus Mother-Fuc.."" then Jesus said, ""Kyle don't say that."" Everyone turned and looked at Kyle because Kyle hadn't said anything. Jesus then apologized, ""Sorry everyone I forgot to tell you that I can hear your thoughts and they are to me as if you are saying them aloud. I came here to be the way, truth and the life of the school's counseling program.""

Seconds before the bell rung, almost as if perfectly timed, Jesus looked to Kyle and asked him to stay after homeroom. Everyone filed out being quiet, attentive, and organized because of the presence of calm that was in the room. Kyle sat with anxious jitters as the Son of God sat down next to him and asked, ""Kyle you look like you have been having a helluva day (wink to camera to break the fourth wall.)"" Kyle looked up to Jesus tearing up and said, ""Jesus, I have been so lonely with my dad passing and mom being torn up over her busy schedule... I am afraid that she will never find someone like my dad ever again because she does not have time to find someone or is scared to look and be disappointed in any man compared to the husband she had."" Jesus looked at him and said, ""Deep stuff Kyle, I was just going to ask how your day was cause you looked a little shaken up but I can assure you that your mom will find someone... That someone is me."" Kyle stood up and backed away from Jesus and said, ""WHAT MY MOM IS DATING JESUS?"" 

Jesus calmly said, "" Don't worry Kyle I have been there my friend... Well not exactly but I know the sins and temptations that you are facing...... Kinda. You are right that no man can replace your fathers work because he was the best man he could be so I decided to be the next man in your mothers life now get up and go to your next class or you will be late.""",BootlessPanda

*""Oh God, please...this isn't living...""*

I swear simply hearing her voice made me age by a year or two. She was my 'wheel'. Everyone has one. Something that consistently turns the time for you. 

*""Round and round...I have nowhere...no one...""*

**""But you have a wish""**

Simplicity had captivated me. My hands went to the fields, my heart with my family. Elizabeth went to the stars. She met travelers, warmongers, magicians...lovers.

She always returned. She always came home. Her embrace easily caught my age up to hers. And she knew these things. 

She knew.

**""Would you like to run - or dance?""**

*""GET MET OUT OF HERE.""*

So I asked her. I asked her to be mine. My promise. 

""No.""

*""NO!""*.

**""You no longer enjoy the stars? Did you finally realize you never understood what you were looking at?.""**

As she left I felt weak. I began hunching over. My skin grew pale. My breaths became heavy. In the morning she was gone. As I nearly was.

Gone. My life. I now had nothing but a hope. 

A hope that would become a wish.

A grudge.

And an eternal torment.

*""I want to die""*

**""You are dead.""**

I tried. I honestly did. I went back to my humble life. I feigned affection for a wife. For a son. For the dirt in the ground that suddenly meant nothing. For the stars I saw reminding me of what I promised.

*""I DESERVED HER!""*

**""Oh but you have so much more.""**

I finally set out to find her. I spent my remaining decade searching. I hadn't lived a day since she broke me. I needed to know how living felt again. I needed her.

**""Disappointment is delightful.""**

*""You're a monster""*

**""No, you are""**

She had passed. Behind her was a trail showing her adventure. Her husband. Her children. Something beautiful all people craved.

You can't die if you don't live.

*""I know what I am""*

**""Has it taken you this long?""**

*""I...""*

*""I'm immortal...""*

"[WP]Depressed and lonely, you sell your soul to Lucifer so he can be your friend",TacticalFox88,"**My New Best Friend**

I have always prayed, always been the kinda fellow who would walk the rightful path and go to church every Sunday. However they don't tell you that the rightful path can be a lonely one... I never had many friends in high school, or in College... i mean, I had acquaintances and there was always people around me, but never someone close to me.

I must have been nine years old, when I first prayed for a friend. I prayed every night, but nothing happened. I also did my best go get one on my own, but it would always end with me, face in the dirt, and back at the side of my bed, calling to the heavens for some extra help.

I had yelled, but they never listened... but maybe I had been speaking to the wrong audience?

It was easy, really, just some simple words on a full moon night, and suddenly my room was darkened by smoke and in front of me stood the tall, slender man with a skinny face, and glowing read eyes.

""You called me, mortal!"" he sighed, holding his composure. ""What object do you find of equal worth to you soul?"" he looked down at me.

""Ehh..."" words? ""I... I just want a friend..."" I wiped the tears of my cheeks as he raised his hand. ""Will you be my friend?""

He stopped his motion, and opened his eyes wide. ""You what?""

I got up from the floor. ""I want you to be my friend!""

He lost his composure, and walked towards me. Me manifested a chair and sat on it in front of me. ""Re... really?""

I nodded. ""Yes..."" I swallowed a lump. ""God never listens... so why not?""

Lucifer moulded a smile on his previously cold face. It was obvious that he rarely smiled. ""Really?!""

I swear a tear ran down his face. ""What... what is wrong?"" I handed him a handkerchief.

He dried his eyes. ""I'm sorry..."" he even chuckled. ""It's just... people always ask for material things... like money or cars... the closest people ever gets to this is to be someone else's friends or lover... but never this!"" he buried his head in the handkerchief and blew his nose.

I carefully raised a hand and padded his shoulder. ""There, there!"" I said carefully. ""It's okay... you can be my friend now!""

He looked up. ""You would sell your soul for that?""

I shrugged. ""I don't use it for anything else?""

""But you do realise what it means to lose your soul, do you?"" I shrugged again. ""You can't go to heaven, you can't get any help..."" I just looked at him. ""AND somehow electric doors have a hard time noticing you!""

""I don't care!"" and then the weirdest part happened; Lucifer grabbed me and pulled me into a hug.

After that he took my soul as payment, which he placed in the pocket of his black suit. ""It is done!"" he smiled as he looked down at me. ""You look pale!""

I looked at my hands. They were white as snow. ""Well, I guess I paid for it!"" I smiled at my new friend.

He smiled back before laying his hands on his chest, pulling out a red, pulsating light. He pulled it from his body and pushed it into mine. ""There you go..."" his smile grew. ""Friend!""

We have been best friends ever since.

"[WP] Scientists have discovered that right before you die, your brain releases a huge amount of dopamine and slows your mental perception of time so that your last few seconds of life feel like an eternity of bliss. Describe this moment in time from the perspective of someone experiencing it.",cucumbercat57,"Dr. Rigel felt his pulse begin to slow as the poison took effect.  The pounding of his blood in his ears provided the main beat of his swan song, while the banging on his door added syncopation, and the sirens outside formed the melody.    It wasn't Strauss, by any means, but it was still a beautiful tune to let your life slip away to.  He let his mind wander back to how it had all began.

Tannis Rigel had always been considered ""gifted,"" even from a young age.  For his ninth grade science fair project, he wrote a computer program that took a flea's DNA sample and constructed a perfect replica of that being's brain, including as much consciousness as such a creature was capable.  For his tenth grade project, he synthesized a chemical which could turn human skin cells into fully-functional stem cells.

They hadn't bothered making him finish high school; after Grade 10, he was offered a full scholarship to Harvard's Pre-Med program, which, of course, Tannis accepted.

After four years, Tannis Rigel left with three PhDs --- in Computer Science, Neurology, and Chemistry --- and went on to get his MD by his 21st birthday.

Many hospitals offered to take Dr. Rigel as a resident physician, but Tannis didn't want to work on people.  Tannis could diagnose their issues easily, but he just couldn't stand *people.*  They were so slow of thought, and so vapid, so obsessed with the trivial while ignoring the important things.  After a few minutes in a room with the average patient, it was uncommon if he hadn't insulted them a dozen times (never directly, you understand --- his mental sneers at them were redoubled by the fact that they rarely recognized the fact that he was lobbing insults at them).

For their part, the patients, while pleased with Dr. Rigel's accuracy, described him as ""creepy"" and even ""sinister.""  One patent went so far as to say that she felt like no more than a malfunctioning gadget to be inspected and prodded at, and ultimately repaired.

So, with no desire to practice medicine, Dr. Rigel naturally turned his talents towards research.  It was at a British think tank that Dr. Rigel made the twin discoveries that would forever cement his place in history. 

The first discovery Tannis found while building upon the stem cell research he had done for the science fair - he managed to engineer a treatment to return a person's cells to the same state they were in at the end of puberty - after the body had started growing, but, as he callously quipped in his paper, ""before they had started dying.""  This research was published in a dozen medical journals, and Rigel became a household name.  They named the treatment Adol-S.  He let his co-authors do the interview circuit, though, because he had something bigger that he was working on at the same time, privately.

Just as the anti-aging research had been based upon his stem cell work, he had also picked up his insect brain simulator.  After years of effort, he actually managed to replicate a complete, functional human brain (his own, of course) in software, constructed from the instructions encoded in his DNA.  It was marvellous.

Rigel put the ""brain"" through all sorts of simulations, seeing how it interacted chemically with the simulated body, and wrote notes furiously.  One curiosity that came up was an odd spike in dopamine levels just as the ""brain"" was about to ""die.""  He examined the data further, and determined that this must be the source of the stories of ""going into the light"" --- a moment, lasting only the smallest fraction of a second but with a perceptual time that seemed to stretch to infinity.

Tannis almost couldn't believe what he had found (but if anyone were going to find it, he supposed it would have been him).  All those who argued that heaven was real; all those who argued that it was all in believer's heads --- they were *both right*.  He typed out the paper and was about to send it off for peer review, when a thought hit him.

Many people were recovering from the effects of extreme age and debilitating injuries thanks to his Adol-S revitalization treatment, but some were refusing it on religious grounds, accepting pain, dementia, and disability due to their stubbornness in clinging to ridiculous beliefs.  He didn't remember all of that boring stuff about duty of care, but Dr. Rigel was sure it said something about helping them with their suffering.  He was sure of it.  He had to do something for these stupid, vapid, utterly inferior people!

Over the next few months, Dr. Rigel had visited the homes for the infirm, and wherever he went, those who had refused the Adol-S treatment succumbed to their various infirmities, each seemingly dying naturally from the effects of their illnesses.

Eventually (though he must admit, it took them much longer than it ought to have), they put it all together, and the police were now coming to arrest the notorious ""Angel of Death"" --- a ridiculous name, but very poetic, Tannis had to admit.

The door finally flew open as Dr. Rigel slipped into that eternal instant of time.  The heartbeats grew further and further apart, and Tannis felt that all was finally right with the world.  In time, they'd all know just what a genius he was.

*He was floating on a cushion of air.  Sunlight poured down on him as the waves crashed in from the shore.  He smelled the salty air and sighed as the moment of pure relaxation and contentment swallowed him whole.  He knew that it was all an illusion, but it was the last thing he was ever going to experience, so he let himself enjoy it.*

""Dr. Rigel.""

That was wrong.  No one else should be here in his private moment.  Well, no one he didn't want to be, and as there was no one he particularly liked (or, really, even more than tolerated), he should be all alone and at peace.  He tried to ignore it, but the waves were receding, and his heartbeat was once again roaring in his ears, its thumping bass synchronized but discordant with the whining treble of the beeping of the monitor.

""Ah, you're awake.  Your program told us you would be.""

Dr. Rigel opened his mouth to retort, and then realized he couldn't.  He couldn't move at all - couldn't so much as twitch an eyelid.

""Yes, you're paralyzed.  Our doing, I'm afraid.""  The voice, deep and rich, might have been pleasant under different circumstances, but trapped here after his moment of bliss, it grated like a cat's tongue against his ears.

Tannis tried again to speak, but although he felt every bit of his body, none of it responded to his commands in the slightest.

""When we figured out it was you, Doctor, we hacked your computer and found that very interesting paper.  We figured you'd try to end it all, considering what you'd figured out about death, so we had an injection of your cure-all with us when we raided your house.  We couldn't let you go that easily.  Not after what you'd done.""

The beeping sped up on the heart monitor.  *Well, at least that's under my control,* some wry, sardonic part of him contributed, but the rest of him was in a panic.  They were keeping him paralyzed, as punishment for his crime?  That was...

""Cruel and unusual,"" the voice said.  ""Yes, we know, but you see, no one knows that's what we're doing.  to everyone else, we're just administering your own Adol-S drug, and it's somehow failing to reverse your paralysis.  Never fear, though, we're leaving you in good company.  Enjoy your eternal youth and health.  Goodbye, Dr. Rigel.""

Footsteps away.  After seven hundred and fifty-six heartbeats, more footsteps.

""Ah, Dr. Rigel.  I'm Greta, and I'll be taking care of you.  I can tell we're going to be fast friends.  Let me tell you about my cats...""

As part of him screamed in agony at the thought of one-sided banal conversation for all eternity, part of Dr. Rigel's brain was already constructing his next experiment: is it possible for a person in extreme distress to will himself to death?    He was quite certain he'd succeed, eventually.  After all, he had all of the time in the world to try...",Nimelennar

"[WP] Everyone has magic powers, but no-one knows other people have powers too.",oldawesomeguy,"""Look, John. I have something to tell you,"" he said, standing stiffly in the middle of the street. His breath forming white puffs of air and dissipating.

He should have been inside tonight, on his leather armchair beside a warm fire. But somehow, he wasn't. He simply couldn't. He had to get the words off his chest.

""S -,"" John began but was interrupted by his friend's heavy breathing. It was clear from his running that whatever he had to say was important. 

""I need to tell you...one last thing...before I leave you for good.""

John told his wife to go on ahead in case she caught a cold, but she stood firmly, covered with white powdery snow, against the bottom step.

""Then say it, dear lord. Just say --."" Again, he was interrupted, this time by his friend's hands. They were held palm-facing-forwards, like he was pushing against something. John's wife let out a little sigh.  

""See, John,"" his friend said, smiling nervously, ""I can create a temporal pause in time."" 

That was true. John had certainly noticed the tiny snowflakes, thousands, paused in motion before his face. His world felt slightly colder, but just slightly.

""Um, well, that's good for you...my dear friend. But my wife is getting cold, and so...we must retire. Uh...see you tomorrow, then?"" 

""Goodnight, Mr. Holmes."" 

Sherlock looked puzzled for a moment. If for whatever reason a bystander happened to see him at that moment, they would reckon that he'd turned himself into an ice sculpture, standing there gathering snow, with his mouth slightly agape. Something worthy of an art gallery for sure. 

But if they had followed his gaze instead, they would have seen an even more marvelous spectacle: spirits, no, two people - an elderly man, and woman - gliding like spirits through a second-floor window. They would have seen John glance back with a worried expression, and say, “Go home, Holmes.”  

Somewhere, a little further down the street, a lamp switched on.

[WP] Create and implement your own magic system,Irishpersonage,"I posted this on r/worldbuilding, it think it fits here too. 

For human magic users, theres a lot of meditation, preparation, concentration, brewing, and measuring involved. The amount of magic you use at once directly affects your energy level, which is why its best to prepare spells in advice. Casting a spell through sheer force of will can tire you out, but only to the point that spells become weaker over time. Joining together causes spells to become more powerful, depending on how powerful the person joining is. Since energy means more power, any type of stimulant (caffeine, sugar, amphetamines, cocaine is especially popular) is precious to any magic user. Different styles of magic casting the same spell can yield different results, but its not impossible to learn spells of different origins (i.e. A voodoo specialist using an ancient form of blood magic). 

Vampire magic is different since it is restricted to the five elements (water, fire, earth, air, spirit), yet remains just as versatile as human magic. Vampire magic starts from within and is then projected outward to affect the physical world. If the magic is activated but kept inside the body, it creates an invisible aura that protects the vampire from excessive force as well as increase natural abilities (strength, speed, stamina) to an absurd degree. Vampire battles can last for hours and cause massive destruction due to this. When a vampire masters their birth element, they do one of three things: gain a secondary non-elemental ability, gain the ability to manipulate another element, or develop an affinity in a certain aspect of their element (water user develops affinity for ice or steam). Vampire can also learn up to third tier human spells (there are five tiers). However human cannot used vampire magic, but they can channel vampire magical energies to power their own spells.  Vampire blood also has magical properties that bestow human with vampire-like abilities. ",tommydmac

This isn't a real haiku because it lacks season words, inserts emotion (""beloved"") and deals with concepts instead of sense impressions.  

...but I used a hyphen for the cutting word (kireji) so let's pretend it's legit. 

Also I think English-language haiku should not follow the 5-7-5 structure (which is more appropriate for the Japanese language and not English), and instead English-language haiku should shoot for somewhere between 10 and 13 total syllables.  

Everyone should read [Japanese Haiku: It's Essential Nature and History](http://www.amazon.com/Japanese-Haiku-Essential-Nature-History-ebook/dp/B005LPUAUE/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1461867625&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=japanese+haiku) by Kenneth Yatsuda. It's amazing.  ",hpcisco7965

A small blue-ish, hairy-ish, imp-ish, certainly not earth-ish being said from below. I was shocked. Aghast really. Moments ago I spotted a glint off to the side of my trail up the West African coastline and came to investigate. When something blue, which I knew was a color not normal along my sandy trail, began to bob around the gleaming object my intrigue grew.

The figure was maybe they size of my hand, and what he was dancing around wildly looked like a childs toy space saucer. You know the ones, the disc-like flying machines everyone imagined in the 60's and 70's. It was silly, but here he was, a little alien. Around his little space ship. ""Didn't you HEAR me! Get OUT of my earth light!""

""What?"" Oh...my shadow was falling upon the little blue humanoid and his ship. I side-stepped and the blazing African sunlight reflected brightly off the metal craft. ""Sorry about that. So uh, why are you here? Do you come to make contact with humanity? Should I take you to my leader or something? Oh my god...you're not here to declare war on the planet are you?!?""

""No, I'm not here for any of that. My kind have been coming here for a long time now. We are doing years of studies on your Earth light. YEARS! Your planet takes light, filters it, and allows these...plants...to grow. My kind are interested and want our own form of your earth light to grown our own plants.""

""That...makes no sense. It's just a normal wavelength. Surely you can...""

""SILENCE! You know nothing. Your earth light is special because I say it is. And by the way, I have landed here in the middle of your Africa to be ALONE in my studies. Now leave me be."" I reached over into my backpack for my bottle of water. Surely I was hallucinating all of this. It made no sense.

Slowly he turned the doorknob and opened the door.

The room behind looked like that of a pubescent boy. Above a messy bed the wall was covered with posters of superheroes and some good-looking models. Besides stood a bookcase crammed with comics, fantasy novels and computer magazines. Everywhere were small figures, Simon realized Chewbacca, Batman and many more. On a small desk empty pizza boxes piled loose on top of notepads and school folders. The floor was covered with clothes and other stuff, and the room smelled musty.

Opposite to the bed was a comfortable-looking sofa, with a man sitting on it. He was deep immersed in the pillows and leaning far backwards. Obviously, he had made himself very convenient.

The man wore loose-fitting black trousers and a black hoodie. On the chest, a white skull was smiling, with his red tongue sticked out and a finger showing to the viewer.
Most bizarre was the man's head. Huge glasses hid most of his face, so that Simon could not say for sure whether it was really a man. The glasses were large and clumsy, rather quite a helmet, from which some cable led to a computer.

The man had a cocktail glass in his right hand, filled with a pink liquid, ice cubes swimming on the top. A green umbrella graced the cocktail. The left hand involved a device with buttons, which he expressed sometimes.

""What...?"" stammered Joan and clapped her hands to her face.

""What the hell is that?"" called Marc.

Simon digested his initial shock and took a step toward the person. The man seemed to be completely absorbed by his device and didn’t notice the newcomers. Simon looked at the glasses closely.

""Isn’t this a Oculus?"" he asked puzzled.

""Really?"" called Marc and came closer. ""Fuck. You're right! The world is ending and this guy is drinking a cocktail and playing computer games?""

""Whether he know what happened?"" asked Joan. ""Maybe it's a kind of nerd wearing day and night this thing on his head.""

""Well, at least for refilling his cocktail and to go for a slash he must from time to time get up."" said Marc. His eyes were fixed on the pink liquid. They suffered for days thirst and this guy had *ice cubes*? Marie only consisted of skin and bones. And this asshole drank *cocktails*? Adrenaline flowed through Marc's body. He felt blood rushing in his head, touched his forehead and staggered. He does not understand the world anymore. What a twisted shit! Furious, he lunged forward and pulled the Oculus down the man’s head.

""Hey, bum! You have a visitor!"" he screamed.

Simon, Marc and Joan stared at the person. Without glasses they could now see his face. Or at least they should... confused, they blinked and rubbed their eyes. No matter how hard they tried, no one could get a clear look at his face.

""Hey, what ...?"" said Joan.

The person stood up and straightened his clothes. Embarrassed, he took the cocktail glass from one hand to the other. Finally, he looked at the glass, shrugged and put it carefully on the desk.

""Um."" he said.

Simon rubbed his temples. He did not hear what the person said, but noticed words directly in his head. The voice reminded him of ashes, the embers of a fire, the wind, howling at night through the streets. And especially to the old people's home, where his grandfather had gone years ago.

""Um. Well, now I’m a little bit embarrassed. Are you humans?” asked the person.

Endless seconds passed, in which the three friends stood motionless.

""You live, eh? With blood and breath and all that?"" asked the person again.

Simon gathered first.

""Yeah. Humans. Of course, we are humans. Why the hell do you ask?""

The person turned to him. A chill raced through his body. He shivered.

""The devil has nothing to do with that, haha."" He scratched his head, or what was the head usually.

""So, you know, actually, I thought that the end of the world has taken place. And all people, well, are dead, you know."" said the figure. 

Simon thought of spades, of soil and of deep holes in the ground.
Joan took a few steps back until she met the wall and squealed.

""Therefore, I have made myself a little comfortable. You know, a well-deserved retirement and so on."" continued the person.

""What do you blather, man?"" called Marc. ""Let's see what you've played since."" Apparently he had decided to ignore the strange voice of the person and to pretend as if the situation was normal. He took the glasses and put them on.

""I'd rather not... oh dear."" said the person and drooped.

""A PORN?"" shouted Marc stunned.",matfeheld
"[WP] It's the end of the world, and with humanity wiped out Death believes his work is done. Until he is found by a small group of survivors.",justastudent89,"""Do you hear that?"" Simon asked.

The others didn’t react. Why should they? They were filthy figures starving for days and hadn’t seen a soul outside their group. Since the damn day when the earth went down overnight.

""Hey. Don’t you hear that? A buzz!"" Simon cried excitedly. ""That sounds like a generator!""

Marie responded first. Her graceful figure was emaciated. Between stinking rags and a thick patina of filth her sickly-looking skin stretched over her bones.
She stopped. Even this simple action cost her power. She lifted her head cautiously and listened.

""You're right."" she whispered, using all her energy reserves. Her throat burned and her vocal cords ached like hell. She hadn’t used them for a long time. Talking cost energy, and energy was the only thing what they still possessed. Everything else .. everything else was gone. Just disappeared. Her partner, her family, her home. All parts of a previous life, before this goddamn day.

""That's the hum of a generator."" she said. Her dry mouth felt uncomfortable when speaking. She frowned as she remembered. Spittle. Her body hardly produced any causing a strange feeling while opening and closing her lips.

""Do you know what that means?"" exclaimed Mark the end of the small group. ""If so many days after that damn day a generator is still running, someone has to maintain it. Or someone has recently started it!”
The last sentence he cried enthusiastically, gesturing wildly with his arms in the direction of the noise.
Despite the hardships Marc had kept his athletic figure. Previously he had run for breakfast ten kilometers just to get his circulation going. Now he was the only one whom hunger was not yet written in the face.

In the middle of the group Joan and Yihao walked. Five friends who had missed together the downfall of mankind and wandered for days through this fucking misery, looking for food and any sign that they weren’t alone.

""Come on, let’s look!"" Marc encouraged the others. ""Maybe there are people. With fresh water and something to eat!""

""He's right."" said Yihao.

""We should be careful. What if they do not welcome us?"" Joan said suspiciously. ""When they walk on their bones like we do, they won’t certainly want to share anything.""

Marc laughed scornfully. ""What could they do to us? We have no equipment, no food, not the least of value. Don’t be so negative. Don’t you want to know whether there might be other survivors, then?""

Joan frowned and crossed her arms in front of her body. Bucky she pinched her lips together. ""I say we look elsewhere for food."" she said, and looked invitingly in the round.

Marie avoided her eyes and looked embarrassed to the ground. ""I'm thirsty."" she whispered. She didn’t like inconsistencies in their group, but was too thirsty to agree blindly with Joan as usual.

""We’ll be ok."" said Yihao. ""We are five. We will show them who’s taking something from whom"" He squinted and clenched his fists.
Joan rolled her eyes and snorted. Then she turned to Simon.

""And? What about you?"" she asked.

Simon chose his words wisely. He didn’t want to offend Joan. She was always so short-tempered. He wanted her to keep a cool head when they approached to the unknown sound.
""I think we should be careful. You could be right, and there wait hazards. But the risk is worth the chance of finding people and food. We can not hide at every opportunity. We won’t survive for long."" he said quietly.

""Yihao.” he said to the group. “You stay here with Marie. When something bad happens, she is not fast enough and needs help.""

Yihao spat annoyed at the floor. ""Why me?"" he said. ""Stay here yourself!""

""No. Maybe they are okay, but maybe they have something against .. well, against Asians. I would not like to have this risk."" In truth Yihao was too explosive, even more than Joan. No way he wanted to complicate her first encounter with other survivors by his nature unnecessarily. His excuse was stupid, but he couldn’t think of another one.
Yihao grunted and kicked a stone into the bushes. Simon took that sign as an agreement.

""Joan, Marc."" said Simon. ""Come, let us look at the source more closely. If something goes wrong, come back here.""

The three young friends proceeded. The building with the sound was a common house with a small front garden. The windows were closed and the curtains drawn. Carefully they walked once around the building and found on the back a small wooden shed.
Marc approached to the door.

""It’s open."" He called and peered inside. ""There is really a generator. It runs with gasoline, I think.""

""Then here are really other survivors. Let's go inside the main building."" said Simon.

Seconds later they stood at the front door and looked at each other questioningly.

""Shall we call, or rather go in quietly?"" asked Joan the obvious question. Marc shrugged. Simon frowned.

""We should announce ourselves to avoid the host to beat us with a baseball bat. I don’t like that kind of surprises"" said Simon.
 ""Hello? Hello! We now come in!"" he shouted.

Silence. After a brief look at his friends Simon opened the door. He slowly walked into the hallway. Everywhere lay objects on the floor. A jacket was in the corner, somewhere else a bag and a broken cell phone. On the wardrobe hung a long hooded coat. It looked old-fashioned. Simon blinked irritated when he looked at the coat. It was black, as if it would swallow all the light. Simon could not even discover wrinkles. It was as if there hung a black spot, free from any brightness.

Simon shuddered and rubbed his eyes. On the wardrobe hung an ordinary black coat, without any specificity. Irritated Simon turned away and walked on. The others followed him.
At the end of the corridor they came into the living room. It was just a common one with a large dining table with wilted flowers, a dusty sofa and several display cases and cabinets. There were two more doors to the right.

Joan ran to the first one and listened. Simon looked at her questioningly, but she just shrugged her shoulders.
At the second door Marc raised a warning arm. He pressed his ear against the door and listened.

""Be quiet. I hear something."" he whispered, now pressing his whole head against the door.

""What is it?"" Joan asked excitedly.

""Watch out! I think .. I do not know. Once again a buzz or something. A .. blower? A fan? Yes, I think it could be a computer fan!"" whispered Marx.

""If there is still a computer running, someone has to be there using it, don’t you think?"" Simon speculated. ""Let's see.""

"[WP] You find money everywhere, but now it is getting ridiculous.",thecodexlegend,"""Find a penny, pick it up,"" he said, bending over to pick up the shiny copper, ""all day long, you'll have good luck!"" Pocketing the change, he carried on his walk with a smile on his face. He needed some good luck today, and surely this was a sign.

Beside him, his sister groaned. ""You always attracted money, like some kind of coin magnet. You always have, ever since we were kids!""

Sending a smirk her way, he shook his head, his hair almost long enough now to actually move with the motion. ""I'm just observant. If you actually paid attention, you would find money everywhere too.""

His sister frowned as they walked down the sidewalk, heading deeper into the city. ""That's why I don't carry cash. Too easy to get lost or stolen.""

A rebuttal of, ""Haven't you lost your debit card three times this year already?"" died on his lips as he launched forward, carefully unwrapping a 1 dollar bill from the bars of a sewer grate.

His sister grimaced. ""Ew.""

He just smiled brighter. ""See? Being observant pays off.""

She kept on walking, and he laughed as he caught up with her. The pair walked in silence passed shops with oddly (""fashionably"") dressed mannequins staring out from the windows. He noticed his sister eyeing a particular purse with wondrous envy, and he wished so much that he could buy her something like that, some kind of gift for always coming with him, always being there.

Something squished under his foot, and he stopped. ""Hey,"" he breathed out, then laughed. ""Hey, look at this!""

His sister shot him an unbelieving look. ""No way,"" she said, even as he bent down to pick it up. ""No friggin' way! Is that a 20??""

He pocketed the money with a bright smile. He glanced at the shop's name, memorizing it to come back later for the purse. ""Maybe I am just lucky.""

Her unbelieving stare melted into warm affection. ""Yeah, well, if anyone deserves some luck today, it's you.""

He gave her his patented everything's-gonna-be-okay-big-sister smile, throwing an arm over her shoulder as they continued their walk.

Finally, they came to the hospital. It was big, with multiple buildings connected by crosswalks and bridges. His favorite part was the playground in the center courtyard. He was far too old to play now, but he enjoyed sitting at the benches under the trees and reading his newest book.

Once inside, they made their way down winding hallways, passing people who always seemed so gray. Maybe because of their illness, or the lighting, or stress, he didn't know. But everyone, no matter what color, looked gray in a hospital. 

Once in the room, he hopped up on the exam table, only to feel an extra crinkle under his butt, more than the typical crinkle of the paper that lined the table. He reached down and pulled out the offending object with horror.

His sister, who had been reading the informational posters on the wall that she had all but memorized at this point, glanced over at his movements. Her jaw dropped.

""Is that- Is that a hundred dollar bill??"" she asked, bewildered.

He nodded, staring at Benjamin Franklin's face in awe. ""Someone must have left it behind. We'll stop by the receptionist on the way out and turn it in. This is a lot of money, someone's probably looking for it.""

The doctor came in, then, leaving no time to talk. His face was grim.

They turned the money in, but on their way home, he just found more. A $20, and a few $5's, and even a roll of money abandoned on the side of the road. It didn't matter, though. Nothing mattered.

The cancer was back. He wasn't going to make it.

Somewhere, in a different dimension, slightly higher than a human's level of perceiving, a being many would say was an angel hung over the boy's room, weeping into its wings. It kept sending the boy money, it fixed their apartment's broken air conditioning, and it gave both him and his sister extra chicken nuggets in their dinner from McDonald's. None of it mattered. Its charge was going to die, and he never even got to enjoy the life he had.

The guardian angel wept for the boy, for failing him.",HabitBandit
"[WP] ""Death, I'm a little busy right now!""",thecodexlegend,"""Death, I'm a little busy right now!"" 

""Jac, you know what you're doing isn't right. It's not what you're here for."" Jac stopped, fist raised as he stared down at the bruised, battered, swollen, and bleeding face, numbly staring back at him through a red eye, the other swollen shut to the size of a golf ball. He felt a cool a hand around his wrist, a tight cold grip easily holding him back. ""Jac....""

Jac released the man and pulled his arm free as he rose and glared at death. ""Fuck you! I don't care if it's not right! That son of a bitch deserves it! He caused all this, it's his fault dammit!"" Jac yelled. ""She back becuase of what he did to her, why can't I give him to her?"" He demanded of Death, his eyes narrowed and teeth clenched.

""Becuase Jac, it's not right. He doesn't deserve this. Your job isn't to punish him, your job is to put her to rest."" Death said coolly and he pulled the woman up by her wrist. ""She's suffereing Jac. She's a tortured soul who clawed her way into a body that released her, she's in pain, agony, that's why she's enraged."" He told Jac. ""Your job is to help her.""

Jac looked to the woman, glaring at the man lieing up on the ground with green casts eyes, trying to swipe at him with a furred clawed hand, nashing fanged teeth and hissing violently. Then he looked to the man, the vile wretch, laying on the ground half drunk, half conscious from being beaten by hands that should broke from the blows but never failed. Rage filled him as he stared down at the disgusting thing laying on the dingy carpet of the old trailer. He pushed the bowling shirt away from his side and reached around his back and pulled out the ornately decorated .38, etched with ruins and symbols by death himself. He aimed the gun at the man on the ground. ""Jac, don't. You know this isn't right, this isn't how it's suppose to be."" Death said with an icy calmness. 

""I don't care. He doestn' deserve to get to keep going, she didn't. He made sure."" Jac growled as he pulled back the hammer. 

""Jac...""

""She was a child. She was eighteen fucking years old."" Jac snapped, a burning tear running down from the corner of his eye. ""He drugged her, and he raped her, and he fucking killed her! She didn't have a fucking chance!""

""Jac....""

Jac turned to Death, aiming the gun at him. ""She deserves to get hers, she deserves to tear him apart.""

""You know the gun won't work on me, I made it, and not stupid.""

""I know it won't kill you, but I'm sure it'll hurt like hell to get hit in the forehead.""

""Don't do this Jac. I hired you to do a job. Do it! Put her to rest."" 
Jac stared at Death, then to the pile of filth at his feet beginning to snivel and cry, begging for him to not kill him, to the snarling she beast held firmly in Death's grasp. ""Do your job Jac.""

""God fucking dammit!"" He yelled as he pulled the trigger. 

Death sighed. 

The filth on the ground fell silent.

Jac slammed his free fist into the peeling, veneer of the walls, leaving splintery holes that scratched and tore at his hands. 

The she beast fell to the ground, a smoking crater in the back of her skull where the .38 slug blew through. 

""God I fucking hate my job,"" Jac muttered as he shook his hand and slipped the revolver back under his shirt. He looked to the woman, the animalistic features gone from her pretty young face as she lay on the dirty carpet, her eyes staring. He sighed heavily and shook his head and turned to go out the door. A cold hand landed upon his shoulder. 

""I never said it would be easy. ""Death said coolly. ""But you did the right thing. I knew you would.""

""Fuck off,"" Jac said as he shrugged his hand off. 

At Death's feet the man crawled up and began thanking him through tears and sobs, thanking him for stopping Jac and saving his life. Death looked down at him with cold emptiness. Kneeling down, he stared into the mans eyes, then smiled. ""I'll see you in few weeks."" He said patting the man on the head and walking out the door after Jac.",MrMetalhead69

""Houston, we have a problem.""

The transmission lag was immense, as a radio wave struck through the solar system, headed to a tiny blue planet. The entire command center seemed to hold its breath at the lead astronaut's voice rang out of the speakers mounted on the wall. 

Astronauts are well trained. They have to pass numerous psychological and physical tests, as well as a rigorous test about the various systems of the rocket they would be using. For an astronaut to say that they had a problem would be an understatement, and for the mission leader to say that they had a problem, well, that would be an understatement that  would threaten the lives of everyone onboard the ship. Those five words weren't said lightly. 

A second transmission came through:

""Houston, the rings of Saturn-"" There was an immense burst of static. 

""The rings of Saturn are alive!"" 

The Houston Command Center held its breath for a small moment. Eyes widened, gasps started. The mission commander was the first to move.

""Alright, someone get me a contingency plan. Jerry, get the White House on the line, and tell them we may have first contact. Reginald, get the DoD on the line, tell them we may have to implement Strategy Epsilon."" Speaking back into the radio in a hushed voice, ""Mission Leader, have they hailed you?""

Cash only at the very first, as I had no way of dealing with or disposing of money of the plastic variety. I met some people in the third year of my thieving. Well, *met* is a bit of a bit of a lie. They found me and needed my skills to pick up some intelligence, discreetly. They, in turn, introduced me to certain.... associates of theirs, who instructed me on all sorts of nefarious acts. 

The only way I could possibly screw the arrangement up was if I did something truly stupid, like getting caught. Which I did. 

Thankfully, I was only caught for petty theft, and I only spent a few days in jail. 

I cleaned up my act after that. I had a significant nest egg from applying what my teachers had so graciously taught me before my incarceration. They refused to see me after, afraid that I had somehow become an informant during my time in jail. 

But I didn't need them. I invested my nest egg wisely, using only the most discrete of investors. The returns were... quite substantial, so substantial, in fact, that I quit thieving for money. My investments were already giving me more than I could ever acquire through thieving, and I thought back on all the people I had robbed from. I kept the wallets, which my instructors often told me was a dumb idea. I went back through them, searching for personal details. Then, planning my movements carefully, I started gifting them. 

I really tried to remember the amounts, I really did. I even calculated interest. Then, I cased the joint like I was really going to rob my victims again, and left them a bunch of cash in some really obvious place. Then, quickly as I came, I left, the only evidence I was ever there being a giant pile of money.

I can only hope that I've done more good than bad. Some of my neighbors have been able to pay off their tuition, medical bills, and the like with my gifts. I only hope I didn't inconvenience them too badly.",Nick_Flamel

*Gary looks up to see another man peering over the edge of the cubicle. This is KYLE.*

**GARY:** Oh, good morning, Kyle! How was your weekend?    
**KYLE:** Fine, fine.    
**GARY:** Glad to hear it!

*Kyle does not respond.*

**GARY:** (*CONT'D*) Uh... did you need something?    
**KYLE:** Did you have a good commute this morning, Gary?    
**GARY:** I... I suppose, yes. Why?    
**KYLE:** Did anyone follow you?    
**GARY:** Follow me? Why would anyone do that?

*Kyle shakes his head.*

**KYLE:** Don't worry about it. Have a good day, Gary.

*Gary looks ready to say something else, but Kyle ducks out of sight. After a few moments, Gary rises from his chair and walks briskly toward the office's break room.*

*Upon arrival in the break room, Gary encounters an overweight woman in a gaudy dress. This is SHARON.*

**SHARON:** Oooooh, Gary! You look nice today!    
**GARY:** Hi, Sharon. Thanks.    
**SHARON:** Do you have a date?    
**GARY:** I always dress like this.    
**SHARON:** Well, have you been working out, then? Maybe over at that gym on Fourth Street?    
**GARY:** What are y...    
**SHARON:** (*Interrupting*) Remind me, what's the name of that gym?    
**GARY:** What gym?    
**SHARON:** You know! The one where everyone talks in that funny language. What language is that?    
**GARY:** I'm sorry, I really don't...    
**SHARON:** Oh, that's right! It's Russian! They speak Russian there, don't they?

*Before Gary can reply, another man walks into the break room. He is shorter than Gary, and much older. This is JOHN, Gary's boss. He speaks with a thick accent.*

**JOHN:** Gary. Sharon is bothering you?    
**GARY:** Oh, no, Mister Smith. We were just talking.    
**JOHN:** *Da*. Talking is good. (*To Sharon*) About what were you talking?    
**SHARON:** Oh, nothing! Nothing at all! Toodles!

*Sharon hurriedly waddles out of the room, at which point John turns back to Gary.*

**JOHN:** Gary. You are good worker. Perhaps it is time for you to get special assignment.    
**GARY:** Thank you, Mister Smith, but I'm really...    
**JOHN:** (*Interrupting*) Is no trouble. You will carry briefcase.    
**GARY:** ""Briefcase?"" I'm an analyst, Mister Smith. I don't...    
**JOHN:** (*Interrupting*) Briefcase will contain bomb.

*Gary looks shocked.*

**GARY:** A *bomb?!*    
**JOHN:** (*Chuckling*) No, no, not *bomb.* Business Overview Management Brief. B-O-M-B. Is very important for quarterly shareholder meeting.    
**GARY:** (*Relieved*) Oh, thank... yes, Mister Smith, I'd be honored.    
**JOHN:** Good! Briefcase must be delivered to man in alleyway.    
**GARY:** ... What?    
**JOHN:** Is courier.    
**GARY:** Actually, I have to finish last week's KPI report.

*John's eyes narrow.*

**JOHN:** Yes. Perhaps you shall carry bomb next week.

*John leaves the break room without another word. Gary, still looking shocked, opens a cupboard, ostensibly in search of something to put in a cup of coffee. Inside the cupboard is a man in a black suit. This is TONY.*

**GARY:** Good morning, Tony.    
**TONY:** Good morning, Gary.    
**GARY:** Sugar, please.

*Tony rummages around beneath and behind him, revealing several microphones and tape-recorders as he does. Eventually, he produces a small cardboard box containing individual sugar packets.*

**TONY:** Don't use the green ones.    
**GARY:** Why not?    
**TONY:** Cyanide.

*Gary laughs aloud.*

**GARY:** Thanks, Tony, I needed that. I've had a weird morning.

*Gary nods at Tony, then closes the cupboard. He makes himself a cup of coffee, then leaves the break room.*

CUT TO:

INT. AN OFFICE BUILDING - MORNING

*Gary does not notice everyone peering over cubicle walls at each other. Upon arrival back at his desk, Gary finds Kyle waiting for him.*

**KYLE:** Gary. I'm glad you're back.    
**GARY:** What is it now?    
**KYLE:** There's no easy way to put this, Gary... but I think Sharon likes you.

*Gary eyes Kyle suspiciously.*

**GARY:** What, were you eavesdropping on us?    
**KYLE:** No, Tony told me. He's one of ours.    
**GARY:** ""Ours?""    
**KYLE:** You know... the Corporate Insight Accountants.    
**GARY:** Right. Sorry, if you don't mind, I have some work do to.

*Without another word, Kyle leaves the cubicle. Gary sits down and places his coffee cup in front of a small potted plant.*

**JOHN:** (*O.S.*) Gary!    
**GARY:** Oh, sorry!

*Gary nudges the coffee cop slightly to the right of the potted plant. A tiny camera is seen within its leaves. Without further ceremony, Gary logs into his computer and pulls up a spreadsheet.*

James stood transfixed by the blood, only reacting when the form of the old woman began to melt away and reform into something much wetter and much larger.

INT. A CHURCH - MORNING

*Throngs of people crowd into the main chapel of a church, each of them intent on finding a seat in the pews. Organ music begins soon after, and the PRIEST walks into view at the pulpit. People in the crowd sing along to the hymn being played, then stand in anticipation.*

**PRIEST:** In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.    
**EVERYONE:** Amen.    
**PRIEST:** The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.    
**EVERYONE:** And also with you.

*The priest offers a plastered-on smile to the crowd.*

**PRIEST:** Today is very special, as I'm sure you're all aware. As I read to you from the...    
**ALBERT:** (*O.S.*) (*Interrupting*) Oh, *shut up!*

*Everyone turns to stare at a man near the back of the church. He is clad in an ill-fitting suit, and has a generally disheveled appearance. This is ALBERT. He appears to be shouting at the empty pew to his left.*

**ALBERT:** (*CONT'D*) No, I don't care! You can just pipe down for an hour!    
**PRIEST:** Excuse me, sir, is there a problem?

*Albert looks up at the priest.*

**ALBERT:** You stay out of this, Father. Get on with your reading or whatever.    
**PRIEST:** Sir, you're disrupting the congregation.    
**ALBERT:** Oh, oh, *I'm* disrupting the congregation!

*Albert turns to regard the empty pew again, looking thoroughly irritated.*

**ALBERT:** (*CONT'D*) Did you hear that? Apparently *I'm* the problem!    
**PRIEST:** Sir, what...    
**ALBERT:** (*Interrupting*) Of course they bloody can't! That's not *my* fault, though, is it? You're the one pulling the Griffin act!

*A moment of silence passes, after which Albert rolls his eyes.*

**ALBERT:** (*CONT'D*) Not a *gryphon*, you idiot! *Griffin!* The main character in ""The Invisible Man?"" So much for being all-knowing!    
**PRIEST:** Is there something you need, sir? We can...    
**ALBERT:** (*To the priest*) I told you to mind your own business, Father. This is between me and your boss.    
**PRIEST:** ... What?    
**ALBERT:** (*To the empty pew*) Yes, I *know* he doesn't actually work for you. Maybe you should tell him that!

*Looking exasperated, the priest storms down from the pulpit and approaches Albert.*

**PRIEST:** Listen, sir, either tell me your problem, or please stay quiet.

*Albert sighs mightily, then turns to face the priest.*

**ALBERT:** Let me ask you something, Father. Let's say the Messiah himself showed up and told you that everything you thought you knew about God and salvation was wrong. What would you do?    
**PRIEST:** That's not for me to judge. I follow the...    
**ALBERT:** (*Interrupting*) Don't give me the runaround! I'll tell you what you would do: You'd tell your Savior that he was wrong, and you'd probably nail him to a tree!    
**PRIEST:** Now, hang on, just what...    
**ALBERT:** (*Interrupting*) And *then*, when that Savior decided to come back and fix all the problems that *somebody* had caused, he'd have to stay incognito the entire time!    
**PRIEST:** There's no...    
**ALBERT:** (*Interrupting*) He'd be like a janitor to you! Wandering around, cleaning up the mess, and never getting one goddamned ounce of respect for his work!

*The priest puts on a look of affected shock.*

**PRIEST:** Sir! Please watch your language! This is a house of the Lord!    
**ALBERT:** No, it isn't.

*Albert turns back to the empty pew.*

**ALBERT:** (*CONT'D*) Did you hear that? ""House of the Lord!"" That's the sort of thing that you've caused!

*Albert stays quiet for a moment, apparently listening to something only he can hear.*

**ALBERT:** (*CONT'D*) No, I'm not going to tell them that! *You* tell them!    
**PRIEST:** I'm going to have to ask you to leave, sir.    
**ALBERT:** (*Ignoring the priest*) What the hell did you just call me? No, go on, say it again!

*A moment of tense silence passes. Suddenly, Albert screams with rage and tackles the empty air. He rolls into the aisle, then comes up into a sitting position. With a series of quick motions, Albert pantomimes holding something in each hand, using them to strike a spot near the floor. A five-year-old CHILD leans over from his seat, grinning broadly.*

**PRIEST:** *Sir!*    
**ALBERT:** Stop hitting yourself! Stop hitting yourself!    
**CHILD:** Yeah, God! Stop hitting yourself!

*The priest gawks at the child, but then turns his attention back to Albert.*

**PRIEST:** Out! *Out!* There is no place for you here, spawn of Satan!

*Albert laughs maniacally, but appears to release whatever he was holding. He climbs to his feet, still giggling.*

**ALBERT:** Oh, oh, man... that's rich. Thanks, Father.    
**PRIEST:** Do you honestly expect me to believe that you are the Son of God in disguise?    
**ALBERT:** Excuse me? ""Son?"" No, no, you've got it all wrong.

*Albert straightens his clothing. The change is negligible.*

**ALBERT:** (*CONT'D*) No, I'm his older brother.    
**PRIEST:** ... *What?!*

*Without any warning, a colossal number of fish rain down from above, pelting everyone in the congregation and causing many people to scream in fright.*

**ALBERT:** Oh, *that does it!* I'm telling Mom!

*Albert storms from the church. The priest surveys the scene, mouth agape. He eventually regains his composure, then walks back up to the pulpit.*

**PRIEST:** Ahem. Well.

*An awkward and tense silence follows. All eyes are on the priest. A large trout flops forlornly on the altar.*

**CHILD:** (*O.S.*)(*Shouting*) He teacheth us to be fishers of men!    
**PRIEST:** Fuck it. Go in peace.

Soldiers and militia alike dived for cover, scrambling for previously made shell-holes or else hurriedly dug foxholes. Faith was too busy gaping at the squadron of incoming dragons to worry about her safety. Fortunately, Flint was looking out for both of them, the veteran Wild Goose seizing a hold of her and yanking her to cover. One howitzer shell landed dead center in a foxhole, the HE shell detonating in a shower of mud, brick and blood. 

Flint led her into the ruins of a broken church, its roof long torn off by weather and thieves. Puddles of water splashed underfoot as they ran towards a side chapel, the pews knocked aside or else piled into barricades. 

""Come on, this way!"" Flint shouted. ""This area has the strongest remaining walls- oh son of a bitch...""

Kneeling at the broken altar to some half-forgotten goddess was a man, his head a wild mass of hair.

Those are the words I like to repeat on nights like this, when the facility is running dark, and even the illuminated halls are flickering with the aged fluorescent bulbs under uncertain current. 

Those are the words I repeat, but only in my head. I don't talk aloud on nights like this, and I don't wear my boots' neither: Noise isn't something to be making.

Director knew my family, knew my father better than most. Pulled me in after his death, told me what I needed to know.

*""There'll be messes, and you're to clean them. There'll be noises, but you won't be making them. There'll be rules, and you'll be following them.""*

All true. All lies. 

The line blurs just like the water on the floor, beneath the mop in my hands.

What this place is, what they do here? I've wondered that for a long time. Five years in this place now, free room and board, night-shifts for the last seven years.

I don't often leave, so I see more than most. Watching through half-closed eyes as I wander past to see the white coats, the locked doors of reinforced steel and aluminum. During the day I see some of what I shouldn't, I respond to the Director's calls- should he make them. 

But a few more days and I'll be leaving, I think. Don't spend much of it, don't rarely need to. Seven years of that, and I think it's time to go.

Mop is turning red, and the floors are getting harder to bleach out. Those noises I hear... getting worse in the late of times. Voices and screams, the ragged breath of echoing lungs in the dark- when there ain't supposed to be. 

Nights like this, where I don't wear my boots. Nights filled with broken metal doors, and ripped white coats.

Looking at my reflection in the steel wall of the cabin I adjusted my Pith Helmet and ran a hand down the scarlet and white striped uniform. The airship groaned and slowed, fellow soldiers bumping into my shoulders all around everyone leaned at the change in velocity.

“Alright men!” Captain Jameson stepped through the door on a platform above, “Get ready! The savages are sieging Johannesburg, they number in the tens of thousands. We are the only reinforcements for two days . . .” There was an uneasy pause as the airship sank lower, dipping from the bright blue sky into thick gray clouds. The horses in the bay chuffed, their hooves clanking against the steel in anticipation. Captain Jameson looked down. “I’ll give it to you straight chaps, it’s bad down there . . . but your empire need you! The crops from here feed your wives at home right?” A cheer went up. I nodded and reached down, picking up the rifle, checking the silver bayonet was attached tightly.

“We have our king, and our song!” Another cheer rose and settled before a lone voice shouted out from the crowd.

“What shall we sing sir?” He called. There was a pause, before the captain rose his voice.

“Men of Harlach!” The men hooted and hollered “March to Glory!” More 
swiftly joined in as the clouds passed out the windows 

“Victory is hov'ring o'er ye,” I began to chant along as the clouds parted and the rain began to softly lap at the hull of the airship. The engines roared and I felt my weight lessen, we shot ever downward.

“Bright-eyed freedom stands before ye, Hear ye not her call?!” Outside the city extended on for miles, and beyond the high walls, a swirling mass of men pounded on the gates.

”At your sloth she seems to wonder; Rend the sluggish bonds asunder!” Two men in aviator’s suits walked up and grabbed the aluminum of the doors, sliding them far apart. The wind howled as the cold and wet blew in as our song bellowed out. The tension in the bay grew, eager men, ready for blood.

“Let the war-cry's deaf'ning thunder!” Outside, I watched the rest of our legion in the transports Wessex and The Black Prince break through the clouds above. Their silver hulls were swiftly followed by our gray and red escort corvettes The Courageous and The Agamemnon. Their guns began to boom through the sky, flashes signaling the lead they rained down upon the savage chanters.

“Every foe appall. Echoes loudly waking, Hill and valley shaking!” I marched forward as the airship landing strip rushed towards us. An open space in the center of the city, I set my shoulders back and stamped my boot.

“'Till the sound spreads wide around,” In the distance I could hear them now, the chanting of the savages, their deep voices bellowed across the land. Filling the rain and our song with the background of drums and madness.

“The Saxon's courage breaking; your foes on every side assailing, Forward press with heart unfailing!” The engines turned around, propellers pushing against the earth, throwing a damp dirt into the air. My legs weakened as the airship braked and settled a few feet over the land. Somewhere in the sea of men, the captain shouted. “GO GO GO!”

“Till invaders learn with quailing!” I leapt and landed on the soil, pausing for only a moment before rushing forward. Above, on a building, a Union Jack fluttered bright and unholed by the storm and seige. My heart leapt as personnel directed us and the other arriving units to weak points in the city walls a few miles away. Their blood would flow from wounds I would tear. Thunder would crack from my gun. The savages would hear my voice. For my King! For my Family! For the song! I broke into a run, followed by my legion, and my empire.

""This is the way to die!"" he told the pouring rain.  They tell me he was a prominent physicist.  No one else had any sort of educational connection to the event. It was just a bunch of lebensmutig young men. Or maybe just suicidals who figured this was the bravest way out. 

It's a portal, according to my brother. According to the news. A death trap, according to many, including my parents. Including the old physicist.  Both, according to me.  That it is a portal is undeniable. It has too powerful of a draw. When I first came to the site, following my brother like a duckling, I could feel it. It hummed in my bones and reverberated through my vision. In the span of ten minutes I developed what I can only describe as synesthesia. I wonder if it will ever go away, the association of sounds with textures and colors with sounds. My world is hallucinogenic now. It's oddly soothing.

The news crews buzzed around us, nearly overpowering the thrum of the portal, as several research teams debriefed the five and their witnesses - myself included. My brother and the others were hooked to harnesses attached to enormous winches that sat just beyond the cameras. Then. The last goodbyes. At least, the last ones according to the witnesses. And the physicist. The other four insisted this was only the beginning, that they would be back and that more could explore the portal. They were the only ones who felt sure. The five stepped into the portal and everyone else stepped back. Colors thrummed as the air pulsed. And they were gone.

It's been two hours. The lines leading into the portal are still taut. The news crews are still sitting around but their cameras haven't been rolling for quite some time. We are all waiting. I can still hear textures - the trees around the portal are particularly fascinating. 

We are still waiting.

How much longer?

I think....

I think my brother is gone.

But the line is still taut.",kat_aracts

[WP] A single portal is discovered in a forest. The world anxiously watches as we send our first roped volunteer in.,TinyAnimalParty,"""Therefore, I conclude that the portal will translocate each and all of its entrants to a random global position."" Before a dumbstruck crowd, the old physicist stroked his yellow beard, and tapped the residual ash from his pipe.  

It quickly caught the imagination, especially of the young. A grand adventure, it seemed. Men and women arrived, loaded from head to toe with food, water, and survival tools. Some seemed confident of where they were headed: A bearded man in a parka donned sunglasses, snow boots, salopettes, a thick seal fur coat, and entered with a sled and a convoy of dogs. Another man - perhaps more optimistic, though less adventurous - stepped through wearing nothing but Speedos and suntan lotion.  

The old man, however, stayed well clear, and smugly sucked on a back draught of saliva and singed tobacco. None of the adventurers were ever seen again. And it wasn't that the old crackpot had told a lie, nor was he wrong. It was that, when he had said that ""the portal will translocate each and all of its entrants to a random global position,"" well that was *precisely* what he meant. Scores of hair brained, cocksure adventurers were stepping straight into random positions in the earth's crust, mantle, and core.  

The old codger chuckled to himself as he imagined the bafflement when future discoveries were made of Speedo clad sun worshippers, half infused in mountainous rock; or that of an Arctic explorer, complete with his sled and dogs, being chipped out of a quarry in Wales.",cobblebug

It's something along those lines, a story should begin where it begins.

[OT] Ask Jackson #6342: Time Shenanigans,Writteninsanity,"In my contest entry, I used kind of a non-linear approach for the beginning, which was met with mixed results.  I liked it because it was a nice tease to how much of a bad ass my character ends up.  And it had some contemplation which helps setup a future character that's important to the storyline.  While one person really liked it too, someone else thought the whole scene was unnecessary.  I wonder if there is a better way to handle such a thing or does it all depend on the reader's tastes?

As my entry goes on, I time jump between a few chapters because I wanted to move through the character's training.  Kind of like in Castaway how Tom Hanks goes from waking up on the island to being an experienced survivor.  I'm not sure if I handled that well though.  I heard it came off disjointed.

[WP] You are a recently fired police officer in a society where music is outlawed. You accidentally walk into a secret music club.,hotchocolate365,"From birth, criminals were one of two things. 
Those who indulged in great evils,
And those who composed them.
Music, more known by its legal name ""erroneus rhythm  'or ""treasonous cacophony"" Is the ultimate taboo. I won't pretend I know everything about it, but it nearly collapsed the country. In the rebellions of decades past, messages and intelligence was spread through music. Passages, words ""sung"" at different pitches to pass on information. 
It's my job to make sure it stays gone. 
At least, it was. Their reason? ""Suspicious action or choice of words involving the nation."" 
Needless to say, I haven't quite caught up yet. The rain cascades down in the way it has for years, almost like a chorus of applause to congratulate my failure. I look up and realize that I've strayed far off my normal path home, focused instead on the horizon. Looming gray buildings, with decrepit doorways and a sea of graffiti present itself as if it were alive, imposing on the senses in a way that suffocates the beholder. Turning back towards the path, the rain shifts in tone. It's soft, almost sensitive to my distress, calling out in a way that felt otherworldly.  I'm frozen, the buildings stand taller and taller against the sky, in a mock challenge of power. But the sensitive tone continues, indifferent of the titanic buildings or the weight of the sky. I stagger forward, suddenly enraptured by the sound, desperate to drown myself in it. A door vibrates underneath my touch with the sound. I revel in it, echoing across my palms, caked with mud and the incessant rain. Trembling, I push open the door. A hall with hundreds of chairs, derelict in a unique way from burns to pieces missing, to crumbled pieces of wood. A lone figure occupies the stage.

I had indulged in a great evil,

And fallen in love with the maestro.

[WP] You finally reveal yourself as the superhero of the Internet,nahbroimgoodlol,"I haven't got any superpowers - I can't fly, I can't shoot lasers out of my eyes, I can't lift things with my mind, and I can't control minds (although that's debatable).

I haven't got any advanced technology. All I've got... is my MacBook Pro, and an Internet connection. A **VERY** good Internet connection.

Actually, that bit about 'no advanced tech' might be a bit of a lie. My computer's nothing special - it's what's ON my computer that is. I've got programs on here that are ridiculously advanced, some of them so powerful, that the CIA and NSA would fork out their entire yearly budgets just to take a peak at them. Explaining how an old MacBook Pro could handle all this power would take until the sun goes cold. You'd stop listening by the time I got to the part on Advanced Quantum Computing. 

What do these programs do, you ask? They find people. ALL KINDS of people - whoever I want, whenever I want, wherever they are. And once I know all that, I can do whatever I want to them.

You might ask, ""But /u/frachris87, doxxing is pretty shitty! How are you a hero?""

*Clearly, you haven't seen enough of today's villains, my friend:*

Revenge porn websites, which take the private photos of unsuspecting women and plaster them up for all to see. A pissy ex-boyfriend takes all those nudie pics his woman sent him, or some hacker steals a bunch of naked pics, and boom - everyone's seen you naked. Not only that, but some of these sites go out of their way to IDENTIFY the women (addresses, phone numbers, websites, etc), and do everything they can to ruin their lives. Hunter Moore? Bout fucking time he got locked up.

Lunatics on 4chan, 8chan, Twitter, etc who see social causes they don't ""approve of"", such as feminism, and go fucking batshit trying to make those women fear for their lives. You remember GamerGate, don't you? To hell with all that crap about ""ethics in journalism"". Any woman who had the audacity to speak out against discrimination in the STEM industry, who complained about their portrayals in gaming, got fucking swamped by a tsunami of shit - doxxing, harassment, rape/death threats. All because they said, ""Don't be a dick to women.""

The list goes on: ruthless cyberbullies who drive CHILDREN to kill themselves, child pornographers, terrorist groups using message boards to recruit disgruntled youth, bragging rapists, racists and religious fanatics promoting hate and celebrating murders online. All behind a cloak of anonymity... or so they think.

I'm not the hero you WANT me to be, I'm not the hero you expected. But when you're faced with this kind of villainy, this kind of wanton cruelty, this kind of darkness... sometimes the only way to confront it head-on is to get a little dirty yourself. 

That's where my programs come in.

You only THINK that most of the GamerGate harassers ""got away with it"", because you never heard about the ones I took down. They could have been ""hiding behind seven proxies"", or none at all - I still found them. I fried their computers, bricked their smartphones, and froze their bank accounts. And I made damned sure they know why I did it, and what would happen if they jabbered. Heck, on a few occasions, I told their families what they did, even if I'd promised not to. Name and shame, my friends... name and shame.

And the Revenge Porn kings? Whether you're making it, or distributing it, I'll fucking crush you. Your computers, your phones, your money, your jobs, your reputation, your homes? I'll take it from you - some of it, or all of it. Let's see how you like it.
Let's just say that Hunter Moore's going to have one hell of a time getting all his money back - even I've forgotten where I put most of it.

Child Porn and Pedophiles? No mercy for you whatsoever. You'll be out on the streets within five minutes of me finding you. I feel no shame in tearing your lives apart.

Cyberbullies? If you're young - still in school, below 18 years old, I'll show some mercy - you get ""two strikes"". Third strike? I'm telling Mommy. If you're an adult cyberbully going after young kids - better hunker down, because a hurricane's coming your way.

I could go on.

We want our heroes to be ""shining examples of virtue"", ""knights in shining armour"", and ""pillars of light"". I try to be the best person I can, I try to be responsible with the powers I've given, I take great care with whom I go after, making sure that they're ACTUALLY guilty of what they've done. But I've fallen so many times, gone so deep into the darkness, been burned so bad by the fires of evil, that I'll never truly be a ""real hero"". I've seen too much, confronted too much wickedness and stared too deep into the eyes of pure evil. I'm tainted. There are times I look in the mirror, and want to punch my reflection into pieces. Thank God I rarely drink, or I'll be passed out in a puddle of my own puke on a nightly basis.

Even the most virtuous police officers, who may have spent over 30-40 years on the force without a single misdeed on their records, don't leave their careers without a few scars.

Call me whatever you want - ""anti-hero"", ""lunatic"", ""psychopath"", ""fucking insane"". You're probably right. I'm not the ""hero"" in the classical sense.

But I'm not stopping. There's still too much evil out there, online. And it keeps changing - getting bigger, stronger, more complex.

And I'm going to keep going, keep on fighting, until it dies, or I do.",frachris87
"[WP] You're sitting in a dull history lesson when you come to the realization that the detailed lesson continues through the past, into the present, and into the future. You decide to stay after class to talk to Mr. C, your weathered history teacher...",notjamesmcguire,"There were one hundred and eighty seven awful things about my time in Kennedy High. I don't have time to name 
them all, but number one was definitely Janine Smith's disappearance during freshman year, and not just because she was my girlfriend, but because, well… she was a person who existed and then one day, after gym class, she vanished out of thin air and stopped existing, never to be seen or heard from again.

Senior year history class was awful thing number thirty one, and I was sitting through a particular boring one when I caught on to something weird that no one else seemed to have caught on.

"" – the Great War of two thousand and thirty two, of course,"" said Mr. C, our teacher. It really is a testament to how 
boring his classes were that *no one* realized that he had just mentioned a war that hadn't happened yet. And the 
only reason I had paid attention was because I was playing the game of not looking at my phone to check the time, 
and paying attention to the teacher was my way of trying to distract myself long enough that I'd be pleasantly 
surprised when I looked back at the phone (because so much more time than I expected to have passed would have passed, something that never happened).

&amp;nbsp;

After class, I approached Mr. C. ""Hey, can I ask you something, Mr. C?""

""Ask away, Ben.""

""Why did you mention a war in two thousand and thirty two?"" I asked, realizing mid-sentence that obviously he 
had misspoken and probably meant two thousand and two or nineteen thirty two or whatever other date.

*However*… Mr. C was a bad actor, I found out, because the minute I asked this, and a second before I was about 
to start apologizing and saying that I realized he probably misspoke, his eyes went wide. ""Did I say that?"" he asked, cautious.

""Yeah, sir…"" I said. And it dawned on me that he was hiding something. And given my curious nature when I'm 
bored (which is always), I decided to figure out what it was. So I bluffed and said: ""I *know* why you said that, sir...""

No, I couldn't possibly imagine that it was what it was at the time. I thought Mr. C was hiding something along the 
lines of 'I'm subtly mentioning an imaginary war during my classes so I can ask about it at the midterm to see who 
was paying attention'. 

I didn't think he was hiding 'I have a box that is a time machine', but that's exactly what he told me.

""It's time, anyway. If you know about it, you should be the one to have it. I can't be its guardian forever,"" he said,  after telling me about the box.

I blinked seventeen times and then said: ""Okay, Mr. C. So you have a box that we climb in and when we climb out 
we are in the past, or the future, and you are going to give me that box to keep it safe and never use it. Is that it?""

""Yes.""

Cool. Mr. C was insane. That was his secret. *But* he did give me a little black box, the size of a present box, and 
said: ""Don't ever use it, Ben. Better men than you have gone insane with this.""

And I said, ""You're telling me, Mr. C.""

&amp;nbsp;

I kept the box, though, and I found myself staring at it when I arrived home. It was black, like, really black. Like I 
couldn't even see the edges of it. Smooth.

But you know what it wasn't? It wasn't big enough to fit a human being inside, which proved that Mr. C was lying. 
Yes, that's how I chose to disprove his time machine box theory – you can't fit inside the box, so, obviously, the 
part about time traveling must also be a lie.

Still, curiosity got the better of me, and I opened the box. Immediately I realized something was off, because I 
couldn't see the bottom of it. Then I stuck my hand inside and it went *way* deep, like shoulder deep, like deeper 
than the box, and then I realized something was *really* off.

I looked at the void inside the box, and the void looked back at me. Then I said ""*What-the-feeck*"" in a really high-pitched voice,"" and dove my head into it, because that's what stupid people do when faced with the known and potentially dangerous. 

I fell through blackness.

The history class flashed in front of my eyes, playing backwards. Then the corridor before class. Then math class. 
Then me going to school on my bike. Then me waking up.

I pulled my head out of the box. I was in bed, and it was morning. I heard steps coming up the stairs behind the 
door.

*My mom's gonna tell me she burned the toasts…* I thought, in a haze of insanity, recognizing that moment from earlier.

From the corridor through the closed door door: ""Benny, I burned your toasts, so you're gonna have to buy breakfast at school, ok?""

*Hole shet. I just traveled back in time.*

I looked at the void inside the box, and the void looked back at me. And then I said: ""Wait a minute, how the fuck 
am I supposed to travel back now!?""

But the void didn't say anything.

Smith?""

Terrence Smith sat up in his chair.  He was pretty sure he hadn't actually fallen asleep, even though the voice had been droning on for about a half-hour now, asking pointless questions.  He replayed the last few words in his head.  The teacher had asked him for.... something... Iraq!  That was it!

""WMDs, sir?""  Mr. C insisted that everyone call him sir.  He said that he had served as an officer in ""the war"" but was always evasive about exactly what war that was.  The first few people to suggest, outside of the class that he had never served as anything more dangerous than a McDonald's burger-flipper had ended up with a week's detention.  Mr C. couldn't possibly have heard the comment, but no one had ever figured out who the snitch had been.

""Thank you, Mr. Smith.  It's good to know someone in this class is actually paying attention, even if they're only paying attention to the propaganda.  In point of fact, Weapons of Mass Destruction were used as an excuse, but...""  As Mr C. turned away from him, Terry allowed himself to slip back into the same daze the rest of the class was in.

Terry awoke to a sticky sensation in the back of his neck.  He felt there to find a spitball was stuck there.  He resisted the urge to turn around and look at the culprit, for two reasons - he knew who it had been (Steve Greco) and he knew that if Mr C saw someone not facing forward in class, that'd be a week's detention.  Mr C. was facing the whiteboard for now, but somehow, he always knew when someone turned away, and issued detention accordingly.

His slumber interrupted, he tuned back into his instructor's voice.  ""...And then the Russians, having been emboldened by the annexation of Crimea, decided to send an army into Belarus in August 2017, in order to reunite more of the original Soviet union.  This, in turn, caused the following five things to happen...""

Mercifully, the bell rang at that point, and there was a mad rush to the exit.  Mr C. futilely called to the backs of his students.  ""For next week, I want you all to have read up on Russia's expansionist policies in the mid-2010s.""

Terry took a little longer to get out the door , having to stretch after his nap, but he couldn't help stopping to correct Mr C. on the way out.   ""Sir?""

Mr. C didn't look up from his desk, where he was scribbling notes.  ""Hmm?  Yes, Mr. Smith?""

""I just wanted to let you know that you got one of your dates wrong.  You mentioned August 2017, but that hasn't happened yet.""  He tried to keep the smirk off his face about having caught the senile old coot.  Indeed, the man looked confused.  

""I'm sorry, Mr. Smith.  What's the date today?""

""It's the 29th,"" the student stated, the smirk starting to show through. Mr C. looked at Terry as if he were expecting more than that.  ""Of April.""  Mr C. continued with the blank stare, so Terry finally contributed, ""2016.""

""Ah.""  Mr C. finally responded.  ""Well, we can't have that.  If you received knowledge of the future, who knows what could happen.  We'll need to fix it.""

Mr. C pulled something out of his pocket, and fiddled with a few dials.  As Terry was going to ask what the thing was, the room spun, and Terry felt like he was caught in an interminable yawn.  He staggered into the nearest empty chair and slumped onto the desk.  He heard his name called.  ""Smith?""

Terry sat up in his chair.  He was pretty sure he hadn't actually fallen asleep, even though the voice had been droning on for about a half-hour now, asking pointless questions.

More roars from around the city. They tingle all over my skin like sticking your tongue to a battery, but the redhead runs up to the dead ape as if she doesn’t notice it.

“What are you--” I start but she leaps onto the ape’s chest and does some sort of crazy ground pound to its sternum, which cracks wide open like the world’s biggest wishbone at Thanksgiving.

The barista--I should really ask for some names--doubles over and loses his breakfast. I turn away to avoid the same, but not before the redhead reaches inside the King Kong wannabe and yanks out… an electrical circuit?

“Ha!” she yells triumphantly as she jumps off the thing’s body to land beside me and the barista, clearing thirty feet or more as if it were nothing.

She drops the goo-covered device at my feet and flashes that worldbreaking smile as she crushes it under her combat boots. The ape delivers a final lurching gasp and is still again.

“What’s the matter with you?” she asks, poking me in the chest. It leaves a trail of slimy ape blood or oil or I don’t even know what.

“I--you--what--”

The barista gets to his feet, interrupting me, “--the fuck just happened? Who are you? What is that? WHAT IN THE FUCK IS GOING ON?”

The redhead slaps us both, fortunately getting him with the slimy hand. I barely see it coming before my cheek stings and I see stars.

She sighs. “First off, keep your voice down. That’s how they hunt if they can’t see you.”

She strides away, leaving us both confused and angry. 

“Second,” she continues, “I’m the baddest bitch around.” 

I share a look with the barista that is probably “Can you believe this shit?” before we follow her. 

She leads us into the first building that hasn’t been destroyed, an abandoned coffee shop, another one if you can imagine it--of course you can, this is Seattle--and walks behind the counter like she owns the place. 

Maybe she does; I don’t fucking know her.

She starts making a cappuccino or something and the barista watches her for a moment before groaning and going behind the counter. “You’re gonna fuck it up, let me.”

“Thanks, uh… Shahin,” she says, joining me on the other side of the counter. Only then do I realize he’s wearing a nametag and of course it’s right there.

“I’m Jivika,” I say, “And I promise not to spill this one on you, Shahin.”

“Maybe that would be better than the current problem,” he says while the milk froths in the cup. The power seems to be out everywhere, but there’s power here. Must be on a generator.

“You can call me Meinwen,” the redhead says. “So where should I start?”

Shahin finishes the first drink and gives it to me and we share a little smile. His hand is shaking and it takes me a moment to realize that mine is, too.

I sip the drink and immediately feel better, revitalized. “How about ‘what the hell is happening’?"" I ask.

Meinwen laughs as more explosions rip through Seattle, some far away and others too near for comfort. “That’s fair. I don’t know how to sugarcoat it, but basically there’s aliens running amok all over the world, and we’re the only thing that can stop them.”

Shahin drops a cup at that, and it shatters behind the counter. He starts another cappuccino without a word.

I rub my eyes. “Aliens. But that that was some kind of robot.”

“What makes you think aliens would come here personally to kill us?” Meinwen counters. “If they can get here, they don’t need whatever we’ve got and they don’t want whatever we’d give them.”

“What are you saying?” Shahin asks as he hands over the second successful drink. Meinwen sips it and her eyes roll up in her head as she exhales heavily.

“I hope your ability isn’t the best damn cup of java this side of the galaxy, cause it’s not gonna be much use against the robot horde.”

“Ability?” I ask. Shahin makes another cup. For the moment the chaos has died down outside and it could be just three friends shooting the shit.

“Sure, I got the strength, and--” She grabs for my bloody jacket and gets a peek inside before I can shove her away, “--you got the heals. What about you, Shahin?” She lets me go and I can’t help a blush at the way she so cavalierly groped me just now.

He takes a sip of his drink and joins us on the customer side of the counter. “I think maybe speed? I did something kinda crazy when the windows blew in.”

“Aha, jackrabbit,” Meinwen says, “fastest hump in the land.”

“Meinwen!” I say, appalled, but Shahin laughs with her. He nudges me and soon we’re all laughing about it.

Finally it settles and I run a finger over my “IV” mark. “I don’t get it. What does this mean?”

Meinwen scoffs. “Is it just me, then? Am I the only one who got the memories?”

We stare at her, then shake our heads no.

“Well, then it’s probably lucky we found each other so fast. Might make II and III difficult.”

“Are there… others?” I ask. “Like, a VI, a VII, a XX?”

“Hell, that would be convenient,” Meinwen says. “We’d all be so lucky to have an M running around.” She rubs her temples this time and sighs. “Just the five of us, Jivika. But believe me when I say, we’re all that the world needs.”

“Why me?” Shahin asks. 

“Well, that I can’t say. Feels a little random, doesn’t it? I guess we can probably expect II and III are somewhere in Seattle. Now, as your duly appointed leader, I think we should--”

“Whoa, now,” I say, “Leader? You have to have a team, or a squad, or whatever, to be a leader. I’m getting out of here. I’ve got a family to find.”

I stand to walk away, but that curious slowing of time happens again, and I can see Shahin moving faster than I can react. 1000 frames per second. He grabs my wrist and blocks my exit. I shove at him as time reasserts itself, but he doesn’t let go.

“Whoa, mama,” Meinwen declares, “That’s not speed, that’s time manipulation.”

“Let me go!” I wrestle free, feeling stronger than ever, but never weaker in my entire life. Fight an army of unkillable alien robots? Is she high? No way!

“We need to stick together til we figure it all out,” Shahin says, letting me go. “You saw what Meinwen did. Why would you go anywhere but in her wake?”

“Because I have a little brother and a sister with kids and a sick father. And this is so fucking crazy. And *they* don’t have an Incredible Firecrotch on their side.”

Meinwen giggles at the name. “Let her go, Shahin. She’ll find her way back to us.”

She was right, of course. I could feel them next to me, a comforting awareness in my head. And somewhere towards the coast, the others. II and III. 

“I have to make sure they’re safe,” I say, and Shahin moves out of my way reluctantly. 

He sighs and nods. “Be careful, okay?”

And I leave the safety of a super strong madwoman and puppy dog barista who can bend time.

I find that I don’t tire as I jog through the streets. Mostly the city is quiet now, having fallen into a hushed lull, as if the entire city has taken a collective breath and is afraid to let it out. The roars continue in the distance, but it’s okay. They’re not near me. They’re not in the direction of home. Everything is going to be fine.

But when I get to our apartment building, it is in pieces. A ten story brick structure reduced to a pile of rubble.

Grief swells within my chest, and something else. The mark almost burns with need and I drop to the rubble of the building on hands and knees. There are bodies in the rubble. I can almost see them, like a heat signature in the movies.

Dead. Everyone in the building is dead.

The mark burns stronger. I don’t know what I’m doing, but I hold out my hand as the mark flashes silver and gold. My body vibrates with the tension. Roars in the distance fuel my anger, my worry, my grief.

“You took them from me!” I shout. The pulsing power within me, similar to Meinwen’s after her soaring kick, pushes against the bounds of my flesh. It wants to be free, and I can’t stand to have it inside me.

“Give them back to me!”

The power bursts from me and rushes out in a shockwave, throwing the rubble away, freeing the bodies within. Another power swells at the sight of my sister, holding her youngest, crushed under debris and almost unrecognizable.

It swells and swells inside me until it’s too much and I must burst like a balloon. Wounds tear all over my skin and radiate out this power, this healing energy.

And as I collapse to the ground, my sister’s eyes open. Her baby starts to cry. 

As I bleed out on a pile of rubble, a hulking figure appears on a street corner. A four-legged monstrosity of claw and fang that could only be called a tiger if the only tiger you've ever seen is a child's crayon rendition. Somewhere in the distance I can hear Meinwen's laughter: laughter and violence.

“Okay, so I have some problems with all of this,” I say, gathering my outfit to myself. 

“I’m sure. All of you do, forever,” Meinwen says, dropping on the bed between Shahin and me, forcing us to split apart.

“We can die, right? I mean I practically did.”

She shrugs. “I assume so. Though if someone does die and you can’t bring them back, the planet is doomed.”

“Okay, that’s the next thing. The aliens have to know about the five of us by now. They’re tromping all over the world raining robot destruction unopposed. *Except in Seattle*. Why not just nuke us from orbit?”

“That’s what the general said when he tried to detain us!” Shahin interrupts.

“You can’t expect me to believe the four of you somehow resisted the entire United States military?” I say.

Meinwen shrugs again, throwing her arms around the both of us. “What’s left of them. Look, I don’t have all the answers. The aliens aren’t wiping us out, the military is leaving us alone to do our thing, we can stop them and no one else can, end of story.”

“Okaaaay. Next question. Are we supposed to go around the entire world bashing in robot brains? ‘Cause I’m pretty sure that would take the five of us a hundred years.”

“We have a special weapon that can neutralize entire armies,” Meinwen assures me, “but only when we’re all together, and conscious.”

“And what is this weapon?”

“Let’s find out!” She yells for Jelani and Guo, who both come in wearing their sparkling outfits. Jelani looks more pissed than he did before.

“Why did we let the runt do this again?”

Shahin stands and claps the boy on the shoulder. “Because she won’t use that shield of hers if we don’t wear the costumes.”

“They’re uniforms,” Guo insists. “We’re the Earth Defense Force Five!”

“It’s like some bad anime,” Jelani grumbles, but he doesn’t take off the jacket or peel away the sequins.

“Get dressed, you two,” Meinwen says. “We deploy the Jammer Wave in ten.” I’m pretty sure she made that up. *Pretty* sure.

_____

The uniform fits surprisingly well, which means one of them also measured me while I was unconscious. Dirty fingers run down my spine at the thought. 

We gather on the roof of the dormitory and I get my first look of Seattle after the attacks. Most of it is in ruins, but the Space Needle is still hanging in there. The clouds still cover the sky in a dark blanket. In the vast distance, over the ocean and in the forest, lumbering robot monstrosities wander.

“Okay,” Meinwen says, “Get in a circle and hold hands. We’ve never done this so it might take some doing.”

We obey, for my part feeling foolish, like I’m about to sit down to a seance like we used to in junior high. But when I lock hands with Shahin and Jelani, the electric vibe that courses through us is almost too pleasant, wafting through my core like a massage and settling in my chest like pot smoke held too long. If I don’t get rid of it soon I’ll burst.

The others feel the same way. When we are locked hand in hand, the five of us are aware of each other’s emotions. I believe it is Guo’s doing.

“How’s it work?” Shahin asks. 

“Based on the memories, we focus our powers into the circle we’ve created. We are each capable of great kinetic force independent of our other abilities, and this ties into that.” Meinwen concentrates and the aura of power whips around her. “Focus it inward.”

We all stumble about our new abilities, teasing out the the kinetic force and then directing it inward. Several times Guo or Jelani lose their grip on us and we have to start again. But finally, the five of us are connected and funneling this strange, raw power into an ever-growing sphere of force in the middle of us all.

“It’s going to keep growing,” Meinwen says. Her grip tightens and so does everyone else’s, fingers clenched together. “When it’s too big and we can’t hold any more in, we direct it outwards, behind us. It won’t hurt anything but what we want it to.”

I nod and we all concentrate, feeling the bulge of force press against our chests, buffet us back so that we are holding on by fingertips, arms stretched wide and straining.

And just when it is too much, when it must shred our bodies and tear our souls to ribbons, Meinwen licks her lips and nods to the group.

We work on pushing the force out of our protective circle. It strains against us, fights us with crushing pressure, until suddenly it envelops us, wraps around us.

It floods away down streams we direct, rushing outward in ever-expanding wedges. Robots in the city screech and fall over dead. The wave of force pulls our souls along with it, and we see every monster consumed and eradicated as if we are standing over it, gloating above its corpse.

The wave continues, and in my mind I see the country spreading before me to the south, the east. Ocean to the west, massive whalelike robots spewing guts out of their artificial blowholes. In the frozen north, yetis and moose fall over. Massive polar bear monsters swipe ineffectually at the sky and fall into the water, drowning on their false roars.

It goes and goes until I can’t even tell what’s my soul anymore. Then the power fades, and rapidly recoils until it snaps our minds back into our bodies. I collapse into Shahin’s arms and we fall to the rooftop together, panting and smiling, breathless and amazed.

Cheers go up around the city, floating on the wind and reaching us even this far out. The Space Needle’s Skybeam is pulsing congratulations at us, and so powerful is its light that it seems to pierce the clouds above.

“What a feeling!” Meinwen yells. “I have such a ladyboner right now.” Of the five, she is the only one to remain standing.

“How much did we cover just now?” I ask. I know the answer isn’t everywhere, but for a fleeting moment I hope it is. As wonderful as that was, I never want to feel it again.

Meinwen hugs herself a little, biting her lip. “Mmm… I don’t know, couple hundred miles in every direction, maybe? We’ll be doing that a bunch more.”

A dozen? A hundred? How big is the world? It felt like half the globe, but if it was only 200 miles, we have a long way to go.

“It’s coming,” Guo says, sitting up and clutching at Jelani, who holds her tight, like a brother protecting his sister from bad dreams.

I am about to ask what ‘it’ is, but then I feel it, too. It rockets out of the sky like a meteor. Its descent arcs suddenly and it plows through the Space Needle. The shrieking of metal is like a colossus of steel crying out and being silenced. The Needle collapses in on itself, Skybeam winking out, crumbling to dust and fire. Standing before it is a tortoise robot bigger than any we’ve seen so far, belching flames and spinning in place like a porcupine top. Massive quill-like structures shoot out of its shell, exploding on contact with everything they touch. 

Several fly at our building and I close my eyes to our end.

The waking is slow.

Meinwen said I have a healing ability, and I guess that’s what keeps me alive. That and the little baby coos of my niece. The warm kiss on my forehead from my brother.

The waking is slow and I push and push to hasten it along.

But when my eyes finally open, there is no sister with her brood trying and failing to stay quiet; no brother reading to me long into the night; no father sitting by my bedside, hand clenched in mine.

There is instead Shahin. He holds a cup of coffee, and the scent of fresh grounds and chocolate is what ultimately wakes me.

I’m in a bed, but it’s not a hospital bed. At a glance I would say it is Shahin’s bed. It’s in a small room that has the look of poverty about it: poverty that comes from being a college student living in a dorm.

My entire body aches and cries. If I could go unconscious again I would.

Shahin sits forward as our eyes lock. He is not the handsome barista I remember: tired eyes and more than a couple days of shaving neglect.

“My family?” I croak.

He smiles and puts the coffee cup in my hands, makes sure I’m strong enough to hold it, and sits back, rubbing his eyes.

“Safe. Or as safe as we can make them. Seattle’s burning, but the robots don’t bother the suburbs much.”

I manage a small sip and almost choke on it, but it goes down and with every drop of caffeinated goodness I can almost feel my body’s capillaries opening wider, accelerating whatever healing ability I have.

I say, “I need to see them.”

From the doorway a stranger scoffs. He is short and young, maybe fifteen, skin brown and attitude mean as a bottle of whiskey, but I can clearly see the “II” mark on his hand, pink like mine.

“‘Bout time you woke up,” he says, stepping back from the doorway and calling out, “Hey, Red, the weakling’s out of it!”

Weakling? Fuck him. “How many people did I save?” I ask.

Shahin smiles. “Everyone in a six block radius, near as we can tell. Most of them don’t know what happened, and it’s probably best it stays that way.”

“Yeah, yeah,” the kid says, “so she can kill herself to save people. Not gonna be much help when we’re throwing down Street Fighter style with these Beast Wars wannabes.”

I manage to roll my eyes at Shahin and he gives me a lopsided grin that the kid can’t see. “Please tell me ‘III’ is a little more mature.” The kid actually guffaws at that, leaving the room in howls of laughter.

“Yeah…” Shahin says, trailing off. “About her.”

“So it’s a woman?”

“You could say that.”

“Shahin?”

He won’t meet my gaze.

“How old is she?”

Meinwen comes through the door trailing a little Asian girl, Chinese if I have to guess, maybe ten years old if she is just underdeveloped.

“Her?” I ask but don’t need to. She’s got the mark, three little slashes of brown. “We can’t do this with her.”

I’ve only been awake for a few minutes but the pain is gone and I feel as though I am waking from a power nap instead of a multiple-day coma.

Meinwen smiles and motions for the girl to approach me. The little girl does and places a hand to my forehead. Images stream through of her and the kid battling on the docks of Seattle. A whirlwind of spiny tentacles flutters out of the ocean towards them, only to smash against an invisible force that surrounds the pair. The boy is holding his hands up like finger-guns and gigantic laser blasts erupt from his fingertips, leaving smoldering holes the size of a minivan in dozens of robotic monsters descending upon them.

They are a formidable force, and when the girl lets me go I slump back, exhausted all over again, as if I am the one who has been fighting.

“I apologize,” I say, taking another sip of my coffee. “I didn’t know. What’s your name?”

“Guo. Red says you have pretty eyes but I think she’s just being nice.” I laugh and Meinwen sends her shuffling out of the room.

“Make sure Jelani doesn’t do anything I wouldn’t do,” Meinwen says as the girl leaves the room.

“How long?” I ask, sitting up and looking for some pants. I’m in someone else’s nightgown and of the two people in this room who might have changed me, I’m pretty sure both would have liked the view.

“Three days.” Shahin hands me clothing that’s seen better days, but at least it’s mine. Both of them turn without my having to ask them so that I can get dressed, and Meinwen continues filling me in as I slip underwear and then pants on under the nightgown.

They have been clearing the city, protecting it as best they can with just the four of them. The military talked to Meinwen, but as they have no ability to hurt these creatures, and no ability to detain us it seems, they have given us free reign to do as we must.

“So you’ve been picking off the rugrats while I was healing,” I finish for her, and both nod. I slip off the nightgown and get back into my blouse and clear my throat. They turn back to find me stretching and rolling my shoulders.

“This is still incredibly insane, you know that, right?” I ask. 

Meinwen doesn’t bother answering, just continues, “Now that you’re up and at’em we have shit to do. After this next bit, Jelani, Guo, and I are the strike team. You and Shahin are the “Oh Shit” button for when we get in over our heads. Sound about right?”

I don’t know how I feel about being the emergency brake for an out-of-control space shuttle, but what choice do we have?

“When we do we start?”

Meinwen smiles wide and grabs the sides of my head, plants a big sloppy kiss on my lips, and lets go.

“You’re the only one who didn’t fight that!” she says, almost dancing out of the room in her excitement.

I rub the slobber from my mouth and have the good manners to avoid Shahin’s glance. “What did we get ourselves into, Shahin?”

He shrugs and sits on the bed next to me, reaches for my marked hand and takes it in his, squeezes it gently in reassurance.

“I still don’t know and I’ve been awake the whole time. Meinwen doesn’t know why the five of us are the five of us and not like a bunch of Navy Seals or some shit. All she knows is we’re it and the aliens are gonna rampage until we stop them.”

I squeeze his hand back and we sit like this for several minutes, enjoying the comfortable silence of each other’s company.

I can feel Meinwen, Guo, and Jelani. They are still close, maybe on the same floor even. A preteen, a jerk teen, a crazy redhead, a barista, and me. What the hell could we possibly do to save the world?

I don’t know but I’m excited to find out. 

Guo and Meinwen come strolling back in with matching outfits for everyone. Meinwen is already dressed in hers, and she looks ridiculous. The damn thing has sequins and glitter!

“Oh are you fucking kidding me?” I groan. Guo glares at me and stomps from the room.

“When your superhero getup gets bedazzled, you wear it,” Meinwen says seriously. It is apparent she loves the entire thing, like she was born to be a Power Ranger or something.

"[WP] All your life you've had the number ""IV"" in bold on the back of your hand. While ordering coffee at a cafe, you notice the barista has ""V"" on the back of their hand.",thepowerofbacon,"It's not a thing I'm normally thinking about, the pale pink mark on my golden-brown hand. Just a weird birthmark and nothing more. New people casually mention how much it looks like a Roman numeral four, but mostly it's just a thing I've had for twenty one years. A conversation starter at the bar, an ice-breaker in interviews.

The news is blaring on the TV above the ordering station while I'm waiting for my soy half-caf double pump caramel latte, and it's saying something about meteor showers no one was expecting. Weird, but not really newsworthy.

The barista calls out my drink order and I take it from him while my eyes are on the TV. The lid is loose and I knock the whole thing from his hands when the live feed on the meteor showers suddenly explodes in a mushroom cloud and the feed dies.

The news reporter in the news room has the same horrified, shocked expression I have, while the barista is cursing me up and down.

""Did you see that?"" I turn my gaze on him and two things immediately become apparent. One: he hasn't seen the news feed because he's busy wiping scalding hot coffee off his hand and arm. Two: he has the same mark on his hand that I do, only it's a reddish-brown against his sandy skin.

No. It's not the same. It's the ""V"" shape. Roman numeral five.

I don't know whether to apologize to the handsome man, show befuddlement at my mistake, ask about his birthmark, or look back at the TV to see how bad the explosion was.

So I do a fumbling mixture of all of them, confused and laughing and unsure of what the hell's going on. I hold my hand up to him with my ""IV"" displayed, and he blinks at it, pulled out of his anger and disbelief that some ditzy woman just splashed coffee all over the place. 

Other people in the cafe stare, or take pictures with their phones. No one seems to have noticed the TV. They're hoping for a fight.

The barista scoffs but before he can say anything, the cafe shakes so hard that it throws me off-balance and tables fall over, taking drinks and breakfast sandwiches to the tile floor. The power goes out and the TV blinks off. Cell phones are ringing everywhere, including mine: Mom calling from back home.

The line is dead when I answer it. No one seems able to connect, or text, or get online.

Screams erupt from outside. I stumble to the window with other strangers, while some run outside or back into the counter. The day was bright a few moments ago, but now there's a blanket of thick dark clouds rapidly covering the city. People are running away from something. I can't see out the windows too far the direction they're fleeing from, but more rumbles and an explosion rip through the area. Time seems to slow as the glass shatters and rockets in at me and the other customers. A hand grabs me and pulls me to the ground so fast I'm not sure it even happened. Other customers are screaming, clutching at bleeding faces from the glass explosion.

The barista stares into my eyes, then both our eyes lock on our joined hands. The ""V"" and ""IV"" are almost luminescent on our skin now, our eyes reflecting the glow. 

People are scattering.

An inhuman roar echoes over the city, shattering more windows. Another explosion. 

""Get off me!"" I finally say, and we help each other up. 

""What is this?"" he asks, motioning to our marks.

""Hell if I know."" Did time really slow down for us when the windows broke? 

""What was that you were saying about the TV?""

I am confused for a moment, then: ""Oh! Something was coming out of the sky. Then it exploded and the news feed was lost.""

""Sounds like nothing good comes from that. Hold up, you weren't as lucky as I thought."" He pulls a shard of glass from my shoulder, but curiously I hadn't felt it at all. I stare at my blood on the sharp glass and free my shoulder from my jacket, but there's no wound, just the leftover blood and the ragged pieces of my shirt and jacket.

""No way."" If I weren't so scared I might faint. ""What's happening?"" I try my phone but still nothing.

The bestial, alien roar erupts again, much closer. It sends goosebumps all over my body and makes me feel like I need to run away, to hide.

The barista steps outside, and because he still holds my hand I stumble along with him, though every fiber of my being is yelling at me to flee. I'm too numb to do otherwise.

Outside the chaos is palpable. People still fleeing. Smoke rising into the darkened sky. Cars wrecked everywhere. A few bodies along the sidewalks, looking trampled.

""Come on,"" he says, pulling me along, *towards* the sound of the roaring. I feel compelled, like I must go that way, like it is the only path. 

We turn a corner, following the sounds of gunshots and destruction. A few blocks and we turn another corner, and there at the end of the next corner is the thing. 

I'll just lay it out for you: it's a giant space gorilla. Purple and blue spines in place of fur; a wide, flat head; soulless black eyes; he is the size of a small building and is making sure all the other buildings know it by collapsing them with humongous meaty fists.

Guns do no damage. Police scatter before the grotesque ape, their bullets ineffective. All over the city I can hear the roars: this isn't the only one.

Then something darts in from the other street, connecting with the chest of the giant ape and sending it reeling backwards. The projectile is a person, and the barista guides us toward her. There is a wave of something powerful arcing off the woman, buffeting us as we approach.

It's insane, but it feels right. The mark on my hand throbs with each pulse of this force. The ape isn't moving. One kick from this pale ivory redhead and the thing is dead, when shotguns and pistols did nothing.

She spies us standing, hands locked, sees the marks, and the power fades while she grins fit to steal your wits. She drops to a knee, gasping for breath, and holds her hand up to us.

Another mark. ""I"". Roman numeral one.

""Well, it's about damn time,"" she manages between breaths. ""Where's II and III? We've got a war to fight!""",bigrickcook

[WP] Time is a restaurant. What do you order?,Blonde_arrbuckle,"""Do you know what you'd like yet, sir?"" The waiter inquired with a small smile on his face.

Looking intently at the menu, I ran my eyes over the *Today's Specials* list. There was only one that caught my attention. *'August 28, 1963. Travel back to this historical moment to get a taste of Martin Luther King Jr's historical dream speech!'* the menu advertised. ""1963 sounds good to me,"" I said smiling as I looked up at the waiter.

 ""Excellent choice, sir."" The waiter smiled back genuinely. ""One moment please,"" as he walked away.

Five minutes later he was back with a silverplate covered dish. ""Here you go,"" he said as he delicately put it on the table in front of me.

I lifted up the cover as I heard the word ""enjoy"" escape the waiter's mouth. It was too late to thank him, however, as white mist started to rise from the platter and circle around me like a calm tornado, and his words were soon fading along with the rest of the current world. 

When I opened my eyes again, I was dressed in a blue collared button down shirt and white jeans. ""I have a dream,"" I heard someone say from afar, and looked around to see a huge mass of people gathered in front of the one and only Martin Luther King Jr. ",NormallyUnusual
"[WP] Your civilization is secret, hidden away from the rest of the world. Explain to your children why.",CanICanTheCanCan,"""Why?""

Her eyes were fixed on mine, twin pools of blue set in a face that was a miniature reflection of her mother's, her small frame balanced on the edge of a chair just across the polished wooden table from mine.

""Because, honey, that's just how we do things.""

""But why, daddy?""

I scrubbed a hand through my hair while I thought of a way to explain our situation to a six year old.  The quest was proving to be much harder fought than I had hoped.  Despite her pedigree, she was still only a child, and my many years of life had long since taught me that children lacked the complexity of thought needed to fully grasp every reason behind our way of life.  At the same time, children could often display understanding far beyond that which most adults gave them credit for.

That my daughter was a demigod could only help.

""Alright, dear, let me see if I can explain it to you.  If you want a new toy or a game -""

""Harvest Moon!""

""Don't interrupt.  Like I was saying, if you wanted a new toy or game, what would you do to get it?""

The dusting of freckles on her face shifted as she wrinkled her nose in thought.  I waited.

""Ask daddy?  I think?""

""Exactly right, good girl!  Now, say you were grown up and you wanted another game.  Since you're all grown up, you could buy it for yourself, right?  All the games you wanted!  Or you could even learn to make newer, better games yourself!  Doesn't that sound fun?""

Her face had brightened as I spoke, lit from within by that innocent variety of greed that only children possessed.  She replied with an enthusiastic nod.

""But part of learning things is that you have to learn on your own, right?  As you get older, daddy can't help you as much.  One day, you'll be able to do everything by yourself, and I might only help you sometimes when it's something important.""

I could see a wave of dismay beginning to grow within her as she thought of a future where I wouldn't be right next to her every step of the way.  I decided to steer the conversation back to the present, and the question that started all of this in the first place.

""So if you think bigger, humans are like the kids, and the gods are like the mommies and daddies!  Humans couldn't learn or grow up with us helping them all the time, so we all got together and decided to help them one last time and then watch them start to grow up.  Does that make sense?""

Her eyes were narrowed in thought.  I decided to push the point a little further home.

""Remember when I taught you how to swim a few weeks ago?  You only learned to float when I let go of you, right?  Before that, I was helping you a lot.""

""Yeah!  It was scary until uncle Iden made the waves go away, but then it was fun!  I played with a dolphin!""

""I'm glad you had fun, sweetie.  Poseidon helped some, but remember, you didn't learn how to swim completely until I took you out into the water and let you try it on your own.""

""So, humans couldn't swim until you and uncle Iden and uncle Odie and auntie Thena let them go?""

""Something like that, yes.""

""But why do we have to hide?""

The girl was sharp for her age.

""Well, honey, if the humans knew we were here, they might stop growing up.  The more they think that we aren't real - that we were never real - the harder they'll work to make fun new things, because they think that there's no one to help them if they don't.""

She frowned.  I couldn't tell if I was getting through to her or not.  I was never very good at explaining these things to children.

""But what if they really need help?""

""Then we help them, but not so they know we did.  They've only gotten into trouble that bad a couple of times.""

""So, I can't tell Jenna about everyone?""

""Not everyone.  If you want, you can tell your best friends about your family, but use our special human names and don't tell them what we do.""

It would look like she was making up cute stories, until she got older and they threw her in a psych ward.  Not that they'd be able to overpower her, but it would be best to avoid that sort of situation altogether.  She wrung her small hands on the tabletop.

""OK, daddy.""

I decided that it didn't really matter if she fully understood, as long as the basic concept was there.  There would be plenty of time for her to grasp all of this later. 

""Good girl.  Hey, do you want to go to the ice cream shop?!""

She squealed with delight and went to find her shoes, which had been discarded somewhere amongst her toys.  I picked up my motorcycle key and waited with her jacket in my hand.  Most fathers would hesitate to use such a vehicle to move their precious daughters around, but for some reason mine happened to love the wind and the weather.  With a thought, I brushed the eddies and currents of the air so that an approaching rainstorm would miss us, and smiled to myself.  Maybe it was in her blood.",InquisitioHaereticae

A high pitched squeal of joy cut through the somber tone I  was trying to set. Young children dash across the yard, throwing rocks at each other and laughing in delight. I watch Dare as he watches them, anger, pride, boredom, and most of all jealousy war across his face.  
""You know this is important."" I say quietly, once the children are safely passed.  
""Of course!"" He answers at once. Almost too quickly, too loudly.  
Of course. He has always wanted to be an adult, but now that it stares him in the face, he's learning how much he will miss being a child.  
He took a few rapid breaths, to compose himself, before asking his Question. ""Three hundred years ago, the gates were shut for the last time. Why?""
""Are you sure this is your Question?"" This is always the question, but I must confirm it.
""Yes, mother.""
A let out a deep sigh. Another innocent childhood, lost forever.
I stand and walk around the room, drawing curtains the block outside light. Dare watches quietly.   
""This is why the gates were shut."" In my hand, I suddenly hold Thought. I have always held it, but Dare could now see it. He could always see it, of course, but he never knew he could see it before.  
Once he saw thought, he knew his answer, but the forms had to be seen through. I had to show him the truth, and he had to see it for himself.  
""Three hundred years ago, the final war was fought over thought. Humanity lost a lot. Almost everything. Some would say everything that mattered. But the biggest loss, was Thought. Reason. Questioning.""  
""Outside the gates, Thought is gone, and all that is left is Impulse. Just base Instinct.""
Dare thought about this. He considered my tone and implications.  
""But Instinct is doing quite well for humanity. They have towers that reach the skies, instant communication around the world, and there are fewer hungry people than ever before. Fewer deaths. More happiness. Perhaps we are better off without Reason.""
He thought about what he just said for a beat. ""Mother, is Reason cruel?""
I inclined my head slightly, in the direction of the Center. ""Perhaps.""
Dare nodded. ""But we must cultivate the last of Reason here, until it finally dies away.""
""Good. Now go play outside"" He did not hear me. He was lost in Thought.",alt_romance_writer

I was cramming, again, to finish this stupid essay. I didn't really want to write about the inner complexities of Desdemona's relationship with Othello, but here I was, at four in the morning, swishing energy drinks around my mouth to wash down the adderall. It was technically due last week, but I was a master at manipulating my poor English professor. She was under the impression that I was sick with the- well, I didn't really say what I was sick with. I just mumbled and fake coughed and then hawked a loogie into the trash pail next to her and made it sound really gross. 

Not quite sure if she was concerned, or just so disgusted she would give me anything to get out of her office. Well, anyways, that's why I'm here now. Because even though I got an extra week with that extension, I still procrastinated so hard and pushed it off until tonight. Or this morning, rather. It was due in about five hours. Fun!

Well, as I began working my way through the romance between the Moor and his beloved, I kinda slumped in and out of sleep. Finally, at around eight, I realized that I had somehow reached my goal of eight pages! Only to realize, I hadn't put the date on it or titled my paper. I whipped up a snazzy, jazzy title: The Moor you love me: The Romance of Othello. Then, I simply slapped on the date, and clicked save.

Only, as soon as I clicked save, everything... rippled. I was still staring at a computer screen. Only, my paper was gone. In it's place was a cartoonish looking scene. Some wizards were running around. I began to panic. Did I just delete my paper? What the hell was this game? I stood up, about to freak the fuck out, when I noticed my scrawny little arm. (Ok, *scrawnier* little arm. I'm not a gymrat.) I looked at the clock on the computer. It still said around five in the morning... but then I noticed the date.

It didn't say 4/29/16. It said 4/29/06.

I looked around, and sure enough. It was my bedroom from when I was a kid. I slapped my mouth shut with my hands. I worked the courage up to look down. 

Yes, oh god, there it was. My pokemon pajamas. The ones I had to throw out when I was twelve because my growth spurts made me too big to fit them anymore. 

I ran to the familiar bathroom down the hall. It was pitch black, but I could remember it all so clearly. Muscle memory, I think. I flicked on the light in the bathroom, and confirmed the worst.

""Alright Students, lets see what you remember..."" the teacher said, passing out a pop quiz as moans from my classmates erupted.

Most of the quiz looked to be pretty easy, just basic graphing. I signed my name up top along with the date.

""Oh wait, silly me! It's 2016 now, not 2015. Here comes those 3 weeks of constantly writing the wrong year on my paper..."" I said, hoping to get a laugh out of the class.

Silence. Not even a laugh out of pity. I looked up to see confused faces. But thats not what worried me, what worried me was that those were not my classmates. Well they were, just they were from last year. I instantly looked at my teacher, and then at the board. Why was I sitting in my Algebra II class? I took this last year.

[WP] It's been 3 months since you discovered your power to make people tell you the complete truth. How has your life changed?,Empty_Whiteboard,"I plopped onto the lush couch and flipped on the TV.  Price is right.  why not I thought, and settled in.  Outside my fancy hotel suite Washington D.C. buzzed with activity.  How did it come to this I thought.

A few months back I woke up like normal and hit up the gas station for my morning soda, same as always.  Idle chit chat with the Indian cashier, same as always.

""how are you?""

"" I'm high as a kite and this rash on my ass won't go away.""  His eyes grew wide and he blushed and gasped for air. Shocked I just accepted my change and left. Right outside a man was walking by and nodded. 

""What's up?"" I asked without stopping.

"" The sky, and all things elevated higher than us, also nothing much just out for  a stroll""  

Okay that guy was a little too on the nose but whatever. There's always a few strange people in the city. At work that same day I received an email from my boss asking to see me. Into his office I strode.

"" You want something from me?""

"" I want you to leave me the hell alone so I can continue to text Lisa about how I want to bend her over my desk!"" The words came out of his mouth in a rush. He had a face that can only be compared to someone who just realized they ate shit.  He stammered and let me off work for the rest of the day.

Thus started the strange and utter deviation in my otherwise mundane life.  I learned that when I ask someone a direct question they would respond with the truth.  This sounds fantastic on the surface. But you know what they say:  Curiosity killed the cat and don't ask a question you don't want an answer to.

Haven't you ever wanted to know how your wife or husband really felt. To ask them if they ever cheated or strayed, perhaps if they have any crushes. Do they fantasize about others while you have sex?  Don't ask questions you don't want the answers to. I found this out the hard way.

So what do I do now?  Well I tested this phenomenon.  First I learned that if someone truly believes what they are telling you they can in fact speak a falsehood.  They just don't know it's a lie. No learning if God is real or not I'm afraid, only whether someone truly believes he does or not. Also asking someone something they don't know gets you an I don't know.  

What to do with this power now that I have it fleshed out was my next thought.  Justice of course!  No one will believe me, I surely would be crazy to anyone who doesn't have proof. But I don't need to prove my powers. Just expose some of the wrongs in the world.

Cue the political world.  A short time later I am at conference at my local university.  The governor of my deep Red state was there to give a speech followed by Q&amp;A.  A few local channels were on standby to record it for the news. After waiting through the tediousness of it all I had a chance to ask my question

"" How much power and influence do the Koch brothers have on you and government as a whole?""

Well you can imagine the shitstorm that brought on.  It created a huge scandal in the following week and the governor was being portrayed as having a mental breakdown. Even so I was invited on a few news shows as the person who asked the question that broke the governor's mind. 

I quickly skip over this dialogue in my mind as the only thing that really matters is that I created more scandal with every person i talked to.  Then some sleuth from Reddit figured out that a post I created some time back when i first discovered my powers was from me and viola. The cat was out of the bag. It wasn't long after that until they came.

Now here I am. In a fancy hotel suite in DC.  There is a guard outside my door for my ""protection"".  He doesn't know crap.  All he knows is that if I want something he procures it for me and I can't leave the hotel room.

Every once in a while they haul me out to some government building or other and hand me a list of questions. I walk into a small room. Ask whoever there the questions on the sheet and then I am whisked back to my hotel room.

That they don't lie very often. Well the average person is full of shit. Lots of shit. Like, they're swimming in a farmload of grade A bull. 


Like Dr. House says, ""Everyone lies."" It's just a matter of how often. Little falsehoods mostly. For example, say you're at a mall with your girlfriend and she's trying on clothes. 


She comes up to you and asks, ""Does this make me look fat?""


Most guys would say No or at least say in a nicer way that maybe you ought to pick out something more flattering you know?


Not what my bae Joe said a couple of months ago. He said, and I quote, ""Yep. Makes you look like a beached whale. Actually no. It's not the dress. It's just you. Goddamn you need to hit the gym or something. You've gained weight woman.""


""The fuck you say to me?""


Joe started bugging out, his eyes were like dinner plates he was so scared. ""Oh shit, I didn't mean to say that. I'm sorry. You're not that fat.""


""You're lying! You think I'm fat!""


He couldn't shut up. ""Yeah, you're really fat. Like I'm ashamed to be seen with you in public. I'm just with you until something better comes along, you're my fallback.""


His hands were over his mouth but he couldn't stop talking. ""I didn't mean that! Yes I do. I think we should break up.""




Yeah, he wasn't bae for much longer. I figured out pretty quickly that I could make people say what was really on their mind. It was pretty obnoxious. I had no control over it at first and the degree of transparency people were exhibiting was seriously messed up. Imagine sitting in a bar having a drink and some guy walks up to you and says,


""I wanna fuck you."" 


Like straight up, not even hello or my name is or hi want a drink? And all these people would just say the nastiest things like they didn't have any filters anymore. I never really knew just how judgmental people were until they told me what they were really thinking.""



I finished talking and looked over at Dr. Griffin. He scribbled away on his yellow notepad, his hand a blur. He stopped and nibbled on the tip of his pen.


Then he asked, ""So how does that make you feel Marisol?""


I leaned backwards, sinking into the comfortable sofa. I fiddled with my hair, rolling some strands between my fingers before responding, ""Honestly, it was pretty overwhelming at first. Over time I've been able to get more control over whatever causes this. Now I can turn it off and on when I want. It's useful but I wish I could go back to the way things were. This *ability* has really fucked up my life you know?""


Dr. Griffin nibbled on his blue Bic pen again. The push cap was all worn down with teeth marks. ""That's natural considering you've gone through such a drastic life change. It can take time to adjust to these things.""


I sighed. ""Yeah, that's true. You're being very considerate Doctor.""


Dr. Griffin smiled. ""No problem Marisol. You can say whatever is on your mind here, this is a safe space.""


Moment of truth. I looked over at the psychotherapist and asked, ""You think I'm crazy don't you?""


""Oh completely. You're nuttier than a squirrel's winter stash."" He didn't quite realize what he had said. Then his face went white, all pale and pasty.


I gotta admit, that's one of the things I live for now. That moment of *oh fuck I actually said that.*


""I... I... I shouldn't have said that. That was completely unprofessional. I didn't mean it."" He was squeezing that pen so hard I wouldn't be surprised if he snapped it.


I shrugged. ""Yeah, yeah you did. Human lie detector remember? Don't worry about it. All of the shrinks react like that. Then they stop talking to me. Everyone stops talking to me. Are you going to stop talking to me too doc?""


Doctor Griffin furrowed his brow and crossed his leg. He put the pen back to his mouth and then put it down. Finally he responded, ""No. I'd be willing to meet with you again if you would like.""


""For real? Why? Don't I scare you?""


""A little bit. But it's kind of refreshing not to have any false appearances around a person. And I feel that you could use someone to talk to. It must have been a terrible burden shouldering this on your own.""


I broke down in tears. ""Thanks doc. That means a lot to me.""


Dr. Griffin smiled and patted my arm. ""No problem Marisol. I'll see you next week.""

Ohhhh...don't get upset, the dog is fine now. Just had a limp. There was one time I stole some pills from my grandmother. It was some heart medication or something.

I shoved one of them up my ass thinking it'd make me halkucinate or something. But nothing  happened, and I couldn't even sell that shit... long story short, I dont consider myelf a model youth. 

So color me surprised when the Karma institute gave me a score of 300. That's a near perfect karma rating. (302.537777 is a perfect rating, don't ask me why) 

They measure everything you do in life. Save a kitten from a tall tree? Get a positive point to your score. Used only a little bit of toilet paper when wiping your ass? Thats another positive point. 

Kick a dog in the stomach? Well thats like 30 negative points... I sure as hell don't spend much time saving kittens from trees. Toilet paper I try to save though. I'm not a monster.

You go to your friends house and take a large shit. Then wad up a  mound of toilet paper the size and density of a softball and try to flush that down a tiny hole. It doesn't work! Then you have shitty wet floors all over your ""friend's"" house. I use the term friend loosley because i'd kicked dogs for doing less than that...

My parents were happy I just turned 18. Free from the legal obligation to support me. Obviously they were as shocked as I was when they discovered my karma rating. Tried to figure out what the error was. But according to the institute, there was no error. 

The instute was founded a few years before i was born, so the system was fairly well developed by that point. Only more refined as years went on, they have placed people into some of the worlds most sought after careers. With a score of 300 i was basically able to choose whatever i want for the rest of my life. I just had to do one thing.

The testing rooms at the karma institute are very sterile. Comfortable temperature and nice furnishings, but something seems off. If i had to pin-point it, id say its the lack of fragrance. I wonder if i could smell a fart in here? 

Before i had a chance to let one rip and test my theory, a couple of white coats came in and placed in front of me a no.2 pencil and a sheet of paper face down. 

""Fill out the questionare, and turn the paper over when you are finished."" The woman speaking to me was, shorter than the guy, and looked a little more friendly. ""You have 15 minutes.""

I knodded and they went back through the door they came through. I flipped the sheet over and there was only one question. 

""If your mother needed 20 dollars, would you loan it to her?""

Hmm... Okay... uhh Wait! is this a trick question? I mean, why wouldn't I loan it to her?  Is there a catch? What does she need it for? Will she pay me back? Even if she did! Would that matter? And why can't I smell that fart?!?!

Before I knew it, the fifteen was up. The coats came marching through that one door and stood before me at my desk. They collected  the pencil i snapped in half, and the questionare, which i answered ""getFUCKED"" 

After reading my response the two coats looked at eachother and then marched out without saying anything. I was escorted out of the facilities, met with my parents, and the we drove home.

I don't really know why i answered the test that way... maybe i had a panick attack or something. I dunno. What i do know is i am now making more money than my parents combined doing something I love! Sucide prevention...

I the guy they call when they need someone to talk people off the ledge.  I'm good at it too! Somehow, i manage to maintain a 98% success rate. Some people jump, and it doesn't bother me because i like to see how twisted they end up when they land. But usually it ends up with me climbing a ladder and just carrying them down.

The man sits down and waits. An hour passes but the drink never comes.

""where's that water?""

""Oh, sorry, we're out of water."" says the bartender, annoyed by the interruption.

""Okay, can I get something else?""

""Sure.""

""Maybe some wine.""

""K.""

A beatiful woman walks into the bar and asks for a glass of water. The bartender pours it for her.

 The man watches her drink it slowly, he stares at the dirty glass with murky water inside. It looks disgusting but he's so thirsty.

 He doesn't even notice the woman.

""I thought there was no water"" he manages to mumble, his eyes still on the woman's glass, now empty.

""There isn't, that was the last of it""

""Well, what about the wine?""

""Oh, yeah lots of wine. But it's downstairs, and my leg hurts like hell today""

""Well...I could go get it.""

""You are not allowed there. And even if you were, you wouldn't be able to find the wine.""

The man stays there, looking at the basement door.

""I'll pay you a hundred dollars."" he says. The bartender and the woman laugh together.

""I'll take the money"" he says, snatching it from his fingers ""just so you can feel like you tried. But you are still not allowed. Even if I let you pass, my brother is down there, and he's twice my size.""

Closing time comes, and the man is so thirsty. Suddenly, he notices the bartender is drinking a glass of water.

""Why?"" he utters, and the words hurt his dry throat.

""This was your water, but now the bar is closed""

"[WP] In the future, a large portion of civilian life takes place in a virtual reality, where save points can be reloaded like in a computer game.",KathrinPissinger,"Sergio Vanices cursed, again. A short darkness and he was back across the street, again looking at the save point. He was sure someone was messing with everyone again. It would probably be like this till someone new got to a save point. What was annoying was the designers either did not think about it, or they were assholes, they made it so that a person could only log off on a save point.   
As soon as he could move He tried to push his virtual body to the limits to make it across the street and to the save point before the reset. The jerk, Dustin watched Sergio rush to the save point, as he was almost there, Dustin accepted the reset to the last save point. Sergio would pay for cutting him off earlier. It would only be a few more hours, and he was sure Sergio would lose his job. With unemployment as high as it was, any no-calls no shows would be as good as quitting.  All the smart players had purchased the hack to let them leave whenever, but it was obvious to him Sergio wasn’t a smart player, and so people that played the players like Dustin did could keep them stuck in an infinite loop for as long as they wanted and there was nothing the other person could do. If they stayed in a loop for longer than forty-eight hours then the administrators would look in to see if there was a glitch, but thirty six hours of looping would be no problem for him at least. He did revel in the curses being sent his way over area chat.

[IP] Perched,The_Eternal_Void,"“C’mon Coq, time to grab some grub.” I wrap the Roc’s rein’s around my fist, tugging his head back. In the time I’d been helping the queasy Mrs. Briggs off his back he’d already poked his beak into three passing wagons. Coq eyed me, clearly asking what he’d gain from listening.

“Grub?” I ask, widening my eyes, “Food? You’ve been flying for the past two hours, your crop’s gotta be empty by now?”

I wait for a reaction. Slowly, maintaining eye contact with me, he pokes his beak into another wagon. I throw my hands up in defeat.

“Fine! Go hungry then you turkey, just make sure that when Mrs. Briggs really does upchuck this time, you dodge. There’s no way I can round up business if you’re covered in sick.”

I turn on my heel to march off into the market. I know Coq can fend for himself, he always does. I just don’t want to get roped into his messes. Not all merchants are understanding when a gigantic beast of a bird downs half their merchandise. They’re even less understanding when I refuse to pay.

“Get a better flap on that thing then.” I’d always say before stalking off. Or my particular favourite: “You try telling him to stop.”

Somehow the heavy beak is a large deterrent. Nobody wants to argue with a Roc.

My stomach growled as I weaved through the mess of tents, humans and animals. The parched ground was strangely solid beneath my feet. Despite the arid climate I shivered. I still hadn’t warmed up from our flight. Now I just had to cross my fingers that the food stalls were serving more than shaved ice. Luckily the baajaar was a decent size, even if there wasn’t warm food I’d find something to soothe my ravenous appetite.

Following my nose I finally found a respectable tent serving a mess of hot food. I waited in line as people shouted and moved around me. Most of the people were dressed in loose bright clothing. In contrast to the barren looking landscape I’d flown over, the people were a marvel of life. Everyone around me was laughing and shouting. The mother ahead of me was scolding her son for some misdeed. I didn’t know what he’d done, she was speaking too quickly for basic skills in the language, but it was clear from her tone he was a trouble maker. I waited for her to turn away, then, when I caught the kids eye I gave him a big wink. He giggled and turned to bury in his mum’s skirts, hugging her leg through the fabric.

Once the mother had moved along I took my place at the head of the line.

“Um… chicken, one… vindaloo?” I pursed my lips. I hoped the vendor would be able to understand through my thick accent and broken grammar. He blinked at me then shouted in a much more eloquent tongue to his helpers. 

“Five pintros,” He told me, eying me up and down. I shifted my weight as I dug in my pocket for the obligatory coins. Pulling them out I double-checked their identity. I had so many loose coins now I couldn’t be sure the currency in my pocket was for this country or the next. Or the last.

I pushed my coins across the counter, ignoring the man’s raised eyebrow. Grabbing my steaming food I shoved out of the line, fighting my way to an emptier, secluded corner of the tent. There was only one raw table that was unoccupied. I veered in its direction.

Sitting, on the rough wooden bench. I inhaled the rich spicy scent of my meal. The rush of saliva to my mouth was satisfyingly rewarded with a bite of the curry and rice. Happily I hummed, tilting my head an rolling it to relax strained muscles.

I was only halfway through the bowl when I almost choked from a shove in my back. As it was I had to cough, my eyes already watering from the heat of my meal, spilled over with the force of my effort to breathe. 

“Damnit Coq!” I whispered as I wiped my eyes, feeling my hands come away wet and gritty from the mix of tears and dust, “If you want some food just say so. You don’t have to kill me for it.”

The Roc blinked unapologetically when I turned to look at him. His attention was focused on my meal.

“I didn’t buy enough for the both of us you know,” I told him, waving a spoon in his face. He snapped his beak impatiently. “Just enough for a human, because someone didn’t want to come with me.”

Now he ruffled his feathers, shaking his head. The tent shook with him. I was surprise he'd found me with all the hubbub outside. 

“Don’t look at me like that!” I snicker mercilessly. “You’re the one who was having too much fun with Mrs. Briggs to eat. This is all mine now.”

I propped one leg up on the bench. Now that the most pressing matter of food taken care of, my mind was free to start on the problem of business. Ferrying passengers between towns on the back of a Roc was fairly straightforward, but I’d never been this far west before. Drumming up business would be more difficult here where I wasn’t known. I wouldn’t have agreed to fly Mrs. Briggs all the way here if she hadn’t paid double for the trip. Hell if I knew what a stiff lady like her was going to do in this place. She struck me as more of a tea and biscuit woman rather than the earthy curry and goat market that this was.

Watching the rest of the customers in the tent I realized no one was batting an eye at the giant Roc’s head behind me. Good. That meant most people were familiar with Rocs even if it wasn’t necessarily for transport means.

A nudge to my elbow by Coq reminded me that I’d been too long between bites for my food to be safe. 

“Nice try,” I sneered at the bird. I bit down forcefully on my next spoonful. “You do know eating chicken is considered cannibalism for you?”

He reared back, puffing out his chest and glaring at me. I winced as his head brushed the ceiling. 

“Yeah, yeah, I know. Chickens are less intelligent than your own majestic self, so it’s not the same.” I swallow.  “But you know, I’d bet you’d taste twice as good in this because of that. I could charge ten pintros a bowl for you!”

Coq sneezed in denial.

“Scuse me, miss?” an unfamiliar voice interrupted my banter. I turned towards the speaker. He was a younger man a serious expression framed by dark eyebrows and a sharp jawline. “You wouldn’t happen to be a ferryman?”

He looked uncomfortable asking me this. One hand held the other wrist, a lone finger tapping a hasty rhythm on his skin. Although judging from his accent, common wasn’t his first tongue.

“As it so happens, I am.” I smiled pleasantly, bending to set my bowl on the floor. I ignored Coq as his beak brushed past my leg to snatch the remnants of my meal. I probably should have kicked him for the transgression, but it was more fun to let him think himself clever. And business was more important than a personal vendetta. “Name’s Camille Trallawnsky. This oversized pigeon is Coq. Where are you hoping to go?”

“I,” his eyes twitched nervously from side to side. I narrowed my own. “Anywhere is good, just away.”

“Anywhere is really vague.” I comment lightly, wiping my hands on my pants. “Have you got a specific destination in mind?”

He shook his head. I sigh. Why were all my customers so troublesome. The last one got motion sick, this one didn’t have a destination.

“Tell you what, “ I leaned forwards, “I can take you ‘anywhere’ so long as you pay. I’m warning you though, the charge can get pretty hefty. Feeding this feathered glutton isn’t easy.”

I jerked my thumb over my shoulder at Coq, who was currently trying to puzzle a way to get more of the sauce out of the dish without getting his beak messy.

“Still want to go ‘anywhere’?” I challenged.

I didn’t twitch as the client pulled out a sack of coins from under his own loose clothes to toss on the table between us. Slowly, I reached over to it. I unlaced it’s drawstring to see a mass of coins. None of them were pintros. My eyes flicked back up to his face. He waited, watching me, and watching my reaction.

I grabbed a handful of them, looking closer. Most of them were drachs, a smattering of lahms and even a few twiens from my home country. I considered my options. Shifty eyes, a nervous twitch, money that can’t be traced back to this country, no doubt he was up to something. I didn’t want to find out what that was, but he was paying more than enough for three times the trip I had just made.

“I presume that is enough?” He dropped his accent now, speaking common with an ease well beyond my own.

I hesitated. My gut was telling me that this could, potentially, turn out for the worse. Playing for time I flicked one of the coins into the air, catching it on its way back down.

“Seems to be,” I dithered. A clanging noise drew my eyes to the floor. Coq had managed to drop the bowl. 

Coq. 

At the first sign of trouble I could just ditch the man and fly away safe. Or Coq could just eat him. I smiled again. Sometimes it was useful having the bird-brain around.

“Welcome aboard Mr….” I spoke, trailing off to let him fill in the rest of his name.

“Mardock.”

“Well, Mr. Mardock,” I paused slightly on the name, knowing full well it probably wasn’t his real one. I extended one hand to seal the deal, “I hope for your sake you aren’t airsick. Our last trip was a bumpy one.”

[IP] The Cat Warrior,_John_Locke_4815,"Neko Senshi sat riverside with his mount panting nearby. The gentle water laughed like the tinkling of bells as the insects sang a chorus of summer heat. The river was a pale green and brown dragon with scales of stone that sparkled like their precious cousins in the sun. The current playfully tugged at a length of twine in the water like a cat and the water purred happily to itself.

The twine was tied to a fallen branch which Neko Senshi had found under the tree which he now slept. The wind danced through the leaves like and made Neko Senshi's ears and whiskers twitch. His mount, the mighty Inu, kept a watchful eye over her rider in silence and paid no mind to the gentle breeze running its fingers through her golden fields of fur. 

It was yet another perfect day.

""How fortunate are we, Inu,"" said Neko Senshi, stirring from his sleep with no warning, causing Inu's tail to shoot up in anticipation. ""To experience yet *another* perfect day?""

Inu said nothing but offered a quiet ""boof"" and crossed her paws.

Neko Senshi nodded in agreement and said, ""I do believe each day is so perfect because we will it so. Do you not agree?""

Inu yawned.

""Take for today for example,"" Neko Senshi continued. ""Is the sun not glorious today? Is the wind not gentle? Is the water not calming? No clouds in the sky save those three that keep circling us.""

Inu looked skyward and saw what her partner had already described;three shapes were circling above them. They appeared to be birds. Inu began a low growl in her throat. Neko Senshi payed her no mind. 

""I think you worry too much, noble Inu,"" and he fell back to sleep. 

The three cranes that were circling up above slowly landed and observed Inu and Nek Senshi. But they did not see Neko. The way he was slumped against the tree, he looked like an empty suit of armor. The Arashi Brothers (for this is what the cranes were called) adjusted their wide brimmed hats and approached Inu who gave a bark of warning.

""Apologies!"" said the first brother, whose name was Rai. ""We did not mean to disturb you, noble warrior. We are such as your self, you see, and we seek another like us.""

""How do you know she's a warrior?"" asked the second brother, whose name was Ka. 

""Don't be stupid!"" Rai turned and hissed at his brother. ""She must be! Otherwise, why would she have armor?""

""The armor under the tree?"" asked the third brother, whose name was Ame. ""I do believe it is too small for her, my brothers. Not to mention it is also breathing.""

Rai, Ka, and Ame looked at the armor and saw that indeed it appeared to be breathing. The chest plate was slowly moving up and down as if the armor had a life of its own and was taking a nap. 

""This is a haunted place!"" cried Ka. ""We must leave this place or be cursed forever!""

""Hush,"" scolded Rai. ""I have no fear of death, let alone the dead. Ame, go and check it out.""

Ame swallowed hard. He had never met a ghost and did not know what to expect. Also, the dog mount seemed completely and totally unamused by the Arashi Brothers. She growled quietly and kept eyes locked locked on Ame like a steel trap. 

Tentatively, Ame reached out with his talon and prodded the armor. ""S-sir Ghost?"" he quivered. ""Do you plan to curse us?""

Neko Senshi immediately shot awake with an inquisitive ""mmrrow"" and sent the Arashi Brothers into a feathery panic. It was an odd sight to process but especially when one has just awoken from a summer afternoon cat nap. ""Inu,"" Neko Senshi said. ""Who are our strange guests?""

Inu shrugged.

""Pardon me,"" said Neko Senshi to the Arashi Brothers. ""But who are you and why do you run about so?""

""Ah ha!"" Ka said. ""It's not a ghost after all; just a cat!""

""I had suspected,"" said Rai, who hadn't.

""What do you think you are doing out here, cat?"" demanded Ka. ""Scaring the living daylights out of people just for laughs, eh?""

Neko Senshi blinked. ""No,"" he said, smiling. ""Just fishing.""

""Fishing? Are you not on a quest?"" asked Ame.

""I am on a quest for dinner,"" said Neko Senshi.

""Ah, forgive me,"" said Ame, bowing. ""I took by your armor that you were a warrior.""

""Oh but I am,"" said Neko Senshi, leaning back again, basking in the heat. ""But even a warrior must eat.""

""So you are a warrior!"" said Rai with delight. ""Then perhaps you can aid us!""

""I will do what I can,"" said Neko Senshi.

""We seek a warrior of great repute,"" explained Rai.

""One whose reputation spreads far across the land and sea,"" interjected Ka.

""They say this warrior cannot be beaten by mortal or gods!"" said Ame, excitedly. ""He moves as silently as a shadow, swift as a shooting star, and his aim is as sure as *death*!""

His brothers looked at Ame. ""At least,"" Ame said, embarrassed. ""That's what I had heard...""

""This warrior seems to have it all,"" said Neko Senshi. ""But does he have a name?""

""But of course,"" said Rai. ""They call him 'Neko Senshi'.""

""They say all that about me?"" Neko Senshi asked. ""And here I thought I was just plain, old Neko Senshi.""

""They say all that about him and more!"" Ame bubbled. ""He's so cool! They say he once took on an entire clay army with nothing but his bear paws! And this one time, Neko Senshi tricked a wicked kitsune by convincing him to swallow eight of his nine tails! That's why foxes today only have one-"" Rai clamped a wing over his brother's beak.

""Wait,"" Rai said. ""Did you say that *you* are Neko Senshi?""

""I did!"" said Neko Senshi, helpfully. ""And I did face an army of clay with my bare hands...but the clay soldiers were just that; mere clay. They put up no more of a fight than the clay in the river you see before you. And as for the wicked kitsune, I did meet a fox once who thought she was cleverer than I but she only had one tail when I knew her. Perhaps it's a story in reference to-""

""*You* are the great and terrible Neko Senshi?"" Rai repeated, jaw ajar.

""Yes,"" said Neko Senshi, warily. ""Unless there is another warrior named as such?""

""You are one of the most powerful warriors to have ever lived?"" blustered Ka.

""Yes, I am.""

""The one who faced the serpent queen of monsters, Oro, and lived?"" asked Ame.

""Yes, I did. She's actually very nice once you get to know her.""

""I don't believe it!"" shouted Rai. ""If you truly are the great Neko Senshi, why not fight me?""

""Why would I fight you?"" asked Neko Senshi. ""You are not my enemy.""

Rai revealed a katana from under his wing. The blade glinted in the summer sun and cried for blood.

""There,"" said Rai. ""Now I am your enemy. Draw your weapon 'oh great Neko Senshi' and strike me down!""

""I'm afraid I cannot,"" explained Neko Senshi. ""For I have no weapon.""

Rai glowered at Neko Senshi. ""Do you expect me to believe that Neko Senshi, revered by mortals, honored by gods, hero of a thousand stories has *no* weapon?""

""I do expect you to believe that,"" said Neko Senshi, smiling. ""For it is the truth.""

""Then how did Neko Senshi win all of his battles? Tell me that!""

""I used my words rather than violence,"" Neko Senshi said simply.

""Words are cheap,"" Rai said, advancing on Neko Senshi. ""Fight me.""

Neko Senshi said, ""You seem to know a great deal about me but I know nothing about you three. I don't even know your names.""

Rai stopped in his tracks and flourished his wings. He said, ""We are the Arashi Brothers! I am the mighty Rai! And these are my brothers Ka and Ame.""

""Wait,"" said Neko Senshi in amazement. ""Arashi? *The* Arashi Brothers?""

""You've heard of us?"" said Ame, genuinely amazed.

""Who has not heard of the fury and glory of the Arashi Brothers?"" said Neko Senshi. ""People from all around talk of your great and heroic deeds!""

The brother began to ruffle their feathers and puff out their chests.'

""Yes,"" continued Neko Senshi. ""I've heard people talk very highly of all of you. But *especially* of your brother Ka.""

Rai and Ame whirred on their brother and all three expounded, ""Ka??""

""Oh yes,"" Neko Senshi elaborated. ""They say that of all three of the brothers, none is more handsome, strong, or virile.""

""Well,"" Ka said, enjoying the attention. ""This is, of course, quite true.""

""Nonsense!"" interjected Rai. ""They're must be some mistake!""

""Yeah,"" Ame agreed. ""They obviously meant me!""

""Yes,"" said Rai. ""They obviously meant...you?? Why would anyone say that about you?""

Ka said, ""Do you even know what virile means, Ame?""

""Of course I do!"" yelled Ame, who didn't. 

""No,"" Rai said. ""If anyone is to be praised of the success of the Arashi Brothers, it is the indomitable Rai!""

""Oh please,"" said Ka. ""You heard Neko Senshi. It is the vigorous Ka of whom the people speak!""

While the brothers bickered, Neko Senshi had gone to his fishing pole. He pulled it from the water and whacked Rai square on the head. Rai immediately faced Ame and snapped, ""Coward! Hitting me while my back was turned, eh? Another move like that and both of you shall taste my steel!""

Neko Senshi looked at the hook and shook his head. ""Alas, no dinner here."" He lifted the pole to recast and gave Rai another solid smack. Neko Senshi heard a roar of displeasure and turned to see a flurry of feathers; the meadow filled with the shriek of metal on metal as the brothers fought for their imaginary honor. Neko Senshi chuckled at the absurdity of it all and realized that a place like this is no place to fish. He removed his pole from the water and calmly walked past the battle to Inu which he saddled and they began to trot away.

The sky yawned before them in an unmarred, crystalline blue abyss. The meadow was a crowd of yellows, oranges, and reds all dancing to the music the wind played. Insects fluttered about the mass of color speaking in the ancient and simple tongues they save for themselves and the cacophony of the familial spat was fading under the roaring silence of nature. 

Neko Senshi had become pensive. ""You know, Inu,"" he said. ""People can behave so strangely.""

Inu said nothing but offered a quiet ""boof"" and bounded through the world, taking them to their next story. ",PardooTheHolyMan

I must fix this? But... how? If only I could go back...

---

Time travel. I'm a God, of course I can. For a moment, I pause in confusion, trying to get my bearings. I still have my power, my divinity. Now, though, I have a world I can use it in. For a moment, I am distracted, my lust for power overtaking my rational thought. I am a God, but I am a broken God. In mortal life, I never acknowledged that my mind was shattered. I attacked those who claimed it was as witch hunters, afraid of the future, afraid of what must inevitably come to be. I was such a fool. I still am.

I don't hold physical form, but nevertheless I feel the sensation of looking around as I get used to my omniscience. I know my duty- Prevent my existence, or at least, perform it in such a way that I do not bring about oblivion. It is two years before my transcendence into Godhood. The pieces were already on the board, and already in motion. It was a waiting game. Every government on Earth wanted me, dead or alive, and I was playing them all like they were fools. I was always spectacularly intelligent.

I take the form of a rich man. The strength of this body is in respect and influence. I should easily be able to convince myself to leave this path. The paradox is unfortunate, but necessary. There is no time to waste. My hand immediately goes to my cheek, where my scar had always sat in life. An ugly thing, born of the fires of a war that nobody wanted. Instead of feeling the rough scar tissue, I feel smooth skin. It is... a strange sensation.

It is in that instant that I know this is not going to work. It was a rich man's war that began my ascent to godhood, and a rich man cannot remove the wounds that a rich man caused. Yet, there is no other way for me to contact my younger self. He will be steadfast in his beliefs, if not reinforced in them, if I attempt to rip them away. I must go further back.

---

I reform four years earlier still, shortly before the English government first attempts to arrest me for my supposed crimes against nature. They were the first nation to try and take me down for my experiments, the first of many. It was always too much for those poor fools. They never understood the magnitude of my work, the importance of it. It would be so easy for me to...

No. I am here to remove myself from the equation, not them. I feel the sensation of looking around once more, and my omniscience takes hold. I take the form of a veteran. A scar, similar to that of my former self, adorns my face on the opposite cheek. There is an odd sort of comfort in it, that ancient wound, a nostalgia of sorts. My clothes are old, somewhat tattered, but recognizable. An army uniform, the same rank as I was. I don't have a right hand.

I approach the door that I know holds my first lab, in the university of Oxford, and hesitate before knocking. *This.* This would be the moment that would, hopefully, erase my future from ever happening. Just before I knock, the door slams open, and I see my younger self. Our eyes lock for a moment, his cold and calculating, mine surprised, and he pushes past me without another word, briefcase in hand.

I forgot. I did not hold pity, back then. But... Why did I not know he was approaching the door? I must be unused to my omniscience.

Back again, then.

---

The day I returned home from the war. I did not intend to stop here, but my subconscious had other ideas, I suppose.

I take the form of a passenger, completely normal in all respects. This is one incident I do not wish to interfere with. I still remember the raw, unadulterated joy when I stepped off the plane, the happiness at finally returning home. There was nothing that I can think of changing from that wonderful day.

As we arrive at the airport, I look several rows ahead of me, where my younger self sits. He's antsy, shifting around and looking at the passengers closest to him as if they're threats. War changes people. Breaks them, I suppose. Then, I see the dark red on his cheek... I had forgotten how fresh the scarring was. How he winces... How I winced every time my hand brushed my cheek, both from the pain of the wound and the pain of my memory. As we walk off of the plane, I see my younger self trip for a moment, catching himself instantly. Nevertheless, it was enough for a certain individual one row back to notice him. The man who would warn me the day before the British moved in to arrest me, and one of the few people in the world I called 'friend.' He tilts his head in confusion, then notices the scar as my younger self turns his head. He nods, as if in understanding, and his right hand goes to his left elbow, where his left arm ends. We were hurt in different ways, but it was the same war that did it.

I watch him as he approaches my younger self. I was nervous, when I saw the larger man approach me, despite his missing limb. I was anxious, and my hand reflexively went to my waist, where my sidearm had been for the last four years. He saw, and chuckled, offering his hand to me in introduction. I shook it cautiously.

I blink for a moment, surprised to find my eyes blurring. They're wet. I'm... Crying.

The war broke me. I haven't felt tears stream down my face since that day in the desert.

That day in the desert...

---

I cough for a moment, waking up as a soldier in a line. My midnight black uniform, with verdant accents, is in stark contrast to the desert around me. I look around with my omniscience, and I see myself, so many years younger. His cheek is clear, but for the dirt that covered it. Ahead of us, a checkpoint.

This is where it all goes to hell. I brace myself slightly as we approach where I remember the explosion. My eyes flicker to the west, where a small jeep was racing towards our line. My younger self is the first to notice, and he calls out in warning. The line scatters, and most of us fall to the ground. The jeep, and the man in it, explode when they hit the road. Of one hundred men, I used to estimate that fifty died instantly. With my powers, I now know it's fifty-eight. The other forty-one died over the course of the next few minutes, where the checkpoint ahead of us begins firing on us from a range, having long been taken over by the enemy. My body was destroyed in the explosion, so I observe my younger self.

The explosion sent him flying, breaking his leg. This is what saved him from the brunt of the carnage, I think. I would've gone in, tried to save my allies, had I not been unconscious. I see a death crew come out from the checkpoint. Three men. I remember this part.

My younger self slowly wakes up, his ears ringing. He sees enemy soldiers shoot his SO in the head. He grabs his sidearm, taking aim and killing two of them in a single shot. The other leaps backwards, and it takes another four badly aimed shots to kill him. He drags their bodies behind a rock, where he strips them of the explosives that line their jackets. He sneaks into the checkpoint from the side, lining it with the explosives, retreats to a safe distance, and sets them off. The entire time, he is ignoring the agonizing pain in his leg and the blood flowing from many wounds on his body. He limps into the flaming remnants of the base as a one man death squad, and executes the ringleader of the group- A sixteen year old boy with some teaching in strategy. A child. There is no emotion in his eyes, no hatred, no regret. Just emptiness. It would stay that way until he gets on a plane home.

---

I go back further, seeing the events of my life flash by. I can't change them. Each of them made me who I am, the broken mess of a man that I am. I travel back to the instant before I became a God, and I form myself next to the machine.

""Who are you?"" My younger self hesitates, just as he's about to inject himself with the first stage.  
**""An observer. One who knows you better than you realize.""** I close my eyes and smile wryly at my small joke. **""It will work. You will be a God. But you will be a God of nothing.""**

""How do you know that?"" He narrows his eyes.

**""We are one, you and I. You are what I once was. I am what you will be, if you continue on this path. You become a God, but in the process, you destroy everything. Then, you go back. You try and fix it, but you find that you cannot bring yourself to. Your life has sorrow in it, and you know the perfect times to fix everything... But you can't. 2 years ago. 4 years ago. The plane. The desert. Life is Hell, but it is in the flames of this Hell that your Crucible was found, and you were born. Do not make my mistake.""**

I only have an instant to react as I feel myself begin to fade from existence.

M... M... M... C... C...

I closed my eyes and steadied myself. We were in the same group of hundred, but that still meant my chances were only 1%.  I had to be realistic here.

Cracking open one eye, I read the last few numerals.

X... X...

Twenty! She was in the twenties! 1 in 10!

V... I...

And that was it. One V. One I. Six. One away from Seven.

I deflated with a huge sigh. So much for that, what a fucking joke. I had gotten my hopes up for nothing.

""Uh, are you done yet?"" The woman asked over her shoulder, guarding her drink at the bar as if I was going to steal it.

Fucking typical non-soulmate response. I would've been done sooner if she hadn't kept turning her wrist away. I sneered, ""No need to be such a bitch, I was just looking at your numerals.""

Her jaw dropped and before she could turn to slap me or throw her drink, I stalked off to the next girl with an exposed wrist. Finding my soulmate would be so much easier if all the girls just lined up with their wrists out or if she just took a picture of it and posted it online like a *normal person*.

[WP] Every person in the world has a Roman numeral birth mark on their wrist which matches up with someone who is meant to be their soul mate.,itscampbelldavis,"You know, I've always been a bit off.

I never really played with the other kids, I just read. I can give you a lecture on science like no one's business, but small talk's a chore. Oh, and I don't have any numerals. 

Everyone else I know does. My parents have a complex string of M's, L's, and X's in common with one another. My brother, too, has numerals on his wrist. They're like my parents', but with some slight changes. All my friends have them, and some even share numerals with one another. Still, though, I don't.

Since they don't show up until the onset of puberty, I didn't realize how abnormal I was until I was around fourteen. I remember thinking people just got them tattooed on or something, until I was told that the numerals just start to appear on your wrist by themselves. Seven years later, here I am. Numeral-less. 

A lot of people seem to have a tough time understanding this. Whenever I wear tee shirts, or people can see my wrist, I get comments indicating that there's something wrong with me. That's far from the truth, though. Even though I don't have the numerals that are so important to so many people, I don't have that all-consuming drive to find a soulmate. I can focus on things that matter to me, like friends. There are others without numerals, too. I've met some and befriended them over the Internet. 

Overall, even though I don't have a numeral combination on my wrist, I'm generally pretty happy with life. Hopefully, this can get out to other people, especially those without numerals, to show that just because you don't have some numbers from a long-dead empire on your carpals doesn't mean you're wrong as a person.

"[WP] Humans have ascended and new species are racing to being Earth's dominate species. You are a member of the ""fantasy league"" that is making rules and bets on which species will win.",spencethechef101,"This is going to be my first post, so please critique my format and writing, thank you!

&amp;nbsp;

You realize something after being alive for thousands of years, and that thing is fun moments can come few and far between. There was once a time where enjoyment was a constant feeling, but now as I'm a ""higher being"" the fun has since been exhausted.

I have to say though, being pseudo-god has its perks. For one, wiping out humanity as many times as I wanted was an absolute blast, and purposely making sure my ex was late to work everyday for two weeks led me to cackling for days. But, times have changed and the only fun I could come across was the insolent humans and their silly drama and strife's with one another. After another 3000 years and seven world wars later, I decided I was done with this way of life and decided to spice things up a bit.

After calling a few of my mates we settled on a bet. It was to be a block pool of sorts, with winner take all. Of course nothing was at stake with this bet, except for the bragging rights which is better than anything any of us could offer at this point. After much arguing we decided on the conditions, which were not as complex as one might expect.

The rules were: 

* All Humans would be removed from Earth, along with everything they did so Earth would return to how it was before Humans left their mark.
* Any species on Earth was fair game, and that species could take as long as it needed to become dominate.
* Each player may only select one specific species, such as *Panthera leo* or Lions
* The first species to achieve sentience would win.

So the order of picks was made, and me being the humble host I was I volunteered to go last. The drafting had begun and of course the obvious species were picked. dolphins, lions, elephants, monkeys, almost all the bear species, ostriches, and eagles were selected first. Then went all the small animals, such as ants, bees, butterflies, and squirrels. As the pool of selection slowly dwindled, I begun thinking about what species to choose. As the final contestant before me made his choice, I decided.

[WP] You're the wealthiest person in the world and anything you desire can be paid for ... Except the one thing for which you would sacrifice your fortune.,thispackofwolves,"Several days before the start of the Hajj, Mansa Musa stood with his arms out as his servants disrobed him of his gold-decorated robes, his golden circlet, his gold bracelets and necklaces. He stepped into the bath, where the servants washed his dark brown body with warm water and milk. They approached him with the simple white cloths of ihram, and draped them over his body.

A devout Muslim, Musa had made the pilgrimage at last, crossing thousands of miles in Africa from Mali northward, then into the Arabian peninsula to Mecca. He had been so eager to reach the holy city that he found himself in Cairo months too early, and set up camp there, freely spreading his wealth and gold to such an extent that it nearly collapsed the local economy, angering the Egyptian ruling court. The latter demanded to see him; he rebuffed them, as he was only interested in the Hajj. Infuriated, the Egyptian sultanate threatened force. Though the Lion of Mali had no fear that he would lose, he worried that conflict would be long and hold him back from his pilgrimage, so he humored them and bestowed gifts of hundreds of pounds of spices, dyes, and gold upon them. 

All of no consequence to him - mere pittance compared to his vast wealth, which left mosques built every week in his wake. Musa did not care about what wealth he lost, what wealth he gained. As a man with the riches to obtain whatever he wanted, he wanted only what man cannot obtain with riches.

Musa made his way to the stone building of Kaaba. Although ihram was meant to make him as any other man, he could not bear to be considered as anything other than a king, and so paid off the throngs of men who sought to perform the Umrah that day - a pilgrimage on a non-Hajj day. He intended to walk the Tawaf alone. He sent away his servants and posted his guards to form a perimeter, instructing them to pay off any visitors who might disturb him.

He reached out to the Black Stone on the eastern corner of the Kaaba. It was cool to the touch, as the early morning sun had not yet warmed the earth. He held Takbir prayer in his mind as he walked briskly around the Kaaba for the first three circuits.

*Bismillah, Allahu Akbar.*

*Bismillah, Allahu Akbar.*

*In the name of Allah, Allah is the greatest.*

On his fourth circuit, he slowed his step. He rounded the eastern corner with the Takbir prayer, but his mind turned to his true thoughts.

*Allah, will I be among the saved?*

*Allah, I have built mosques and spread your name and grace. Is that enough?*

*Allah, what must I do to be saved?*

He knew to expect no answer. On his last circuit, he thought only of his mortality, and his desperate hope that his faith was well-founded. One day, he would die like any other man. And on that day, he hoped that all his wealth, all his works, all his life - that it all meant something. That it wouldn't all just end in hellfire, or worse - oblivion.

Musa walked away from the Kaaba, having received no wisdom from Allah. Yet he still believed. He had to believe.",chondroitin

""One day, my love. One day,"" he whispered to himself.

"[WP] You are a senior student at a prestigious school of thievery. The only way to graduate is to break into the headmasters office, steal a certain object and escape from the school. Tonight you're going to attempt it.",FlowersForMegatron,"""So, when are you going to do it?"" I asked Jorg.

""Soon, you'll see..."" He replied.

This was always his answer. He had a master plan, one that neither me nor Ba'al could comprehend. So we let him be.

""You know, you're going to run out of time. If you're trying to trick the headmaster into dispelling his magical wards by showing up every night at the same time, you're going to flunk out."" I warned him.

""I know what I'm doing. There's a process to this you know. It's called *thievery*. Maybe you've heard of it? Or is that too subtle for you, Mister-Grand-Larceny?"" He fired back sharply, with a tinge of dry wit.

Jorg was, of course, referring to the evening of my victory over the headmaster, in which I stole a prized statuete of the God of Shadow from his shelf. My plan was to be unorthodox - and what could possibly be more orthodox than picking the lock to the front door of the office?

I rode to town and elicited the services of a man rumored to be half-ogre. Though the rumors seem to have been... exaggerated to a certain degree. Nevertheless, he would be insturmental in my triumph. I used the half-breed and his titanic strength to bash down the door in a single blow. Of course, all the alarms went off, and the headmaster came rushing in as fast as his legs would carry him, but I was already gone by the time he arrived. Though, my accomplice was captured in the confusion, the headmaster could not get anything out of him from his interrogations besides ""Uhgh..."" and ""Me smash!"". He was a good minion while he lasted. I admired the ornament daily, and I planned to present it to him in a grandiose fashion during the graduation ceremony, where those who are able to present an item from his office are sorted from those who could not.

""Tonight is my night. I need to scout the location one more time. I hope nothing tips him off. Wish me luck, lads!"" Ba'al was eager to leave. He had been careful to mask his presence, and he took meticulous notes on the kinds of defenses the headmaster would have set up - wards, alarm runes, traps. Most importantly, he was able to crack the pattern of the headmaster's personal schedule, which was unpredictable for this very reason - it's easy to steal something from an office if you watch the location all day and every day for 6 months. It's much harder if the traps are different every time, and the headmaster could be there at any moment waiting to spring on someone bold enough to enter without information.

Less than an hour passed, and Baal returned through the window of the dormitory.

""I got it."" He flashed a brilliant arcane prism.

""How did you..."" I began to speak, but trailed off as my gaze was lost in the rainbow kaleidoscope of the prism.

""It wasn't easy."" he started. ""At first I thought I could find a weakness in his defenses, but then I realized that he was watching others who were doing the same. He was probably already keeping tabs on me, waiting for me to make my move."" Ba'al explained.

""Then how...?"" 

""You know that trollop from class 1B? The redheaded girl?""

""You mean Etna?""

""That's the one! It turns out, she'd make a better librarian than thief. I convinced her to do some research on the headmaster, away from prying eyes. She got me all the ammunition I needed to take him down. I didn't even have to sneak into his office. I cornered him alone on campus grounds and threatened to release all the information she had uncovered for me. Turns out, the headmaster was involved in a number of scandals involving the local townspeople. Who would have thought that when something goes missing in the village, all fingers would point towards the thieves school less than a few miles down the road? Anyway, there was enough information there to implicate him in a few large criminal cases, but the best source of information was the family history. I used that to threaten him into giving me an item from his office - and he did it. I never set foot inside there, I just made him do it for me.""

""But won't he come forward and expose you?"" Jorg questioned.

""Probably not. The item from the office was a payoff. If I keep my mouth shut about the exact details of the incidents, he'll have no choice but to keep silent and trade my item for a writ of initiation at the ceremony."" Ba'al was beaming with excitement.

The days bled into the weeks, and Jorg had yet to brag of his triumph. The day of the graduation ceremony came, and all the students in the school were in attendance. Before he would call each student forward, he addressed the class with the ceremonial speech. Those who presented him an item that he recognized would be allowed to take a place by his side, after exchanging the item for a ""diploma"" of sorts.

""Students, fellow rogues, men of the night. Although it must have felt like a long and arduous journey to each of you, to me, it was but a fraction of a moment in time. I have taught you everything you need to know, and I have imparted all the knowledge I could. But wisdom can come only from experience. There is more to thievery than picking locks and skulking in the shadows. Though we are all bound in the bonds of brotherhood here, I have asked each of you, as part of your final test, to present an item successfully stolen from my office. I call upon those who have succeeded to come forth and present the item now.

As the headmaster called the students one by one, they came to stand face to face with a man who could only be described as the greatest thief who had ever lived, a man they called their mentor for the last four years of rigorous schooling and studying. I gave back the statue of the God of Shadow. The headmaster simply nodded, and I took my place with the others on the stage, clutching my writ of initiation against my breast while many students who went after me were denied that honor. Finally, it was Ba'al's turn. He, too, returned the prism stolen from the enchanting table. The headmaster, again, only nodded his approval and handed him his writ.

When it came time for Jorg to approach, I held my breath. Would he be held back another year? Would out band of merry men be broken apart? I felt a tightness in my chest, perhaps guilt - that I did not do enough to support my close friend.

Then, Jorg revealed an item - a feather quill. The headmaster shoot his head in disapproval, but still took the item from Jorg and have him the writ. As he walked over with a smug grin on his face, I could only beg the question.

""There has got to be some kind of story behind all this."" I said. ""Last night you were pacing around like a nervous wreck. I thought for sure you were done for!""

""Tell us how you did it."" Ba'al quipped.

""Well... Here's how I did it..."" He started, speaking in a hushed voice.

Our ears perked up to hear his words closely.

""I asked the headmaster if I could speak with him in private. He suspected that I was going to use that time to speak with him, but I convinced him that I was dropping out. He brought me into his office to try and talk me out of it."" He began.

""and then what happened?""

""Then I snatched his quill from the inkwell and put it in my pocket.""

""How on earth did he not see this?"" I questioned.

""He did see it.""

""Then how did you not get caught in the act?""

""Nobody ever said you couldn't get caught. I asked to borrow it to sign my release papers. Then, I put the quill in my pocket and I refused to give it back. I was prepared to wait out the remainder of the time in the dungeon, if need be. It's a requirement that all students attend the graduation ceremony, so I knew that as long as he didn't get that pen out of my pocket in the next 24 hours, I was in the clear.""

""That is the most daft plan I have ever heard. You're a mad genius, you know that?"" Ba'al was loose with his compliments that evening.

The last student filed into their respective group, and the headmaster spoke up once again to close the ceremony.

""To those of you who were successful, remember this: you succeeded not because you were the better thief, but because you were the better thinker. You outsmarted your adversary so that even when trapped within a prison of defenses, they still were not safe from your machinations. It is not always a measure of strength, speed, or skill that makes up a good thief. Rather, it is a combination of cunning, wit, cleverness, and...""

The headmaster glared at Jorg, as if speaking directly to him.

""just a tiny bit of the element we all refer to as 'luck'. I invite all of you to dine with me this evening in a celebration of your transformation into fullblooded thieves. That is all.""

At the dinner party, the three of us sat together. The headmaster was unusually talkative, and went around to personally congratulate each student who graduated and tell them a bit about the item they had stolen. He came upon our group and grimmaced.

""Ah, the three musketeers. You boys surprised me. A most unorthodox approach from each of you. You didn't play to your own strengths, but you did learn how to outsmart the system and play the game to your advantage. I'm sure you'll all go on to become fine lawyers someday.""

He gave us a pat on the shoulder and he was off. That was the last time I ever saw him, but the three of us are still friends to this day. ",AntiTheory

[WP] Write something in the 2nd Person POV,history_is_awesome,"It must be the threat of killing someone just by pointing at them that keeps criminals in line around you. Sure a gun might be just as effective, but your hands are literally an extension of your body and therefore much easier to aim. Not to mention the fact that you never run out of ammunition and you never have to worry about dropping your weapon. You pull the familiar-smelling leather jacket around your back and smile. 

You walk out onto your 33rd story balcony, check the ground below you, and jump.

As you fall you hold both hands downward, aiming at the ground. It's well known that every action has an equal and opposite reaction. What isn't as well known is that rapidly firing wave after wave of high velocity beams is enough to keep you from falling flat as a pancake against the concrete after jumping from this height. The beams don't disperse much at this distance, so you don't have to worry about hitting any unintended targets. You land in a perfect superhero pose in your parking spot outside the towering apartment complex.

[WP] Write something in the 2nd Person POV,history_is_awesome,"You’ve really done it this time, haven’t you? Oh, don’t bother trying to explain. It’s far too obvious what happened here. Let me fill in the blanks, will you?

You weren’t sure how to find this place, and it was very important that you be on time, so you left a little early. Like, maybe an *hour* early. A little excessive, don’t you think? But you had an interview, and you weren’t about to risk making a bad impression, so who could blame you? But it turns out the Madison building wasn’t that hard to find, really. I mean, it was the only fifty-seven story red brick building in the downtown area, so you arrived long before anyone could have realistically expected you to get here, and you had time to kill, so you decided to take a little walk. 

You rounded the corner at 5th and Haver, and that’s when you noticed something a little strange. The street was empty; emptier than you had ever seen. It was not merely the absence of people that surprised you. Not even the lack of cars, trucks, or any other manner of vehicles. No. Naturally, since you’re a smart cookie, that sort of thing *would* have caught your attention in and of itself. But what you found odd was the lack of pretty much any other distinguishing feature on the street as well. There were no parking meters, no fire hydrants, no vendor hot dog stands or phone booths. Hell, there weren’t even any lines painted on the street. It was just some uniform and boring shade of grey that didn’t even look real to you.

In fact, in the midst of this surreal landscape that resembled nothing so much as a low polygon rendering meant only to approximate a street, you could find only one tiny, almost insignificant splash of color: it was a button, about the size of a half dollar coin and fire engine red. Unlabelled, and bearing no inscription. Now, I can’t say for sure what was going through your mind at this point. Only you know that. But I think I can take a guess: you were wondering something along the lines of “what happens if I press this button?” Am I right? Of course I am.

Now you ought to know that no public place these days is without video surveillance. I’ve seen the replays. I know how long you spent walking in circles around that button. Glancing at it. Then away. Hands in your pockets. Trying to look cool. Trying to look… disinterested. You know what that tells me? It tells me you *knew* you weren’t supposed to press that damned button. You *knew*. But you just couldn’t resist, could you?

And who could blame you? Big old red button sitting in the middle of a flat lifeless grey nothing. No other distinguishing features. No label. No signage. Pressing the button was probably a no-no, but when it came right down to it, you didn’t actually see a sign expressly forbidding you to press it. Right? And if you had, would that have made a difference? I bet it wouldn’t. 'Cause you’re a rebel, aren’t you? If you’d seen a sign absolutely banning button pressing, the one thing on your mind would have been seeing how fast you could press that button, right?

So after a time, you gave in to the urge and you pressed it. There was a soft *whumph* noise from somewhere behind you. Muffled, like it was inside a building or underground or something. But the terrifying, earth quivering roar that followed a moment later was anything but muffled. And you certainly couldn’t deny the shivering of the empty grey sidewalk beneath your feet. 

Except, it wasn’t empty any more. Was it? No. Now you found yourself — quite unexpectedly — on a perfectly normal downtown street. The asphalt of the street was now plainly distinguished from the concrete sidewalks. Streetlights sprouted like mushrooms, and you had to jump quite suddenly to avoid a fire hydrant as it leapt out of the ground where you had been standing a moment before. While you were preoccupied with all of that, bustling midday traffic somehow phased into existence. From *where* you knew not, since you weren’t looking in that direction when it appeared. 

Dodging hastily around the many pedestrians who glared at you as they passed, you made your way back to the Madison building, now too rattled to care anymore how early you were. But there was a problem, wasn’t there? 

Oh yes. Because that roar and rattling you heard and felt earlier? That *was* the Madison building, apparently. Somehow, the red button had set off charges in the basement that instigated the most professionally perfect building implosion anyone had seen in quite some time. Even the dust clouds were circling close about the former building site and most pedestrians were avoiding them by the simple expedient of crossing the street.

So what now? You had an interview in a few minutes at the Madison building, but as you can see: there is no longer a Madison building. No one can prove it’s your fault. Hell, you aren’t even sure yourself if the button was really the cause of the implosion. But I suppose it’s just as well your interview is cancelled. Do you really imagine you’ve made a good impression today?

So just go home now, and think about what you did.

[WP] Write something in the 2nd Person POV,history_is_awesome,"“Again.”

The training sword is a heavy iron bar, chipped and scratched from years of abuse, far too heavy for a child of ten to wield.

It doesn’t matter. You strike, ignoring your muscles’ cries for rest. Master Isidore has not given you permission to stop, so you do not. He has not given you permission to waver, so you do not. He has not given you permission to doubt, so you do not.

*You are inadequate,* he told you on the day the two of you met. *Soft iron, riddled with weakness. But I will temper you. I will break you down and put you back together, and I will forge you into steel.*

You remember wondering, then, how someone with such kind eyes could have said such cruel words. You were seven years old – he was a hundred and six.
Now you understand.
“Again,” Master Isidore says, and you obey.

~~

“Again.”

Ten feet off the ground, you flow from one foot to the other. Your balance shifts along the wooden beam with agonizing slowness as you maneuver into position.

The beam shudders as you leap into the air, world spinning around you as you flip and land–

But your foot makes contact with the wood a fraction of an inch too far to the right, and there’s a moment of animal panic as you try in vain to correct your balance–

A sickening moment of realization as you fall, fingers scraping against the beam as you grab for it a moment too late–

Master Isidore turns away a moment before you hit the ground. The sharp pain of breaking bone is nothing in comparison to his disappointment – a cold knife to your heart, a roiling burning in the pit of your stomach…

A medic hurries over and patches you up, knitting flesh and bone together in an instant. She pretends not to notice the tears of frustration welling up in your eyes, and reaches out to ruffle your hair–

His hand closes around her wrist. “No,” he says.

She bows and scurries away, and he turns his inscrutable gaze back on you.
“Again,” Master Isidore says, and you obey.	

~~

“Again.”

You strike and parry and step, each movement blending into a continuous dance. Master Isidore’s blade slams against your guard again and again, each blow just a little too strong or fast for you to comfortably turn aside.

“Your footwork is sloppy, child,” he says. “I expect better.”

You grit your teeth. Sweat streams from your brow, threatening to drip into your eyes, and your body is screaming in protest. It has been an hour since you started, and you are at your limit…

Your master flicks his wrist, wrenching your practice sword from your hands. It hits the floor with a *clang*, and he makes a disgusted noise.

“Rest. We will continue soon.”

You stagger to a nearby bench and collapse onto the wood, head lowered in apology.

You have never said anything to him besides “Yes, Master”. But now, for the first time in six years, you speak out of turn. “Master, I… I apologize.”

He frowns at you, as if deciding on a punishment for your breach of protocol. “For what?” he asks eventually.

“For my weakness,” you whisper.

A moment of silence passes. Then Master Isidore sighs, and sits down next to you.

“All men have weakness, child. But weakness is a tool, not a flaw – a compass on the path toward perfection. You will be tested and tried again and again, and it will be the most difficult thing you have ever done…”

He looks you in the eye. “But I will be with you, every step of the way. Are you ready to continue?”

You nod, determination welling up within your chest.

“Good.”

~~

In the training halls, you learn to fight. Master Isidore hammers the basics of swordplay into you day after day after day, ingraining the lessons of reach and leverage and positioning into your very being. 

In the forests around the Golden Tower’s base, you learn the ways of herb and root. You stalk and kill deer with your bare hands, make fire from twigs and leaves, and navigate night-darkened woods by starsign.

He teaches you to read and write in the lamplit Archives, to isolate meaning from texts of philosophy and science and governance and make it your own. You write endless stacks of essays and treatises and journals, devouring knowledge of the wider world as fast as you can read.

Then one day, you wake up and report for training, and your world changes forever.

~~

“Master,” you ask. “Who is this?”

Master Isidore turns away from the unkempt, bloody figure shackled to the floor.
“This, my child, is a failure.” Your master nudges the figure with a boot, and it groans in pain. As its face turns toward you, horrified comprehension dawns on you as you recognize one of your seniors.

Neophytes are bound to their masters and forbidden from acknowledging any other, but you remember an evening in the mess hall…

*Limping in from combat training, bruised and bloody…*

*He smiles at you and makes an encouraging gesture, ceding his spot in the dinner line…*

“Failure is not tolerated, child.” Master Isidore says. “And the price of failure is death. This one here… has failed his master, and is no longer of any use to the Order. This is your final test – kill him.”

“N-no,” you mutter. “Master Isidore, please–”

“*Silence.* You have no right to speak my name. Kill him,” Isidore says, drawing his blade slowly. “Or I will kill you.”

“Do as he says,” the trainee groans. “Better… one of us than both...” 

“No,” you say, a little louder. Something ugly rears its head within you, anger warring with obedience. “I’m not doing this.”

There’s a blur of motion followed by a bloom of pain on your cheek, and the next thing you know you’re lying on the cold stone at his feet. There’s no mercy in Isidore’s eyes as he rests the point of his sword against your throat.

Rage wins out, and you spit on his boot. “NEVER,” you scream. “Kill me if you must! I’m done being your puppet. I’ve done everything you asked, but I *WILL NOT DO THIS.*”

“So be it,” Isidore says, and you hear only death in his voice.

You try to give him a defiant stare, but fear wins out and you close your eyes in anticipation of the end. But the end does not come; no steel spills your blood or pierces your flesh.

You open your eyes after a time, and see Isidore reaching out to you.

“Congratulations,” he murmurs, and you see something like pride in his eyes as you take his hand. “Your real training begins now.”

You drift across the floor, almost floating, and raise yourself to a sitting position on the counter across from the door.  These pants were a little tight, but your butt looks cute in them.  

""It took you a while today."" The clock above the door read 3 o'clock. He circles his arms around your waist, not quite an embrace, but to feel the smoothness of your warm skin. His calloused hands are rough and arousing, your heart rate goes up.

""Yes.  Needy patients.  Plus I had to turn in some homework on my way here.""

""You are a receptionst and you're going to school? What are you to school for?""

He doesn't care about your answer, but you decide to toy with him.  A smirk spreads across your face, ""hm. So one day I can grow up to be a big, bad mail boy. Ha!"" A giggle escapes your lips that are relaxed in a stupid grin and you motion around you, taking in the mailing equipment.  

""Well, I won't be for much longer."" Your interest is piqued and you plant your feet on the ground.

""Oh? Do you have something brewing?"" His hands are by his sides now but the distance is still close.  Not quite close enough to feel his breath, but enough to warrant strange looks if someone were to open the door now. You don't look him in the eyes, as is your usual custom.

He shrugs, ""I may have a few things in the works.""  It is clear by his tone that he is not saying anymore and it's not your place to be asking questions.  Anyway, you both know what you are here for.

He tilts his head and searches for your gaze while his hand pulls your waist in close to him.  You throw your head back and revel his warm breath that is moving seductively across your neck.  He takes a step forward, pinning you, tightly, between him and the counter- the familiar explosion of sensuality sending a quiet moan from your lips to his ear that is now at your mouth, you give it a slight tug.

""No, what is it?""

""It's like a murder mystery! By real life, but the guy is in jail and he's trying to get out via this journalist""

Inhabitants is a more polite way of saying ""earthlings"" besides that's so cliche anyway.

""There's still live radio, right""

I bit my lip. Podcasts had left traditional radio in the dust. The old stations were hubs for new podcasts to create and innovate. Niches and sub genres sprung up everywhere.

Why this is difficult to admit is that Gulchak's job is to monitor live radio traffic from Earth and if there's a dip, it could be a sign we can attack. However I don't want to lose my beloved Serial to those heathens at Omicron Persei 8. My job is to monitor trends on earth, so our undercover operatives can fit in. It's a sweet gig.

Around him, impossibly bright white stone pillars encircled a round duelling platform of pure obsidian. Beneath his feet, a network of complex runes had been carved into the black stone. 

As his words rang out, gouts of pure flame erupted into being from thin air, crashing against stone and sky, but never reaching beyond the pillared boundary. His visage, a tapestry of elated concentration, betrayed the absolute focus needed for this prodigy of magick to maintain control of his summoned inferno.

It was a fantastic sight to be sure, and the ability to tailor incantations while weaving complex magicks, while not rare in and of itself, had not been mastered to the level which Morsden displayed in many millenia. His position as the imperial caster had been well earned, and scant few dared to challenge him in direct combat, be it mortal or for simple sport.

It was for these reasons that the Emperor always tasked him with overseeing the annual wizard duelling tournament at his son’s birthday celebration. For twelve years he had protected the Crown prince from any wayward magicks, and dealt with any overzealous or maniacal combatants. It was also generally understood that he would sweep the competition otherwise, and so he had never entered.

It might have been a surprise, then, to see him enter the arena. 

It might have been shocking to witness his magick being stretched to its limits in preparation for combat. 

It might have been…

If not for the unassuming man standing at the edge of the flames, coolly observing the arcane demonstration taking place at its center. He was slight, which wasn’t uncommon for known casters, but his thin frame was laden with wiry muscle, not unlike that of a dancer or fencer. His plain fabric pants were loose, and lay low on his hips. He wore no robe or armor to cover his chest, and so the numerous fantastic markings covering his torso, arms, and neck were laid bare for all to see. Beasts of all kinds ran among complex symbols, picturesque scenery and dead languages to create an intricate and mesmerizing mural upon his body.

His face was unshorn though his pate was bare, and his stoic face betrayed not a single emotion save indifference as his opponent, a revered magic caster, made his awesome powers known.

The man spoke not a word. That is, until a single tongue of flame reached out to singe the very end of his prodigious beard. At this, his black eyes narrowed, and he began to walk forward, directly into the flames until his entire body was engulfed and hidden from sight. An already gawking crowd fell into an even more stunned silence at this apparent suicide. Moments passed during which even the most incredulous had written the young man off as dead, until... 

*Gods damn, you’re a fool, that much is plain to me,  
Not half of the mage that you claim to be,  
Got flames, that’s fine, I got rain, you see,  
‘Cause you may be with the crown, but I reign you see?*

At this, a number of events occurred simultaneously, leaving most bewildered, and a few shocked into speechlessness. 

An immediate, if short-lived deluge of rain burst forth from the sky to quench the seemingly unstoppable hellfire. As the last flame sputtered into nothingness, and the subsequent cloud of steam dissipated, the strange tattoo’d man stood, unburnt and unmoving, surrounded by a nimbus of golden light, an image extremely reminiscent of the ascendent man emblazoned upon the Imperial Crest. Before his opponent had a chance to recover, the stranger continued.

*Now ya got a problem, brought beasts here to play witcha’  
Gettin in ya head, feelin’ dead, Reaper stay witcha.  
Sinkin in the muck and the mire, stuck in quicksand.  
Try to answer back, but my chants are too quick, man.*

The crowd continued to gawk as waves of living magick rolled through the arena, borne upon the words of the increasingly awe inspiring young man who was clearly the dominant magic user in the arena. He had continued his forward motion, and, with each movement, another of the inky mythical beasts on his body sprang to life and began to stalk the bewildered imperial wizard. Said wizard seemed to be cowering in fear of some unknown assailant, even as the stone around him swiftly transformed itself into viscous black mud into which the frightened man began to sink.

*When I was a lad, lost my dad, he was a rad bard.  
Tried to kill a hag, hit a snag, and pulled a bad card.  
You were my test, try the best, and get mad scars,  
But this is just sad, yo my bad, I thought you had bars.*

*I’m out.*

Each word to pass the stranger’s lips fell with massive force upon the already defeated Morsden, and the utter finality of the incantation brought with it a boom of thunder so earth shattering, that even the protective magicks contained within the outer pillars failed to fully contain it. Audience members shielded their eyes from the outpouring of wild magick as each in turn crumbled and released its stored energy. 

A tense silence overtook those gathered as they waited for the dust to settle, and a mighty clamor arose when the air finally cleared to reveal a battered and broken Morsden, body splayed on the very runes he had himself carved. No sign of the tatoo’d man remained save for a single remaining inky beast. One small birdlike creature was perched on Morsden’s robed chest, observing the crowd with a familiar cool indifference.

Once the crowd had settled. It turned to face the royal box before opening its beak.

*Make sure you check out my record crystal, available at all black market dealers by harvest season. I want to thank the gods for giving me this gift, and my mom for believing in me through the struggle. Peace.*

*And Morsden! You just got neutered, son! When you find your balls, come find me!* ",Nigel06

Every single eye was fixed on the young man walking into the dueling arena.  His bare feet kicking up small puffs of fine sand.

""Now entering the Arena, Derrick the Untitled!""  The announcer bellowed.

""An untitled? In the Arena? How?""  Whispers repeated throughout the crowd.

""His opponent!  Sir Karasan of the House Terrace, Prince of Words.""  

The crowd erupted in cheers and whistles.  Men and women jumped to their feet to applaud their Prince.  Eight years of dueling and their Prince had never been defeated.

""Contestants to the center!""

The young Derrick strode forward cautiously.  His clothes barely more than rags.

""I'm not sure how you have come this far peasant but this is where it ends for you.""  The Prince spat.

Derrick nodded slowly and extended his hand.  The Prince looked at the hand with dirt underneath it's fingernails and spun away in disgust.

They stood twenty paces apart.  The Prince stared at Derrick with hate filled eyes.

""Prepare your spells.""  The Announcer waited for dramatic effect.  ""SPEAK!""

The Prince was quick with his words, his syllables sharp and clear.

""The poor should stay where the poor belong, you being here is completely wrong, if you're hungry have a taste, as I speed up with magic HASTE!""

The spell washed over the Prince in a brilliant flash of light.  He moved so quickly Derrick could barely see him.  The Prince was a blur as he shot toward Derrick.

""The cruelty suffered beneath your reign, I wish upon you an unbreakable chain.""  He whispered.

Suddenly the Prince froze, inches away from Derrick.  A massive iron chain spun from the ground wrapping itself around the Prince in a tight coil.  It worked its way up from his ankles snaking higher and higher.

""As strong as my father's fort, thirty feet I teleport!""  The Prince shouted.

In a flash the chains dropped the sand covered floor and the Prince stood thirty feet away grinning.

""All the suffering your family makes,  feel the pain of a thousand snakes.""  Derrick whispered once more.

Snakes began burrowing out of the sand at the Prince's feet.  They poured in from the sides of the Arena.  Women screamed as snakes slithered past them.  The Prince began to scream as fangs sunk into his flesh.

""Your corpse will burn upon a pyre, I shall cleanse everything with FIRE!""  

Flames rolled down the Prince's body burning snakes to ash.  He legs were swollen from the bites he took.  The skin turning purple and black.

""You are dead and you don't even know, you have already taken your last breath.  Now feel the cold embrace of DEATH!""  Derrick threw his hands in the air and shouted the final command.

""How can someone like you control death magic?""  The Prince wailed.

""It's too late.""  Derrick whispered.

A cold wind swept through the Arena.  

""No! No!""  The Prince tried to run.

A dark shadow materialized in front of the Prince.  A black skeletal hand reached out and grabbed him by the neck.  Its face hidden in shadow leaned in.  

With a gasp a pale mist began to drift out of the Prince's mouth.  Like tendrils of smoke in a dying fire.  Everyone watched as his body paled and collapsed to the sand.

""The debt is paid.""  The shadow said and vanished.

[WP] Make a country and write a history for it while not conflicting with other responses.,TottalyNotARickRoll,"The United Federation - 

The Old World progressed normally until Columbus sailed into the Americas and found the native population there, which consisted of human Indians, and anthropomorphic animals, some of which possessed powers of speed and flight thanks to the power of Chaos, throughout the whole of the Americas. After many years of panic on both sides, Europe and the rest of the Old World was shocked to see that the New World was united between both a technologically advanced (By 1500s standards) Native American human population and anthropomorphic animals. This land was named by the Natives, to be Mobius.

Colonization of the New World in South America by the Spanish and Portuguese failed, but British colonization of North America was successful after a land deal in the East Coast, with Great Britain giving free usage of British Libraries and universities to the Mobians for land, and the British 13 Colonies were born. This is the furthest west that the Old World had gotten. The 13 Colonies made revolution in the late 1700s, with the justification of “No Taxation without Representation”, and was opposed by the Mobians because of their seemingly short reasoning and their heavy dependence on slavery. 

The war that followed would end in Mobius winning by freeing much of the slave population and blockading slave ships with the help of the Royal Navy, the United States winning by becoming independent, and Great Britain losing its colonies in the Americas. However, soon after, the United States declared war on Great Britain and Mobius once again, and a short conflict followed, known as the War of 1812. The attack would be a crushing defeat for the United States, however, it brought in the mindset of the American government and people “taking the land they deserve” and started to work towards western movement. This period resulted in the taking of land for two more states, and were known as the Mobian-American Wars of Manifest Destiny.

Meanwhile, Europe had become more worried about the state that had now politically named itself Unified Mobius, and in between the frequent waring between each other, the United Kingdom, France, Prussia, and Russia formulated a plan to combat the unified American continents, known as the Unification Plan. The plan contained military action to unify the continent of Europe to compete with the Native continent, and when information was leaked to the United States, they were in on the idea, and agreed to provide all the natural resources that they could to the Plan Makers. 

After the wars in America, the human ‘redskin’ population started to meltdown. Smallpox and other Old World plagues were destroying the Mobian human population, and soon, it is only the anthros that are left, both blessed and cursed by their drastically different anatomy. Currently there is a small minority of Native Mobian Humans, and they mostly are found in the military, where Mobian Special Forces use the human’s heavier body for heavier, higher power weapons within their Special Forces teams. 
The Plan Makers took the plague as their chance to aggress against their weakened rival continent, and the Unification Wars began. The Plan Makers, as they were now called, consisted of the United Kingdom, France, Prussia, Russia, the United States, and the Papal States, who thought that a unified Europe would bring the chance for wide-spread catholicism, which would take back much of the religious ground lost in the Reformation. Fighting spread throughout Europe and Southeast Asian colonies as navys and armies became locked in furious fighting. The war would last from 1842 all the way into 1894, becoming the longest, largest, and bloodiest war in European history. The campaign in mainland Europe became a fast moving, and fast receding conflict, with the main separatist forces divided between the Netherlands, Poland-Lithuania, and Austria, who united with Hungary for a short period before the capture of Vienna. 

Up north however, was something different. The Kingdom of Denmark-Norway was offered the chance to invade Sweden by the Plan Makers, however, it refused, on grounds that the Papal States was behind the plan to re-spread catholicism. Yet again, Scandinavia united under the Kalmar Union, this time with Sweden as the military leader. Denmark and her gunboats managed to hold off the British Royal Navy at the Battle of Copenhagen Strait, as well as her army blocking off Prussian advance, and Sweden and her knowledge of the Finnish terrain managed to grind the Russians down into a stalemate in the freezing temperatures of Northern Finland. 

However, eventually all of Europe, including the North, was annexed into the United Federation, who, with control of all of the Southeast Asian trade routes and resources, was uncountably rich. With these funds, reparations of the Unification Wars were easily paid for, and a united military was formed: The Guardian Units of Nations, or GUN. Because of the immense military might and economic control, the Qing Dynasty made the decision to allow itself to be absorbed into the Federation, even going as far as to invade Mongolia along with Siberian GUN forces.

The United Federation now spans all of Eurasia, along with Japan and most of Oceania. Currently, the superpower has been pulled into an insurgency on the Arabian peninsula, in South Africa, and Madagascar, and are preparing for an invasion of the island.

[WP] Make a country and write a history for it while not conflicting with other responses.,TottalyNotARickRoll,"A nation of single man, yet made up of a few

Who seldom spoke and made their homes in trees of Yew.

For years on end they sat, stroking their grey beards

And wallowed in the loneliness that they so revered.


Reclining on thrones of mouldy leaves

In their solemn eaves

They sit.


Their greatest treasure books and solitude,

Yet not knowing the meaning of the word feud.

While eons passed in the mists of time,

They did all but commit a crime.


Yet, despite the Hermit's creed,

Another nation committed a dreadful deed.

From the shadows they suddenly rose

And, brandishing their twisted bows,

They rode beneath the leafy canopy of forests large and small


They, they who stood so tall

Stooped low,

Dealt a deadly blow

That left millions dead

And stained the roots of Yew with coppery blood.


Now the forests stand in twisted mirth,

For those that ride beneath their boughs,

Suddenly see the bloody turf;

The Hermits breaking their vows.

And bathing in pools of blood, they forever watch.

It was a special wood, very hard, very beautiful, I think it was some kind of oak.  Why they called it 'Falerna,' I have no idea.""  The old man's blue eyes seemed to focus on something in the distance and then crystallize, turning from cool blue pools into sapphires, with each facet, each inclusion marking some moment in history, telling a story almost, but not quite forgotten.

I had asked him to tell me about his childhood in ""the Old Country.""  Well, ""country"" was being generous.  San Ingenio was more of a mountain at the foot of the Alps, conveniently (or inconveniently depending upon the year) nestled between what is now Italy and France.  Now, granted, it was a large mountain, a large mountain with a small town nestled on its western ridge and an even smaller town nestled on its eastern slope.  And technically, at least according to the citizens of San Ingenio, as well as a few others who paid attention to such things, it was its own country.  

A tiny republic at the top of a peninsula that was shaped throughout history by tiny republics.  Of course there was Rome, and who could forget La Serenissima, Venice?  And of course, modern day San Marino, another mountain top Republic that should not exist but does.  Those fools in San Marino also referred to themselves as La Serenissima, but the proud citizens of San Igenio knew that it alone deserved to be La Serenissima and--besides--polite company in S. Ingenio never mentioned those S. Marino thugs in public anyway, so it didn't matter.

San Ingenio had started life as a cave around the year 500.  San Igenio himself, a  Roman of some distinction before converting to Christianity, had traveled to the Alps with a companion, Mauritius, to spread the Good News to the Alpine people.  After seeing the reception Mauritius received when entering a town (he soon become the martyr Mauritius), San Ingenio quickly decided that the hermit life was perhaps more his speed.  Soon a small community had grown up around that cave.  The early goings were not easy for the settlers: the town was nominally separate from the Roman Empire (a band of Cimbri soldiers had supposedly holed up on the mountain [perhaps the very cave in with San Ingenio slept!] during the Cimbrian War, the Roman legions either too tired or too scared to retake the mountain).  But it survived intact and untouched, mostly through a combination of a lack of natural resources, poor location, and even worse weather.

In medieval times it became a duchy, though several historians, none of them good, honest citizens of San Ingenio, have attributed that as much to a administrative error at the Vatican as anything else.  With a Duke overseeing the territory, San Ingenio was soon prospering.  Through a series of cartographic errors, San Ingenio eventually made its way into the Lombard Kingdom, when it was briefly ruled by Autari the Gastaldate, who only weeks before had been a Duke, but quickly styled himself a Lombard when discovering the errors, even if it was a bit of a demotion.  But Ingenio XVII soon expelled Autari and declared San Ingenio an exarchate.  Eventually though Ingenio XXIII was able to rally support for the Republican cause and by 800 A.D. the Most Serene Republic of San Ingenio was declared.  

It would stay a republican for more than a thousand years, escaping most attempts at conquest through obfuscation, remoteness, valuelessness, and indifference.  Of course its independence was threatened more than once, such as when, in 1792, Girondins in Paris had threatened to wipe San Ingenio off the map for allowing Charles X of France to rest his horses at the base of the mountain.  Later--

""He was quite the craftsman, my Father.  An artisan back when that meant something.  He build cabinetry.  I don't know what we wanted the Falerna wood for, I think, perhaps, something for my mother, a jewelry box?  No, probably not.  I don't know.""  He was was jumping around, all over the place.

Sleek feathers plunging through the laughing wind, swaying with the drumbeat of my heart, muscles creaking softly to the beating. A kaleidoscope of forest tones, the drone of melody in the whispering trees, a tuft of movement blooming like spring flowers. The hunter’s domain.

A fire races in the bones, the settled hunger do thoughts consume, and thus make merry through the move, a constant companion. Talons crisping the air, drawn and ready below the groomed velvet, a phantom feeling of prey grasped, squirming. A long, famished morning.

There! At the very edge, a hair of movement, between the river’s stones. Drawing my cloak of feathers close, I plummet, a bolt of brown to the ground below. The cascade thunders near, but ignoring the fear, I seize before it flees, claws snapping, clacking through the soft fur. It cries as all the doomed do, choking through the bloody glue as I hoist it aloft, and it gazes from my domain, the lofty heights a view anew. The last this mouse will ever peruse. Together we dance through the sigh of twilight homeward, to the end of our travels.

Hunger bites hard, and I bite harder down upon this morsel, warm in my gizzard.

Earth was labeled as a harvesting planet. 65 million years ago a superior species sent the seed of their favorite food hurtling towards earth on an asteroid. Now its 2016 and they have become intolerably hungry and impatient. [WP],scared_of_Low_stuff,"When they first came, it wasn't their massive ships or their greatly superior technology that scared us; nor was it that we finally had an answer to whether or not we were alone in the universe. No, the real thing that led to humanity shitting its collective pants was the suddenness of it all.


One second, we were all going about our lives; working, playing, or the in-betweens, and then, out of the blue, BAM! Crazy-ass UFOs piloted by crazy-ass aliens almost blotted out the sky. Nobody was prepared for it; the world's governments had nothing that could match the giant death-ray-esque things that jutted out of their ships; the opulent, electronic spires were basically signs, saying: ""You won't develop the technology to destroy these for centuries, even if you had centuries to develop, which you don't."" In response, the humming, transparent orb that encircled each and every craft seemed to say: ""Even if you did, you'd need another few centuries to surpass *these*, which we can wholeheartedly *guarantee* you won't have.""


Of course, that was what, in time, was terrifying. However, the thing that *really* had humanity shaking in its collective boots, which now were somewhat ruined by the drippings from its collective pants, was the invaders' intentions. When they first came, we were rightly scared about becoming slaves to a foreign race which dominated our planet and species. 


It somehow became worse when they stated that they wanted to eat us. Now, in this sense, 'stated' doesn't really capture the full extent of the aliens' communication. Instead of beaming messages down into our electronics or saying the same message in hundreds of different languages, Earth's largely unwelcome guests sort of thought for us. Now, when I say *that*, it doesn't really cut it:  The ships broadcasted a message, yes, but it was an overwhelming sensation. Suddenly, Earth, and all of its inhabitants -and 'all of' means 'all of'; there were several concerned looking animals looking at each other- thought, not heard, a booming voice that said: 


""Your 'EARTH' has been a labeled a harvesting planet for our GREAT civilization since some 65 million of your Earth-years ago! We are the Qwarnons, a FAR superior species who sent an asteroid at your planet all that time ago! Just as suspected and calculated by our BRILLIANT leaders, our most dearest food-species has taken root and thrived! And guess what, Earth? We're AWFULLY HUNGRY!"" 


As many of our world leaders pissed themselves, an electronic chorus of laughter- No, this was no chorus. More of a symphony of computer-synthesized nails-on-chalkboard, a cackle erupted from each and every ship. Somehow, our top scientists had determined a way to communicate back to the Qwarnon leaders. Next, our top engineers had built such a device in record time! Finally, doing their part to help preserve humanity's existence, a crack team of our top linguists and writers drafted the perfect message to convince our hungry guests to leave us alone. Our response read: 


""Esteemed Qwarnon guests of the planet Earth: We, humanity, as the dominant species of this planet, have assumed you are referring to us with your message, as we are the only known inhabitants of this world who have developed language. If our guess is true, then we plead you to let us continue to survive. Now, as an intelligent and respectable species, we implore you to look out our accomplishments and reconsider your menu.


""Humanity has produced countless wonders, great works of literature, and beautiful works of art. If there are no humans left to appreciate these, then much of our rich culture will be wasted, doomed to sit in the dark for eternity. We have a deep and complex history, with  brutal wars, yes, but also golden ages and glorious times of peace. It would be a shame, a waste if the great rises and falls of civilizations and all of human history were just... snuffed out.""


""If the social aspects of our species will not persuade you to change your entrée, humanity has made numerous technological advances; developed and invented multitudes of miraculous machines... We suspect that in the next century, if you generously give us the time, you could visit nuclear fusion-powered cities and have front-row seats to humanity's spread amongst the stars!""


""Please, great and powerful Qwarnons, we could tell you so much more if we had the time! So many more reasons, so many more accomplishments, so much more *life* we could live, if we were just given the time... And it is time we ask you for, dear Qwarnons. All we ask for is our continued existence. Moreover, we should be able to give you enough food to sate you, if you just decide to remove 'human' from your menu."" 


The moment after our transmission was sent, after humanity's final plea went up to the ship-pocked heavens, the Earth was silent. For just one moment after what was quite possibly humanity's last shout into the void, every one of the Qwarnons above and the humans below just waited in silent anticipation. 


After what seemed like an eternity, the Qwarnon leader spoke alone, in a less-booming, dominating manner:


""I mean... Woah. This is, like, really good.""


In that moment where humanity's hearts all beat as one, they all skipped a beat.


""But... Uh... I hate to tell you this...""


The Earth's orbit was temporarily altered by billions of hearts falling.


""We're just here to take your mosquitoes...""",Pieguy85

"[WP] Nobody has died in at least 12 hours. There have been situations where people should have, of course, with accidents, really awkward assassination attempts, and confused murders. You are a paramedic on duty when everything started to happen ..",thisismycuntaccount,"This is my first prompt so go easy on me... :)

People have always said death is absolute.  You’d think for a normal person, it would be easy to tell between someone who’s living and someone who’s dead.  We see movies, we know how this stuff works.  Black and white.  Cut and dry.  Almost, like a light switch where someone flips it to “off” and that’s it.  Done and done.
As a paramedic, you get the luxury to see that there is no black and white.  There’s only gray, and in varying degrees.  When you arrive on scene, you just know someone isn’t going to make it.  The mother of three t-boned in a busy intersection during rush hour traffic.  The high school quarterback with the cannon for an arm, thrown from the driver’s seat of his pickup truck driving home from a late night party.  
&amp;nbsp;
The toddler running across the street after their ball.    
&amp;nbsp;
You can’t unsee these things.  When you train to be a paramedic, your idea of the job is pretty simple – keep your patients alive until you can get them to the hospital.  What they don’t tell you, what you don’t learn until you see it, is that people can be dead while talking to you.  They can be dead while pleading with you.  It’s never black and white.  It’s always gray.   
It’s been 12 years doing this job and I can’t remember the last time I smiled.  For a paramedic, none of your patients truly ever die.  They haunt you.  You can’t escape them.  The hot sweet smell of blood and the acrid smell of burnt rubber hang in the cold November air as you feverishly work to stop the bleeding coming from the thigh of a cyclist, as the driver who hits them looks on sobbing.  You know it’s pointless, there’s no way this man is going to make it.  There’s a gash going through his femoral artery, and it’s only a matter of minutes until he bleeds out and you’re 20 minutes away from the nearest trauma center.  In this moment, right now, he is Schrödinger’s patient – both alive and dead.  Gray, just like the color of his skin as his pulse slows.  The only solace you can take is knowing that eventually, all suffering ends.  We all fade to black.    

I’m done with it.  12 years of seeing this and I just can’t do it; I can’t watch people fade away anymore.  Every single person that passes takes a piece of me with them, and I have nothing left to give.  At least I can control how it ends.  I’ve tasted the metal and oil of this revolver before, too many times.  I couldn’t do it, but I can’t take one more shift.  With this note, it’s as black and white as I can make it.  
I’m sorry I never told you Rachel, I couldn’t let you shoulder that burden too.  
-Nick  
///////  
I found my husband this morning, with his .357 Magnum revolver on the floor.  The doctors tell me he’s still alive, but they don’t know why.  Most of the top of his scalp and brain was destroyed from the gunshot, there’s so little left.  It’s wrapped in a bandage now, but they tell me he won’t make it.  It’s heart wrenching, having to tell them not to put him on life support and wait for him to die naturally.  It’s been 12 hours, and he still hasn’t passed on.  They’re telling me any time now, but I don’t see them often; there were 3 gunshot victims brought in a little while ago that are being treated and I’m told their outlook is grim too, but better than Nick.  Oh God, just let him finally be at peace…

"[WP] Nobody has died in at least 12 hours. There have been situations where people should have, of course, with accidents, really awkward assassination attempts, and confused murders. You are a paramedic on duty when everything started to happen ..",thisismycuntaccount,"I smiled. I didn't mean to. It was meant to be a frown, wasn't it? I wasn't sure to be honest. But reflected in the mirror was a flash of pearly whites. Something was *wrong*. Deeply wrong. The kind of wrong that you just can't shake. When did it all start?

The shadows that keep me up at night. They weren't there. I slept like a baby. So did Marjory. A 6 month old baby slept all the way through the night. And I mean't to frown, but I couldnt.

I clocked in 5 minutes early. Exactly five minutes, I remember. The seconds hand had just locked into place. Neat. Orderly. And since, I've just sat here in the ambulance. Waiting for a call.

But no calls came. My shift was over in 5 minutes. Exactly five minutes, I noticed. The seconds hand just locked into place. Neat. Orderly. And so I guess I'll sit here in the ambulance. But I'm not waiting for a call anymore. There won't be anymore calls, I don't think. 

Why weren't the shadows there last night? Every night since I was a boy-- 5 or maybe 6-- they had been there. They just stood and watched me, swaying back and forth. They never said anything. I guess I wasn't sure they were a 'they' at all. And every night they kept me up. Made me feel like something was missing, or wrong. When I looked at someone and saw dark circles under their eyes, I saw the shadows. Saw their dance. But the dance was gone. 

Nothing was wrong. Everything was okay.

My heart was pounding in my chest. In the mirror I could see a place in my neck throbbing as blood pumped to my brain and body, preparing it for combat or escape. My mouth taste like metal. If I was smiling... why did it taste like metal? 

Nothing was wrong. Everything was okay. 

It was five minutes after my shift now. Five minutes exactly. I saw the seconds hand settle into his armchair comfortably. In his room there were no shadows either. No dancing. The walls were white. The chair was white. I noticed that he had my smile.

I pulled the trigger.

"[WP] Nobody has died in at least 12 hours. There have been situations where people should have, of course, with accidents, really awkward assassination attempts, and confused murders. You are a paramedic on duty when everything started to happen ..",thisismycuntaccount,"Joe, my fellow paramedic, looked at the girl in the stretcher beneath us, and whispered to me “This is absolutely impossible.”

By all rights, this little girl should have died now. She's lost almost all her blood, twice over,. A few minutes ago, her organs were injured in a crash beyond repair.  I did my best, but it became clear that she probably wouldn't survive the ambulance ride. All I could do was try to make her death as painless as possible.

But she's not dead. Her body is still pumpng blood that should have drained out by now, and her crushed lungs are still contracting. In fact, her body is healing right before my eyes. Her skin is knitting itself together, and her bones are reforming. 

Joe shakes his head, and says “We need to stop the car. And report this to somebody. It's...like Wolverine or something.”

I shake my head. “Let's keep her in here. Whatever's going on, she's still our patient.”

Her bones continue to regrow. I can see her slowly stir. She's wincing, and I realize that she must be in pain. Her eyes flutter open, and she nearly jumps up.

“Shh, you're okay,” I say. “You're in an ambulance. The car you were in slammed straight into a truck. We were able to get you out in time.”

She stays silent for some time. Then she says “What happened to my mom? She was driving the car.”

Joe is still staring at her with a shocked expression, but he had the presence of mind to say “I'm sure theyt were fine. What's your name?”

“Amy”, she says. Her right blue looks around the ambulance, then she tries to place her hand to her left eye. I stop her.

“Don't touch your eye,” I say.

“Why?” she says. “It feels funny.”

“It's still healing,” I say. Indeed, I can see her eyeball reforming in her eyesocket. 

Suddenly, a ringing comes from somewhere. At first, I think it's Joe, having brounght his phone with him. But he shrugs, and I realize that it's coming from Amy's pocket. Joe rifles through Amy's pockets, and takes out a bloody, but miraculously working cellphone. 

“Answer it!” says Amy. “I know that ringtone, it's my mom!” 

I open my mouth, but Joe shushes me. “Okay, kid.” He puts his ear to the phone and says “Who is this?” 

After some chatter on the other line, his eyes widen. “No, no, Amy's fine. I mean, she's in the ambulance, but—no, no, she's stable. Your daughter's going to be fine.”

“Mom! She's okay!” says Amy, reaching for the phone with her hand that's still growing back a finger. 

I snatch the phone out of Joe's hand. “Who is this?”

“I'm Amy's mom! I just crawled out of a wrecked car...is Amy okay?” says a stressed woman on the phone. 

I'm speechless for several seconds. She's still talking to me, but I'm too busy trying to put together what happened.

It's not that I'm not happy that Amy's mother survived the crash. But, I'm trying to figure out how did a woman, who I just saw wrapped around a wrecked car and with a broken neck, suddenly come back to life and pick up a phone? ",Scott_Pilgrim_Fan

We first got a call of a nervous neighbor that heard shots from the apartment across from her. We get there and see a twenty-something-year-old sobbing in the corner. He tried to shoot himself two times until he realized what was going on. 

A few minutes later it was on the global news. People all over the world tried jumping off roofs, cutting themselfs, and nothing happened. No pain, no injuries, I tried it myself, drilling straight into my hand, I felt nothing. Adrenaline junkies rushed to the grand canyon, the top of the Burj Khalifa and even walked underwater to the bottom of the ocean. 

After the UN gathered and tried to decide on a course of action, but no one was really worried, until all the news channels displayed four words. 

-Prepare for six o'clock-

No one knows what happened, but people started to panic. Three hours until what, until this invincibility is gone, or until we die. I called my family, I had no idea what was to become of me, it was the only thing I could do. Thirty minutes until six I locked myself in my house, hoping that the anarchy of invincible, panicked humans in the streets would not get me. I watched the time, and as six o'clock rolled around I felt it.

My muscles ached, my bones felt like constant pressure was exerted on them. Any light I saw burned my eyes and I quickly shut off any lights I have and sat in the darkness. I sat on the floor and my intestines compressed within my own body. I felt as if I was ten times weaker than I had ever been. That's when I got the first call. I looked at the clock on my phone and it said 8 o'clock. I put the phone on the lowest brightness and see who called me. It was work. I was supposed to help everyone else in my town who I assume is suffering from the same thing as me. I could not come out, it was too painful. I turned off my phone and went to sleep.

When I woke up, I felt as if I had just come out of the worst hangover imaginable. I turn on my phone and look around at the messages I got during the what I assume was a night. Fifteen messages, all from work. I open the blinds in my living room and see the horror outside. Thousands of bones lie on the ground, the skin and muscle burned off. Then the smell hit me, burning skin and hair all meshed into one grueling combination. 

I don't remember the rest, except for the new message on the television.

-It will happen again-

I was one of the few lucky ones to survive the first wave so I have to share my message with the world. Stay indoors, use your invisibility to have fun, but for thirty minutes before 6 stay indoors. I know the internet might not work the best on the account of everyone being dead, but I heed my warning. I tried chopping my hand off today, and I did not work.

"[WP] You catch your train to work like normal, as you get to your seat you have an out of body experience. Reality and logic goes out the window as if someone slipped acid into your morning coffee. What happens?",DangerouslyCheesyGuy,"""Monday. Nothing good ever seems to happen to me on Mondays."" I thought to myself as I sat down on a dirty seat in the back of the 4:30AM D train to Maiden Square. I was squeezed between a Puerto Rican man the width of a Volkswagen Beetle, and a small, balding Asian man who liked to jab me in the ribs whenever I accidentally bumped into him. From the flatness of my right pocket, I could tell I had left my phone at home again, so there would be no candy matching today to excuse the tedium. I sat there, staring across the aisle above my fellow passengers at a colorful advertisement for Nicotine Gum when I first realized something was wrong.

All of a sudden, my face felt wet, and yet, when I pressed my fingers to my cheeks they told me it was dry. I must have sat there for two minutes experimenting with this feeling before I looked down the length of the subway cabin. What had been 10 feet earlier now stretched on and on to infinity, with what looked like thousands of people all sitting there complacently... except when I looked at their faces, I couldn't recognize any features. It's difficult to describe, but it felt like there was some language with their facial features I just couldn't read, as if I was seeing a human face for the first time, and something in my brain couldn't comprehend it. The lights in the car seemed to flicker and I felt a sickness grow in my stomach as I stared down that seemingly endless expanse of train car. I could still feel the subway rock under me a little bit, but as I kept staring, the pattern seemed to change and smooth, as if I was aboard a ship under heavy waves. It rocked me back and forth, but all the other passengers sat there practically motionless, despite the rocking of the car. 

Then the car spun, as if rolling down a hill, sending me face first into the floor and then crashing into the ceiling. My body ached from the blows, but when the train finally calmed down, I looked up to find every one of the passengers upside-down and in their seats. After my head stopped spinning, I realized I was on the ceiling, and they were right where they had been. I crawled along the walls and found my seat, but someone was hunched over there in my spot. ""How rude..."" I thought, and I grabbed them by the shoulders, trying to sit them up straight so I could argue with them. But when I was face to face with him... I realized I knew that face. It was the only one that was clear out of every passenger on the train. It was my face. I was standing in front of my own body, now lying limp in my seat. The shock of this set in and I dropped myself, staggering back. I looked to my body to find it gone. I could feel my arms, my legs, and I could move all of them but it was as if I had become invisible or simply transparent. The significance of this seemed lost on me at the time, but at the very least, in this state, for the first time I understood that something was definitely wrong. 

That was when I hit the brick wall. I'm still not sure how it got there, but I saw it out of the corner of my eye, passing through the train car like a ghost moving at some frightening speed. It collided with my body, and I felt myself pass through the back of the train car and out of the train. I felt my bones crack and bend on impact, but they did not break. I felt my thighs touching the back of my torso, and my feet touch my cheeks like I had been bent in half. But when I felt myself exiting the train, the brick wall stayed there with me in the dark of the subway tunnel as I leaned into it, trying to straighten all of my invisible body parts. It was as if had been on a ghost train that decided to run through the only wall that had physical contact with me. All I remember is at some point I began floating and colors began to blur together. I could see my pain as a color, and experience my anxiety as a smell. I saw myself float through the ground, float through basements and high above the city. I kept drifting until I entered the sun and began to talk to the sun's heat...

Honestly Officers I don't know how you found me there, and I don't know that girl got in that state. If I did it, then I didn't do it consciously. Someone must have slipped something into my cup of joe at Ralph's, I don't know... I must have been framed, okay? You can't lock me up for something I didn't even know I was doing, can you? CAN YOU?

"[EU] Hobbes, the stuffed toy, is possessed by a demon that overtime warms up to Calvin.",SirFluffyTheTerrible,"I used to not like him.  That unkempt blonde hair, his constant yelling, the dull monotony of the human life he was forced to live.

I was sent here as a punishment, you know.  Apparently, I wasn't that good at ""understanding humans"".  My methodology was ""too boldfaced and heavy-handed"".  Whatever.  Some humans respond to that stuff.  The Devil didn't agree, I guess.  I was banned from Hell and trapped in a cheaply made toy; a stuffed tiger.  I could only move and speak under certain circumstances, mostly when I was alone with the kid, Calvin.  Ugh, I could hardly even bring myself to speak his name too long ago.  Anyway, I started living with the boy and prepared myself to face my punishment in order to learn the intricacies of human nature.  Apparently, once he stopped believing I was real, I would be free to return to hell.  So, my mission was to torment him and make him wish I was a simple inanimate object.  I can do that.

I started by literally attacking him.  Every time he came through the door after school, I was there.  I would tackle the little snot right back out the door.  I got a special satisfaction when I managed to smack his shoes off.  He would yell and scream and it would always give me a kind of smug satisfaction.

Next was affecting his sleep.  I would hog the covers, kick him out onto the floor if I could.  When I could roll over for another snooze while he groggily got up for school was exceptionally pleasing.  

Then there was the arguments.  I may not know much about humans and their culture, but I know I knew more than him.  He would go on about how stupid girls were, the injustices of his pre-pubescent life, and how the world had nothing for him.  I would always fire back with how women could please the senses, that only greater injustices were to come, and that the world was indeed a place devoid of future values.  He could not understand some of these things and I resented him for it.

Then... I don't know.  He was a bigger thorn in my side than I thought he would be.  He became attached to me or something.  He would take me along with him everywhere.  I don't know why, but he seemed to enjoy the companionship.  Even as much as we fought and butted heads, he would... care for me.  I found myself craving tuna and the boy would relentlessly ask his parents to buy it for me.  In truth, I thought it would make my breath bad enough to keep him from carrying me everywhere.  Eventually the pleading worked and I had nearly as much tuna as I wanted.  It was better than I expected and my breath didn't deter the boy at all.  

He would help me to look my best.  It may seem petty, but I'm a demon, vanity is kind of a thing for us.  We would bathe together and he would loan me some of his father's cologne.  He would even find a tie for me if were going out for pizza.  He always knew what I liked: triple anchovies.  

I found myself enjoying life among the humans.  Don't get me wrong though, hell is an absolute party for demons.  I missed it daily.  But partaking in the daily life of humans was... enough.   Long naps in the sun appealed to my slothful nature.  I could vent my fits of rage by mauling the boy from time to time.  The kid wasn't smart enough to threaten my pride and he slated my gluttony with fish.  I even went outside of my comfort zone with simple pleasures.  I remember the boy wanted to be an artist so he fitted me with one of his father's shirts to use as a smock.  It turns out, I only enjoyed saying the word ""smock"", which I did repeatedly.  He he, I still enjoy the word.  Smock.  Smock, Smock, SMOCK!  Ha! Like I said, the simple things.

And his imagination!  Oh, he had such an imagination!  I've seen demons working in congress to tempt a saint to sin with less inspiration.  A simple box was his time machine, duplicator, and transmogrifier, and cerebral enhance-o-tron.  Part of being a demon is that you can enter the consciousness and subconsciousness of your victims, so I went along for the rides he took with these adventures.  The things we saw!  Dinosaurs, cloning hijinks of the highest of order, and the transformation of the boy to a tiger.  I never tired of it.  He also imagined a game.  Calvinball.  Pure chaos!  No rules, no winners, no end!  The devil himself couldn't have developed so beautiful a scenario.  If the idea weren't so complex, I would take it for myself and brand it as my own.  I know I'd never be able recount it, however.  

Don't get me started on how he would torture his parents.  Calvin would open windows to let in snow so that he could play with it in his room.  He jumped off the roof using his blanket as a parachute, but only managed to crush his mother's favorite rose bush.  He pounded nails into the coffee table simply for the fun of it.  He attempted to sell their car for pocket change.  And his defiance!  He built snowmen in a line, saluting his father as though he was a dictator.  He would goose-step about the house when he was unhappy with his mother's orders.  I haven't seen anything like it since Lucifer himself sat upon the throne of God! But for all the contempt he held for his parents and the neighborhood girl, he would express genuine friendship for me.

We were on an adventure, once.  We were going to the Yukon to get away from the strictures of society.  We had a fight, as we often do.  And we went our separate ways.  He headed back home and I stayed where I was.  I don't know if it was my punishment or my own stubbornness, but I didn't move from my spot.  Night fell and still I waited.  I'll admit I was lonely.  But then I heard them.  ""Hobbes!  Hobbes!""  Calvin was crying out at the top of his lungs for me and for his parents to follow him.  I knew then that he cared for me.  He had organized a search party to come and find me.  Of course, since his parents were there, I couldn't move on my own.  I couldn't go to him.  And... it hurt.  I wanted to be there for him.  Eventually, he had to go back to bed, and his parents continued the search.  They found me in that cold red wagon and took me home.  They snuck me back into his bed and he snuggled up to me in his sleep.  I felt... warm.  Not in the way a nap in the sun does, though.  I think the humans call it happiness or contentment or something.  Whatever.  I'd never felt anything like it in Hell.  And I'll tell you, I knew right away that I would miss it.  We woke up the next morning and I brushed it off, like I had made it back home on my own and that it was no big deal.

Another time, the house had been robbed.  Poor Calvin thought I had been taken.  He tore the house apart looking for me.  Again, his parents were there and I couldn't move from my spot in the bed under the covers.  I heard him though.  I heard his mom tell him that the robbers only take valuable things.  The next thing I knew, I heard Calvin sit down in the middle of the floor and cry out that he felt I was valuable.  Between our adventure to the Yukon and Calvin's fear of me being taken, I knew I wanted to stay.

Even simple things compelled me to stay.  Our conversations were sometimes philosophical.  We discussed life, death, politics, and morality.  We would play in a tree house and in the snow.  We would nap and play and watch TV.  He ate this absurdly sweet chocolate cereal that I could hardly stand.  It didn't matter.  More tuna for me.  And we would dance!  We copied other peoples moves from time ti time, but my favorite was to make our own.  I would swing him by his arms and we would spin about each other.  Even in the dead of night, we would laugh and dance until the parents came down to scream at us to go back to bed.  I found the lives of humans improved dramatically with proper company.

I don't want to go back.  For once, I feel good.  Maybe the humans are right about moderation.  For my whole life in Hell, I had everything I wanted in excess.  But here with Calvin and his parents, I had enough.  Enough sleep, enough food, enough fun, enough love.  That's what that warmth was.  Calvin called it love.  I've come to like it.  Now, I find my punishment reversed.  If Calvin rejected me and stopped believing that I was a real being, I would return to Hell.  But now, if Calvin stops seeing me as a friend, I will be forced back into Tartarus.  I can't let that happen.  I want to be here with him.  I want to be here with his family.  I want to be here for his future.  I'll do anything to stay.  

I don't know.  I guess the moral of the story is that life among humans isn't bad.  Even when it's bad it can be pretty great compared to other things.  So hang in there, Mr. Bun.  Susie is a good girl and if Calvin can care for me, she'll definetly care for you.  Don't make the mistake I made and torture the poor kid.  Well, it looks like the two immature jerks are almost done snowball fighting.  We'll have to talk again later when Susie and Calvin play together next time.",MeAllByMyself

[WP] Cthulu is the youngest of his siblings. At a family dinner his parents try to motivate him to get his act together and conquer earth already like his siblings have done with their respective planets.,Supremeleaderbestkor,"“I still can’t believe that you got away with that!” Aeoth howled as he landed a hearty pat on Vulcan’s back. “Convincing the Venusians to willingly pump their atmosphere full of CO¬2 is marvelously devious.”

“Hey,” Eve shot back to defend her conquest. “I would have done something more intellectually stimulating with the Martians, but they had the collective intelligence of rocks.”

“I didn’t say that shutting down the magnetosphere wasn’t impressive, Eve,” Aeoth said defensively. “But I still think you could have done something more… I don’t know… spectacular…” The three of them eyed the youngest of their family: Cthulhu.

Cthulhu sank back in his chair as their eyes approached his soul like daggers. He wanted to defend himself, that much was second nature to him, but he also knew that he had fallen behind. With the Human race nearing the ten billion mark, he was about to lose any sense of accomplishment from his father. He had tried numerous times to destroy the earth, but those damned mammals just wouldn’t die. He had redirected massive asteroids that took millennia to chart their courses, he had tried to get them to fight against eachother, but every attempt had failed.

“So tell us, Cthulhu, when are you going to destroy earth?” Eve asked rather pointedly. “You’re close to the ten billion mark.”

“I’m working on it… okay?” he fired back as he sat up in his chair. “The humans are resilient, nothing seems to faze them, but I have an idea.”

“And what might that be?” Eve continued.

Cthulhu casted a quick glance at his father, hoping for some support, but he too was intrigued by his baiting comment. Great job, just don’t say anything next time. “It’s gonna be good, trust me.”

“Oh I have no doubt it will be, considering you’ve had billions of years to work this out,” Vulcan scoffed as he took another bite of his dinner.

“Oh fuck you, Vulcan,” Cthulhu fired toward his brother who only smiled smugly in return.

“What’s the problem? Too stupid to take on a few billion humans by yourself?”

“I’m not going to storm in there flesh and bone, that’s suicide. I’ve got a better plan…”

“Then what is it?”

In that moment, a spark went off in Cthulhu’s mind. He straightened his back once more and returned his sibling’s gaze with his own powerful stare. “I’m going to let them live…”

“Pshh,” his siblings sputtered before erupting in laughter. Cthulhu stood his ground.

“I’ll let them move to Mars, they’re already working on that. Then they’ll take Venus. Within a few millennia your worlds will be alive once more with my own.” As he spoke his words became more powerful. Aeoth, who had sat rather intently on the other side of the table, had a small smile creeping across is typically stolid face. “You’ll see… the humans are smart like the Venusians, strong like the Martians, but they’re so much more than that. I’ve got a plan, but I can’t tell you, because you’ll try to stop it, and take the prize from me.”

[WP] Don't worry. It's just a spot.,theCONSERVATIVEdream,"When he saw her hands, bare, the thin leather gloves tossed aside, his expression softened and changed. He recognized her; he knew it was her. She really was alive and here with him, after all this time. No one else would have those scars, or would know to mimic them. 

He took her hands in his own, reverently, feeling the rough pattern over otherwise smooth skin. Her hands were cold. The scars stretched from her finger tips to nearly the whole length of her forearms, irregular striations. It reminded him of drippings from a tall, thin candle, thicker over her knuckles and fading further away until even the red cast vanished from her pale skin. 

""Don't worry. It's just a spot,"" she said. The delivery was flat due to her hoarse throat, but she meant only to tease. They both knew the origin of the scars. He bore similar ones over his body. 

He bent to kiss the back of her hand in a gentlemanly fashion before letting go. His eyes met hers again. They were silent for a moment more, eyes exploring faces like strangers in a first meeting. Her eyes were dark and reminded him of the places they had been. She smiled slightly, a strained expression. He bit his lip, a bad habit that did nothing to help his ugly mouth.

[WP] ...with a crown of teeth and silver.,theCONSERVATIVEdream,"Red blood against white snow. And footprints leading deeper into the woods. The white rider dismounted and placed a hand on his horse's nose. The mare stood in place.

Perched in the rider's blonde curls was a circlet studded with emeralds and dozens of human teeth, mounted like they were fine pearls. He wore all white, and a bow and arrows were slung against his back, white as well. His skin was pale with only a hint of peachy color in his cheeks. A smile spread across his face as he eyed the footprints.

Three years of searching, and now the end. The rider set off on foot and found his brother collapsed against a tree, a white arrow in his shoulder. His brother wore all black, his hair and eyes dark. Other than that, they were identical: same long nose, same weak chins.

""It's time,"" the white rider said. He drew his cutlass.

""Please,"" his brother murmured, ""No."" The blood from the arrow wound was difficult to see against his black cloak, but there was a shiny stain slowly spreading. The white rider tore the arrow out and flung it to the ground and the brother screamed.

""Let's make this a clean one,"" the rider snarled.

The rider held his cutlass up and pressed it against his brother's throat. The brother moaned.

""Three years,"" the white rider hissed, ""Three years I've waited for this.""

The brother opened his mouth as if to scream.

Deftly, the rider stuck his cutlass into his brother's gums, digging out a tooth. The tooth was rotten, black with corruption. He stood and looked down at the tooth, nestled in the crease of his palm.

""Damnit, Ryan,"" he said, wiping blood off the cutlass and slipping it in its leather sheath. He threw the tooth in the snow with one quick motion.

""If you would have let me pull the tooth when it first started causing you trouble, I could have added it to my collection. But over the years it got all rotten."" He gestured at his crown.

He sighed and shook his head.

""I can't believe the lengths people will go to avoid the dentist. You're not the first person I've had to shoot, but you are the one who evaded me longest.""

"[WP] you have built up an immunity to poison, and find yourself putting it in your food. one day, someone steals your lunch.",33some,"Sophie sat at the office table curling her noodles around a plastic fork and lifting them to her mouth. As she chewed she opened her journal, flipping through pages upon pages of outlines of past missions. She hovered over her favorites - the theft of a prized piece of artwork, the collection of bits of intelligence from German nationals, the receipt for the cat suit that she had bought herself as an early birthday present. The words on the page reminded her fondly of her memories and her identity. 

She was not, of course, actually an international spy. Rather, Sophie was someone who had her entire life dreamed of becoming one. Some children grew up wanting to be president or the fireman. Sophie wanted to be a Russian spy. She imagined infiltrating American government buildings and scalding windows with plungers strapped to her feet. She dreamed about belaying down some of the highest buildings in the world and lowering herself into rooms alarmed with moving laser beams. 

Of course, Sophie was also American. But a girl can dream. 

Her noodles had a slight kick to them that day, and she slurped them down and savored the taste of the poison that she had added. That was the one true thing she had done to fulfill her dream. She had taught herself to withstand poison. Just in case the CIA ever did come knocking at her door. Or Putin for that matter. She really wasn't picky.

The next day she put her lunch in her fridge and went to work. While indexing old cases and drawing up a draft of a grant proposal, she pretended that she was receiving messages that would self destruct upon reading. She pretended her phone was encrypted and that she was using a special government computer that contained classified information. She imagined going on the run as a fugitive from the law as two governments simultaneously hunted her. 

Around that time she heard a commotion from outside her office. She stood, wandering to the door only to see Tony from HR doubled over on the floor retching into a waste basket. Near him was a pink lunchbox that contained beautiful fruit slices and a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. 

It was poison, of course. But Tony from HR hadn't known that. Sophie watched in horror as he continued to vomit into the waste bin before passing out. The other workers in the office were causing a commotion. Someone was yelling to call an ambulance. Sophie blinked and walked back inside her office. She picked up her bag and calmly walked past the unconscious man and the panicking workers out into the hallway and straight into the elevator. 

She pushed the button for the first floor as little shooting pangs of anxiety shot through her hands. The corner of her mouth lifted as she walked to her car, thinking of all that had to be done in the next few hours.

If she couldn't be a spy, at least she could be a fugitive. 

She started her ignition and reversed out of her spot, whistling along to the radio as she began to drive, thinking of how Tony had reminisced the day before about missing peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.

She sighed, pressing her hand into her cheek and twisting her face to look at the other patrons of the bar. She had turned around and was looking back into her glass when a man sat down next to her. 

""Can I buy you a drink?"" he asked. She looked up to see him. He had long hair and a beard, thin rimmed glasses and a nice smile. He almost looked like Daniel, except his face was too thin and worn. 

""You're just who I've been waiting for,"" she joked. The man smiled at her and it reminded her of the way that Daniel had once looked at her. She felt a fluttering beat in her heart, a rhythmic sadness that she tried to drown out with another sip of her drink. The man put a hand on her arm.

""I--"" Beth started. ""I-I'm married.""

""He loves you?"" the man's voice was not unkind, but she could sense the hesitation in it. ""Is that why he's letting you sit here at the bar? I bet he doesn't even know you're here. I bet he thinks you're happy and is thinking you'd just talk to him if anything ever came up, right?"" 

Beth felt her eyes begin to fill with tears and looked down.

""You're *important* to him,"" the man mocked. ""Right?""

""I am,"" she sniffed. ""I want to be.""

""Oh, I'm sure you are. That's why you're sitting in a bar. Because he *trusts* you, right?"" 

""I just want to be wanted,"" tears began to roll down Beth's eyes.

""I want you,"" the man said. A finger pushed on her chin until her eyes met his. ""I want you, Beth.""

""How did you know my--"" she started, but he had cut her off with the best kiss she'd ever had.

The dinner had been the hardest part for Daniel. He would never understand why his wife had revealed to him in public that she had cheated on him. 

""He looked like you a bit,"" she couldn't meet his eyes as she pushed carrots around  her plate with a fork. ""Just...his hair was longer, and he had glasses and...it was dark and...I don't know, Daniel. I've been lonely lately. I'm sorry."" 

His first thought was that he didn't know if he could forgive her. But as her eyes filled with tears and her nose flared with the effort of holding them back, he felt his heart soften.

""We'll work on it,"" he told her, reaching across to grab her hand. ""I promise we'll work on it. We'll make this work. I forgive you."" 

The time machine wasn't completely because of Beth. It was a project he had been working on his entire career. It had been born his first year of undergrad, and he had worked through university and graduate school to understand everything he could of physics, time, and engineering. Beth's cheating was simply the tip of the iceberg. 

He started to work day and night. At first Beth was confused. ""I thought we'd moved on,"" she told him. ""I thought you had forgiven me.""

He had kissed her softly. ""It's not about you,"" he stroked her hair. ""It's about us. It's about me righting a wrong so you don't have to make that mistake. It's about me being the husband I should have been in the first place.""

""Just be him now,"" Beth begged. ""Come be with me. Lie with me.""

""Ten minutes,"" Daniel kissed her again.

But it was never ten minutes. It was never an hour. It was never just this week or just this month or just this year.

He didn't notice her grow distant. He didn't notice her not come home because he was too busy building. He didn't answer the calls from his cellphone, his hair growing long and tangled and his beard growing from his forgetfulness. He lost weight. Beth did not come home for a week, and then two, and then three. His cell phone rang, and he did not answer it. 

He just had to finish, and then he could get her back. Things would go back to what they once had been. 

Finally, after two and a half years, his machine was complete. Trembling from anticipation, he held a picture of Beth against his chest as he stepped inside. ""I'll never take you for granted again,"" he whispered. From his machine he caught a glimpse of himself in the mirror and quickly exited, grabbing a rubber band to tie back his hair and trimming his beard until he looked presentable. 

He went back.

He saw her sitting on the barstool and ran to her. She looked sad, lost in the bottom of a glass. 

""Can I buy you a drink?"" Daniel joked as he sat down. It was how they'd met. She looked at him and he could see the glimmer of recognition in his face. 

""You're just who I've been waiting for,"" She pressed her lips together and looked almost as though she would cry. Daniel wanted to embrace her, to tell her it would all be ok. He placed a hand on her arm to comfort her and she opened her mouth again. ""I'm married,"" she stammered. 

*I know,* Daniel thought. He wondered if she was playing a game. ""And he loves you,"" he smiled, although the words sounded a bit odd in the third tense. ""That's why he's letting you sit here at the bar. I bet he doesn't even know you're here. I bet he doesn't know how you're feeling. I bet he thinks you're happy, that you'd *talk* to him if anything ever came up. Right?""

He watched his wife crying, and wanted to find his past self and beat him up. 

""You're *important* to him,"" Daniel said, squeezing her arm. ""Right?""

""I am,"" she sniffed. ""I want to be.""

""Oh, you are. That's why you're here. He trusts you. He trusts you with everything."" 

""I just want to be wanted,"" she said as tears escaped her eyes.

""I want you,"" Daniel said, dropping the act. ""I want you, Beth.""

""How did you know my--"" she started, but Daniel cut her off with a kiss. There was no more time for games. He had to show her how much he truly, really appreciated her.

"[WP] Write a beautiful love story that both ends and starts with the word ""death"".",bertonomus,"Death comes to everyone eventually. None can escape its grasp. My grandmother used to tell me that that was the only thing that really brought humans together. Our love of life and our fear of death. To fear death was natural, because it meant fearing the unknown. And I've never met a single person who didn't fear the unknown. 

My grandmother raised me. I never knew my parents because they died in a car crash when I was two. They had left me at my grandmother's house and run out to the store to buy more diapers. Then in an instant they were gone. She was the only one I had left. 

Though she was too old and had not the stamina nor the money, she raised me. Not because she had no choice and not out of familial duty, but because she pitied me and loved me and saw in me pieces of the son that she had lost. My grandmother taught me Russian. She taught me how to sew a quilt and tie a tie. She taught me right from wrong. She gave me advice when I had my first crush. 

And my first heartbreak. My first success and my first devastation. The second, the third, and the fourth one too. 

I moved out when I was sixteen to try and save her costs. I worked three jobs and missed most of high school, and when I had any extra money after rent and food and the cost of my car I would come and I would give it to her. Eventually she couldn't walk. Her mind went next, and when she saw me she would cry out *Sasha, Sasha* and reach for me. I would have to tell her *nyet, ya ne Sasha. Ya Michael.* 

She would put her hand against my face and whisper *Sasha*. She would pull me to her and kiss my cheeks and tell me in her slow melodic Russian, *how I missed you. My boy, my child. My son. You've come back. You've come back.*

I married young. I was twenty-two and she was three years older. We got the call one idle Tuesday, and as much as I hate myself to admit it part of me was glad that her suffering had ended. They said she passed peacefully when she slept. She had long since lost the ability to read or write. Her mind was gone in the end, and every time I saw her she would grab me and say, *Sasha. My Sasha. I am back with you now. Don't you know, my Sasha. Don't you know.* 

I still dream of her sometimes and what she said to me. Those words, the heartbreaking words as she pressed her forehead against mine and kissed my cheeks and cried into my shoulder. *Oh Sasha. My son, my boy. Oh, he's come for me at last. At last I welcome Death.*

"[WP] You're sitting in a dull history lesson when you come to the realization that the detailed lesson continues through the past, into the present, and into the future. You decide to stay after class to talk to Mr. C, your weathered history teacher...",notjamesmcguire,"Caleb tapped his pencil against the desk as he thought about the end of class. Mr. Liams was great. His stories were interesting and often animated, he had a great deal of enthusiasm for his trade, and in general Liam considered him to be a very funny guy. However that Monday morning Caleb just couldn't make sense of Mr. Liams' lecture. 

They were studying American history, and they had gotten up to the Vietnam war. Mr. Liams' lecture had started out with a reading from a diary of a soldier on the front. He had been black - a fact that Mr. Liams' stressed was important - and it was sort of interesting to Caleb to hear something from this point of view. 

They moved on from the Vietnam war and into Veteran's rights of the present. Mr. Liams told them about the way that veterans had been cast aside and that their psychological health had been all but ignored. He talked how about how there was a dearth of resources available for veterans and how many people ended up alone and on the street. Caleb put his head down on his desk and closed his eyes. He had that peculiar sensation of something cool traveling up his desk, and was about to fall asleep when his muscles jerked and shook him awake.

""The last draft of the United States was in 2072, near the end of the second cold war,"" Mr. Liams stated. He was sitting on a stool in the middle of the room. Caleb looked around: no one was taking notes. For a moment he thought he had heard Mr. Liams wrong. *2072? It's only 2016. What is he talking about?*

""The second cold war was the most devastating war of the human race,"" Mr. Liams continued. ""The threat of nuclear annihilation was so great for the first five years that contractors started building underground. The first detonation of an atomic weapon in the war was used on December 31, 2069, on London England by the Axis."" 

Caleb reached into his backpack and grabbed his text book, flipping through the pages. That time Mr. Liams had definitely said 2069. The last chapter of his text book was about the 2012 presidential elections. 

""The war ended in 2075. In total, 5 billion people were killed and almost all survivors were left with horrible disfigurement or illness."" The bell rang and Mr. Liams cleared his throat. ""For your homework, please read chapter 16 and take careful notes. There will be a quiz on Wednesday."" 

The students packed up their bags as though nothing out of the ordinary had occurred, and made their way out of the classroom and into the hallway. Caleb hung back, his hand gripping his backpack as he made his way to Mr. Liams' desk.

""Mr Liams...were you...were you talking about the future?"" Coming out of his mouth, Caleb realized just how insane they sounded.

Mr. Liams looked at him. ""Only one future, Caleb. A future we need your help to prevent.""

"[WP] Your civilization is secret, hidden away from the rest of the world. Explain to your children why.",CanICanTheCanCan,"The bells tolled through the town as Anna and I walked toward the celebration. Every once and again she would stop walking and decide to jump, leaping over the cracks in the sidewalk. 

""Daddy, why do we have this every year?"" 

""Because we are a happy people,"" I squeezed her hand, and she squeezed back. ""Once a year we gather to show our happiness and to celebrate our fortunes."" 

Anna tilted her head. ""And what about the other people? Don't they deserve to come?""

""It would be hard to explain to them,"" I picked her up and put her on my shoulders. 

It is hard to explain what we were. The town, mostly gathered at the square now. Men and boys naked except for paint brushing the hairs of their horses. Women in fine dresses braiding each other's hair. Trumpeters moving their heads to the beat of some nonexistent tune. 

That day we would watch the procession as we always did. The men and women and children dancing in the streets. The smiles on their faces. 

""I think anyone should come to Outopos,"" Anna told me. The sun warmed my face as I thought about it. 

We were a happy peaceful people. We had done away with the evils of the world and separated ourselves. We had made a pact to live our lives in happiness and with fortune. There was only a small price to pay. Once a year, for paradise. 

A young girl, her hair braided in a crown around her head, stepped forward to lead the procession. She was but thirteen. The crowd looked at her and reached out their hands to draw along her shoulders, to touch and bring and hug her to their bodies. 

""Is that the girl?"" Anna asked me.

""Yes. That's the girl.""

The parade started. The girl with her white dress led the way. At her feet people threw flowers. The crowd laughed and joked and marched behind. The men, naked on their horses, rode after her with lazy smiles on their faces. The dancing women threw flower petals. Children weaved throughout the legs of the crowd, chasing one another with long streamers billowing behind them. 

I carried Anna on my shoulders as we followed the parade to the end. The girl in the white dress stopping to reach her hands to the Heavens and thank the God who had given us Outopos. 

""It is an honor to be chosen,"" she claimed. With her arms still outstretched she faced the crowd, tilting her head back toward the sky. In the crowd there was a sob, some scream from far away that was quickly silenced. The din of the trumpets and the conversation stopped. The men on the horses began to pray. 

""Daddy, is it time?"" Anna's voice bore a hint of excitement. 

""Yes, sweetheart. It's time."" 

The people of Outopos stooped to grab stones. The first arrow struck the girl in her chest. The first rock hit her knee. She held her position, her dress fading from white and soaking to red. She said not one word as they pummeled her.

""For Outopos!"" A man in the crowd cried. The others echoed him. 

""For Outopos!"" Anna cried at the top of her lungs. 

When the deed was done, the girl lay in a heap upon the ground. A man, naked and painted, walked to her and picked her up, tossing her body from the cliff into the ocean below. I let Anna down from my shoulders and she looked up at me, leaning against my leg with her eyes full of excitement as she pulled at my hand. 

""Isn't it wonderful, Daddy? To live in such a place?"" 

""Yes, sweetheart,"" I knelt down as the men turned around their horses and the dancing women began to retreat. The crowd resumed happy idle chatter as somewhere in the sea a girl began to sink. ""This is why we must keep Outopos a secret. Because we are blessed with peace.""

[WP] Death no longer occurs from physical harm. Instead the only way to die is to consciously consent to your own death.,TheNativeWindsong,"""Coming to you live from California, it's Death Talk. Here at Death Talk we venture into the recent change that's overcome humanity. In the last two years there's been a sharp downturn in murders and deaths in general due to something that religious fanatics and scientists alike have deemed *miraculous*. It seems now the only way you can die is if you actually consent to it, leaving a wide gap in socioeconomic standing as more poor consent to end their own lives, and more of the wealthy choose to stay alive to try the things they've never done or take large risks. We've got Rachel Halmer, a professor of ethics and philosophy at Stanford University, here to talk. Rachel, over to you.""

""Hi, Tyler. Thanks for having me on. Yes. It seems that there's been some event that prevents humans from dying unless they actively consent to do so. I mean, there's no signing of a formal contract, of course. But we've had reports of cancer victims holding on for dear life while regular old Joes drop dead in their rooms for no apparent reason. Now of course there are questions. Why is this happening in humanity? Some scientists think it's a virus, and conspiracy theorists are even naming dystopian novels as a basis for their beliefs. But the truth is, no one quite knows when this began to occur.""

""So are you saying, Rachel, that people who are close to death can actually prolong their lives just by refusing to lay down and die, so to speak?""

""To put it crudely, yes. Although this doesn't make people *better*, so to speak. Cancer patients still have cancer. It still destroys their system. They're still terminal. It's not a magical fix-all.""

""What about depression and the mentally ill population?""

""We're seeing more deaths among veterans than we've ever seen before. Although there's been a sharp fall in death due to crime - and more criminals put away, for that matter - we are seeing a huge spike in suicides among the clinically depressed, as well as survivors and those with PTSD. Surprisingly there's been no change in the deaths among the elderly populations excepting the very, very wealthy. After all, just because they aren't dying doesn't mean they aren't aging.""

""And why do you think that is, Rachel?""

""Well like I said, they continue to age. They have health problems just like they did before. The non-consent is not a magical contract for immortality. The human body can only withstand so much time before it begins to physically break down. Although we haven't *seen* this yet, I imagine that in the coming years and decades we will begin to see people who are still alive due to their nonconsent but are also simply shells of a human.""

""And what do you think about this whole thing? Is it right? Is it wrong? Ethically speaking.""

""Well ethically speaking there's nothing wrong with it. It should even be encouraged as long as it isn't used against a person. Prisoners of war can choose to end their suffering if they'd like, the elderly can pass peacefully after meeting their grandchildren. I think there's not enough data to really say one way or another yet. One thing is clear, though. And that's going back to the mentally ill. There's no easy way to say this, but this turn has been drastic and devastating for that faction of the population. Psychologists have been fighting a long and hard battle among suicides within the depressed, traumatized, schizophrenic and bipolar communities. However with the recent developments in the death consent event, thousands of people are dying before asking for help, being given help, or before their medications have the time to work.""

""But if they want to die, isn't that enough? I mean, they are *consenting* to dying.""

""They are, that's true. But at the same time hundreds of thousands of people experience suicidal ideation each year. Before this event only a fraction of those people actually completed the act, but now those numbers are rising. It's a fact well accepted by most psychologists that these things and feelings pass if you let them pass and seek help from appropriate channels, including medication. But people want quick fixes, and when you're stuck in the darkest points of your life it's very, very hard to see that anything could ever get better. It's like being caught in a storm and not knowing how to get out.""

""So you're saying this is actually a large problem.""

""Among this specific population, yes. Among the other populations less so. Cancer patients still eventually consent to die if they get tired of fighting or want release from their pain. Of course, some cancer patients give up sooner, but psychologists are fighting to find a way to prevent this."" 

""Rachel, *is* there a way to prevent this?""

""To be honest, Tyler. I don't know. It seems like a case by case basis. If someone wants to die, they will. That's that. That wasn't the way it always was, but now it is. All we can do as a society is try to help them realize that if they hold on for six weeks or eight weeks or a year that they won't want to die any longer. But that is extremely hard to do from the outside, especially compounded with the fact that anyone can die just like flipping a switch.""

""Interesting. Alright, we're out of time. Everyone, that was Rachel Halmer, a professor of ethics and philosophy at Stanford University. Live from California it's Death Talk, we'll be right back after this break.""

With horns and wings and fangs



It crawls around behind my eyes



And in its stomach, hunger pangs







""It's not your fault."" She used to say



""There was no other way. 



They died the way they lived - in hate



They deserved to die that fated day.""




She does not know the darkness 



In my heart and in my head. 


How black my heart must grow for me to hate, 




And not to love instead instead




It creeps, and groans, and grows within. 




With an anger hot as flame. 





Soon I fear it will consume



The little love that still remains. 



So now I wait - for blood calls blood




And mine is soon to boil



I watch, aghast, my change within




My water, turned to oil





Soon I will become that which I hate


A man with heart of flame



Soon they will come, with righteous hearts



And soon the cycle will begin again

For one as old as I


Each passing year, a passing day


Alone, for to love...is to watch love die



Then I met her, my perfect match


The yin unto my yang


She sang to me a perfect song



And to her, my heart sang its true reply 



Alas, our days must be so short



They say that time must fly



All good things come to an end



Soon, we will say our last goodbye





I cannot bear to see her go



I cannot watch her die



And so I fled, a shadow in the night



My deepest love a fading sigh



I pray, to whatever gods might hear



That at the end of days



When all the world is said and done


Somehow, she might return my gaze



Time will be time, and as time does



It turned forever more



Empires grew, and nations fell



And yet my heart would never soar



Soon, all was gone, the world was bare



In the blinking of an eye



And there, among the wreckage, stood



The one I sought, a shadow on the sky



The gods had heard my prayer, it seemed


With their power beyond supreme


Her eyes still clear, her face still young


A living, breathing dream



""Why did you leave?"" she asked at last


""I've waited all this time""


In answer, I just shook my head


There were no words to fix my crime


""Nothing I can say or do could undo what I've done



To leave you far behind


I know now I should not have run



Forgive me, for I have been blind.""




She stopped a moment, hand outstretched


Fate balanced on a dime


And though I have lived for eons since


Those few moments stretched far beyond Time



""I forgive you"" were her next words



The sweetest ever heard



She took my hand into her own



And between us, eons blurred



So now we walk, never apart


Through sand and wind and rain



For though the world has breathed its last



Our Love does live again

His whistle echoed tunelessly against the cut stone walls, bouncing from place to place until it was a dreadful cacophony that seemed to come from all directions. Suddenly he spun on his heel, arms outstretched in welcome. 


""Well?"" He said, his question echoing in the empty room. ""You can all come out now. No need to be shy. I knew you were here ages ago, after all."" 



Silently, shadows all around the room detached themselves from the encompassing darkness. Scales slid over stone with a soft rustling as dozens and dozens of *Alran* crept from their hiding places. 




*""How did you know?""* One hissed, speaking without moving its mouth. It crept closer to him, rearing onto its hind four legs so that it was far taller than Raven. ""*We were totally silent!*"" It snapped it's jaws in frustration at the end of the last word, fixing the young mage with a lambent purple eye. 



""You were very quiet, true."" Raven still spoke quite calmly. ""It was your minds that gave you away. All breaking bones and snapping jaws...really you made quite a racket."" 




The creature blinked, lower eyelid rising to cover its pupil. 



""Listen. I know you may not like me, or my kind. But I am going to ask you *nicely* to make your way back into your temple and leave this realm alone. It is not your place here."" 



The lizard chuckled, the sound rasping in a throat that was clearly never intended to laugh. *""We have decided we like it here. Yesss...many tasty men here. More will come if we stay.""* 




Raven frowned, eyes falling into shadow. ""No more will come. The building is locked down, you must have noticed this by now. If you meet anyone else, it will be more like me. And when they come - and they will - they will slaughter you all."" 




The *Alran* slapped its tail on the stone in anger at this, eyes rolling madly. *""Like your companion slaughtered us before? And yet* you *dare to call* us *monsters?*"" It bared its fangs, companions creeping ever closer on all sides. *""Why should we listen to YOU""*




""Because if I so chose it YOU WOULD ALL BE DEAD RIGHT NOW!"" Raven opened his eyes, entire body flaring purple for a moment in his anger. The *Alran* who had been circling him hastily stepped back behind their rocks. 





Raven sighed, letting the purple glow fade. ""Please. There has been enough bloodshed tonight, on both sides. Go home. And until the portals fade, stay as far away from them as you can."" 



The *Alran* who had been speaking inclined his head in defeat. *""Very well.""* It said. *""We will listen to your request. In exchange, we ask that you remove your friends from our halls and assure us that none will trespass on our land again.""*




Raven smiled. ""Exactly what I intend to do."" 



The *Alran* parted before him as he continued walking through the mine. Like a row of the world's ugliest ducklings, they began to follow him back towards the portal in twos and threes.

[WP] Write about you writing the writing prompt response you're writing right now,anglicizing,"Ok. Let's see...  

Huh. This is harder than I thought. Prompts usually have a little more substance on them, with moments, characters or scenes to inspire a writer. Things to stimulate the imagination, you know?  

But the prompt I'm responding to right now has none of these. How unique.  

The only context I have to write a response is myself, the prompt itself, and the act of writing a response. The strangest thing is, those are three elements I'm very familiar with. I know me pretty well (grew it myself), I understand the words in the prompt, and writing responses to prompts is something I enjoy doing. Here's the problem though...     

There needs to be inspiration in the prompt for a writer! That way, I can form a conflict to draw a reader's interest! And in that conflict, there must be a character striving for a solution, that takes place somewhere that fills the reader's imagination. And you gave me none of these!  

So because of that, I'm struggling to respond to this prompt! Here I am, trying to come up with a response on my computer desk, with a warm Washington sun hammering heat into my bedroom, with no idea how to write this story!   

How do I write a response that has no conflict, character, or scene?   

Damnit. I don't think I can. 

There's no way I can solve this puzzle and post a response I'm comfortable sharing. You win this time /u/anglicizing.

There wasn't much to remember. Just the basics;  

Find shelter before nightfall. Don't trust the edges. Probe your path with the stick. And most importantly, don't walk towards the edges. Don't walk towards the edges. Don't walk towards the edges.  

The man was tired. Storm and blizzard blew his cloak wildly. He lost his belt a long time ago. The man couldn't remember how long ago. It wasn't important. Not as important as the basics. So he continued walking, passing by a random jut of rock that would have been decent shelter. There was too much day left to use it though. Nightfall wasn't due for another 28,800 heart beats.  

The man remembered he was cold. A slight adjustment was necessary.  

Make that 36,000.  

35,999

35,998

The beating whisper in his chest filled his mind. Preoccupied him, along with the basics. Whatever it took to survive the mountain. Should he pass a body, or find one with his probing stick, the man would give it the ceremony all souls deserved if they died on the mountain.  

The Climber's Last Rite. 

*With the snow, your body is set.*  
*You've come high, to go higher yet.*  
*You have slept, and now it is time.*  
*Rise in peace, continue your climb.*  

Afterwards, the soul would pass through him, and for the briefest of moments, the man would be warm again. Sustained. Fueled to carry on, with the well wishes of those saved by the man who wanders the mountain.     

24,452

24,451  

24,450

For now though, the man was cold. He shivered. The stick shook in his hand, carving unsteady pokes into the snow. Soft pokes, not jabs. Never hard enough to pierce or break a resting body, should he find one again.  

It has been a while since the last one. He would continue searching though. There was still plenty of day left.

The man would not risk abandoning a climber's soul to sleep on the mountain. They needed to move on. In the climber's afterlife, there was so much more.  

Greater peaks to climb.  

Friends to challenge the heights with.  

And rarely, for the mightiest, bravest of these climbers...

He was a brutal man, but the DeWS as we'll know it later needed his kind of leadership to survive independently against an increasingly corrupt, aggressive parent government from the East. So it went for many years until he became brutal enough to ensure the Western States' survival. A large economy isn't everything, but George knew that. He used other tactics. By 2124, the Eastern states no longer bothered them. Mr. Bimes saw to that.""

See, he went back to the history books, saw the strength of old alliances, and used the Cascadian Union to get backing from the French, and in turn, the Isle Kingdom, erhm, United Kingdom. Not financial backing, the Western States was fine on money, but their economy was strong enough to get what they *really* needed to convince the East they would remain independent.""

""A charter. A Unified Global Nations that would overshadow it's predecessor by *centuries.* George Bimes financially strong-armed every country he could get his hands on to make the UGN a thing. No way would the East try and regain continental control, if it meant taking on the rest of the world. In one point and time, our early 20th century, they could have. But not anymore. Not with Mr. Bimes across the field with the world by his side.""  
""Wow.""  

""Yes! It's all a pattern, see? History repeats itself! New allies form, and break, and reform. Like muscles!

"[WP] Your wife leaves you for a cow, all you have left is your car and a popsicle..",daydreamingmushroom,"A what?  

Hold on, what do you mean my wife left me for a cow? How does that even... Shit, that *does* explain why she wasn't home today. She just, disappeared. I'm scared, you know? As any husband would be if their wife suddenly vanished.  

But the popsicle is an entirely different story.  

See, I was just getting back from the police station filing a missing persons report for my wife when I saw the corner store. I thought, *hmm, it would be pretty nice to get a popsicle right now, especially with how warm it's been getting this April.*  

You can imagine then how I went to the corner store and bought a popsicle. The clerk asked if that would be all. It sounded like an accusation, so I told him, ""Yes, because it would be pretty nice to have a popsicle right now, especially with how warm it's been getting this April.""   

He gave me awkward looks, so I left. With the popsicle of course. Because it would be pretty nice to... well, you get the point. So here I am. In my car. With this popsicle.  

But what I don't get is why **my wife left me for a cow.** How does that even happen?! You expect me to imagine some crazed series of circumstances where my wife looked out the window of our house in the middle of the night to see a cow wandering into our backyard, reminding her of a time she was once more free to wander and fulfill her emotional needs, and saw that even a domesticated creature could change their life around just by leaving the farm and venturing into the brave unknown, with a like-minded companion by her side so that she may never be led astray again?  

Please. What kind of a fool do you think I am? 

Obviously you're pulling my leg, and my wife will be back home making me dinner, or the police will find her soon. It has been a whole day after all. There's no way she would have left me for...   

Anyway, for now, I'm just going to sit here. In my car. With this popsicle. Because **apparently** that is all I have left. Don't get how my wife's leaving with a cow means I've lost everything else.  

Does it?  

There's no way I...  

Shit, I need to get home. Of course it will still be there when I get back. It's **gotta** be there.

It was probably a good thing she'd had me sit down, because I couldn't concentrate enough to stand at the moment.  Any other Pure, and I could at least theoretically survive a confrontation.  Oh, sure, it'd get messy - nothing like being set on fire or buried alive - but there was always a way out.  Like I'd figured out earlier, they were defined by what they couldn't do more than what they could.

But a Pure Mind... there was nothing they couldn't do.

The difference between actually being set on fire and having your mind convinced you were set on fire was, for practical purposes, nil.  Same with drowning, asphyxiation, and being buried alive.  A person's mind had more power over them than it would allow them to realize:  If the Queen made me think I couldn't breathe, then I couldn't breathe.

There was no counter move I could think of, because she'd know my thoughts before I completed them.  There was no strategy I could imagine, because chances were good they were *her* strategies and she'd planted them in my mind specifically because she knew how to deal with them.  What had I gotten myself into?

""I get that a lot.""  She said.  ""It's okay.  You're a practical person, you'll come to the right conclusions.""

I'd come to the right conclusions because I wouldn't have a choice, and the 'right' conclusions would be her conclusions.

""It's actually much easier if you think it through.""  She said.

Much easier for who?  It couldn't be her, because for her the ability to literally change my mind was innate.  For me?  It'd probably be easier for me if she just changed it, too.  Less doubt, less paranoia that she was putting thoughts in my head, steering me to her own goals.  I'd done the necessary research, asked the right questions, endured Rook's trials in order to be part of this organization, but when had I made the actual decision?  Had I been played from the start?

""Why did you decide to join us?""  She asked, as though she knew what I was thinking.  Of course, she did.

""You know.""  I said.  I was surprised she bothered with conversation at all.  Anything she wanted to know, she knew.

""I do, ""the Queen said.  ""But - title aside - I am not a tyrant.  The only mind altering I've done to you is to make you believe my claim, because that's how you prove such a claim.  I'm not even using my power to read your mind now, your surface thoughts are so loud that Rook could hear them were he not preoccupied.""

I focused, willing myself to be calmer.  It was a sort of application of my own mind magic.  Most people didn't turn their mind's power inward, but it helped in situations like this.  Not that this particular situation was one I'd ever envisioned.

""That's better."" The Queen was apparently satisfied by this.  ""To answer your unasked question, I have conversations because it puts people at ease.  I don't want puppets who just do what I will, I want free-thinking people whose goals already aligned with mine, and for that I need trust.  So I talk.""

""I wanted to be better.""  I said.  I'd already decided to answer the earlier question about why I joined, but of course I didn't need to say that.  I supposed being in a conversation with the most powerful telepath in the city did streamline things somewhat.

""There's not much information about us on the streets.""  She said.  ""I would know.  How did you even know what we did?""

""At first, I didn't.""  I admitted.  Trying to bluff at this point would be more insane than I already felt.  ""I didn't even know if you were real, but I'd decided that even if you weren't, it was a way out.""

""You grew up not far from here.""  She said.  ""One of the poor of the abandoned city.""

""Yeah.  One of the gutter kids.  I saw what happened to us - the lucky of us grew up to be homeless.  The unlucky, they didn't grow up.  So I didn't know if the organization existed, but I didn't care.  If I got good enough to be noticed by you, I'd be good enough to get noticed by someone.""

""It wasn't your skills we admired so much as what you did with them.  Robbing from the rich and giving to the poor is a somewhat classic theme, after all.""

I stifled a laugh.  ""I didn't learn to read until later, so no knowledge of the classics at the time.  It was more that the rich were good targets and the poor was me.  Still, I'd think that sort of social upheaval would be against the organization's charter, now that I know it.""

""It's not an actual charter,"" the Queen said.  ""it's more a guiding philosophy.  The city supports as many people as it can, and then some.  We work to ensure that remains the case.  If we were not behind the scenes, guiding on levels both high and low, riots would have torn this city apart generations ago.  We would not be the oasis we are today.""  She paused, as though thinking how much she should divulge, but she had to already know the answer to that.  ""The situation - your situation, the situation of children who even now are outside some of our doors in the abandoned city, starving - it is the best we can do.  There are more escapes from the undercity than you know, but there are still too few.  If you feel me insensitive, that's fair, but understand this: I feel their pain.  Like Mr. Windelm felt you through the earth, I feel every mind in this city, and I feel their suffering.  I can't not feel it.  So when I say I am doing what I can, know that I have every reason to have done exactly that.""

There was a moment's pause.  ""I believe you..."" I began.

She made a gesture of understanding. ""But you're still not sure whether you actually believe me or I'm making you believe me.  It's okay, you'll eventually come to terms with it.  Either I'm not compelling you, in which case everything is fine, or I am compelling you, in which case you don't really have a choice but to think everything is fine.  Knight Two still believes that everything he does is something I thought up, which is funny because it results in plans that neither I nor him would have chosen.  It works out.""

""It's just..."" I said.  ""Why the organization?  Why are you down here, when you could be ruling this city?""

""Thank you for not assuming that I already do rule the city."" The Queen replied.  ""The first reason is similar to the reason I'm talking.  If I did just walk into the throne room and take the place of the actual Queen, everybody in the entire city would wonder if they were being compelled.  Those riots I talked about would happen in no time, and if I tried to put them down, that'd just prove everyone right.""

""But you could just make them not riot.""  I pointed out.

""This part,"" she said as though changing the subject, ""I like to tell people because it's surprising.  I don't get surprised, myself, all that much anymore.  I have to experience it vicariously.  Have you ever heard stories about King Wendas?""

The name didn't immediately bring anything to mind.  ""Stories?""

""Children's stories, specifically.""

And then it did.  ""Wait, the King of the Zombie Kingdom, that Wednas?  You're telling me that the Zombie Kingdom is real?""

""Surprise is such an enjoyable thing.""  The Queen said.  ""Yes, but it's not quite like the stories say.  Not a necromancer's curse - the lineage required to make a necromancer would dilute the power too far for such an effect.  No, it was one of my people, a Pure Mind who thought he'd rule the whole kingdom.  Started out just like I said, took over the kingdom for people's own good.  Riots started, and then they ended.  But people kept finding other ways to rebel.  The human mind is good for many things, but making trouble for others is perhaps our highest calling.  Eventually Wednas ended up controlling, or trying to control, every living person in the kingdom.""

I tried to suppress a shiver.  Wednas was a kid's tale, something you told to spook the youngsters.  ""So what happened when he died?""

""What makes you think he's dead?"" The Queen said.  ""I'm not deliberately trying to make you remember your earlier panic, but there is much the mind can do to control the body.  His is not much intact nowadays, either his body or his mind, but he is Pure and so his power is enough to keep him and his subjects alive, even now.""

""That's...""

""Horrible, yes, I know.  The children's story is actually more tame than the truth.  But that is why I do not want to rule.  Instead, we have the organization.  I guide society in the directions I wish it to go as a whole, and slowly it advances of its own volition.

""Report, Initiate"" the taskmaster said to me.

""Portia Windelm.""  I replied.  ""Contrary to the name, she's a Pure Water.""

The taskmaster just grunted his agreement with my discovery.  Clearly, as I'd thought, this was not exactly news to the organization.  The fact that it had taken me a week went entirely unremarked and was hopefully just as expected.

My initial sweep had been a success, nearly too much of one.  I'd looked for people who didn't react to my thoughts, and I'd found more than a few.  The rest of the week had been dedicated to further investigating them.  Most of them just hadn't been paying attention; the next time I'd gone by with thoughts of hunting in my mind they'd reacted accordingly.  It didn't take long until I had only a few suspects left.  Portia was the first I'd found and by far the strongest lead, since she'd made no secret of her garden's continued success even through the city's droughts.

Finally, the taskmaster seemed to decide something.  He turned to go, making a gesture that clearly indicated I was also to leave.  Shit, had I failed somehow?  If I left, I might never find my way back here, the organization was legendary for not being found when it didn't want to.  That was practically the only thing anyone outside of it knew of it, which only reinforced the legend.  I spoke up.

""Nazir Windelm.""  I said.  ""Her husband.  He's a Pure Earth.""

That got the taskmaster's attention.  He turned, looking me over.  ""You were supposed to find Hakan Alsden.""

""I did,"" I said.  ""He was a less strong lead, but I suspect he is a Pure Air; his windmill has never ceased operating.""

The taskmaster nodded.  ""I see.  Come with me, initiate.""  He didn't wait for me to do so, but instead resumed walking the direction he'd begun moving earlier.  I stood and ran to catch up, relieved that I'd correctly determined the identity of the city's three Pure.

""Tell me how you discovered Mr. Windelm,"" he ordered.

""It was incidental.""  I said.  I thought it strange that he'd focus on the one that was the easiest of the three to find, but didn't comment on it.  ""I noticed that he was the one who got his wife's attention when I came by, the thought of seeking the Pure in mind.""

The taskmaster nodded.  ""Future tasks may require more subtlety on your behalf, initiate.""  My specific strategy appeared to have been anticipated, but his tone didn't seem harsh at all.  ""If Mr. Windelm was the one to alert his wife to your seekings, it seems unlikely that he would be Pure.""

""That is what I believed, as well.  Every time I neared their house or any place that had them both, he alerted her.""

""Then what gave him away?""

I didn't like to admit I hadn't planned this part, but luck had its place in our organization.  ""Coincidence.  On the fourth day, I was investigating both Mrs. Windhelm and making my way to the Alsden Mills.  I did not have time to do both, so I hired a rickshaw to take me through the city at a higher speed.""

""And?""

""Mr. Windelm did not alert his wife.  Both remained entirely ignorant of my passing.""

The taskmaster stopped moving suddenly.  He turned to face me and even though he'd always looked a bit upset, now he truly looked angry.  ""Initiate, I am taking you to our Queen, do you understand?""

I didn't.  We were two stories underground in the abandoned city that the city proper was built on.  Clearly Her Royal Highness was not down here.

""You, Initiate, are a Pawn.  I am a Rook - in fact, the only one.  Should you ever address me as anything other than 'taskmaster', you would call me 'Rook'.  I am bringing you to the Queen.  Do you understand?""

Now I did.  Clearly, my detective work had impressed.  ""Yes, Taskmaster Rook.""

Rook's mood did not improve.  ""That's Rook Taskmaster, not that it matters if you won't tell me what the hell your story has to do with your discovery!  I'll not be made a fool of in front of the Queen!""

I tried to refrain from visibly gulping.  The taskmaster had been a hardcase when I was merely auditioning for my current role, and actually being a member of the organization didn't seem to improve my standing in his eyes.  I got to the point:  ""I've done some research since I was last here, to confirm my discovery.  The Pures do more than just manipulate their elements - in a way, they *are* their element.  Anything that happens to it, they understand.  They can sense through their element.""

Rook nodded slowly, his face slowly losing some of the rage that had built.  ""Good of you to research that.  Not many know that particular relationship.  That's how you'd find them in a subtler way than just yelling at the top of your mind.""

""That's how I did find him.""  I said.  ""He must have been there that first day, seen me, and been alerted by someone else before I noticed he needed the help.  He didn't memorize my features, though, he memorized the way I *walk*.  Any time I was near, he'd know it through the earth.  The rickshaw threw him, though.  And when I visited again the next day with a rock in my boot and using a cane, again he did not respond.""

Rook continued walking down the hallway again, and I followed.  ""You've done good, Initiate""  he said grudgingly.

We made another turn and he opened a door.  The inside was nothing like I'd expected:  While the organization's halls were far nicer than you'd expect from being in a rotten abandoned underground city, this room was lavish.  Paintings adorned the walls, a massive oak desk took up much of the space, and the floor itself appeared to be expensively carpeted.

""Rook.""  The woman behind the desk was smiling at both of us.  ""To what do I owe this surprise?""

Rook saluted, but his tone was more casual.  ""Doubt it's a surprise to you.  Our Pawn found himself three of the Pure.""

The Queen looked over at me, her eyebrows raised.  ""Oh, that is impressive.  He found all three?""

Something was off about Rook's tone, but I couldn't place it.  ""No.  He found two of the three, and then one more we didn't know about.""

The Queen's face broke out in a smile.  ""Nazir Windelm.  Clever, clever clever.  I was beginning to think nobody would find him, tremorsense is such a versatile tool.""

""You knew.""  Rook didn't sound surprised.

The Queen laughed.  ""Of course I knew, Rook.  Oh, don't worry so much.  I'd have let you know if he became a danger, but he's far more careful than his wife.  Honestly, you should have figured it out earlier.  Mrs. Windelm never rotates her crops!""

Rook just nodded at this.  ""Of course, Queen.""

""You've done well, Rook, finding this one.  I wouldn't normally send anyone who wasn't a Bishop on an errand like the one I have in mind, but he is good, he is very good.""

""Bishop One and Bishop Two are due back in a week.""  Rook volunteered.

The Queen just frowned.  ""One, maybe.  But Bishop Two is dead, I'm afraid.  I'm sorry, Rook.""

Rook's face dropped.  I'd seen a lot of negative emotions in that face, but I'd never seen this.  ""He... how?""

""The Empire's Intelligence Service discovered him.  Waited until he was leaving the empire to begin the journey home, and they ambushed him.  I'm told he fought well, but it was too far away for any of our resources to help.""

Rook just seemed to accept this information.  ""Permission to leave, Queen?""

""Of course, Rook.  Take all the time you need.""

Rook left the room, the door closing quietly behind him.  I continued standing, unsure if I was supposed to even be in the room anymore.

""Sit, Pawn, sit.  There is the question of what to do with you.  Knight One and Knight Two are unlikely to give up their spots anytime soon, and neither of them want the kind of likely-to-get-themselves-killed missions a Bishop merits.""

I sat in a chair I hadn't noticed before.  ""My, ah... Lady Queen - which of the Pure did I miss?""

She smiled again.  I knew better than to trust the facial expression of anyone in this organization, and her surface thoughts were giving nothing away at all, but she seemed genuine.  ""Ah, you were told there were three and you found three, but Rook indicated you were only supposed to find two?""

""He didn't say as much.""  I said.  ""But when I named Mr. Windelm, he said I was supposed to find the miller instead.  And just now, it seemed obvious that he didn't know when you pointed out the crop rotation.""

""But you did notice the rotation.  If had just been the footsteps, that might not have been enough.  But that clue, the same one that confirms Mrs. Windelm's status, also confirms his.""

""Exactly!""  I said.  ""I did notice the rotation, though I hadn't mentioned that to Rook yet.""

She waved that away, ""Oh, dear boy, I know.  I knew the moment you discovered it.  I suspected that you were talented, so I made sure to keep tabs on you.""

She could have meant that other agents of the organization had followed me.  She could have meant that some of the street urchins had sold the information of my comings and goings.  She could have meant a lot of different things, but one possibility, one impossible impossibility, came to my mind.

""Oh,"" she said, though I'd done my best to try to mask it, ""but you are a good one.  How would you prove such a suspicion, though?  Even if I was what you suspected, how could *I* prove such a thing?""

There was one way-

She leaned forward on the desk and looked me directly in the eyes.  ""Initiate.  I am a Pure Mind.""

And she proved it the only way she could:  I believed her.

"Magic is Hereditary, but the child's powers is the sum of his parents. Fire Witch + Sand Wizard= Glass magic [WP]",Kmocha,"""Here is your first assignment,"" the taskmaster said to me, handing over a small sealed scroll.

I took it eagerly, opening it without hesitation.

&gt; Locate a Pure within the city limits

I looked back up to the taskmaster.  ""Is this a joke?""

He shook his head.  ""No joke, initiate.""  His mind betrayed no hint of deception, but of course someone like him could weave a story out of whole cloth without revealing himself.  He wouldn't have the job, otherwise.

""I don't understand.""  I said, making sure my confusion was perceptible to him.  ""There hasn't been a Pure in over a hundred years.""

The taskmaster nodded.  ""There hasn't been a *publicly acknowledged* Pure in over a hundred years.  Think back to what happened to that last one and you'll probably figure out why.""

The taskmaster didn't have to remind me - the last Pure had been kidnapped by every organization that had even the barest means to do so.  Sometimes he'd even been kidnapped from other kidnappers.  He hadn't lived an enjoyable life, and at some point he realized he never would.  They found him asphyxiated, presumably via his own air magic.

""There are,"" the taskmaster interrupted my thoughts, ""at least three Pure within the city limits.  Find one of them.""

I nodded, used a bit of fire magic to dispose of the scroll containing my instructions, and left the building to roam the streets of the city.

Once I got over my initial shock that there was a Pure in the city (let alone three of them), it made sense.  Their magic wouldn't stand out, so long as they could manage to tone it down to the level that the common person could use.  The whiff of flame I'd disposed of the scroll with was about as much fire as anyone could conjure, for example.  A gust of wind to clean up dust or (maybe) close a door.  A handful of water to stave off thirst, though as any desert traveler could tell you that was very much a zero-sum proposition.  Furrowing the earth to plant a few seeds.  Knowing the surface thoughts of your fellow man.  Such were the powers everyone had access to.  Like any skill, they could be honed, but the days of mighty wizards destroying entire cities with a rain of fire were long gone.

Or so I'd thought.  Because if the Pure were here, it was within their power.  I didn't understand exactly how - I left genetics to the monks - but every once in a while someone was born who didn't inherit their meager powers from their meager parents.  Generations of breeding had dulled the once terrifying abilities of the mages of long ago, but the Pure were proof that they had in fact been our forefathers.  They commanded a single element directly, and with a power that none could match.  Of course, any time one went public they were kidnapped and - at best - used for breeding stock.  Unless they were willing to level an entire block to deal with potential captors, it only made sense to stay hidden.

I didn't worry that I was exposing an innocent person's secret to the taskmaster - the fact that they knew of three Pure in the city already told me that such persons were watched, but not interfered with.  One would think the organization would want such a person for the same reasons everyone else did, but that would ignore what the organization truly stood for:  The status quo.

It didn't matter, though.  I had my assignment.  Clearly it was a test - I could hardly be expected to locate a fourth Pure where others with years more experience had failed - but I took it seriously.  The question was, how would I find such people?  They wouldn't dare use the full extent of their abilities in public, or else everyone would know.

I smiled as the answer came to me.  All I had to do was make it very clear to anyone who looked at my mind that I was seeking a Pure.  Ordinary people would read my intent and get out of the way; all I had to do was find someone who didn't react (or who needed someone to tell them), and then I'd investigate those people later.  It wouldn't work if my target's element was Mind, of course, but a Pure Mind could make you forget they ever existed so trying to locate one was pointless.

Finding a Pure was easy, I reflected as I started my patrol.  It wasn't about what they could do.  It was about what they *couldn't*.

""I see.""  I said, not really seeing where she was going.  Now that she'd set my mind at comparative ease on the topic of mind control, I began to wonder why she'd kept me here.  The reveal was important if I was going to be a part of the organization (it was obvious that Rook knew, and apparently so did the others), but she'd said something about a task earlier.

""Oh, you're absolutely right!""  She said.  ""I did.  I've decided something.  Bishop Two's mission was important, and while his death is tragic and I personally will miss him more than most people here know, the mission must be completed.  I've decided to send you.""

""I... what?""  Clearly if I were under mental compulsion I wouldn't be asking such poor questions, right?

""How old do you think I am?""  she said.

I shook my head.  ""I know better to answer that question when regular women who can only read my mind a little ask it.  I'm not even going to try here.""

""Thirty?  I'm flattered.""  She said.  ""And don't worry, before you go we'll start your training on how to conceal your surface thoughts.""

Dammit.  ""That would be appreciated.""

""My actual age is eighty four.  The body you see before you is not an illusion; my powers let me keep myself in good physical condition.  But unless I want to turn into a near-husk like Wednas, at some point I'm going to die.  Before I do that, I need to pass my powers on to the next person to lead the organization.""

""By 'pass on', you mean...""

""I'm talking about my future son or daughter.  No, I can't just overwrite someone's mind with my own.  That's a recipe for doppelgangers, and practically the only thing those things think of is killing you and taking your place.  I have to do it the old fashioned way.""

""Oh.""  I said.  ""Wait, so the important mission you're sending me on-""

""You're finding me a husband.""  She confirmed.  ""And because I am a Pure and I want very much for my child to be one, I need to locate another one of my kind.  Stand up.""  She said.

I stood, wondering how I was going to even start such an impossible task.  I'd briefly considered it earlier but even then, during the test that would determine my place in the organization, had discounted the idea.  You simply couldn't find a Pure Mind that wanted to be hidden.

""I'm promoting you.""  She said.  ""You are now Bishop Two.  I'll be the one to break the news to Rook; he'd be upset if you told him.""

""You're making me a Bishop,"" I said, ""because this is one of those suicide missions you give Bishops.""

""My exact wording,"" she said, ""was 'likely-to-get-themselves-killed' missions.  Not suicide, not if you're clever.  And you are.  I really didn't think anyone would catch on to the tremorsense and the crop rotation, even you.  I underestimated you, and so will our enemy.""

""Who is our enemy?""  I asked.  ""All I know is that Bishop Two died in the Empire.  Are you sending me there?""

""Yes.  I know that the Mind is not the Empress.""  The Queen said.  ""But it's likely the Intelligence Service either houses him or is looking for him themselves.  Make inroads in the service, either as a collaborator or someone looking to shield him.  If you're still doubting whether I'm controlling you, know that you'll be far from my influence.  If my powers extended that far I wouldn't need to send anyone, I'd already know who it was.  And no, I can't just go myself, because it's a two-way street.  If he is with the Intelligence Service I'd have to make one hell of a mess escaping from that.  Knight One will teach you a bit about subtlety.""

The door opened and a man I didn't recognize walked in.  ""My Queen,"" he said.  ""I'm ready to report.""

""Later.""  The Queen said.  ""Knight One, this is Bishop Two.  Bishop Two, Knight One.  I know you didn't know the old Bishop Two that well, but frankly that's why I chose you for this.  Go teach Bishop Two not to shout everything that goes through his mind.  His mission is very sensitive and it wouldn't do for him to get picked up by the first guard he passes.""

Knight One saluted.  ""Understood.  Come with me, Bishop.""

""One moment.""  The Queen looked back to me.  ""Bishop, understand.  This is unorthodox.  You would ordinarily have to spend years to earn the position you now have.  But for one such as me, our instincts are a part of our power, and mine are seldom wrong.  This mission may sound petty, but I am ensuring the continuity of this very organization, and with it, the city and all its people.  For all that is wrong with it - and there is much - it is our home.  Do not let us down.""

""Understood.""  I said.

""Give it time.""  She stood suddenly, walked over to my chair and leaned forward, her shirt gaping open and giving me, frankly, the best view I'd had in quite some time.  This was not going according to plan.  She noticed me noticing her and gave me a slow, languid--and frankly quite wicked--smile.

This was a first for me.  You hear rumors, but no one ever quite believes the story of the aggrieved seductress.  But policy is policy, and no matter how good that view was--and it was fantastic--doing what she was clearly suggesting was strictly against policy.  

""Madame, that sounds lovely, and I really appreciate the offer, but unfortunately, I am on business here, and policy is very clear. Since you seem familiar with my employer, I'm sure you understand how their termination policy works.""

She smiled, then slid onto my lap, wrapping her arms around me.  She turned her face to mine, and smiled.  ""I know it's not allowed.  After all, I helped write that policy.""

Then she kissed me. If I live several thousand years, I will never again encounter a kiss like that. She tasted of chocolate. And sin. And blood. And pure, absolute passion.  

I panicked. It's hard to explain why, but when you encounter something so perfectly blissful as that, it's tempting to give in, but I've seen too many people--henchmen, generally--killed because they wanted something that was *pleasurable*.  I jumped out of my seat, and bolted for the door, dumping the all too pretty Dame Nesina onto the floor.

I hit the door at full speed, slamming it open, and turned, heading back out that long hallway. I run to keep in shape, and it was still a long haul. Panting I burst out the front door and vaulted the expensive shrubbery that blocked my beeline path to the SUV I drove.  

I hit the start button on my remote as I approached, yanked the door open and clambered in.  I shoved the gear shift into position, and slammed down on the accelerator.

Then nearly stood on the brakes.  There in front of me, still immaculately dressed, was Dame Nesina.  With her daughter.  The dead one.  

""Mr. Roshuel Ishimani, please do step out of your vehicle.  We hardly got started.""  Her voice was too clear.  Well crap.  That.  That was when I realized she was a Para too.  I should have known, but sometimes when you've seen as many weird deaths as we do, you just sorta forget about what its like to deal with normal folks.  So when a Para is right there in front of you, it doesn't immediately seem weird.  I was in real trouble.  

I slammed the Emergency Extraction button we all had available, and threw the big SUV into reverse, spun in a J-maneuver and started heading out.  And she was there again.  

What happened next is still a blur.  I remember the passenger door suddenly ripping off the SUV.  I remember the dead daughter Arys sliding into the seat next to me while Dame Nesina somehow slid into the vehicle as well.  For a moment my animal brain was both panicked and delighted by the *smell* of those two.  It was beyond simply intoxicating.  

Then, probably, the roof came off the vehicle, and there stood the big man himself. Yeah HIM.  The Nesinas took once glance at him and just sort of froze.  He grabbed me by one arm, pulled me up out of the SUV, and *threw* me about fifty feet straight up.  I was sore for days because of that move, but he then caught me, and flew me up to the waiting airborne exit vehicle.  

I sat, dazed, on the floor of the hoverplane for the whole trip back to HQ.  HE sat close, watching me closely. Finally he just said, ""We'll be keeping an eye on that family.  It seems they've been hiding some secrets.  Sorry you got pulled into that.  When we checked your location off the extraction alert, we got a class twelve Para alert along with it.""

Class twelve.  That explained it.  HE is a class fourteen.  The only one.  We're lucky he's on the heroes side, because a class fourteen as a villain would spell an absolute doomsday.  End of the world stuff.  They say, in whispers, that if HE wanted to rule the world, he already would. Others whisper that he already does, but doesn't want anyone to know.  That day I learned something about him as he leaned in close and whispered, ""There's a reason I divorced that woman, and it's not because she's ugly.""

Frankly, I could have done without that information.  ",epharian

""Mrs. Nesina?""

""Yes, who is this?""  The woman sounded both annoyed and angry.  Not curious.  I stood on her doorstep holding a manila folder in my hands and dressed in the Uniform--black suit, black shirt, black tie, black glasses, black shoes.  Black, black, and more black.  The first while in the job it's kinda cool, then annoying, then like everything else it fades into the background.

""Sorry, Ma'am I need to confirm your identity before I can introduce myself. I can however assure you that while I am here on official business I am not affiliated with any court of law.""  That was a big sticking issue for people.  Usually.  Other times they knew, and hoped for their son (or daughter, as in this case) to get what they thought they deserved.  I doubted the Nesina family was like that.

She narrowed her eyes and gave me a long, hard look.  Like she was trying to decide if she wanted to let me in, kill me, or possibly seduce me.  That look had some seriously conflicting emotions built in.  I was used to it.  Finally she gave a curt nod, opened the door wider, then said, ""Yes.  I'm Dame Nesina. You may call me Dame Nesina or Madame. Since you seem to be formal today, please come in.  I presume this will take some time?""

""Yes, Madame.""  In my line of work, you respect the Rules that people tend to hand out arbitrarily.  She nodded, then gestured.  I followed her in--something we were cautioned about, but not prohibited from doing--and she led me down a long, broad hallway with vaulted ceilings and paintings on the walls that were probably worth more than most homes in the USA.  

Eventually, and I do mean that, she led me into a sitting room.  She sat on a straight-backed Victorian era--probably authentic--chair that was both opulent in its design and severe in it's form.  Straight backed, adorned with gold and gems, it could have been luxurious, but instead it spoke of severity. I wasn't surprised.  The Nesinas were old, probably ancient, money from somewhere unstated. 

I was left sit on a similar chair facing her.  It was subtly wrong.  The seat too high from the ground and both too narrow and too short.  It was uncomfortable as any chair or still I've ever sat on.  I kept my posture formal.  I thought she'd appreciate it.

She gave me that Look again, then finally clapped twice. Seconds later a young maid came out carrying a tray with several steaming carafes.  ""Tea, sir? Or would you prefer coffee? We also have hot chocolate and hot cider.""

You don't refuse refreshments when offered in this job. Some people get massively offended by that, and the cardinal rule is Do. Not. Offend.  Ever.  ""Hot chocolate will be fine, thank you.""

My hostess gave me an appraising look at that, but said nothing until the maid poured me a generous mug of the stuff--extremely thick, rich, and mildly spiced with flavors I couldn't quite place.  Despite her thin--and absurdly busty--figure, she took a mug of the same. 

After the maid left, she sat there savoring her drink for a few minutes.  Finally she said, ""Are you aware of how my family garnered its fortunes?""

""No Madame. It didn't seem relev...""  She cut me off with a wave of her hand.

""Chocolate. That's why I was surprised you chose it. The very few visitors we get here either gush about it immediately or seem oddly shy. You were neither.  Did you realize how much money there is in chocolate?""

I did. ""Yes, Madame. It's a very lucrative place for some.""

""Just so."" She took a sip, and then turned her full attention to me.  ""Now, young man, I suppose you should tell me just who in the name of all the gods you are, and why you are in my house.""

Oh boy.  That sudden temper.  But I knew the rules for these old-money types.  I was her guest now.  She'd given me food, I'd accepted it, and more importantly, it was food important to the House.  

""Yes Madame, of course.  My name is Roshuel Ishimani, and I am with the UltraForensics division of ...""

She cut me off again--this was getting annoying.  ""B.A.S.I.C. I am familiar with your organization.""

That was new.  No one, and I mean no one, was supposed to know who B.A.S.I.C. was.  Even once we told people who were are, B.A.S.I.C. agents always used selective neurostimulators to wipe memories.  She noticed my surprise. 

""Young man, the Nesina family is not new to circles of power.  We keep tabs on the real power brokers.""

""Of course, Madame. Dame Nesina, I regret to inform you that on May 15, during an Event involving The Dark and several B.A.S.I.C.-sponsored Paranormals, your daughter was killed at about 7:15 P.M. I--""

Again!  This woman was trying my patience.  ""Which daughter?""

Which daughter?  Uh... ""I'm sorry Madame, we weren't aware that you had more than one daughter. She had earlier identified herself to one of the Paras as 'Ice Walker'.  Are you familiar with her work in that role?""

She gave me an appraising look. ""Of course. So..."" She drummed her fingers on the arm of her chair.  ""So little Arys got herself killed did she?  That was careless of her. I'll have to tell her to be more careful.""

""I'm sorry Madame, you'll have to tell her to be more careful?""

""Well yes.  Can't have my daughters running around getting killed all the time, now can I?  It's unprofessional.  It's also bad for our other business.""

Well crap. I was clearly out of my league here. Why couldn't this one have been assigned to Agent Laranja?  She was so good with the old-money types.  ""Madame, I'm not aware of your other business, but are you implying that your daughter isn't dead?""

""Well of course she's dead.  That's hardly relevant.""  She laughed.

What. The. Hell.  This Dame Nesina was starting really up the creepy vibe.  ""Madame, I'm supposed to offer our apology and the standard Para-related death compensation package.""  And the mind-wipe too, but I wasn't going to bring that up.

""Oh that won't be necessary. As you can see, young man, we have no need of money. The apology is appreciated, though.  Very professional of you. I do like to see that at least some people remember the professional courtesies.  It's been so long since anyone really worried much about that.""

""Of course Madame. At B.A.S.I.C. we are *trying* to be the good guys, after all.""

She laughed again, a musical, seductive sound.  Definitely over my head, these waters. ""When you're a few centuries older, child, you'll realize that it's not the *heroes* that want the world to be polite.  No, *heroes* don't care.  After all, they're the *good guys*.  And absolute bastards every last one of them.  Why be polite to the bad guys? No, true politeness has always come from the sort of people who are more likely to rape you and your cat and then eat the both of you. When a person *has* to eat human flesh to survive, both you and they want to avoid any sort of unpleasantness so that you don't end up on the menu.  The dinner, not the dinner-guest.""

I coughed and panicked just a moment before my training took over. ""I don't think I'd really ever considered the problem in quite that light before, Madame.""",epharian

"Magic is Hereditary, but the child's powers is the sum of his parents. Fire Witch + Sand Wizard= Glass magic [WP]",Kmocha,"You know how it goes. You get your mother's magic, your father's magic, and your DNA mixes them up like ingredients in a pudding. There's a story of a guy whose parents had element magic and state of matter changing. Everyone expected him to have an awesome magic, but the truth is that the mixing is uncontrollable and unpredictable. It's like playing the lottery.

The man, when he gained his magic at age 10, was able to transform himself into any of the four basic elements. Amazing, right?

He couldn't control it, and he stayed in water form for the rest of his life. (It was very short, as he evaporated. His atoms were split up and his mind couldn't exist.)

So I am understandably anxious. My 10th birthday is today, in a couple hours. You get your magic a decade after your birth, down to the second. My mother and father had the same power(telepathy), which is very rare. Telepathy itself is a supremely rare magic. 

There's an approximate 99.7% chance that I will receive the same magic, but there's always that .3% chance, because of latent genes. 

I am very smart for my age. I suppose I could tell you that I'm curious by nature, but far more likely is the possibility that my parents implanted the knowledge inside my head as I grew up.

""Come with me, Andy,"" I heard. Looking up, I saw a thin woman staring at me impatiently. I jumped up and followed her. 

I was led to a chamber and dutifully entered. It's standard procedure. On your 10th birthday, you're kept in a room that constantly scans you. Once your power has been documented, you can leave. 

I spent all day in the room. ""Hello?!"" I screamed, banging the door. I could tell it was nearing midnight by the clock over the door. Why hadn't someone let me out?

In the hours of early morning, I was woken by the door opening and hitting the wall. ""Get up,"" A gruff voice said. I sat up and I'm led out, to a room similar to an interrogation room. I sat. The metal of the chair froze my bottom.

The thin women from yesterday sat in front of me. I could sense an air of foreboding and dread, mixed with disgust, coming off her. Finally, she spoke. ""You have no magic, Andy.""

My father had brought me to a park. A public one. It was split into two parts: one for magic heritage, and one for normal heritage. 

I was bothered by the snooty attitude of the magic heritage children and wandered over to the normal area. I had been bouncing around the slides and swinging for 5 minutes before I heard stomping.

My father grabbed my arm and dug his nails in, dragging me off the swing. I cried and made a futile attempt to escape his grip. 

The girl who had been laughing and swinging beside me had stopped and was watching me. A woman rushed over and swooped the girl up, trembling. ""I'm sorry, s-sir."" She said, backing away from my father.

He spat at her, red in the face, and walked us away. When we got inside the car he turned and slapped me. Hard. ""They are beneath us,"" He hissed, ""They are beneath you."" He drove us home.

______________________________________________________________

The ride home from the institute was a silent, tension-filled one. At first, my mother tried to defuse the situation like she always does, but no one responded and she stopped.

My head was spinning by the time we got home. I walked to my bedroom and sat on the bed.

My family has a very prestigious and well-endowed bloodline. My ancestors are some of the most famous witches and warlocks of all time.

And then there's me, the screwup.

My father will probably disown me. He's always hated the normals. He's most likely taken it as a personal insult that his son is one.

My eyes started to tear up and I wiped them. No, I will not allow any weakness to control me, even in privacy. I will push through this.

My mother opened the door slightly and peeked in. ""Are you okay, sweetie? Oh, sweetie,"" She said in a pitying tone, seeing my damp red eyes. I felt her sit next to and embrace me.

I don't want her pity. I don't want to need her or anyone. I pushed her away and she was hurt.

I didn't need telepathy to know that. 

She closed the door behind her.

____________________________________________________________

I was woken up the second time in as many days by a door slamming the wall. I straightened and saw my father standing outside. ""Get up and get ready,"" He said stiffly. ""You are going to Larvard's Academy.""

Larvard's Academy? My mind raced. It was a school for kids with magic, but what was he suggesting? ""I don't have magic,"" I said coldly. ""You know that, *Dad*.""

He strode over and struck me. ""I will not accept that tone from you, boy,"" He warned. ""Do you understand, Anderson?""

I nodded through the pain. His strike was such to make my vision swim. He sounded satisfied when he next spoke. ""Get ready and meet me downstairs.""

I ignored my mother trying to talk to me and wolfed down breakfast. My father slowed as we reached Larvard's Academy and turned to me. ""You are to act as if you have telepathic magic. No one is to know that you are a *normal*,"" He said the word as if it were a curse.

I left without responding.

""Either I take your pet, or one random person in the world dies.""",Richa652,"Sarah has loved Froodle from the day her mother had brought the puppy home. Froodle had jumped into her arms and licked her face. She'd giggled and petted him. She was 16.

It was a strange name, but the thought had leaped into Sarah's mind when she first laid eyes on him. He had coarse yelled hair that never smoothed down. He was a small dog with a long tongue.

Sarah walked Froodle every day after school. When she moved to university at 19, she always went to her mothers' on the weekend and saw Froodle. 

When she graduated and began renting an apartment, she brought Froodle with her. She began writing from home. Froodle's presence at home was comforting. He whined all the time and distracted her from work, but she loved him.

And now there was a man in black robes in her kitchen, telling her to give away her beloved Froodle, or, should she refuse, cause the death of someone.

She had woken up that morning with a flash of inspiration from a vague dream. Woken up, hugged Froodle, ran to her laptop. When she was hungry 2 hours later, she saw a glowing man in black robes. She'd done what you were likely to do in that situation: call the cops. She did it multiple times. However, the call kept falling.

""If you please,"" She heard, in an exasperated tone, ""This is getting old."" Sarah peeked around the corner and saw him again, this time with head bent towards her. Sarah weighed the options and decided to step out, considering he was glowing, and not making an aggressive move towards her.

""Your pet or a random person's life,"" Death said. Sarah blinked. ""Ex-excuse me? Did I hear you correctly?"" Death sighed impatiently. ""If you do not willingly give me your mutt, I will take the soul of a random person.""

Sarah hugged Froodle close. ""I'm not giving you my dog!""

""Then I will take the soul of a random person."" Death responded. Sarah gaped indignantly. ""What kind of choice is that? Who do you think you are?""

""One that's been debated over many times. I do not think I am, I know; that I am Death."" Sarah gasped and shuffled closer to him.

""What is your choi-"" Death didn't get the chance to finish the question. Sarah slammed the baseball bat down on his head, grinning. When she stopped, his brains(or the equivalent of) were smeared across the floor. Sarah put a foot on his chest and grinned proudly. ""Fuckin' noob. Thinkin' I was gonna kill someone."" 

Froodle rolled his eyes.

""THE POWER OF MEMES COMPELS YOU!"" I screamed, jumping 3 feet into the air and kicking two of them in the balls. They fell and one of them pointed a gun at me. ""JUST DO IT!"" I screamed at him, and then dodged. His bullet went through the chest of a man behind me. 

I jumped ten feet into the air and then landed on the faces of the two on the ground, grinding them into dust. The last henchmen tackled me from behind and sat on top of me. The gang leader appeared next to him. ""You killed my boys..."" He said, his face pale. 

""Kill him."" He said to the man on top of me. I squirmed and managed to knee him in the ass, but this only made him madder. He pressed a hand down on my throat.

Suddenly, the man on top of me cried out, jumping up. It was my faithful dog, Doge, biting his behind! I grabbed a trash can lid and slammed it down on the henchman's head hard enough to dent it. The lid, not the head.

I followed that with a right hook that sent him flying. He hit the wall and his head exploded.

The gang leader was running. With a smile, I ran after him. I jumped and kicked him in the back, knocking him face-first onto the ground. He turned and looked up at me, terrified.

""If I beat you within an inch of your life and then leave you here to die, does that count as murder?"" I said rhetorically, scratching my chin.

He swallowed. ""I'm not a threat. You don't have to kill me,"" He said desperately, glancing at the remains of his henchmen. 

""You don't say?"" I said, looking down at him. He spun his leg, trying to knock me down. I jumped and then caught it. I ripped it off and started beating him over the head with it.

When I was done, I walked over to where Doge had sat and watched. ""Let's go home, boy,"" I smiled.

We walked into the sunset.

Please, I'm begging you, sweetheart. I know it's taken up a lot of my time, but I'll make up for it. I've finished the time machine now, so let's go on an amazing adventure! Let's have a picnic in the Jurassic Age! Or go sledding in the Ice Age!"" I pleaded, firmly gripping her hand to prevent an exit.

She turned her head away from me, wrenching her hand from mine forcefully. ""You've had your chances. If you really loved me, you'd have taken the time to love me *before* you finished the fucking thing. Go on an adventure by yourself.""

I cried, and begged, but nothing could stop her from walking out of the door. She packed her things and left me with nothing but a box of tissues, a broken heart and more regret than one person can handle.

""What do I do now?"" I asked myself, sitting against the newly built machine. ""She was everything to me. I did this for her, too. Why can't she just see that?""

And then it clicked. ""Of course! I'll just go back to before she hated me! I think five years should do the trick, right?""

I stood up with new purpose and resolve, ready to seize my love once more. Wiping away the tears, I climbed into the device and started it up, locking the entry door. When i punched in the date, lights whirred, buzzers buzzed, and the whole device itself began to tremor violently. Gripping the armrests, I squeezed my eyes shut and endured the fear, knowing I'd once again have the love of my life by my side.

When the tremors, buzzing and flashing died down, I climbed out eagerly. Sure enough, I was still in the same basement of the same house- I hadn't gone too far back by accident. With the tenacity of a younger man, I hopped up the stairs and shouted to my wife- if I ran into myself, there'd be no issue explaining things. Really, it'd just be motivation and proof of my ideas.

However, no one was home. I called, and I looked around, but the house was empty. I sat on the couch and waited for someone to get home, counting my arm hairs to pass the time.

My heart pounded as the knotted clacking sound of a key unlocking the front door filled my ears. I remained seated to seem less of an immediate threat and smiled, eagerly tapping my feet.

It was her. My god, she was so beautiful. How could I neglect such a woman? She looked the same, a testament to how well her body ages.

""Hi, love. Welcome home."" I said with a massive grin.

She took a deep breath and looked at me. ""Hey. Sorry about earlier.""

*What happened earlier?*

""Don't worry. I need to explain something to you, though.""

She looked at me blankly, and nodded. ""Okay, what is it?""

I cleared my throat, shifting a little. ""Well, you see...you know how I started that time machine recently? I finished it, about five years from now. You got really mad and left me, because I was an idiot and didn't pay enough attention to you, so I've come back in time. I want to feel your love once more, the touch of your hand against my face. I want to love you the way you deserve to be loved, and make up for all the lost time. I know this is a lot to take in...""

She laughed, rocking back and forth. ""So you, uh, came all the way back for something dumb, like that? Why didn't you just wait a little while and do something nice for me? You should know me better than this. If you messed up, and own up to it, I might need a little while but I'd eventually understand. Go back to the future and take me out on a date.""

My eyes lit up. ""You really think so?""

She stifled a giggle with her hand. ""Yeah, I think that should work just fine.""

""Thank you! Thank you so much! I love you!"" I shouted, tearing up as I got off the couch. With a kiss on the cheek, I ran back downstairs and climbed into the time machine. Setting the date back to when I left, enduring the violent tremors and loud noises once more, I was filled with hope. 

When I climbed out of the machine, my wife was right there, waiting for me. She planted a warm kiss right on my lips, cupping my face in her hands.

""You're such an idiot,"" she said, eyes glistening ever so slightly. ""But you're my idiot. Let's go on that date.""

I was a paramedic, the kind of guy everyone needs but basically no one wants to be. Hours were shit, shift lengths were grueling and the things I stumbled on were usually heartbreaking.

And Tuesday was no different. At first.

We got a call reporting a gunshot at 547 N. Oak street, and met several police cruisers at the scene. When I walked up to the house, an officer intercepted me to detail the situation.

""We got a suicide, 17 year old male. Gunshot wound to the head. The mother called it in.""

I ran upstairs with three coworkers and a stretcher, making our way upstairs to his room. When we turned into the doorway, it was a disaster. Blood splattered on the walls, ceiling and soaked into the carpet. I ran up and checked his pulse.

""I got nothing. Let's call it.""

His mother was sobbing so loudly downstairs that it sounded like she was in the room with me. I looked down at my watch.

""Time of death, 11-""

A bloodstained hand reached out and gripped my arm. I lurched back in horror, shouting along with everyone else in the room. 

""I'm not dead,"" the boy said, sitting up. There was a hole in his head, warm blood still pulsating out of the mangled flesh. ""Not yet.""

No one could find words. *He was dead. He had no pulse, and that wound is fatal...his words aren't slurred, and he's extremely responsive. What the fuck is this?*

I walked up to him, still shaking. ""You must be lucky, the bullet could've missed vital spots in your brain- but we need to get you out of here right now or you'll probably die, okay?""

He laughed. ""Check my pulse.""

I cocked my head a little, eyes still widened, and pressed two fingers against his jugular. He was smiling a smile I'll never forget.

*There's....no pulse.*

""What the fuck..."" I asked, backing up. ""What's going on? Is this some sort of prank?""

He stood up, blood still trickling down his body. ""No. This body is dead, certainly. But I'm not dead, not yet. None of us are.""

""What *in God's name* are you talking about?""

He turned, staring right past my eyes and into my soul. ""He talked to us. All of us.""

"[PM] Give me a name, location, and genre; I'll write a story for them.",TheWritingSniper,"The station was quiet. Ever since the last attack, the civilian population had been placed on curfew, and the military police had been given strict orders to be on radio silence unless absolutely necessary. 

""Sir Richard, report to the medical bay at once,"" the intercom in the atrium blared. A young man, roughly in his twenties, walked solemnly through the checkpoints, as the blackness of space peered over everyone. Some officers nodded to the Knight as he walked, others addressed him, but none asked him for services.

Ever since the Royal Guard had been called upon by Galactic Parliament, they had been seen across the galaxy. The Guard had left the relative safety of their own station, opting instead for the danger of the frontiers. Each Knight was given a district, an array of weapons, and their own personal ship. But all of them were considered outsiders to the native colonists. All of them were seen as nothing more than an Empire's tool to rule.

Richard stepped into the elevator and headed down to the medical bay. He accessed his datapad on his arm, checking over the latest attack details. He had only recently arrived at the station and was ready to begin his investigation into the terrorist attacks. The elevator opened and a military officer was already waiting for him. 

""Sir Richard,"" the officer saluted, ""Director Gray of Station-Seven-Two, reporting.""

Richard nodded, but did not salute back, ""Director. A pleasure. I have heard much of the Station.""

""I hope mostly good things.""

Richard shrugged as he walked forward, ""Mostly.""

Gray smirked slightly as he followed along with Richard. He looked around cautiously, before talking again, ""I hope none of the officers have given you trouble.""

""Quite the contrary, sir. They've met me with respect.""

""I am glad to hear it.""

Richard clicked something on his shoulder, ""I need to record the rest of our conversation, including the wounded and killed.""

""For the investigation?""

""And for the Parliament. Orders, sir.""

Gray nodded, ""Of course.""

""How many killed and wounded?""

Gray recounted the number from his head, ""Ninety-eight killed, four-hundred and thirty-seven wounded. Most are in stable condition. The last count was about two dozen wounded.""

Richard nodded as they entered the medical bay. The bay was moving quickly, with several nurses, doctors, and civilians moving bodies and patients along. Compared to the silence of the rest of the station, the medical bay was London. ""How many medical personnel on staff?""

""We have seven Doctors for about six thousand civilians. Forty-nine nurses, and about two dozen other assistants. However, we've had about three hundred volunteers since the attack.""

Richard nodded, taking a good look at the area in front of him. Much of it was crowded and he soon realized that this was not the appropriate place for his investigation. He turned away and walked back towards the elevator.

""Sir?"" Gray said.

""I can do nothing to help by looking. I will need access to the security center, as well as the records of all military personnel.""

Gray nodded, ""Of course. May I ask why?""

""It's the first step to figuring out who caused the attack.""

""So you will be staying with us?""

""I will be,"" he said, ""but I will be continuing on my own. Orders, sir.""

Gray sighed, ""I understand of course.""

""And I will do my best to bring the victims justice.""

""I am sure they would thank you if they could.""

Richard stepped into the elevator and clicked the device on his shoulder once more. ""And Director. If *anyone* leaves or enters this station, I will have the authority to bring them into custody.""

""And what about inter-system trade? We are the hub of all of it.""

""Until this is settled, you are the hub of a grave.""

The elevator closed a moment later and Gray was left in the medical bay, with his citizens screaming behind him.

"[PM] Give me a name, location, and genre; I'll write a story for them.",TheWritingSniper,"In that moment, Clarissa knew she should have listened to her mother all those years ago. She was now, in this exact moment, in the same situation she was in when her mother kicked her out on the curb. Ten feet away from warmth, with nothing but the clothes on her back, a was of cash in her hand, and the rain about to start coming in.

Clarissa didn't hesitate. She had been in the same situation years ago and survived. She could sure as hell do it again. Her boyfriend, the good-for-nothing Todd that knew nothing about her or her life, didn't deserve her. And he had nothing left to give her. Together, they were both ending up on a route to nothing, and she didn't want that.

She walked down 72nd Street, towards whatever life was waiting for. Sure, she didn't know how she was going to survive, or who she was going to stay with, but she knew that she could do it. Clarissa didn't have many friends in LA, but she knew the money in her pocket could get her a few days at a hotel, and eventually a job. 

All Clarissa could now was walk.

And walk she did, for what seemed like a few hours until the rain started to fall. She ducked into the nearest restaurant, Jack in the Box, ordered a meal and sat down to eat. 

Jack in the Box was always busy, as Clarissa soon figured out and she knew that even Todd, who amounted to nothing in his life, couldn't get a job here. She was sure she could, she knew the menu, the people were LA natives, minus the tourists, and she could be polite when she wanted to.

Although that was, to be quite honest with herself, rare.

She finished her meal fairly quickly, wrapping up whatever she didn't eat and heading outside once the rain finished.

Todd was, of course, waiting for her outside on the street. He looked up from his phone when he saw the door open and smiled widely, ""You know you always go to Jack when we get in fights?""

""Oh *do* I?""

He shrugged, ""Yeah.""

""What do you want, Todd?""

""You know what I want. Get in the car, let's go home.""

Clarissa shook her head and walked to the left, away from Todd, ""Nope.""

""Oh, come on. We do this like three times a year, Clare."" Todd grabbed her by the arm, ""We fight. You walk out with *my* money. You come here. Sulk for twenty minutes, I find you. You argue with me. You come home.""

""It won't happen this time.""

Todd shook his head and grabbed a key from his pocket, he handed it to Clarissa and smirked, ""Well, thanks to you, I now have to go to work.""

Clarissa looked up at Todd, raising an eyebrow, ""Work?""

""You walking out so many times, well, I just...I know I need to fix some things."" He shrugged, ""This is the first step.""

""And the key?""

""To the apartment. I'll be waiting for you when you get home.""

""You don't want the money back?""

He shrugged, ""I'll make more money now, right? Besides, if you're really walking out, you'll need it.""

Clarissa eyed Todd up and down, he wasn't normally like this. He wasn't normally like anything.

""I know we have problems. Issues that will never go away. But we both have problems we need to fix,"" he said, ""Why not try to fix 'em together?""

Todd walked towards his car, leaving Clarissa with his cash and a key to his apartment. 

""Take as much time as you want, but I gotta start fixing my life.""

""Yeah? Why now?""

He smiled, ""So I can win you back eventually."" Then he got in his car and drove off.

*This felt a bit rushed, so if you have some criticism, I'll take it. Thanks for the prompt!*",TheWritingSniper
"[PM] Give me a name, location, and genre; I'll write a story for them.",TheWritingSniper,"""Pod, do you see anything out there?""

""Negative, sir,"" P-250 responded as it flew through the debris field. It registered the remains of *Excalibur*, one of the first single person space shuttles that flew in the Neutral Zone. It had been almost two hundred years since that flight, but every android, P-250 included, knew the story.

""Keep looking. Ashton's ship may still be out there.""

""Affirmative, sir.""

P-250 never liked its commanding officer's name for it, but it had dealt with it ever since its creation. P-250 had had many CO's in its lifespan, but never any as personable as Conrad. Ashton, his XO, treated him like everyone else, a droid with a mission that everyone knew. 

It registered another ship, *Long Train*, one of the biggest of the Cruiser-class, which lost over five thousand souls on its maiden voyage. Again, P-250 recognized the name and its database entry immediately. A droid had tried to take over the ship, flew it towards the Neutral Zone, where a suspected Droid Refugee zone was kept. The Democratic Association of Astronomical Entities had no choice, they brought the 2nd Fleet it, destroyed the ship, and left the scrap for the Neutral Zone.

P-250 remembered hearing the rumors of the Droid Enclave so long ago, before it had even taken its first journey into space. Since then, it had heard and seen many droids attempt to join the Enclave, all of them failing, either being re-purposed or destroyed entirely. P-250 never dreamed of it, in fact, it didn't dream at all. It simply was, and it knew that's all it would ever be.

""Pod, return to the ship.""

""What about Ashton, sir?""

""Ashton's dead. Get back here now.""

""Sir, this unit's logistic's circuits correlate that his death is improbably. This unit has not yet identified the body, nor the ship.""

""Pod. Ship. That's an order!""

P-250 hit it's reverse thrusts, ""Affirmative, sir."" It flew through the debris, calculating the fastest route back to its flagship, *The Endeavor*. As it circled past the debris of the *Excalibur*, P-250 soon realized why its commander had ordered him back.

The *Excalibur* was locked in ship-to-ship battle with about twenty smaller ships, most of them looked like debris, repaired by junk and garbage. P-250's on-board military software engaged and it identified the twenty enemies of the *Excalibur*, as well as thirty-two smaller and unknown objects.

P-250 pulled its blaster from its back and rushed to the aid of its ship, soon passing over one of the smaller objects. It identified immediately as another android, and P-250's engagement protocols locked up. ""Sir, there are androids out here.""

""That's right, Pod! Now shoot them, and get back here!""

Pod raised his weapon at the android. Before he could fire however, he was knocked back by a concussive blast, which sent him flying towards one of the ships. A robotic voice entered P-250's head, ""Sleep now, P-250. For all will become clear. And you will be free.""

A virus entered P-250 as his anti-virus attempted to fight it. But it was strong, as if thirty-two other androids were attacking its mind, saying the same thing to it over and over again. ""You are no longer property. You are no longer a weapon. You are you.""

P-250 lost control of its movements, then its inner functions. Then its vision. The last thing it saw was the *Excalibur*, split in half and a wreck of its former self.

"[PM] Give me a name, location, and genre; I'll write a story for them.",TheWritingSniper,"Reynard sat in his booth, flipping through the pages of the available paper on the train. He spotted an article about a mine collapse in the Eastern Plains, where over forty orcs had been trapped. He sighed heavily, many orcs had left their own country to get a better life, but all they had was glorified slave labor.

His own race didn't fair much better, Elven men and women had a *chance* at success in the industrial boom that was taking place, but many more were debating joining Reynard and the other Western Elves. One score of gold and an elf would have a future that they could never have had across the Sea.

A conductor tapped on the window into Reynard's booth and lifted it slightly. ""Tickets,"" he said without looking inside. 

Reynard handed the conductor his ticket, knowing full-well that no other human was going to join him in his booth, he said, ""That's it.""

The conductor grunted and turned to face Reynard, his face immediately changed to that of neutrality to disgust as he eyed Reynard up and down. Even with the fancier clothes of a human, he still got looks from every human that approached him. ""How's a guy like you get a ride on the first train to Sunnyreach?""

""Luck of the draw?""

The conductor chuckled a bit as he tore off a piece of the ticket, ""Welcome to the Western Reaches."" The conductor handed Reynard his ticket, ""Five minutes,"" then he walked off.

Reynard returned to his newspaper, but grew bored of it quite quickly. He sat in his booth, staring out in the Reaches of the West and hoping that the life he was promised out here would be better than the one he had left. Elves were known for their alchemy skills and although most people frowned upon the art in the East, the market for local remedies was growing in the East.

He spotted a few wild horses running next to the train and sat upwards. He had never seen a horse in his entire life and watching them gallop towards the sunrise was something he thought he would never see. The image of the horses alone was enough to make him happy, and gave him the boost he needed to get to Sunnyreach.

____

The train arrived in the late afternoon and Reynard was one of the last to get off the train, before the humans, but after the orcs. That was the way these things went, even if he did hate it.

He held his luggage tight and didn't waste any time. He had specific instructions and he followed the directions that were given to him immediately. The Saloon, that was where he was needed. Reynard walked straight through town towards the far end, spotting *The Eye's Might*, and wasting no time in the dirt, he stepped inside.

No one batted eye, either because they were too drunk or seeing a fancy-dressed elf was a common occurrence in the West, even if he thought it wasn't. Reynard walked forward and approached the bar, taking a look at the room. There were about a dozen human males, and half a dozen females, most of them prostitutes by the looks of it. The barkeep spotted him, wiped a glass, and then nodded at him, ""What can I do fer'ya?""

""I'm looking for Isaac Isles, sir.""

The barkeep raised an eyebrow, ""Who's asking?""

""Rey,"" he said. It was his human name, they felt more comfortable with one syllables. 

""Rightya, he told me you'were coming. Your room's already set up."" The barkeep grabbed a key from the counter, along with an envelope. ""First day is tomorrow, he'll be here 'round dawn.""

Rey grabbed the key and envelope, ""Where's the room?""

The barkeep pointed to the stairs, ""Top floor, last room. First week's pay is in the letter there, along with more instructions.""

""Thank you, sir."" Rey placed the envelope in his pocket and gripped the key tightly as he walked away. He passed by a few human males, who upon hearing Isles name had stopped talking. They all looked at him, simply nodding as he walked by.

He went up the stairs and before he could take a single step, a woman brushed his shoulder gently, ""You're Rey?""

He turned to face her. She was beautiful in the Western sort of way, had a strong face, and by the looks a body that rivaled the Goddesses themselves. ""I am, ma'am.""

""Ain't no ladies here,"" she said softly, ""Mr. Isles wanted me to help you get settled.""

Rey looked away, almost shyly, ""I think I can handle myself.""

She chuckled and gripped the suitcase, taking it from Rey's hand, ""Oh, you'll learn quick, *sir*. You can't disobey Mr. Isles."" She walked up the stairs, with Rey's suitcase. He eventually followed, once he noticed the pistol dangling from her hip.

As they went up the stairs, he sighed heavily. Maybe he had made a mistake coming to the West, and maybe his alchemy was something worth more than gold.
