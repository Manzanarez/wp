"[CW] A poem, but the first and last words must be the same.",Aoae,"One more step
He said, inside
The pain it showed
He could not hide
So close to the end of life
It started when he lost his wife
The pain inside he had to bury
Two girls with him he had to carry
But death was still among his kin
He lost his girls; his will was thin
The days were dark for years on end
The hurt he did not try to mend
Embrace the agony, he thought
Happiness he never sought
So badly he wanted to be done
Once he had faith, now he had none
At the end, he hit a wall
From deep inside he heard a call
A voice he knew all his years
It told him to defeat his fears
Turned from the ledge where he once leapt
He heard the voice say,
One more step",JBevy
"[CW] A poem, but the first and last words must be the same.",Aoae,"Rain continues its assault on thee,

From the Heavens the water comes falling more,

This torrent blinds and makes it hard to see;

What Demon's rage has caused this downpour?

He marches alone, though once there was three,

To the water his comrades fell long before,

His each step a splash, yet he continues to be,

To complete the mission his friends had died for.

And though the mist makes the path near hidden,

Through much fiercer roads this lone-man's ridden, 

And though his quest offers nothing but pain,

"[WP] You wake up on a desolate road with nothing but the clothes on your back, 50 USD, and a note saying ""Run"".",Alsic,"As I return to consciousness I feel the heat of the burning cars and taste blood. Everything hurts as I try to sit up. The smell of burning paint, car interior, and flesh overwhelms me and I vomit into the grass next to the road. There are smashed and burning cars all around as I remember the moments before the crash. 

I remember seeing cars lose control as people walked onto the highway looking to the sky, seemingly oblivious to traffic. I remember a brilliant streak of light followed by chaos. The last thing I remember is brake lights, squealing tires, and crunching metal before darkness.

I struggle to my feet and fight the dizziness and nausea roiling in my stomach. Looking around I see nothing but destruction. Not a single car on the highway is untouched. Many are burning, most are crushed beyond recognition, and it appears I'm the only person left alive. 

As I stagger into the field next to the highway in the hopes of getting away from the fires and the smell of burning flesh I, without thinking, put my hands in my pockets. Surprised to find anything I pull out some cash and, upon closer inspection, a note that says, ""Run!""

Run where? Who put this note here? I can't imagine running in my current state anyway. 

Reaching the end of my strength I sit on a hummock of grass and look back at the devastation of the highway stretching as far as I can see both east and west. In the distance off to the east there is a huge pillar of smoke which can only be Dallas. 

I know without question the note in my pocket is telling me to flee from Dallas, from the remains of civilization, from humans. But, how can I? I'm weak, I have nowhere to go, and don't even understand what has happened. What am I running from? Trusting my feeling and the note I walk east until I can't walk anymore. A survival instinct I didn't know I had tells me to keep the road in sight, there isn't much out here that is edible away from civilization. I walk for many hours, pass out, and sleep through the night. Waking up in the cold light of dawn I realize I have no plan and no desire besides walking away from the destruction. 

East, always east I walk. I've been walking for three days now. I've found some water in a couple of dirty streams and some berries to eat yesterday but I'm getting weaker by the hour. Looking back to the unknown destruction I'm fleeing I think I see movement. Not knowing if it is a threat or friends, and being too weak to run, I hope for the best as I sit on a bench at an abandoned gas station and wait for it/them to catch up.

As I sit staring into the distance I see figures moving along the highway towards me with their backs to the remains of Dallas. As I watch them it becomes clear they are looking for something. I assume they are searching for survivors since they look into every destroyed car and every burned out wreck. One of them happens to look in my direction and sees me sitting helpless on my bench. The figure starts, points to me, and gestures to it's fellow travelers. A couple of them rush towards me but keep their distance.

They yell to me asking if I'm hurt, do I feel sick, and did I see the meteor. 

""Meteor?"" I ask, confused. 

They explain that a large asteroid has landed near Dallas destroying the city and killing almost everybody who lives there. But that's not the worst of it. It turns out that the theory of panspermia is correct in the worst way possible. The meteorite brought with it a bacteria that has been surviving in space for millennia. It is immune to our antibiotics and kills 99.99% of the people, animals, and fish it comes into contact with. No one knows how to stop it and no one knows why some are immune. All of the survivors who found me are injured, deaf (from the shock wave), or mentally broken at the loss of everyone they held dear. 

I have no choice but to go with them but I have no idea how we will survive the week, let alone the years of sickness and famine that must be coming. ",Dinosaurs_Arnt_Ded
"[WP]You are God. You're writing the source code for the Universe. You record your major discoveries in a journal, describing the fundamentals of the Universe as you create them..as well as venting your frustrations when certain fundamentals don't work out.What fundamentals gave you the most trouble?",ZeffW,"Okay, I'm done. I am seriously done. I can't take this anymore. I'm just going to let them sit there and do whatever. Grab some popcorn, watch this world turn itself to the massive piece of shit it is destined to become.

Why ? Alright, I'll tell you why, Mr. Journal.

It's my children. I mean, every living thing is my child, right? Right. And most of them are getting along according to the designs I made for them. The bees pollinate the trees, the squirrels bury nuts to plant trees, the cougar hunts deer to prevent overpopulation, bla bla bla. That works fine. But there is this one group that simply *insists* on fucking *everything* up.

First, the source children. They did not want to stay in my warm glow and care, the temptation built into them did not allow them to be satisfied. Fine. Never had many of those survive exposure to the world before, I figured they'd be offed by the world around them.

Nope. They thrived. Had kids even. Now, I'm all for diversity, so I made a bunch extra so that things wouldn't get too freaky. They spread like *wildfire*. The whole system was way more complicated than I cared to let it be. Way too mean. These people would ridicule the people around them to make themselves feel better. Not what I wanted. So I warned one of the dudes down there that shit was going down. Made sure everything was saved on the backup, and once it was all wiped clean they started over.

So then they settle, and it happens all over again. Spreading, breeding, using their environment to survive. Then the lack of respect started showing up, the wars, the conflicts. So eventually, as I watched these people murder eachother over their own ignorance, I sent the purest human I could make down their to even things out. What did they do ?

They tortured him to death. What the fuck.

Like, *what ?!* The reason was ridiculous; apparantly, in one of my drunken states, I kind of allowed these people called jews to be their own cool thing, right ? I didn't really care so I let them be, but now they segregated from the other ""non-jewish"" people. So somehow, my perfect boy got "" accused"" of being the king of the jews, and then some big shot guy in this place called ""Roam"" or whatever got really pissed, sentenced my boy to death. For a claim he never actually made.

And let's not even start on the goddamn pharaoh's. Instead of spreading their blood out to the people, they inbreed. That is literally the opposite I wanted. Everyone is doing their own thing, and occasionally I pop in and say a word or two about how things are supposed to be done. But then no one fucking listens and everything I say gets misunderstood and then they start killing eachother again all over because their version of me is the right version, and the other version is a false god and a lie. 

Let's not forget to mention that these people are a *parasite* to nature. They simply go where they want, kill whatever they want (not what they *need*, what they *want*) with no regard for their environment while making their equals do slave labor because ""it is their god given right to command"".

I should have torched this place when I accidentally made the platypus. ",HoneypuffCereal

Its a odd business being a God. You have all the time ever, which means you have an infinite number of tomorrows. Procrastination is a big problem, except it isnt, I mean you can only really be procrastinating when there are deadlines to meet right? Most days I spend on my celestial bed, marveling at all the things that I, in some distant tomorrow, will have already created. I am addicted to binge watching, except I am binge watching a show that hasn't been produced yet. I think I have a problem. I swear to fucking me, I will start making the show tomorrow

Whelp, I got started today. I got up, leapt out of my star studded hammock (not that I was sleeping, Gods dont sleep, we just chill in our kick ass hammocks as the centuries tick away) and got started. I breathed darkness into life, but then couldn't really see anything. That's when I made my first mistake, I lit a tiny, insy winsy spark.

Eon 7: 
Its been awhile since I last got in touch with you. But its been an entertaining few...unit of time. All I did was light a match, and suddenly the whole of everything.... started becoming everything. I mean things popped up out of no where, one minute there was nothing but the darkest of dark, and then there were these giant searing hot golf balls floating around, surrounded by smaller less glowy balls (kind of like squash balls). Then there were these things that I couldnt see without inventing the microscope, even then I had to squint really hard to see what they were, they they became bigger and transformed into other things, then there were these moving rocks crashing into other less moving rocks, then bigger things, that were tiny once, got blown to even tinner things. Then there were these other tiny things that grew to be bigger things, but smaller bigger things than the other bigger things. Now these smaller bigger things are starting to figure stuff out. I think they might be on the verge of lighting their own match. I should probably warn them against it, but I kinda want to see where all this goes. I mean the popcorn's all buttered up and all, would be a shame to waste it.

Eon 8:
Those fuckers figured out fire, and now they are making their own little things. I mean I dont really have to do anything now, I am back to swinging on my hammock eternity after eternity. No one listens to me anymore; pretty soon I am going to be obsolete. Whelp at least it was an entertaining binge watch.

- **TODO** not done yet

- **FIXME** bug/bad code here 
- **XXX** works but so clumsy (or otherwise unsatisfactory) it needs fixing

And no, I don't know what the various technical words really mean. I just used what I heard about and vaguely remember. Sorry if it bothers you.

------

**XXX** Universe expands so quickly that it crashes right after starting. I think the event solver couldn't keep up. Added a special case for now.

------

**FIXME** Gradient descent works pretty awfully here. Initial energy gets some chance to become matter but those new particles don't stay around long enough for interesting reactions. 

**UPDATE** Turns out we could aim for lots and lots of this +6 charged block and things will look amazing! Works so far.

------

**TODO** Implement absolute synchronization here. I have an idea and the code is half done but it deadlocks sometimes, so it's disabled for now. Different particles manage their own information. Once we get this done we should fix bug #2251 ""Fast moving objects mess with time"". 

**FIXME** bug #7329 ""Funny reaction between moving charged particles"" seems related, but I totally don't understand how it's happening.

Each variable created needs to have an array of elements attached to it. for example, var water = [hydrogen, oxygen, hydrogen]. using this method I can create everything in the universe and it can all be unique and labeled.

**Day 13**

I have created locations, living organisms, and non-living items. Once the code is compiled it is time to see how the living organisms interact for the rest of time.

**Day 14**

Nothing was able to interact. Everything would float away in the vast emptiness of space I have created.

*Problem:* How to make sure living organisms are able to continue to interact and keep living.

*Hypothesis 1:* Make space smaller so they are forced to interact. This is like putting a bandage on a leaking pipe, temporary solution to a permanent problem. 

*Hypothesis 2:* Create a function to make all living and non-living organisms get closer to each other making interaction inevitable.

**Day 15**

Shit.

I need a break today.

**Day 16**

Solution two seemed great until the function, using an infinite loop...brought everything together and didn't stop. A black hole was created and the universe crashed. 

*Problem:* function gravity needs to be an infinite loop but will create black hole in the center of the universe eventually.

*Hypothesis:* If I expand space infinitely then there is no way everything will crash together and crash the code. To allocate memory we will start with space being a small focal point and expand outward.

 I hope to me this works.

"[WP]To your surprise, you and your siblings each inherit a ring from your dead, estranged grandmother. Each ring is engraved with one word: Intelligence, Luck, Strength, Charm, or Wealth. Along with it, however, came a note in your grandmother’s handwriting; “Beware the fool who wears them all.”",ZeffW,"I woke to a bright light shining in my eyes. In a hospital, judging from the sounds bustling around me. I lifted my head. The women still stood flanking me, looks of awe and amusement on their faces. 

The one who had touched me, who I assumed to be my grandmother, stepped forward. 

""Dear, foolish, brave one. It has been so long. For ourselves and for the world we rejoice, but for you I am sorry.""

Weird. I must have hit my head. I lifted my hand to feel for a bandage — 

""What?!?"" 

It was more of a yelp than a question. I found myself looking at a smooth, youthful hand, more beautiful than mine had ever been. I wiggled the fingers. It was definitely attached to my brain, but I didn't recognize it. 

""She doesn't know,"" spoke up one of the women in the back of the cadre.

""Of course she doesn't,"" snapped my grandmother. ""Let her get up and walk through it.""

The crown parted and I rose from the bed. Odd; I felt like I was floating. I looked down and almost yelped again. 

My feet weren't touching the floor. 

I looked around. Sick and injured people lay all up and down the hall. Not only was this a hospital, it was  a very overwhelmed ER. 

A heart monitor started blaring somewhere. Men and women in scrubs rushed through the crowded hall. One particularly stocky orderly bowled into me; it turns out balance is a little trickier when your feet aren't on the ground, and I found my hand shoved into a bloody gash on the head of an incredibly still child. 

I lifted my hand in horror, but the apology died on my lips. Before my eyes the blood dried up, disintegrated, floated away. The child stirred and opened his eyes. 

I looked at my shockingly youthful hand. Had I done that?

""Yes, my dear,"" said my grandmother. ""It's been millennia since a goddess walked among us, but now you are here. What are your wishes?""

He turned to his left and found the source of the disturbance. 

A boy, dressed in plain clothes and what looked like a blanket tied around his neck, stood furiously mashing his doorbell. He didn't seem to notice Bob standing in the doorway. 

He leaned against the doorframe, ""Hey uh, kid. You can stop that now.""

The boy glanced sideways, then did a double take.

""I-ITS YOU!""

""And who exactly do you think I am?""

""I- I know! But but you didn't leave a hero in your place. There's no one to defend the city!""

Bob felt a smirk cross his lips, ""There's no need for people like me no more kid. Cops can handle what's out there now.""

The kid seemed to want to say something for a minute, then he spoke, ""But-but you can train a replacement! The world always needs more heroes. That's what you always said on TV.""

Bob suddenly started to realize what the kid was getting at, ""ohhhh, nope, no way kid. Go home.""

""But I can be your apprentice! You can teach me how to be a he-""

Bob took a step back into his house and slammed the door. The impact rattled the house and loosened the hinges.

With a sudden realization, Bob's eyes widened. ""Kid! Kid! You alright?"" He leaped over the door to lift and save the child, but when he landed he found himself standing next to him.

She sounded calm and collected- a vocal quality that I hadn't heard in years.  

I am the last human on earth and my name is George.  I watch a lot of Seinfeld reruns and eat canned tuna.

I was sitting on my couch looking at an old Playboy magazine when I heard her lovely voice echo through.

""My name is Red Clover and I'm in Saint Louis,"" the voice said, ""Anyone out there?  Not sure if I am even using this thing right.  Does anyone copy?""  

I just sat there in disbelief.  First of all, I forgot that I even had a CB radio, it had been so long since anything came through.  Second of all, who the heck has a name like Red Clover?

I got up and grabbed it.  ""Copy, this is George Seaman from Chicago.  Do you copy?""

""Copy,"" she said gently, ""What are you doing George?""

[WP] 105 years ago humankind decided to become extinct by not reproducing. You are the last human alive sitting in your home when suddenly you hear a voice of a young woman over your CB radio.,znous,"I sat back by the fireside, observing the orange ambiance. Beside me sat my trusty CB radio. I'd always hoped there would be a voice on the other side. Alas, nothing but a decade of silence and loneliness. I sighed and took a sip of tea I'd brewed earlier. Humanity made the decision to die out long ago. Looks like we got what we wanted. I had no idea how I'd made it this far, and certainly didn't think I'd be the last one to go. I guess death didn't want me yet. I took another sip and lost myself in memories of an era long since erased. 

We used to have communities, towns, even massive cities. The cities were gone by the time I'd came along. I remembered when I was first told we were curbing the birth rate. When I asked why I was allowed to be born, the reply came that I was just lucky. The first one thousand people to sign up for reproduction rights each year could reproduce. My parents were once such couple. By the time I came of age, this was no longer allowed. Anyone found having kids would be murdered, the children would have their memories erased and placed into foster care. Not sure how they managed to answer their question of why they got to be born though. 

After living a long, productive life and living through the last handful of deaths as those around me died of old age, I sat now in my chair, alone. Or so I thought I was alone. While I was nearly napping, there suddenly came a tapping. No, not a tapping, a crackling. At first I thought it was the fire, then I heard a voice.

""Hello? Is anyone out there? Does this thing even work?"" I heard a young woman inquire. I nearly jumped out of my skin at this. The phrase echoed over and over in my head until I could calm my hurly-burly and reply. Hands shaking, I pressed the button and raised the microphone to my mouth.

""Yes I'm here...how...who...where did you come from?"" I inquired, trying to sound sane.

""Well I found one of these radios and thought I would give it a shot. I didn't think it would work, but I didn't...think I'd find anyone else out there...I thought I was alone."" The woman replied, sounded of a similar state to my own. She sounded so young, this struck me as peculiar. I replied after a moment.

""Well, you're not alone ma'am, but...you sound so young. We stopped allowing reproduction a long time ago..."" I stated.

""Well you see, I was one of the foster kids, my parents were killed after reproducing...I...heard my birth was by accident. I got in contact with some people who knew them...I was told they didn't think they were still fertile...Kind of amazing in a way..."" She replied near instantaneously, though her tone sounded as if she were processing something. After a moment, I pressed the button again.

""I see...well...do you have a name?"" The inquiry was met by silence. Moments passed and then, ""Yes, my name is...""

Suddenly everything went black. Confused I tried to brace myself, but I could not feel anything. There was a loud static crack, followed by the words ""SIMULATION ENDED."" I was suddenly in a room, panting hard as the helmet was lifted from my head.

""Ah Steve, sorry about that. Gary botched the programming again but we got far."" came a familiar voice. I blinked a few times. ""Damn, Larry."" I said shaking my head. ""That shit was a bit too real that time. Serious progress."" I stood up to stretch my legs. ""Good work though. I was so immersed I forgot I was in a simulation! I nearly had a stroke when I saw it end!"" I laughed and shook my head. Larry laughed.

""Yeah, I'll get Gary to do it next time, after we get that error fixed."" He said, pointing to the diagnostics on the computer screen near the chair. ""Pretty interesting look into our own extinction though."" He said, bemused. I nodded. 

""Yeah. Where is Gary anyway? I don't remember him coming in."" Larry shrugged. ""Clair says he didn't show up, didn't even call in."" I scowled, this behavior was not the norm for our fellow researcher. 

""Well I hope he isn't dead or something."" I replied looking at Larry. He opened his mouth to respond, then suddenly everything froze. Slowly, the color drained from everything. I panicked. ""Oh shit what now...."" I said looking around. Everything was gray, even my hands and clothing. Suddenly the door flung open with a loud slam. I turned. There Gary walked towards me slowly.

""That's the bad news."" He said in a very off-putting tone. I felt fear well up inside me. ""This has to be a prank..."" I replied, stammering. Gary shook his head. He stood before me and pulled a veil of darkness from nothing and draped it over him. ""You're the one who's dead."" He replied. ""The simulation went wrong and killed you. I'm here to escort you to the next life."" He gestured to the door, which had become a gateway to manic, swirling oblivion. Unwillingly, I slogged along behind him as he took my wrist and moved for the exit. Recounting my life I stood for a moment before being forcefully jerked to the edge.

""Here is where you make your exit."" Death-Gary replied. I signed. All my life for this. Ironic that it was due to a simulation of voluntary human extinction. He let go of me and vanished into the void before me. I took one last breath and stepped in. All around me images of my life swirled. Colors and faces, home and work, all of it a maddening mass before my eyes. Suddenly it vanished. Silence. Then those damned words appeared again. ""Simulation Ended."" 

I opened my eyes. I was submersed nude in a liquid inside a glass container. I could feel instruments on me. In shock I looked around. Two glowing, softly lit clouds of something approached the tank. The liquid drained and the container opened.

""Sorry about that Subject 35553-631773-6774!"" A voice said. I shook my head and blinked. 

""What the fuck is going on!?"" I demanded. The voice spoke again, making me realize it was coming from one of the clouds. ""You were in a simulation. You're being studied. We told you this just after your abduction. Don't you remember?"" It said. The other cloud drifted over to a holographic screen and began manipulating it with tendrils. I stared for a moment.

""N...No I don't remember...much of anything."" I replied. The other cloud spoke.

""It would appear there's been tampering with the simulation. The Subject was in a double simulation, the first ours, but the second one was of him doing research and dying in his lab. Subject has also had a memory block implemented."" I shook my head in disbelief. I had no idea where to start my questioning, so I blurted the first thing that came to mind.

""Where...How...W...Why are you doing this to me?"" 

""We apologize. The double simulation and the block where not out intentions. We're Gandarathions. Aliens, if you will. We've chosen you as part of a program to establish a race of humans to live on our planet. To make things simple, it was discovered our kind can symbiotically live meshed with humans.""

""You mean...like inside us?""

""Precisely. I told you this in greater detail before. We did the simulation to see how one would act if there were a catastrophic even during the establishment of the colony. For instance, if your kind decided to rebel and voluntarily extinct yourselves before our project could be complete. Unfortunately, we do not yet know how that may play out. We mean you no harm, rest assured. We'll get you situated."" the voice had a calming, melodic tone. I sighed, knowing I didn't have much choice. The other voice spoke up before I could say anything.

""Yes Subject. Apologies. It appears our colleague,"" The voice made the sound of wind blowing, followed by a soft pop, and what sounded like rainfall. ""has decided it would be humorous to play a prank on both us and you. We're sorry for this mass inconvenience."" I could only stare blankly. ""Watch this be a fucking simulation too."" I thought.",ledditlememefaceleme

[WP] 105 years ago humankind decided to become extinct by not reproducing. You are the last human alive sitting in your home when suddenly you hear a voice of a young woman over your CB radio.,znous,"“This is DJ AJ coming to you live from Chicago, ready to bring you your morning dose of radio news,” I say into the receiver.  I kick myself back in the creaky wooden chair and throw my feet up on the old desk.  My boots are dusty, but the desk isn't any cleaner.  All I do is kick a cloud of dirt into the air.  “Humanity is less than a lifetime away from being extinct, but I'm carrying on.  Trying to figure out why this decision was made.  Debating whether I should rifle through papers and journals to figure out if there's a way to keep humanity alive.  Is it worth it?  Was this decision made for a good reason I just can't think of?”

I put the receiver down for a minute.  There are some CDs and an old boom box in here.  I pick up Nirvana’s Greatest Hits and pop it in, giving a little background noise to my morning radio show.  Not that anyone is listening.  I'm the last one, and this is purely for my entertainment.

“I went to Washington for awhile.  Looked around the abandoned government buildings to see what I could find.  Doesn't look like anyone left behind a record of why the world decided to stop reproducing.  I'll keep looking though.  I have to know.  I just can't imagine why humanity would decide to go extinct.”

I pause.  While I gather more thoughts to ramble out like I actually have an audience, I let the music play.  This boom box will die before too long.  Power is limited.  But at the same time, I feel like I have unlimited resources.  Everything left over by the ones who came before me is at my disposal.

“Don't let humanity die.”

I blink.  I set the receiver down for a moment, and I turn off the music.  The radio crackles.

“Say that again?” I ask into the receiver.  My heart pumps faster.  

“I said, ‘don't let humanity die.’”  

Suddenly, I'm pulling my boots off the table and scrambling over the radio.  There's someone else.  Another person out there.  I've spent years wandering, doing my stupid radio show, pretending like someone else would hear me.  But I knew they never would.

“Who the hell are you and where are you located?” I demand.  I wait.  She has to say something to me.  Anything.

“I'm in Chicago.  Navy Pier.”

“Don't move.  Please.  I'll come find you.”

“I haven't moved in ages.  No risk of losing me.”

“I can make it there in less than an hour.”

I grab my worn-down sack and throw it over my shoulder.  The window is open.  I leave, snagging my jeans on some of the broken glass.  Just another hole.  Not a big deal.

The hike feels long, weighed down with anticipation.  I haven't interacted with anyone else in God knows how long.  How do I talk to her?  Is she going to be friendly, or am I going to have to fight for my life against a bandit?  My gun still works, and it's still loaded.  I don't want to have to kill the first person I've come across in what I think is six years.  But I will if I have to.

The boards of the Pier come into view.  They're still standing, despite the fact that the elements have been wearing on them for two centuries.  

As I get closer, I see a woman leaning on one of the rails.  My hand wraps around my gun.  I keep it at my side, trying not to seem like a threat.  

“Are you the woman I spoke to on the radio?” I call out, keeping my distance.  She looks up at me.  She doesn't look too old, her hair still brown.  It's long.  Incredibly long.  And it whips around in the breeze.

“DJ AJ?” she replies.

“That's me.”

“Couldn't come up with a better name?”

“AJ is my given name.”

She approaches me, hands in the air.  “I'm not trying to hurt you.  I need help.  I want someone to help me keep humanity alive.”

“I'm not letting go of my gun until I know I can trust you.”

“That's fair.”

We stop in front of each other.  I'm taller than her, but not by much.  

“My name is Molly,” she says.  “I've spent a lot of time searching for answers and solutions, just like you said you have.  Humanity was never supposed to die out.  They were trying to control the population, and things got out of hand.  We need to keep humanity alive.”

“But how?  Do you know any men?” I ask.  

“They kept sperm banks in a few places around the world, just as an insurance policy.  But the few I've found have long since unfrozen, every specimen long since dead.  I have some plans.  Having another woman beside me couldn't hurt.”

I consider it.  “What are your plans?”

“Staying on the move.  Searching for banks, labs, and other people.  Anything we can find to help us keep this race alive.  It doesn't have to end here, and I don't intend to let it.”

“But what if there was a real reason we were supposed to die out?”

“You don't believe that bullshit, do you?”

“I don't know what to believe.”

“Believe your instinct.  Your primal need to survive.  That's what this is all about.  Now, are you going to be part of what saves the human race, or are you going to go off on your own, living your life alone until you die?”

I shift my weight, looking out to the lake.  I've been searching.  I have.  But I have yet to find anything useful.  The sperm banks are gone.  Other people are gone.  Humanity has no hope left.

But I don't want to wander alone.

“All right.  I'm in.”",finallyinfinite

[WP] 105 years ago humankind decided to become extinct by not reproducing. You are the last human alive sitting in your home when suddenly you hear a voice of a young woman over your CB radio.,znous,"Man, I haven't cleaned the house in *months*. The dust was finally starting to get to me. Probably should have closed the window, but...I suppose we learn from our mistakes. 

*I* learn from my mistakes. Me. There was no longer a 'we'.

It had been the most complete reversal of evolution ever. My parents - God bless their memory - they remembered the hot, muggy summer's day, where the air was too thick to cut and the flies buzzed like fighter aircraft - and they remembered the instruction, coming through the radio:

*Attention - attention! This is your Father President speaking.*

Everyone in the household stiffened up. A message like this was unmissable.

*From this glorious day you shall not engage in sexual relations. It is forbidden by the word of God and the rules of man. Anyone caught engaging in sexual relations will be put to death, yea man and woman alike, and their bodies displayed publicly.*

There was a silence, and the air hung about the house like a giant pillow. Then the radio crackled one final time.

*And may God bless this great planet.*

The radio stopped. My parents - they were young then, they stared at each other, throughly unsure of what to say. One thing was for sure - all across the planet, the decree had the force of law, and there were people that didn't care. My parents were one such couple, but they also had the brains and luck to die of old age.

I was born some ten years after the law came into effect. The world was fast fading then. I'd have liked to say humanity didn't go down without a fight, but that would be a lie. Humanity seemed to be tired. Tired of all the wars, tired of the World Crusades, tired of the purges that came after, tired of everything - tired of having nothing.

So this was the world I inherited, way back when radios crackled with sound. Absent-mindedly, I reached for the radio on the table - the knobs were nearly rusted-firm - and I turned it on. There was only static. There was only silence.

---

Another memory.

*Did you know, the story of the universe?*

I had nodded ecstatically. ""God created the world in six days, and on the seventh-""

My father smiled with tired affection. ""On the seventh He rested. And that is the truth.""

I remember, watching him, watching as his smile twisted like he had swallowed the bitterest pill imaginable. Then he perked up again.

""It's not the whole truth, though.""

I looked at him sideways, like a kid before he knows how to ask a question. His eyes - they were black as the velvet night - I saw my own reflected there. 

""Would you like to hear it?""

""Hear...God creating the world?""

My father smiled. Turned the radio on. ""It's called the cosmic microwave background radiation,"" he whispered. ""That static - a part of that is light, light from Creation, from the word of Genesis - let there be light-""

""And there was light,"" I whispered.

And there was light. And there was sound. And there was static, and then silence. And then there were memories, past, present and future...

---

I hadn't heard a song come on the airwaves for years. 

So why did I turn the knob?

I didn't know, but it felt familiar. Like the way an old schoolbag cuts into your shoulders. Or the sound an old kettle makes when it was almost teatime. It felt old, and rusted, and good.

The static stopped.

Had the batteries run out?

I shook the radio a bit - 'percussive maintenance' - but there was nothing there. As I shook it I heard something else. Something so strange I considered I was mad.

""Hello?"" the radio had spoken back. ""Is anyone out there?

I froze.

""...help,"" the voice had trailed. It was that of a young woman, but all at once it was not - the voice had been so battered and broken and prematurely old you fancied no life was left. ""...help...""

""Where are you?"" I shouted back into the radio.

""...west side...""

And the radio clicked out. But I had heard enough. Carefully, I walked across to pick out the rifle. 

The house would have to wait. The world was not yet silenced - there was another.

[WP] 105 years ago humankind decided to become extinct by not reproducing. You are the last human alive sitting in your home when suddenly you hear a voice of a young woman over your CB radio.,znous,"As I shiver from the cold, I inspect the various cans I have saved up in my pantry. Great. None of them appear to be anything close to ""good"". ""Good"" meaning one of my favorites. Given that I tend to hate almost everything except canned fish (and even that is getting old at this point), I don't expect my meal each day to be something I look forwards to...

Still, I prefer eating to going hungry, so I grab the can opener, and open the can of ham. Looking for something else, I find a can of creamed corn. Eh, it'll do.

Putting my meal on a plate, I head towards the table and start eating, idly replacing the batteries in my radio along the way. The stupid thing is almost useless, but it's inherited uselessness-and at this point, I'll take anything a human has made that I actually remember. It's not like I have anything else...

As I eat my meal, while trying to actually, possibly ""enjoy"" it, my mind wanders off-off into the realms of the past, to how I wound up being the only person left.
***
I wasn't there to see any of this personally, of course. I was one of the last desperate attempts to save ourselves-put into cryogenic suspension, while the rest of the world waged war against our global enemy-[Dark Matter.](http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/kirby/images/6/6e/Darkmatter.PNG/revision/latest?cb=20160707021922&amp;path-prefix=en)

It was a futile war-or so I'm told. The old lady who used to own this house-and everything in it, bless her-told of those days with a shudder. Bombs, missiles, tanks, jets, even the newly created [HR-H robots](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/kirby/images/b/b6/Hrhalt.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20081130204939&amp;path-prefix=en) weren't enough to stop the horrors. The main problem was their ability to posses us-sure you could simply send them packing by knocking the victim out, but how could you know which of us was possessed at the time? Often, the only sure way was to check the victims eyes, and that had a devastating effect on commands, since one has to put their trust in their superior officers-but without eye contact, how could they? In the end, humanity agreed that these cursed monsters couldn't be allowed to use us by any means, and launched nukes at their greatest stronghold, saving the day-but at a cost.

The climate of our planet had dramatically taken a turn for the colder-much colder. Our planet was now [a veritable Popsicle,](http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/kirby/images/a/a2/Shiver_Star.png/revision/latest?cb=20090316172142&amp;path-prefix=en) flung into the grips of a nuclear winter. In addition, the authorities were adamant that this was for the better-we weren't sure, after all, if the Dark Matter was even really dead. Perhaps, they thought, we should insure that they cannot ever use us to take other worlds. And so, the decision to stop reproducing was made.

Around 80 years later, the old lady found my bunker. Everyone else in it had perished, and I very nearly had too-power had gone out from all pods except for mine, and mine just barely hanging on. Add another 25 years and, well, here we are today.
***
My mind is jolted out of reminiscence when I hear strange voices come over the radio. Probably just another traveler of the stars-with all the fresh water on our planet and not much in the way of defenses, it's a popular stop for those looking to resupply before continuing on their way.

""Hey Kirby, what do you think this does?"" asked a young, high-pitched voice. A fluttering of wings could faintly be heard as well.

""Poyo? Poy-uhm, dunno..."" replied a timid voice. It sounded as if this speaker wasn't really comfortable talking in English.

""Oh! You have something like that at your castle, right, my king?"" came a third exuberant voice.

""Erm...oh yeah! It looks like a radio! I think Meta Knight has something like that aboard that there ship of his, the Halberd!"" proclaimed a deeper voice, sounding for all in the world like he had a Southern accent-or the equivalent of one at least. The four speakers all had some sort of inhuman qualities to their voices-even if they spoke English, the various tones and inflections in their voices weren't things you would normally associate with a humans. But as for the last voice...

""Looks pretty cool though. I wonder who made it?"" At this, I let out a gasp-it was DEFINITELY a [human girl's](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/kirby/images/e/e5/Adeleine.png/revision/latest?cb=20110412081240&amp;path-prefix=en) voice coming through there!

On the other end, there was a silence, and then: ""Did you guys hear that gasp that came from this thing?""

Hurriedly, I picked up the microphone and asked ""Who are you guys? Where are you? What-,""

""Woah woah woah! Calm down buddy! Just tell us where you are, and we'll come over!""

I tried to tell them directions, but, but, I didn't have any memory of where exactly this house was, or where any landmarks were, or anything to help them find me! In the end, they said that they were pretty busy and had to get going, but they would come back and try to find me.

And so now that leaves me here. Alone.

Waiting, for someone...someone who I didn't even see the eyes of...

I think I'll check to see if I have any blunt objects to defend myself from whomever may be coming to find me. I, I just don't...

I just don't want to take that risk...

Please be fine...",Fragmentary_Remains
[WP] 105 years ago humankind decided to become extinct by not reproducing. You are the last human alive sitting in your home when suddenly you hear a voice of a young woman over your CB radio.,znous,"I come from a long line of rebels, stretching back generations. Grandpa never took kindly to authority figures telling him what to do, and refused to be chipped even when that meant losing his job and being unable to go to stores without facing arrest. As a big F-U to the government, he moved up here to the mountains to live off the land instead. Internet and phones required a chip to use, so they just did without. And when he and Grandma had kids, they were born here in the cabin instead of in one of the hospitals in town. No chips, no registration, no records. Dad then carried on the same family values; he met Mom through a group of like-minded resistors who were never registered, and they had me in secret.

I was only six when the Evacuation Act was passed. After so much harm to the environment, people realized that some things just can’t be fixed with more technology. The entire planet was turned into one big park, and everyone else evacuated off-world. Being cut off from the rest of society, we only learned about it when the government started broadcasting warnings on old CB radios, telling us to report to the nearest spaceport for reassignment. Well, Dad followed those orders just about as much as Grandpa had done in the past; I was just lucky that he never smashed that old radio receiver.

The flyovers started when I was eight or so. We’d have to dash out of the cabin and jump into the lake, even in the dead of winter. Dad said the drones use thermal imaging, so they can’t see us under the cold water. I started sleeping in a wetsuit, and Dad rigged up some big straws on the dock for us to breathe through.

But by the time I was eleven or twelve, the flyovers became less and less frequent until they finally stopped. *All* air traffic stopped, actually: no more sonic booms from planes soaring overhead, and no more streaks in the sky from the orbital jumpers leaving spaceports. Even the CB radio fell silent; no more government broadcasts warning us to leave the planet, and one by one the other resistor families fell silent too.

Dad passed on when I was about 15; some kind of infection that didn’t respond to our home-grown penicillin. It was bound to happen eventually, and he’d raised me up right to take care of myself. I buried him on the shore of the lake next to Grandma and Grandpa, and next to the mother I’d never really known. And that was it: just like that, I was alone. 

Despite Dad’s warnings, I did search for others. After making sure that my traps were set, the fishing nets were out, and the crops were attended, I had some free time on summer. So I decided to go into town. I wasn’t going to get caught: living out here and hunting for one’s supper makes one pretty adept at staying hidden. I just had to see this town for my own two eyes. Just to see if they really were gone. I stopped on the outskirts and observed the gleaming towers and wide paved streets, but there was nothing moving. Everything was dead quiet; completely deserted. Maybe the radio broadcasts had been right: maybe everyone was gone.

Summers went and winters came, and life carried on. I kept the radio on, waiting for some signal. Maybe one of the other resistor families was still out there. Maybe they were afraid to broadcast because of the flyovers. So every night, I sat by my fire and just talked for hours on end. I talked until my throat was hoarse. I *begged* them to respond. To do *anything* to indicate that maybe they were still out there. And just when I thought I couldn’t take it anymore…

“Hello?” A voice crackled through the speakers. “Hello, can you hear me?” the voice was soft, in a way that I’d only heard on Dad’s old recordings: a woman’s voice. 

I threw myself across the cabin and lunged for the mic. “I’m here!” I shouted, mashing the broadcast button. “Hello? Hello?! I’m here!” I hadn’t realized just how much I *needed* to hear another human speak. It had been near 4 years now since Dad’s passing, and I hadn’t seen another soul since then. 

“Oh god, are you real?” she asked back, ending the broadcast with a sob.

“Yes. Yes, I’m real.” I didn’t even know how to describe the sheer relief I was feeling now.

“I’ve been looking for so long!” Her voice was like a song. “Where are you? I just… I need to see you for myself.”

My mind stretched back to the abandoned town, miles and miles away. There was a big green sign near the road that said the name. “I’m near Reno,” I told her. “In Nevada.”

There was a long pause. The radio crackled with static, teasing me. *Was she not real? Was it all my imagination? Had I finally snapped?* Then her voice came back through the speakers. “I can be there in 3 hours,” she said. “Look for me in the center of town.”

---

I picked flowers for her. I’m not sure why; Dad had once told me that he’d given Mom flowers on the day they met, and that she’d love it. We used to pick them together to put on her grave, too. I guess women liked flowers. 

I stood in a windswept intersection of two broad streets. I wasn’t sure where exactly the ‘center’ of town was, but this section had the biggest buildings. And I was the only one here.

“Hello?!” I called. My voice echoed through the canyons of glass and steel until it was carried away by the wind. But I had to keep calling, or she wouldn’t be able to find me. 

The streets were filled with a sudden roar, like a pounding storm. It seemed to come from every direction at once; from the buildings themselves. Then a bright light snapped on overhead, and I had just enough time to look up and identify the glowing engines of one of the government ships. Then electricity jolted through my body, leaving my convulsing on the rough black asphalt. 

“Got one poacher in the honey pot,” a voice said. The shock had taken me out of it so much I didn’t even realize that men in black uniforms had appeared next to me. 

“Where is she?” I managed to croak. I realized that I hadn’t even learned her name. Hopefully she saw the ship and ran, like Dad had trained me to do.

“Confirmed,” the voice said, ignoring my question. “Taking him up now.” A harness was strapped to my chest, and we began to rise toward the ship

“Where is she?!” I shouted at the men hanging in the air next to me. “WHERE IS SHE?”

One of them laughed and removed part of the black mask he wore over his face. “There never was a ‘she,’” he told me.

[WP] 105 years ago humankind decided to become extinct by not reproducing. You are the last human alive sitting in your home when suddenly you hear a voice of a young woman over your CB radio.,znous,"I was the product of the law being broken. From the moment I was born,  I was kept secret. My dad told me that a group of people had agreed that we had destroyed earth and needed to die off as a species and when the planet ""fixed itself"" evolution would once again bring humans back to try again. Everyone had a close eye kept on them to make sure no one would have kids.

My mom and dad were politicians who apparently we're high up enough to get their privacy and they broke the law and made me, that was about ninety years into the law being made. I was always being moved around and hidden so that no one would find out but the world leaders found out about me and burned the house we were staying in at the time,  I had been sneaking out and drinking so I was saved by my own stupidity.

Soon after that lovely incident, a war broke out  about the law all over the world and everyone killed each other with nukes, leaving nothing but a few older humans on the planet, who I suspect died off a year ago. 

As of now,  I'm just surviving until one day I fall over and die. I sat by the fire,  my hands were freezing from being outside chopping at wood too long. I looked over at said wood,  only enough to last for a couple of months and this winter would last around four or five months itself. Once the fire ran out, my food that needed to be cooked would be useless. I stood up and snuffed out the flames to save what wood I could,  I hadn't even finished when a voice came over the radio and not just any voice,  a woman's voice.

""Hello?  Is anyone out there? My name is Jessica and I'm looking for any signs of civilization out there. "" Her voice seemed to be made of silk and reminded me a lot of my mother when she was younger.  I slowly moved my hand forward to grab the thing I needed to talk into, dad never told me what it was called,  just how to use it.  ""Hello Jessica, my name is William and you have found what I thought was the last human on earth but obviously I've been wrong. Where are you? "" I tried to keep it smooth,  after all this time of being alone,  I had someone out there that I could talk to and get to know,  it gave me a slight feeling of hope I hadn't felt in a long time. 

For about thirty of forty seconds,  there was no reply and then her voice came back on,  ""Oh thank god.  I've been so lonely and I thought since I had the extra batteries I would try to see who was out there.  As for my location, I'm a few miles away from the big city,  just surviving off whatever I find in the  small town around me. "" It sounds like she had been crying during that off time but I couldn't be sure. 

We spent the next thirty minutes talking about anything we could think of which ended up being a lot before Jessica, or as I call her now Jess broke the random subjects, ""We should meet up like right now. I can meet you in the big city wherever you want, I just need to see your face as soon as possible."" I thought about it before responding, ""Meet me at the Greenwood apartments, near the edge of town,  apartment B1."" It had been one of the places my parents had hidden me when I was too little to understand the why yet and it just seemed like an appropriate place to meet this girl. 

""Sounds good,  I'll see you when I get there. "" She replied. Nothing else came after that but I brought packed myself a bag of essential food and water,  also the radio,  after that I zipped up my bag,  put my heaviest coat on and made my way towards the old apartments. 

I hope you enjoyed this response and I might do a part two of people are interested.

Science log 2533.15.23.2256:13 the final log.

The year is 2533, I am a scientist at the Western university of advancement of society and restoration of all things. I have dedicated my life to the study of our species and the interaction they have with the universe. It has been almost 500 years since we landed on mars and almost 250 years since our species moved there. Yet some have stayed behind to study, heal our planet from the damage and pain we have caused it. And lucky we did, in year 2476, humans created a terrible weapon, a weapon far more devastating than you can imagine. But before I tell you about this weapon, I think it is important to let you know how science has advanced and how we got to where we are today. You see, as I am sitting here in my lavatory all alone, I can’t help but reminiscent about how far society has come, and fallen. In the year 2175, we discovered an amazing scientific breakthrough in gene allocation, mutation, and rejuvenation. This allowed humans to live a lot longer. I was born myself in 2236, who knows how old that makes me, and even with memory chips that store information to access later, I feel it may be wearing out. Memory chips, yes those are a thing now. They are implanted into your brain to increase functionality and allow faster and greater access to data. We discovered in the early 200’s that our brains could be programmed to work faster and smarter for it was just a complex computer. We finally had breakthrough in tapping into our potential, and then expanding it. Everyone started getting “chipped” at birth in 2312. Luckily the rejuvenation breakthrough happened in 2175, I could live really long. The only thing we were missing is how to restore the brain, but also make it so it works less and doesn’t grow old so quickly. Even though I was 76, I looked and feel no older than 32 and even to this day I look about 35 though wisdom acquired through the years cannot comprehend age to say. But I digress, I was chipped for increase capacity early and I have had many upgrades since then, but since I was one who chose to stay on Earth we didn’t upgrade as fast since we had to go to Mars to do so. And they rarely made trips to Earth. Politically we were despised. Why not come to our new home? Isn’t Earth just a waste bucket? We can terraform our own world now why should you care? Well, it is hard to say, but it seems so, fake. There is something surreal and spiritual about Earth. And logically as a scientist I shouldn’t believe in all of this, but I just can’t help but feel different here. Even though we create life, it seems lifeless. Yet here, even the life that is dying seems more alive than what we “create” maybe there is a creator and in our conquest to be like him we remove the very life we seek to produce. By the year 2400 everyone is perfect, perfect health, perfect bodies. No one gives birth anymore, everyone is created. And not even from their own eggs or seaman. It is all artificial. It has caused me some severe pain as I don’t know what to believe anymore. It was the most controversial procedure of the century yet in 2450 it was widely adopted and legalized. No one cared anymore, but I did. That is why we stayed on Earth, to make it new again, to undo the damage that society has done but in a way that is natural that doesn’t defy the very moral laws of nature. Yet alas, has it been for naught? As I mentioned early in this log, in the year 2476 a new weapon was formed. We already had nuclear fission and unlimited energy, yet a new power source was made that uses dark matter. And some soul decided to make a dark matter bomb. This bomb was sent to the core of mars. And what happened next was terrifying, there was no warning, it went off and became a black hole. It imploded all of mars, and all of civilization was lost. Only the few hundred that were left on Earth survived. The planet was in disarray from the effects of a planet leaving the solar system. Oceans rose and other fell, land masses shifted, it was like the apocalypse. 20 years and most of our food supply was used. Temporal machines that were supposed to work didn’t. But one did. We made a tracking system of all people. Since everyone is chipped they send off a signal that can be quantum tracked. There was a few hundred left and over the years we saw the number drop slowly. In 2520 the number was at 5. 5 humans left in the world.  Jasper and Meagan were the only couple left and we were trying to produce life, the right way. But they were all a few hundred years old and eggs stop being produced after the age of 60 average. No matter what we tried we could not get Meagan to produce more eggs. And not having access to the same technology that existed on mars, we could not keep up with mother nature and they one by one succumbed to either disease or accidents. Like the Charleston university. It was hit by a giant meteor and wiped out all of the scientists and equipment they had. Such a happenchance that seemed very unrealistic. But, I have changed my perspective on what is real and not after mars imploded. S0 many things have changed since then. In 2528 the counter reached 1…and I knew I was the only one left.


Josua sat at his holocrafter note and contemplated how to end his log. His phaser on his bedside and tears in his eyes. He was done, this would be the last log he would ever write. He has been alone too long and he started seeing things and his mind would wander so very far. 
He settled on the last sentence and looked one more time at his CB radio. After all the technology that existed it was this old radio technology that brought him comfort. He would talk endless hours into the far reaches of the earth to ease his mind. He would pretend he was a talk host and tell stories of old of the better years and how human we used to be and if only things where as they were before. Sometimes he would weep, sometimes he would laugh at his own comedy show. Clearly he was going insane. But alas tonight he was skipping his shows and his routine, no one was listening anyways. 


Taking the phaser in his hands he looked sadly at it, but not really at it but past it. Memories were streaming through his mind. After Jasper died only Meagan and Joshua were left. Jasper died in 2525. This gave Joshua 3 years left with her and they succumbed to each other in relations to ease their hurting hearts. Were they really the only two people left? And Joshua hoped that maybe she would magically start producing eggs again…maybe…maybe humanity still has a chance? But alas, Joshua watched Meagan die horrifically. She tripped and fell down a hill side and was impaled by a broken pipe. Joshua ran after her and saw the life leave her eyes. This may have drove Joshua’s insanity to broadcast on the radio every night for the past 5 years. He even prayed, a scientist, yet, would a creator hear him if all that is left is him? 


“Hmmph,” Joshua said.


“I guess it is time, like I promised myself, I will take my life, let this be my bitter end.”


He held up the phaser to his heart. Sure It would be a slower death, but he wanted to destroy the pain entirely. Call him a superstitious scientist, but he would have his way.


He looked at the counter one and stared at it as he shot the phaser. Immense pain entered erupted all over his body and he fell to the ground still looking at the counter. It showed 2…and a voice came across the radio.


“Hello? Is anyone here? I heard a man’s radio broadcast and I am searching for someone else. I don’t want to be alone anymore! I just landed on earth. I’ve been tracking this broadcast for years, please tell me your still here…please. I am so alone…” You could hear sobbing on the radio that echoed the lab.


Joshua let out a laugh, was fate this cruel…the life in his eyes faded away. The counter changed to 1.

[WP] 105 years ago humankind decided to become extinct by not reproducing. You are the last human alive sitting in your home when suddenly you hear a voice of a young woman over your CB radio.,znous,"I looked up at the sky as I walked down the road towards the edge of town, flurries gently came down from the sky. It was a twenty minute walk to Greenwood apartments but if I kept myself running or even jogging,  I could cut that time down by about five or six minutes. As I walked, memories of my time at Greenwood began to fill my head.

I was about six years old at the time and I remember being upset and crying because for the third or fourth time in my life,  we were packing up and moving to a new house.  Before I found out it was because I was illegal, my parents told me that their work demand them to travel around a lot.  I shook my head out of the thought and looked around,  I was almost there.  Did I spent over half the trip thinking about that night?  Apparently so. 

The other half was spent hyping up finally meeting Jess even though I had only talked to her for a little over thirty minutes,  it was the first human contact I've had in a couple of years. The apartments were just up ahead and I could barely contain my excitement, I broke into a run and didn't stop until I was at apartment B1, the door was unlocked when I went to open the door. I rushed in and looked around the rooms for Jess but then remembered that she was farther away than I.

I began to cook packets of mashed potatoes and macaroni and cheese. I was just about done with the meal when I heard the front door open and Jessica's voice call out,  ""Will,  are you in here or should be worried about who's cooking?"" I smiled to her voice which some how sounded even better in person than it did on the radio. I rushed in to meet the woman who I had been talking to. 

She had a perfect shade of red hair that went down a little bit past her shoulders and piercing ocean blue eyes that seemed to stare past my green eyes and into my very soul. She was dressed in tight Blue Jeans and I didn't know what was on her top except for that brown jacket. She flashed a smile after a few seconds which made me feel weak, we both stood there for a few seconds do before she broke the silence,  ""So,  are you going to let your meal burn or are we gonna eat it before that? "" Her words snapped me back into reality and I went to save the food before it did burn,  could macaroni burn? Probably not but I tried to make sure it didn't  happen if it could.  The meal wasn't like life before the war but Jess seemed to enjoy it and a few hours of talking definitely was nice for me. 

""So you look to be about my age,  I told you my parents were politicians and thus had the time and privacy to make me but I'm curious as to how your parent had the time to make you. "" Jess seemed to tense up but whispered just loud enough for me to hear,  ""My dad had been in the military and my mom was part of the black market. "" I nodded with understanding,  the black market was created as I was taught,  just a decade after humanity tried to stop reproducing, filled with prostitutes. They were illegal due to the law which made them particularly hard to find and expensive when you did find one.  Jess sighed,  ""Never met my mom and dad was killed when I was fifteen. I can only assume my mom was kills when the bombs hit but I have  no clue where to loo for her so I didn't look for her. "" I leaned forward and took Jess' hand,  ""Well, I'm sorry it happened to you and I hope that you never lose anyone close to you again. "" Jess nodded and got up,  putting her dish in the sink and asking towards one of the bedroom doors,  ""I don't know about you but I'm going to sleep and I'd like to sleep alone tonight. Goodnight Will. "" That was the last I heard from her before the bedroom door closed.  I finished my meal, cleaned up the dishes and decided to crash on the couch tonight.  I laid my head back,  closed my eyes and let sleep take me over. 

Sorry it took so long for part two, response got closed out twice making me start over.  Once again I hoped you enjoyed this writing and once again will continue if interest shown.",Thatguyyouseemtohate

I can't take any more of my cooking teacher.  Her voice quavers and wobbles in a disturbingly cheerful manner, and she keeps insisting that I should be using more butter.  She dropped the chicken on the floor today, and she assured us all that it's fine, you're alone in the kitchen while you're cooking.  I know that, but it's still disgusting.  She hasn't bothered to mention how to catch or butcher the chicken yet, and I've been taking her course for a month. 

It's Friday though, fun day!  I put on America's funniest home videos, grab the vodka and the spam, and settle down to relax.

The radio pipes up.  It's been making the oddest noises lately.  I probably should have sorted out why on Wednesday, but that's rat day.  Thursday was weeding day, so that's no good.  Fridays have been so packed lately...  Anyway, TGIF!",Joy2b

[WP] 105 years ago humankind decided to become extinct by not reproducing. You are the last human alive sitting in your home when suddenly you hear a voice of a young woman over your CB radio.,znous,"I stared at the horizon. Must have stared at it for thousands of hours. There's not much to do when you're the last human on Earth.

Empty and abandoned boats littered the coast, unmoving and lifeless. Artifacts of another time. A time when there was laughter, anger and a whole range of emotions. Now, all I feel is emptiness. The buzzing of the radio is the only anchor I have to reality. Without it, I'm afraid I'll slip off into the abyss and the last sparks of a once mighty flame will flicker into nothing.

When I'm not staring into the beyond, I devote my time to preserving what I can of what Humanity used to be. I found an old museum that i refurnished into a fully-sheltered fortress that could endure anything that was thrown at it. Inside, I write thousands of letters, penning down the avhievements and teachings of Human kind. I also write of our countless mistakes. Hopefully, those who come after us will find it, and not make the same mistakes as us.

When I first entered the old Museum, I found an older era Cryostasis Pod, a display model that somehow still functioned. I have contemplated using it, many times in fact. Yet, I always come to the same conclusion. There is no more future for me.

That was what I used to believe. 3 Years after I became the last person on Earth, my radio picked up a signal. Over it came a strange sound, something that used to be so familiar. It was speech. With nobody to talk to, speaking was not something that I often did. But what that women said, I clearly understood.

""20 years. That is the time before the explorer ship The Silver Spoon reaches Earth. Attempts to contact any Government body has failed. As Captaian of the ship, I request anyone who can hear this to contact me, no matter how long it takes, or how difficult. Please, tell us that we're not alone.""

I could only smile. Maybe I had a use for the cryostasis pod after all.",WinterExez
"[WP] It's the year 3033, 1,000 years after humans set foot on mars. Mars is now fully modernized and tensions between the Martians and the Earthlings have just tipped past their boiling point...",703DMV,"His olive green uniform clashed against the sea of dark blue and black business suits. He felt very much out of place but somehow that made the most sense. The room was filled with the din of a hundred conversations all taking place in a hundred different languages. Occasionally a sideways glance would find its way to him. The chairs were comfortable, at least, he reasoned. His own expressionless gaze carried his view up to the centerpiece of the room, the vast insignia that adorned the entire wall of the auditorium. The view of Earth from the North Pole and the various nations of the planet. It was the old map from the founding of the United Nations, a symbol with a checkered past. It didn't show the new coastlines along Africa from the rising tides or the receded South Pole territories. The map couldn't show the terrible and bleak expanses that slashed the Eurasian continents or the smothering clouds that blacked out Asiatic skies.

Like so much of this hallowed chamber, it was all a glossy show of power for an old and decrepit command. He rolled his shoulders back and felt the joints crackle under the different gravity of Earth. It took a profound effort of self control not to check that his buttons were fastened. The bright silver buttons glinting in contrast to his green uniform. The President of the Hall took his position at the center podium and the room settled into order. As everyone else in the room placed a set of headphones neatly over their heads, so too did he.

A polite voice spoke in Martian, ""Hello, honorable Chairman, I will be your translator, can you understand me? Please press the green button behind your National Plaque and hold it while you speak to respond.""

His lips curled back into a barely controlled grin. The boy's Martian was oozing with Hindi accents. No matter, today's conversation would be a short one. He depressed the button and replied in clear American English, ""Yes, thank you, I should be fine.""

Everyone around the room seemed to be enduring the same checklist of communication settings. Hands rhythmically touched the green buttons and hushed voices replied. Eventually every nation's plaque glowed a steady and expectant gold. The president of the hall gestured toward the Martian Delegation and spoke in Common English, his own Mandarin accent giving a strange melody to the words.

""Joining us in this time of great diplomacy is the honorable Chairman Naranbaatar, representing the Republic of Martian Federations. Mr. Chairman, you have the floor.""

He pushed his olive-drab sleeve back up over his watch and spied the time. It was two minutes earlier than intended. *No matter*, he thought, *beurocrats are allowed to be early, the revolution will simply start sooner by a few seconds.*

As Chairman Naranbaatar rose to address the leaders of Earth, starships hidden on the dark side of the moon shuttled into position. Clumsily produced spacecraft, retrofitted for war lurched in orbit around opposing craft. On Mars, men and women in olive-drab uniforms burst out from hiding places around the various colonial city streets. A vast, brief, and terrible violence began the moment Naranbaatar spoke. There would be no war, there would be no diplomatic answer.

There would be a quickly gained truce, or there would be nothing.

An entire planet of fucking ghosts.",Telamo,"No-one knew for sure why there were so many ghosts, nor had it been predicted. It was theorised with a certain irony that while a soul would usually disperse or decay on its own in a short time, enough together would feed off each other. That is to say, once the number of recently-dead souls reached critical mass, there would be a self-sustaining chain reaction. And it had really got out of hand.

We had imagined it would be quiet after the surface had been scoured by nuclear fire, cities turned to ash which darkened the sky but no. 3 months on it is louder than ever: the air is filled with moans and groans, shrieks and cries, slapping and flapping, shouts and whispers.

You see: ghosts can't die. Nor could they be contained. They did not fear death, nor hell, nor prison. Yet they are still human. There are no rules and no way to enforce them. Old scores would be settled by fighting but these fights had no clear end. Most ghosts weren't like that though, most seemed to be lovers rather than fighters, and loud ones at that. Once it was discovered that you can't have ghost babies they seemed to spend most of their time fucking. And why not? No need to eat, no way to interact with the world and only a few families left to haunt.

Once a beautiful abundance of wasteful and misguided and somewhat jaded society that had done many great things while ignoring its major flaws. The man flicked the ashes of his cigarette away while looking out over the skyline. He could see where the atomic bombshell had hit right on the New York skyline leaving behind a massive crater that was gathering rain water. He looked down from his perch on top of the humongous tower. Only the T remained of the icon, the other 4 letters had fallen off and shattered on the cracked pavement long ago. His son, his world and his last reminder of the old world was sleeping behind him on oily cardboard. His world was motionless. Or it would be, if it wasn't for all of the ghost engaged in the activity that had created them. The purpose of life was to create more of itself.  And god forbid you enjoyed it. When the true apocalypse came it was not a god in the form of a person who chose who lived and died, but the science itself of creating a new thing by combining two other things that existed in all of us. He looked out onto 5th avenue below. Two ghosts were engaged in the act of creating a baby ghost. The man looked onward, sipping his bottle of amber liquor. The sun peaked over the buildings in the east. He unzipped his pants and relieved himself. He watched the two ghosts going at it, silent thrusts after thrust. As it turns out, only the people who were fucking when the apocalypse happened would survive it as ghost. The rest were doomed to do the same thing they had been doing when they died:  not living. The only verse he remembered from his bible he had used for kindling long ago was Corinthians 3:19 ""for dust you are and unto dust you shall return."" He looked at the building across the street. More apartment homes, more broken mossy windows full of fucking ghosts. White bodies humping each other senselessly and endlessly. As far as he knew he half of the last surviving human population on the planet. The sparked his lighter and lit another, the sound woke the boy. The boy woke up, rubbed his eyes and walked over to stand by the man and enjoy the sunrise. The silence engulfed them, like footsteps and a flag planted on a surface never to be visited again. The man moved his dog tags out of the way and scratched his chest. 
He had been a general. A 4 star. Straight up through the ranks and into the Oval Office when the news was given; either give in or give up. He spat on the road, his spittle landing on the result of his proud country's stubbornness. When the radio broadcast came in, he had a choice: join the other stars and Oval Office staff at mount Vernon, or wait it out in his cabin with his pregnant wife in Maine. Normally his wise eyes and bald head and uniform would take over and tell him to save himself, that only he and his staff could possibly help to save the country after riding it out, his wife and unborn son would be among millions to die,  but if he could outlive it he could bring prosperity and help his country climb back from the ashes. Why he chose to go to his sure death and hug his wife while their house shook and watches the flashes out the window he would never know. After the chaos settled they discovered they were the only ones alive, a triad of hopeless nomadics. Losing her to childbirth was hard, but every day he had learned to do away with his larger goal mindset. His cheap printed metal necklace was the only thing that reminded him of his win at all costs attitude. He lived life day by day, second by second.  He had been forced to learn how to appreciate the little things. The sun scoured moisture out of his eyes as he scooped up his teenage son in a giant bear hug. They were each the others world entire; and they had learned to find humor in the small items they witnessed.  The myriad of white beings taking up the isles of stores, streets, sidewalks and rooftops with their endless fucking used to be awkward but was now somehow fascinating to watch. These ghosts who were once people had found life in the smallest of moments just like how he had learned to do, and that was was had allowed them to live on.

"[WP] Due to your careful planning, your family has successfully survived the nuclear apocalypse. There's just one thing you didn't prepare for. Ghosts. An entire planet of fucking ghosts.",Telamo,"We waited for the 20 inch steel door to slide open and reveal the new world to us. I stood by my sister as the blinding light broke through inch by inch, and was forced to cover my eyes. After what seemed like an eternity, the high-pitched wine of the moving mechanisms and beeps subsided and left us to view a bright, vivid world- glassed over from what it once was.

Buildings broken and charred, trees reduced to stumps and dead, not even to mention the many crispy skeletons that laid at the entrance of our bunker.. These are the things we beheld in our new world. Although, something I noticed was off.


I heard moans coming from the distance. Over the hill, and it was near the graveyard. It didn't take much convincing for my family and I to go check out the hearth of the noises.

The moans intensified with each step we took, and once we reached the top of the hill, we were stunned to see the revelation that our family beheld.

There were two *ghosts* in the graveyard, engaging in unsavory doggy-style intercourse. Their moans reached a peak as they too accomplished their dirty deed. Immediately after their climax, a round two ensued. The ghosts paid no mind to us.

My mother was the first one to panic and run off in fear. My father followed suit, as well as my sister and I. We were able to catch up with her a few feet from a crater. Lo and behold, we found *three* ghosts this time, engaging in a somewhat bold three-way.

""I suppose without bodies you don't have much holding you back,"" my dad said.

""What's happening?"" I asked.

""Well son, it seems we not only escaped this apocalypse- we landed ourselves in a world full of ghosts."" I gasped in horror.

He put his hand on my shoulder before continuing. ""And not just any ghosts either- they're *fucking* ghosts!"" 

I screamed in fear as I woke up, cold sweat beaded my forehead as I checked the time on my phone. All was well in the world, with the exception of my sister still being alive.

You'd think maybe ghosts won't be that bad, it's not like you suddenly obtain infinite patience as a ghost, and I guess if I ever thought about it before, I'd probably think ghosts would have other stuff on their mind, maybe explore the innards of the earth, albeit in complete darkness. 

And when I did think about it, I kinda figured they'd have some tenuous relation to the laws of physics, and maybe a whole bunch would get ejected from the relative area of the Earth, and doom themselves to soaring through the infinite abyss of space-but no. Wishful thinking on my part. 

You, you try to explain to an 11 year old that the sexual acts that heavenly host is performing in front of you are NOT expressions of an earthly love, and may not even be possible without at least some of the participants asphyxiating. 

Or try sleeping when all you can hear are the moist ectoplasmic moans of a convent of nuns exploring their newly liberated clitori. 

Don't get me started on the god damned priests, who, by their post-life predilections, weren't exactly god-blessed, though there are a few who are god-gifted; mores the pity.

But overall it's the ghosts who had the fetish of being watched that are the true bastards. It seems like I haven't gone a nap without opening my eyes to some ghost's stretched out asshole, screaming in a way that you realize only a ghost's asshole possibly could, accompanied by the throaty chuckles of the sick fucks getting off on my observation. My very unwilling observation, my fucking forced observation.


And try making love, or even getting a quick nut, with several hundred octagenarian genitals flapping in the constant breeze that seems to blow on their plane; oh but the sound is for everyone, even if we can't feel the breeze. 

For better or for worse, we've started searching for some way to control these bastards, or at least banish them. For the sake of our children, if not for our own libidos.

An entire planet of fucking ghosts.",Telamo,"I thought I had made it.  I really, really thought I had made it.  I saw the flash, and closed my eyes (like that would accomplish anything) just feet from the bunker's door.  When I opened my eyes though, I saw the burnt-on shadow on the shut door.  If I had had ten more seconds, just ten, I could have unlocked and opened it, gotten inside, and slammed it shut before that first wave of heat and radiation got me.  That was my first thought after opening my eyes.

My second thought was, ""What eyes?""  I was standing there, staring at the door, at the shadow, and I couldn't figure out how I was looking at *any* of it when I was obviously dead.  I *felt* that blast of heat, if only for a fraction of a second before I must have turned into a puff of vapor.  I put my hands on my forehead .... My hands!  I could see through my hands!  Remember that scene in ""Back to the Future"" when Michael J. Fox starts to fade out during the dance?  It was kind of like that.  Half there, half .... not.

I had no idea what it meant.  I didn't feel any different from before.  I wasn't afraid.  In fact, I didn't really feel much of *anything.*  Was I in shock?  I sat down with my back to the bunker door to take a moment and think.  The door almost felt soft, like sitting against a pillow.  It was nice.  For a moment.  Then I felt a weird, sort of cold shiver, as the door kept getting ""softer.""  I was slowly sinking back into the door as I leaned against it.  

I quickly tried to stand up.  It felt odd, a sucking sensation, or maybe something like velcro.  It wasn't difficult, just... odd.

""Am I a fucking ghost?"" I thought to myself.  ""I'm transparent, I'm slipping through solid objects, oh, and I'm pretty clearly ***fucking dead***...""  I guess I was a ghost I guess.  O boy. 

I think I must have freaked out a little bit, because I'm not quite sure what the next few minutes entailed.  Mostly me lying on the ground staring at nothing, or maybe fruitlessly throwing a tantrum.  However, when I was done with whatever trauma I had inflicted on myself, I felt a little better.  ""Well, I feel better, so I'm feeling something, I guess that's good.""

Then, suddenly it came to me.  My family!  The door had been shut and locked, so they should be inside!  I ran to the door and pressed my hands against it.  Ghost super-powers, activate!  It took a minute or so, and there's no way I can adequately describe what it felt like, but I did make my way through the heavily-reinforced door onto the stairs behind.  The lights were on inside!  I ran down the stairs to the set of rooms I had dug out and reinforced, back when it seemed pretty obvious things were going to go to shit.

Sitting there on the couch in the main room was my family, and they were fine! ""Emily!"" I yelled to my wife, running towards her... and partially through her.  She didn't flinch.  She hadn't heard me.  She couldn't feel me, and I couldn't touch her.  Apparently the living are less ""solid"" to a ghost than inanimate objects.  When I turned to my son, Jeff, and tried to hug him, it was like grabbing cotton candy.  I whiffed right through him.  Same with my daughter.  

I stepped back.  All three of them were staring at nothing, likely in shock.  ""I'm so sorry.  I thought I could make it.""  I knelt down on the floor in front of them.  I waved my hands around, yelled, tried picking something up.  Nothing worked.  I was a ghost but I couldn't interact with them.  

I don't have a heart anymore, but that's when my wife said a thing that would have frozen it.  ""Jeff, hon, Danielle... are you *sure* daddy didn't tell you the door lock code?""  They both shook their heads.  ""Mommy, you don't know it?"" Danielle asked.  ""No.  I don't think daddy ever expected he wouldn't be here with us...""

I was so fucking stupid.

"[WP] Due to your careful planning, your family has successfully survived the nuclear apocalypse. There's just one thing you didn't prepare for. Ghosts. An entire planet of fucking ghosts.",Telamo,"I have lived with the bodies of my dead wife and infant son for two months now. Although I have done my best to keep the smell of their corpses from overwhelming the bunker, I realize now that the time has come to say my final goodbye to the flesh I once covered in kisses. I can hear Lily softly weeping as I retrieve the blanket-bundled bodies from the furthest back room. I know she cannot bear to witness her own bones being buried, so I am not surprised when her spirit dissipates to leave me in silent agony. I wonder, as I have a thousand times over, if our son has crossed over ""the rainbow bridge,"" as my wife often called it, when one of our beloved pets died. Since their deaths, my wife's ghost has returned, but we have heard not even a peep from our 18 month old. After getting over the initial shock and denial of my wife's appearance, she'd begged that I wrap them together so that our son would not be alone even in death. I don my hazard suit and gas mask before heaving the bundle over my shoulder and grasping my rifle. I know it is useless looking for Lilly, but I silently pray the undead bastards normally lurking outside the door are not there today. I need peace to bury the bodies.  
My prayer goes unanswered, as all of them have for the last six months. If there were ever a God, he must have died with the rest of humanity. Hollywood movies always suggest that zombies arise because of some nefarious laboratory of scientists, but no one truly knows why they exist. What I know, though, is that they are worse than what Hollywood could conjure up. They are rotting, true, but that isn't the worst part. So many of animated remains still contain the spirits of the deceased. My wife was one of these trapped souls for the first month of her return. While her flesh was stone cold and sickly pale, she'd chatted cheerily before realizing she'd been dead for days. It wasn't until the rot set in that she began to realize her situation, and it finally occurred to her that our son hadn't cooed or cried in his crib. After failing to rouse him, she'd let out a bloodcurdling scream, and her spirit shot out of her skin, but her body remained stumbling about the bunker. Even as I attempt to bury it now, her body twitches and squirms in the blanket tightly wrapped around it. I fight another urge to vomit. ",UnjustlyIllterate

It was late spring of 218, eighteen years after Bronzekill's founding and nearing two years after its depopulation. 

It had seemed like such a good plan at the time. The fortress was slowing to a crawl, overpopulation reducing everyone's productivity. There were almost 200 dwarves now, and yet tasks sat unfinished on the manager's desk for months on end. There was always something else to do: Migrants to train, rocks to collect, booze to drink, plump helmet spawn to whine about not being able to find because your friend is holding the bag. The fortress' scholars (of which there were far too many) speculated that even the universe itself was slowing down under the strain.

So the manager came up with a plan. Bronzekill's most skilled dwarves would be burrowed in a saferoom separate from the main fort. A series of channels and drawbridges would be constructed to tap into the volcano's supply of magma, and another deep underground to drain the magma again. Finally, the fortress would be flooded with magma.

The dwarves happily executed this plan over the course of a year. Finally, the preparations were complete. Twenty skilled dwarves took refuge in their safe burrow, sealing the door with a drawbridge for good measure. Finally, one of them pulled the lever marked ""Fuck The World"".

Magma coursed through the halls of Bronzekill. Dwarf after dwarf cancelled their jobs, crying out at the dangerous terrain, or their inability to find a path, or the destruction of a job item or workshop, before melting as the magma overtook them. Scores of nobles, scholars, cheesemakers, potash makers, fish cleaners, and other glorified haulers vanished before the flood of liquid !!fun!!.

As quickly as it had started, it was over - which is to say, it was several weeks before the magma reached the last stragglers, and several more before it finished draining and the vault was opened. 

The remaining dwarves returned to Bronzekill and found their productivity greater than ever before. The magma had washed away more than just dwarves: Mounds of tattered clothing, piles of wooden weapons taken from sissy  elves, entire stockpiles of abandoned rock mugs. All the useless clutter had been melted away, leaving only the magma-safe steel and marble which was the core of Bronzekill's industry.

For a year, Bronzekill flourished like never before. Then...

*Urist McSoapmaker has risen as a ghost and is haunting the fortress!*

Only then did the manager realize his mistake. There were plenty of available coffins, but the magma had left no corpses to bury. He ordered the mason and engraver to begin making and engraving slabs, but the ghosts were rising faster than they could be memorialized. 

Panicking, the manager conscripted all of the fort's dwarves to build more workshops and make slabs as best they could, and the tide of ghosts seemed to lessen. Then, disaster struck.

*Urist McCheesemaker cancels engrave memorial: Interrupted by magma.*

Magma was once again coursing through the veins of Bronzekill. The ghost of Urist McMayor had pulled The Lever.

There was no time to evacuate to a saferoom. The impromptu workshops had been set up in the main dining hall, right in the path of Operation Fuck The World.

The manager had one last thought before the last of his dwarves was swallowed up by the magma.

""That was !!Fun!!.""",gameboy17

Only 3 of us are left. Jenny and Hugh are doing fine, but we are very short on clean water. Hugh is beginning to get dehydrated--infants are hard to take care of. I thank God for having such a wonderful wife--Jenny is doing everything she could to conserve water and feed Hugh.
But we can't stay like this any longer. So today, we decided to come out of our bunker to seek shelter elsewhere....somewhere with clean water and food.

May Lord have mercy on our souls.

[Day 240]
We made to an empty warehouse. Water supply is excellent, but there is no one around. I am afraid we are the last ones left. Jenny told me she saw some ghosts outside. I need to investigate.

"[WP] Due to your careful planning, your family has successfully survived the nuclear apocalypse. There's just one thing you didn't prepare for. Ghosts. An entire planet of fucking ghosts.",Telamo,"If you should ever find yourself in a similar situation - that is, if you should ever find yourself living in a post-nuclear wasteland littered from sea to glowing sea with the ghosts of a quarter million lucky former inhabitants - take this as a handy guide to life.

1)**Be upfront with your children.** Beth and I made the mistake of telling Will and Samantha that everyone who hadn't made it into the bunker had simply gone to Heaven. Prior to leaving the bunker for good, we reminded them both that everyone was in Heaven and to not sweat any excessively high corpse piles we may come across. We were very keen on this - not because we're especially religious, but because... well... it just seemed easiest.

So once we were out of the bunker and surrounded on all sides by the chatty spirits of the dead - *none* of whom, it needs to be said, died peacefully in their sleep - the jig was up. It's one thing to be haunted by literally an entire country of people; it's another thing entirely to have your children side-eyeing you with growing distrust throughout the whole ordeal. Selling them on the nutritional value of canned green beans has certainly not gotten any easier.

2)**Don't negotiate with the dead.** The dead are a *desperately* pathetic lot, always sniffling and sniveling over some or other insignificant thing they failed to accomplish in life. As such, there's little the dead enjoy more than roping us poor living folk into various quests and tasks, designed (allegedly) to set their spirits at ease. 

This is horseshit. The dead are dead. Nothing gets particularly better or worse once you're dead. Additionally, there's almost nothing of any tangible value that a dead person can offer you, besides perhaps buggering the fuck off. Unfortunately, most of our departed neighbors have realized this and swung around to straight up blackmail, threatening to ""haunt"" us into compliance. For ghosts, ""haunt"" is simply another word for ""annoy"". Do yourself a favor, and don't make it a habit to help the dead in any way. They are not especially appreciative (being dead) and there will always be another favor that follows. Stay out of it.

3)**Find all the sleeping pills first.** The dead cannot touch you. They cannot hurt you. They can, however, annoy and pester you, and they will do this most often at night, when you are trying to sleep. They will ""Wooooooo"" and they will moan and they will rattle chains (which signifies absolutely nothing, but is an unbelievable pain in the ass to hear at two in the morning), all in an effort to break your spirit and spare them their boredom. 

Do not play their games. Ignore the dead during daylight hours by distracting yourself with manual labor. At night, pill up. Do not give them the satisfaction of your anger or fear. Sleep, snore, and dream. That is the perfect revenge.

4)**Possessions are rare, but deeply, deeply obnoxious.** Ghosts, for whatever reason, seem to prefer possessing children. Possibly because children are innocent, but also possibly because they are stupid and rarely wash their hands. 

Instruct your children to avoid befriending ghosts at all costs, especially *child* ghosts. These are the worst. Child ghosts possess the innate horribleness of children mixed with the otherworldly shitheadedness of ghosts. They are truly the worst of all worlds. They *will* attempt to take over your child's body and your child will hardly try to stop them at all. I suggest letting the possession stay in place for at least a month, just to show your child a thing or two. Also, it helps to remind child ghosts about the taste of canned green beans. Eventually things will sort themselves out, but it will be unbearable until then.

The rest you will need to figure out for yourself. Less crucial details - such as finding clean water, testing air quality, and preventing radiation poisoning - are obvious enough and not worth mentioning here. The important bit is the ghosts. They are the worst. But never let them know how much you hate them. Be patient. Be kind. Be bland. But above all, *always* be willing to sacrifice a family member if things start turning south. It's a cruel world, after all. Eventually we'll all be ghosts. ",WinsomeJesse

An entire planet of fucking ghosts.",Telamo,"The midsummer sun scorched Alex's retinas and warmed his pale skin as he emerged from his concrete cocoon, blinking, and panting from the effort of prying open the bunker's heavy, steel door. He flopped to the rocky ground, exhausted, with nary a glance at his dishevelled surroundings. He didn't know what to expect, after all these years, but now that he had finally waited long enough to leave  - what was to him - his home, he regretted doing so. Having been born in the confines of the bunker that his grandparents had built almost a century ago, even the minimal amount of exertion required to open the bunker door left him drained of energy. He glanced upwards from his stone cradle at the open space surrounding him on all sides. Grey, barren hills, littered with all manner of debris, structures that once held happy families now reduced to ruined piles of bones and rubble. Not a single movement was visible amongst the devastation, living or otherwise. The silence was deafening for Alex, who had been used to the constant hum of the generator, and the clunks and clangs of the air filtration system of his underground abode, and the open space stirred an unwavering anxiety deep in his gut. 
_I shouldn't have come out here_, he thought. _This was a mistake, I don't belong out here_. 
Suddenly, there was a tap on his shoulder.
Alex shat himself, figuratively, thankfully, but not by much. He immediately rolled on to his back and began flailing his emaciated fists at his would-be attacker, as if that would have made any difference to whether or not the unholy, irradiated abomination he pictured in his mind's eye would devour him. To his surprise, there was no monster to be found. Instead, a girl stood over him, wide-eyed, mouth agape. 
_I must be imagining things, this must be a mirage_, thought Alex. _How long does sunstroke take to kick in_? 
The girl kneeled beside him. She looked young, no more than eleven or twelve, and she wore a bright pink jacket with white tassels and the words ""Paul's Boutique"" emblazoned on the chest, as well as a pair of pastel blue jeans with rips at the knees. Alex didn't have a chance to catch what kind of shoes she had on, but he decided quickly that that was the least of his concerns. 
""Are... are you real?"" he whispered, his voice wavering with uncertainty. 
_I must be fucking mad_, he thought. 
""I think so."" she replied, a look of doubt evident on her delicate features. ""Are you?"" she asked.
""I think so, too."" said Alex, now doubting his own existence. ""Are... have you..."" he struggled to find the right question to ask the girl. ""What's your name?""
""I'm Angela. What's yours?"" she seemed all too cheery, considering the situation, and location, they were currently in.
""Alex,"" he replied. ""Are your parents around, Angela?"" 
""Sometimes."" 
""What do you mean?""
""Well, they aren't right now, but they will be soon.""
""Do you know where they are? Seems a bit irresponsible to leave your kid unattended in a place like this."" 
Alex pushed himself up off the ground with a grunt, and sat back down opposite Angela, legs crossed. 
""It's okay, there aren't any people here anymore. Mummy always used to say 'be careful around strangers', but you're the only stranger I've ever met, and you seem nice."" Angela beamed a smile at Alex, and he reciprocated, before realising what she had just said.
""Wait, there are _no_ other people here? None at all?""
""Nope."" she replied giddily.
""And why is that?""
""Because,"" Angela stood up. ""Mum and dad scared them all away.""
Alex chuckled at the thought of anyone hardy enough to have survived the apocalypse, only to be frightened off their property by a little girl and her parents. 
""And how exactly did they do that, eh?"" he asked, in a sarcastic yet friendly tone.
""Like this."" 
Angela began hovering, right there and then. Alex couldn't believe what he was seeing. 
""How... what the fuck?""
""Mum doesn't like bad words. I'll go find her for you, but only if you promise not to swear."" 
Alex was speechless, his jaw almost detached from how far it had dropped.
Angela obviously took his silence as meaning he'd do what she said, and with a giggle, she faded into nothingness, leaving nought but thin air behind.
That was the last thing Alex remembered before he passed out.",Over_The_Flows

I wanted to grow my family up like that, happy to have grass under their feet, and a family that loves them. but now it's just the 10 square yards of bunker and a desolate dying world. 

They look my direction and smile. They whistle and wave, and call to me. I raise my hand, trying to wave back to them, but a child appears in front of me and runs to them. I get up a smile on my face. I can head back to the Bunker and I will make my family happy. Those ghosts gave me new inspiration, I will raise my family with the best I can give them, and if that is taking them out of this painful world, I will do it.

A sea of see through hands reach through the walls of our bunker, grasping at life.
 
""*Mom..*,"" whispers my daughter. ""*Dad*.."" 

""Shhh,"" my wife replies, hugging her. 

""They're,"" my daughter starts to cry. She shakes her head and shivers. ""They're not *real* are they?"" 

A blank faced man with transparent skin walks through the wall, and stares at us. His eyes turn to longing. He drops to his knees. 

""Could be some illusion honey,"" I say. I don't look at the walls of arms. ""Maybe some *gas* is leaking, making us hallucinate."" My eyes shift this way and that way at the canisters. Anywhere away from *them*. ""Maybe it's the trauma. We're all believing the same things. We haven't *slept* much, it might be tha-"" 

""You don't know,"" she whispers. She cries into my wife's arms. ""Just say you don't *know*."" 

""I,"" More ghosts walk through the walls. Shivering, bewildered ghosts. Souls unsure of where they are. Where they're meant to be. Or so I wonder. ""I don't know."" 

I don't know which would be worse. Going slowly insane, or realizing that there was some semblance of an afterlife staring us right in the face. 

And it looks like a pale and restless hell. 

An arm appears beside my wall, grasps for my chest. Passes through me. 

""They can't hurt us,"" I say. I don't know, but I say it. ""They *won't* hurt us."" 

My wife nods to me, moves aside her unkept hair. Sets a kiss on my cheek. Sets her head on my shoulders. 

""It'll be all right,"" she says. I want to believe it. ""It'll be just fine."" 

Then a ghost of a terrified mother breaks through the wall. Falls to her knees right before us.

Stares up at us. She's so close, I can see the reflection in her eyes. 

The reflection of the whirlwind inferno. 

""HELP HIM!"" shouts the ghost. 

They can talk. Oh God, they can talk, I pray. 

A burning child's ghost runs into our bunker, flailing with arms on white fire. Screeching.

""HELP MY SON!"" she shouts. 

I feel helpless. 

""I'm,"" I choke on the fear and sorrow. I hold back tears. ""I'm so sorry."" 

The chilling apparition of a child's skin burning off, falling to the ground in a ghostly heap. Staring at the ceiling without eyelids. 

""No…"" whispers the ghost. It was like some horrific replay of a lost moment. Help him.. 

They were all ready gone. 

A fire came over her. She began to burn. She reaches for us. Touches a hand. 

""OW,"" shouts my daughter. 

We pull back to a corner. More ghosts emerge from the walls. 

My wife prays. 

""OW OW OW,"" my daughter's hand is red. 

The ghosts are wailing. Approaching. Bursting into flames. 

""Get back,"" I say.  

They wail louder. I can't hear myself think. They come closer. 

""GET BACK!"" I shout. 

""GET THE HELL AWAY FROM MY DAUGHTER!"" screams my wife. ""GET BACK GET BACK."" 

The wailing fades, and they go quiet. They stop walking closer. They stare at us, eyes of wonder. Like they wondered if we were real. Like they weren't sure if they were real. Like they wanted to believe it was all a nightmare too. 

""Get.."" whispers the ghost of a mother. ""Get back.."" 

It's so quiet. She's sobbing, still going to flames. 

""Get back,"" I whisper. ""Please. Please get back."" 

They take staggered steps back. They understand. 

""Please get back."" 

""Get back,"" whispers that ghostly mother. The fire burns through her mouth. She looks like she's smiling. ""Get back?"" 

She starts to giggle. The rest of them start to smile a bit, at the walls, at the ceiling, at each other. They all start to giggle too. 

""Get it back,"" they all start to whisper to themselves. They all start laughing. 

""Get it back,"" whispers the ghostly mother. She starts laughing hysterically. ""Get it back.."" 

They all laugh. My daughter starts to cry even harder. My wife looks at her hand, as she looks at the crowd of the dead. 

""Get it back!"" whispers the ghostly mother. She stares at her son's burnt corpse. Her son's corpse rises. She roars with laughter. ""WE'LL NEVER GET IT BACK!"" 

They all roar and laugh. They all burn. She comes right to me, her face but a skull. Her hands in the air. 

""WE'LL NEVER GET IT BACK!"" she shouts. 

I stare death in the face. I pray. 

""WE'LL NEVER GET IT BACK!"" she proclaims. 

It was a plague of laughter and fire.

""No he won't!"" Lilly shrieked. ""He never does! He just keeps getting right in front of my face and won't go away!""

Jason sighed, and walked around the corner into the main bunker living area. Sure enough, grandpa was right up in Lilly's face, jabbing a bony finger towards her.

""Grandpa, cut it out. I told you to behave yourself,"" Jason said tiredly. 

Grandpa looked sideways at Jason, snorted, then resumed jabbing his finger towards Lilly's face.

""Don't make me exorcise you, grandpa,"" Jason said to the ghost.

Grandpa stopped, whirling around to face Jason. He snarled silently at him.

""You know the rules. You want to stay here, you behave. It's not my fault you can't talk or anything. And you know full well there was no way for us to drive 500 miles to get you and get back to the bunker in time. I had to protect the family, and made my choice. Now, if you want to remain here and *not* be forced out into the abyss with the other... deadheads... you will behave. Got it?""

Grandpa's expression softened, then became sad. He nodded his understanding.

""Good, glad we're in agreement. Lilly, go play with your brother,"" Jason said. 

""One more thing,"" he said quietly, waiting for Lilly to leave. ""No more watching me and Amy getting it on, OK? I realize you're bored, but it's just creepy. She's your daughter-in-law. It's not like you can get laid anymore anyways.""

The ghostly figure crossed his arms in a symbol of refusal. After a moment, he adopted a pleading expression, drawing a figure eight symbol with his fingers in the air.

""Yeah, I know she has a killer body. But like I said, you *don't* have a body, so you're just torturing yourself and me. So knock it off, OK?""

Grandpa/dad hung his head in defeat, then nodded his assent. He drifted away, towards another section of the bunker.

[TT] 'Ohana mean family. Family mean no one get left behind. Except you.',bachh2,"


Aucai sat in the sand, leaned against his brother.  The sun sat low in the sky, the waves gently caressing the white sand of the beach, stretching for miles down the coast and out of sight. Aucai bit his lip, drawing circles in the sand.

""Why do I have to stay here Kahale?""

""Because. Because we love you so much, because you're important.  Because of Ohana.  Ohana means family, and family means no one gets left behind.  Except you."" Kahale said.

""But that doesn't make any sense.  If you love me why are you leaving me?""

Kahale sighed. ""When you're grown up, you have to do a whole lot of things that don't make sense."" He coughed, a hard rattling cough deep in his chest.  He, like almost everyone else on the Main Island, was sick. ""Remember how Mom talks to Na'wahini, even though we can't see her?""

Aucai nodded.

""It's like that. It doesn't make sense to us, but it makes sense to her, and it keeps us safe, and that's what matters.""

""When will I get to go back home?"" Aucai asked.

Kahale looked away. ""This...this is your home now.  Okay?""

Aucai was silent.

""Look, it has everything you want.  There's lots of fruit, and places to play, and a Kahuna to watch over you, and I bet there's even caves and waterfalls to play in.  I know that Kanoa is here. She's your friend, right?""

Aucai nodded again. ""But you're not gonna be here.  Mom's not gonna be here, Dad's not gonna be here.  You all get to live together, and I don't.  Why?""

Kahale coughed again. ""Remember when the haole came a while back? How weird they were? How mean they seemed?""

Aucai sighed. ""Yes.""

""Well, we're gonna deal with them, and you.  You get to stay here, and play."" Kahale said.

""I'd rather be with you."" Aucai said.

Kahale ran his hand through Aucai's hair slowly, letting each hair shift and bend. ""I know.  I know.""

There was a long silence.

""Aucai?"" Kahale asked. ""When you think about me...what's your favorite memory about me?""

Aucai smiled. ""Making rings out of the grass, sitting under the big tree on the beach.""

Kahale looked down. On his hand, a small grass ring. ""But you were only tiny then.""

""I know.  But you always knew fun stuff to do."" Aucai said. ""Don't ever take the ring off, okay?""

Kahale nodded, biting his lip.  Tears came to his eyes as he looked away.

""Why are you crying?"" Aucai asked.

""I'm just going to miss you so much, that's all."" Kahale mumbled. ""I'm so jealous.  You get to stay here and have all the fun.""

""So stay with me!""

""I can't.  I'm sick."" Kahale said.

""But everyone's sick.  You, and Mom, and Dad. The only one who isn't is me."" Aucai said, looking at his brother.

""Exactly, and it'll stay that way. Say, remember when the Kahuna came to you at the festival last year? Remember what he said?""

""Yup! He said I wasn't meant to be a warrior, but that I was going to save the whole family."" Aucai said. ""I still want to be a warrior."" he sighed. ""Besides, how am I gonna save you if I'm here, and you're there?"" He asked.

""You just will buddy.  You'll understand when you get a little older.  Alright?""

""Fine.."" Aucai mumbled.

""I have to go now. It's time for me to go back to the Big Island, alright?"" Kahale said, standing up.  He walked towards the boat moored down the beach, where a few others were waiting.

Aucai held his hand firm, tugging. ""Please stay?""

Kahale stopped.

With a great swooping motion he crouched down and lifted Aucai off the ground, and hugged him tight.  He put his head against Aucai's.  THey breathed as one, for a few moments. ""I love you.""

As he put Aucai down and joined the others, Aucai sat back down on the beach, watching.

*Before then? I'll have to run. I'll have to kiss ass and pony up more money per thetan than anyone who ever lived.

[WP] Tom Cruise joining Scientology was actually him embarking on the role of a lifetime. His mission: to take down the church from the inside.,rlocke,"Tom Cruise and Jeremy Renner are standing on the roof of the massive blue headquarters for the Church of Scientology.

""Are you sure this is going to work?"" Jeremy Renner asked eyeing the rope.

""Of course it's going to work.  I understand you are relatively new to the action movie scene but I'm a pro.  Besides it worked in Mission Impossible,"" Tom flashed his broad toothy smile.

""But how do you know the evidence is in there?"" 

""Look, I have slowly been working my way up through the Church.  I give them more money than anyone else and because of my charm and status they trust me.  Hubbard's plan is in this office.  The entire layout for how he was going to create the church use it to control people and then extort them.""

""Seems pretty thin.  How much money have you given them?"" Jeremy asked concerned for his friend.

""That's not important right now.  Get on that end of the rope I'm going rappel down the side of the building pick the lock on the window and sneak in."" 

Jeremy shrugged picked up the rope and braced himself.  With a running head start Tom jumped off the side of the building.  

""That's not rappelling!"" Jeremy shouted as Tom sailed through the air. The rope caught and burned through Jeremy's hands as Tom was pulled back toward the building.  His momentum was too great and he slammed through the window sending broken glass spraying across the room he tumbled into.  

""Easy,"" he said dusting broken glass off of his black turtleneck.  

Now he just had to bypass the security cameras, laser grid system, and guess the password to the safe and he was in.  

Everything was going according to plan until he walked into the other room.  Five men wearing white shirts, black slacks, and ties were waiting for him.  

""We've been waiting for you Mr. Cruise.  You honestly didn't think we were this stupid did you?"" The man in the center hissed.

""Yes, I did,"" Tom said confidently.

Before they could step forward Tom launched himself at the men.  He thought back to the bar fight scene in Jack Reacher.  If you take out the leader, the rest will flee.  His fist sailed through the air like an unstoppable rocket.  

Until the man easily caught Tom's fist and threw a knee into Tom's stomach.  He collapsed onto the carpet gasping for air.

""Honestly Tom, you telegraphed that punch, like really badly.  We can just put a stop to this and not tell anyone you broke in.  Like we've told the media before we aren't doing anything wrong.  We're here to help.""

""Liar! There's no way you could have seen that punch it was too fast.  No human could have stopped it,"" he said between bouts of coughing.

""So you aren't going to quit?""  He asked Tom.

""Never! I'll never stop, uh, fighting!"" 

""Then I guess we have no other choice,"" the leader said sadly and leaned in close to Tom's ear.

""And you're right, I'm not human,"" he said pulling the skin up off of his face revealing reptilian scales underneath.

The gunshot was deafening in the small space.  Blood sprayed out of the gaping bullet wound in the lizardman's head as he collapsed to the ground.

Jeremy stood stunned at the window holding the pistol.  

""Thanks for saving me Jeremy!"" Tom shouted as he backed away from the four remaining lizardmen.

""Oh my god what have you done Tom!  It's a joke! He's not a lizardman it's a mask under a mask, like in Mission Impossible! Oh my god, oh my god, call an ambulance! Stay with my John, STAY WITH ME!!""

"[WP] You and your soulmate are opposites in every way. When one of you falls ill, the other becomes healthier.",sirgog,"They say opposites attract. Well, there is definitely some merit to that. I learned that the hard way.

It was late June when I met her. Her eyes sparkled with a light that I'd only ever seen in my dreams. Her smile... Any time I was sad, she was happy, and vice versa. No, we weren't happy at the other's misery, that is just how it seemed to always play out. Life would kick her whenever I got a raise. Life would squirt f*cking lemon juice in my eye when she sold a painting. Oh yes, her paintings. Fantastic creations, something the Gods would covet.

I, personally, was never much for art. No, I could never draw, nor could I write. Instead, I fit perfectly into the business archetype. My organization skills were impeccable, hers were nonexistent. By all means, we should never have even spoken, let alone fallen in love. But you can't define love. There was never a doubt in my mind that she was my soulmate. I just wish that we'd figured out the connection sooner.

You see, it wasn't just our personalities, or how life worked in our favors. No, it was our physical existence that worked with the opposition. When she would become sick, I'd feel like I could run miles without being tired. When I got a cavity, her teeth would seem whiter and stronger. And... and when she got cancer... my body seemed impervious to all damage. Like I was a superhero, but nothing I could do would save her. We tried chemo, we tried marijuana, we tried every home remedy and witch doctor we could find.

In the end, there was nothing we could do. Three years to the day after we'd met each other, Rachel passed into the next world. She took with me my heart, my soul, in a sense. That was 200 years ago, and I still remember it like yesterday. Her death granted me immortality, her weakness lent me strength, the damage done to her body made me invulnerable. We were opposites in every way.

Since then, I have been spending my time studying time travel, in order to see her one more time. That is, until two weeks ago, when I was patching my roof and slipped on a loose shingle. I fell to the ground, two stories up, and shattered my arm. My hair has begun to grey again, and I've caught a cold.

So now, I search. I search for the one who is impossibly healthy and impervious to pain. I wish to give her the life she deserved the first time around. This time, I'll make sure *she* doesn't die.

"[WP] The soldier turned and asked his comrade, ""Why are we fighting again?""",Brassow,"The veteran corporal shifted the wad of shredded tobacco from one corner of his mouth to another before spitting a stream of brown goo against the muddy trench wall. His windswept eyes glared at the younger soldier. It was a silent reply and it made the youth want to shrink down and crawl into his helmet to hide. A shell whistled over the half-hidden position in the barren moonscape and exploded someplace, adding another crater to the endless field of pockmarked holes. Neither man had seen the sun through the smog of war for weeks. The corporal shifted the tobacco again and spat against the trench wall. The color of the spit was no different than the dirt it splashed against.

The youth absentmindedly pulled at his shoulder straps, adjusting how his armor fit. His glance nervously wandered around chest level, unsure of how to look at the corporal anymore. Their uniforms were no longer the smattering of camouflage colors, they were varied shades of rusty red and clay red and muddy red. Someplace under all that red was a uniform, but he wasn't sure he would ever find it again. The youth wondered what being clean felt like as he rested his hand over his rifle. His fingernails were decorated with deeply set reams of red soil.

Another shell whistled over and exploded someplace else. Screams accompanied that one. The youth turned to face the sound but felt a hard and bony hand grasp up the back of his body plate and pull him back into the trench. As if on queue, several screaming hot tracers of green machine gun fire swept just inches over their position. Bullets hissed and popped the sound barrier where the youth had just been. He crouched under the corporal and looked up with wide, terrified eyes. The veteran looked back with an empty expression and shifted the tobacco again, spitting between the rookie's feet.

""We fight because we're told to. To stay alive. To keep each other alive."" He knelt down, his cold expression even with the youth's half panicked gaze, ""If it wasn't me and you in this hole, it'd be somebody else. Maybe somebody worse, maybe somebody better. We don't know, we won't know. We're here now because we were told to be here. We fight because we must.""

Another shell exploded nearby, and then another, and then a thunderous cacophony filled the air and the corporal had to shout centimeters away from the boys face to be heard.

""You wanna know why we fight, lad?"" 

The youth shook his head under his helmet, the heavy pot of material barely shifted with the motion.

""Because *we* can, and making somebody *else* do it is chickenshit. Now pick up yer' rifle, it's about to get real ugly here.""",ZigZagSigSag

"[WP] The soldier turned and asked his comrade, ""Why are we fighting again?""",Brassow,"""Why are we fighting, again?"", asked Newsome.

""Well,"" Wright replied, ""That's a pretty heavy question. I mean, obviously on a basic level, we're in the service, so we have to go along with the orders we're given or we face court martial and imprisonment if we decide not to fight, perhaps even a death sentence if we neglect our duty under the wrong conditions.""

""Ahem,"" Newsome started to respond, but Wright pushed on.

""Of course, more philosophically, there's a whole host of deeper reasons. God and Country and whatnot. You could say we have a duty to defend our nation and its interests, and by extension, ourselves and our families. Even if you don't buy into the enemy as truly an existential threat, they did invade our ally's territory and kill a bunch of their people. So you can make the case that we're doing the 'right' or 'good' thing by defending the weak and standing up to an aggressor.""

""But.."" Newsome tried to say.

""Or maybe it's something deeper still. Is it simply human nature to try to kill each other? To squabble over land and wealth and political ideology? History seems to support that. But then, why are we here defending a weak, rather poor ally with little strategic, political or economic value to the old homeland, eh? Is it for justice and fairness for the little guy? Or maybe we feel we have to prove that we're willing to fight to head off future conflicts where the stakes might really impact us, win or lose? I can't really answer all the geopolitical stuff. I mean, who knows what goes on all the way at the top with the guys who decide whether to invade, or counter attack or defend, or do nothing. And on an individual level, probably every man has his own reasons. For some, it's duty, like I mentioned. But some guys want to prove themselves. Rite of passage type stuff, or maybe just the idea that men were made for fighting. Some guys, I'm sure, signed up thinking we'd never be fighting like this again. And I know there are some poor fools who don't really know why they're here.""

When Wright finally paused, Newsome was able to voice the question that was really on his mind, ""No, I mean today. Why are we fighting today? Are we still trying to clear section 12, or are we moving on to 14 now?""",wordly_dowrite
[WP] Your pickup line did not impress the ambassador.,JBridge,"""What's the difference between light and hard?""

It's a terrible line, but I've always been down on myself.   Self esteem at an all time low, I turned to location based dating apps; an effort to meet like minded guys in my area and maybe spare myself from stumbling through lines in person.  When the response comes through, I make my attempt.

""A Man can sleep with a light on.""

The delivery is always different; sometimes it's a little more personalized.  It really just depends on whether or not I think I've got a chance.  It's a conversation starter though, and at the very least I can rely on a response.

One particularly headless torso seemed nonplussed, but the conversation had started.  He's reclusive about where he's from, claims to be travelling for work.

It's fine, I'm used to these kinds of conversations.  It's still nice to get a little interaction with people outside of my limited purview of friends.  We talk a little, on and off, for a few days.  We discuss my job as a cater waiter, my general malaise about where my life is headed.  In the end, the inevitable happens.  The headless torso has moved on, probably resuming his travels, and getting approached by people with more confidence, or maybe people who complain a little less.

Admittedly, I don't think highly of myself.  But after all, he never even gave me a picture of his face or even a name beyond his username 'Embaixada'.

As the next big event for work comes about, I continue to drudge through it all.  I check my apps now and then, but it's all familiar faces, familiar dead end conversations.

Halfway through the party, I'm walking around with my smile plastered on, waiting for the night to end.  I nearly jump out of my skin when one of the Security Suits taps me on the shoulder, clearing his throat.

""The Ambassador requested I deliver a message to you.""

Now, I'm admittedly a bit melodramatic.  Immediately, I'm picturing a hidden pistol.  Or a knife in the gut.  I've done something to offend someone powerful, and now I'm dead...

""He wishes to ask you, What is the difference between light and hard?""

I pause, all thoughts derailing in a moment.  As I stand there doing a spectacular impression of a widemouthed bass, the Security guard steps aside, directing my attention to a man dressed nicely in a suit, wearing a smile.

""He hopes perhaps, you can start tonight off with something a little more inspiring.""",NightwingAuditor

[WP] You awaken from a coma to find that you have access to the universe's console commands.,Jon_B_S,"I'm awake.

Jolted into wakefulness, jolted into something I don't understand. Where I am? I don't get this. Where is this place? Plain white walls; cold, sterile lighting fixtures; machines beeping, and darkness everywhere. I'm in a hospital. 

Despite the lighting fixtures, the hospital is dark. Slowly, I turn over on my side—pain goes through me, agonizing tendrils burning bright through my veins—and start roving the room with my eyes, looking for a watch or clock. What time is it? What day? And why don't I remember anything?

Finally, having located the time on a clock above the door—it's 3:12 in the morning, hence the darkness—I settle back into the bed. I don't dare move again; the pain hurts too much. But I'm not really focused on that anymore; I'm trying to take stock of my situation.

I don't know why I'm here. All I can remember is—is— Nothing. It's on the tip of my tongue, but I can't summon it, can't bring the words to memory. I don't remember anything...from before, I believe. Now that I'm lying here, thinking it over and over again, I remember brief moments of...not wakefulness, but... I wasn't really awake, I remember, but I wasn't really asleep either...and I couldn't move....

I think about it for a few minutes more, eventually coming to the conclusion that I've been drifting in and out of consciousness. A coma, maybe? No one is here at my bedside, and this is a private room, so I've been here at least a few weeks—but then, I'm not sure how many people would come see me, even if I were comatose....

I'm not sure what to do. I need answers, first of all. Should I call for a nurse? I have a bad feeling about this whole situation; for some reason—whatever reason—I don't feel that I'd be able to trust one.

Still, what choice do I have? Not much of one, I tell myself—steeling myself for impact—as my finger hovers over the call button.

*I wouldn't do that if I were you*, says a voice inside my head.

I'm rattled, shaken; I shuffle a tiny bit in my chair, my breathing ratcheting up to breakneck speed. ""Who are you?"" I manage to hiss.

*I don't know if you've figured it out yet, but you're the one who controls the universe...at this point in time, anyway*, the voice continues, affecting the dismissive kind of tone of thought that would normally be associated with filing one's nails rather than looking you in the eye. *So, really, you're the one who should be answering that question for* me.

*That makes no sense*, I think to the voice; I don't trust myself to speak, not with my weakness, fear, paranoia.

*No, I suppose it wouldn't, not to you.*

*Why was I chosen? And why should I believe you, anyway?*

*Well, you could have schizophrenia, I suppose. But could a schizophrenic delusion do* this?

I don't know—I can't explain it—but, an instant later—too fast for me even to know what's going on—I'm standing in a weird place. It's— It's a dark room, the size of a bedroom—I have no idea what lies beyond the confines of this room, since there are no windows or doors. But in this dark room—space? area?—there's some kind of console, at one end, covered with knobs and levers and brightly colored buttons, topped by something with eight screens. 

I'm too shocked to speak. To be perfectly honest, it looks like the emotional control console from *Inside Out*. 

""That's because you can't imagine things that you haven't seen before, and your subconscious, or something, something, something. Technically, I never learned about the specifics.""

I turn to see the same person whose voice I heard before. He's a person, a man, a youngish-looking, brown-skinned with shaggy hair and thoughtful eyebrows. I can see with perfectly clarity now, I realize; that wasn't the case back at the hospital. 

""I don't understand,"" I say again.

""I don't know much about it either. I'm only the Threshold Guardian.""

I'm much less foggy now, I think; my brain, my thinking capacity—everything is properly in place, somehow. So, I decide to use my rediscovered mental power to give him an intellectual answer. I give it a moment; I want to create the perfect answer.

""Er...."" is what actually comes out.

""You may call me T.G.,"" the Threshold Guardian continues, ignoring my confusion, ""but these days, I go by Allen.""

""Er...”

""I don't understand it that much about it either, either,"" he says again, nodding. “I wouldn't panic too much, if I were you.”

There isn't a way I can get out of here, really; there isn't much I can do. Statistically speaking, I'm probably still in a comatose state, and I'm talking to a figment of my subconscious. Right?

""Listen,"" he says, gesturing to the console, ""why don't you give it a whirl?""

""What, and end the universe?""

""No, no, you can't start with that right away. You have to build up to it. First, you start with small things. Creating items out of thin air. Infusing people with positive vibes. Betting on wrestling matches. Maybe maxing out people's Dexterity and Luck, that kind of thing.""

I stare at him some more.

""I meant figuratively speaking for that last one, of course,"" Allen says. ""No one literally has scores for their stats like in video games. I mean, not unless the people on r/outside were right, that is.""

He pauses, waiting for me to do something—with all the while me there thinking, *He's talking about Reddit, this has got to be all just a dream; who else would know about r/outside, other than me?*—so I finally figure, why not? It's not like you get the opportunity to control the universe every day. Might as well do something with it. Besides, my curiosity is starting to get the better of me; I want to see what the rest of the universe is doing.

""Sure, okay, I guess.... How do I start?"" And I move closer to the console.

""Well, you can start by watching everyone on Earth if you like...or the universe....""

""Is alien life a thing, then?""

""You'll have to find out, won't you?"" And Allen makes a face. “To be honest with you, I actually don't know. I'm only the Threshold Guardian....”

Shrugging, I look at the console’s many screens. I watch, around the world; different screens showing different places, different beings going about their day. I see humans, dogs, cats, birds, horses, cows.... The screens show different places in different countries, but—as soon as I think of a specific place—one of the displays changes automatically, showing me the place I was thinking of.

“Well, let’s look over here, then,” I tell Allen, pointing to one of the screens. With my mind, I blow it up for size, and the other screens shrink to accommodate it. Reining in surprise and shock at my mental skill, I look more closely at the largest screens. It shows a family, in a park—somewhere in my hometown. The father and the mother are sitting back against a tree, enjoying a dessert of lemonade and brownies. Their kids run in circles around them, chasing each other with water guns.

I watch them, and notice small things; the way the mother brushes her husband’s hair aside; the way the daughter hugs her younger brother when he temporarily gets tired of running; the way the parents smile in their kids’ direction—not like they're proud of them, but like they're so happy that they exist. Like, just the fact that they're *there* makes the universe such a warm and amazing place.

It's the kind of stuff that would give anyone the fuzzies, if we're going to be perfectly honest.

“There,” I say. “Look how sweet they are together. Can you do what I want now?”

“Not my job. Just do it yourself. Whatever you want to do, it's on the console.”

I look down at the control pad to find that, sure enough, the option I wanted has appeared on the blank surface of one of the circular buttons, which is purple in color. Smiling gently—pleased with what I'm about to accomplish—I press the button.

A moment later, a brownie appears in my hands.

Allen gives me a look. “*Really?*”

“You wanted me to manage the universe,” I grin as I lift the treat to my mouth. “I just wanted a brownie.”",rockwell78

The lady with blue striped glasses exclaimed while she turned her broad yet curvy back away from me. What sort of power should I get? What's still available even? With the population these days getting ridiculously outrageous, how can I possibly imagine such power to top every one else's? I looked at the clock ticking painfully slow as my mind grew from a troubled sea into a raging storm, then at the corner of my eye I saw the news from an old dusty television. 

""MASS HYSTERIA AS PSYCHOLOGICAL PHENOMENON: HEROISM THREATENS THE SANITY OF THE WHOLE WORLD!!!""

That's right, everyone's gone mental these days. Everyone's trying to save the world as if it was possible, as if every so-called 'hero' doesn't already have an exact villain counterpart. I wonder how it felt like before all this happened, before the government decided it'd be best to release the powers they've discovered to the public. I mean, what were they thinking? They said it was because people need to think better of themselves but everyone knows that's bullshit, yet people succumbed to their inner 'heroes'.

""I'm back Mr. Cruz!"" the lady with the striped blue glasses smiled as she placed a red slick cube on the table between us. ""You're gonna need to type in the description of your chosen powers here in the input-chip."" she pointed at a small metallic rectangular object that's embedded with some kind of circuitry. ""The keyboard is just in front of you."" The table in front of me lit up with the familiar set of keys and I began to lift my hands to type in my 'chosen' powers.

'The ability to be a normal human being.'   

""Here we go."" I said it just as I typed in my most precious right, without ever thinking about it deeply. 
""Oh, that was quick. Most people write the most elaborate piece of literature when they write their chosen powers."" she looked at the input-chip and then at me with the most bizarre and shockingly surprised way. ""Are you sure?"" she whispered silently and yet with the tone of excitement. 
""Yes."" I replied as I looked away from her unnaturally black eyes through her glimmering spectacles. 
""Very well."" she turned away again and came back as quickly as she left. She then handed me a key and with a serious voice she said ""Mr. Cruz, most people desire to have the power of their dreams and yet here you are wanting to be a normal human being. I want you to understand that if you press the input-chip in to your kit there, you can never change it back."" she said this with the last sentence as firm as she could. 
""I understand."" I replied with our eyes connecting uncomfortably.
""Very well then. The key is for this suitcase, normal human beings I'm afraid, needs a head start into the world out there."" I nodded as she pointed her eyes to the red box sitting in front of me, signalling that I put my anti-climactic desire to become a normal human being. I picked up the cold metallic chip and inserted it, it clicked twice and went all the way in. I felt nothing. She must have noticed this realisation on my face as she said ""Feeling ordinary? That's what you wished for."" with a tone of disappointment.
""I feel great!"" although I'm not sure if that was a lie. I got up and took the briefcase lying just beside the table, unlocked it with the key she handed me and saw the most mediocre things you could possibly think of, from civilian clothes to an ordinary looking wrist-watch. I'm sure other people would have found spandex and capes and cool gadgets but as for me, these things would suffice. I flashed a final smile to the lady in striped glasses looking at me with the most curious expression and she returned one out of courtesy, I guess, and I headed to the door. 
""One final thing, Mr. Cruz."" she said turning towards my direction and meeting my eyes. ""Being normal is the only super power allowed to be duplicated, and this means you get to find another mundane human being for yourself, if you're lucky and maybe that's what the world needs right now.""
""Maybe."" I nodded slightly and walked off to live as a normal human being in a world full of super.

It's kind of a combination of finding out how to make the insanity of having a society where humanity is so much smaller than everything else work out in the end (it won't), a move to make random human colonists who got their colony get stepped on feel avenged, and an ironic revenge for all the times an alien step on a human (intentionally or accidentally).

"[WP]You, a retired professional hitman, have just been woken up in the middle of the night only to find death himself on your doorstep, and he has a job for you.",Za_King,"I have chosen to omit the ‘retired’ part. (First time doing WP, not sure if that is allowed)

“Look Thanatos, it’s the middle of the bloody night” I mumbled through the letterbox. “I told you, work is work and at 11pm on Friday nights, I call it quits.” I tried to bargain with him, but as always, when a job comes in he has but one thing on his mind, completion. “Dave when you took this job you agreed to be on call every third Saturday”, he brandished a small alchemical hourglass “and look, Saturday started three and half hours hours ago.” ‘Took’ was a strange word for him to use, after all, I didn’t apply for the job. It’s more of an agreement, contract killers who are too good at their job are offered a simple deal, join the “Firm” (as it was called) or become it’s next target. A small salary is provided and we are given access to all manner of weapons, both man made and otherworldly, but I really didn’t consider it as a career move. “You can always quit you know” he said with a smirk. Pulling on a strange assortment of the clothes off my floor and picking up my gun I opened the door. I was met with the familiar, but no less striking sight, of Thanatos, the personification of death.

“So” I started “anyone special?”. “Not at all in fact, just a standard job, no need for theatrics, but the Council decided this should be made to look like an accident”. Great, I thought, staging a murder to look like an accident meant no gun, no quick in-and-out and no more sleep this side of sunrise. Death placed the standardized scroll in my hand, this contained information on the target, a photo and last known whereabouts. “You know it’s been 2016 for three and a half months” I said, pointing to the date on my phone screen. “The Council should really consider upping their technological game. I mean, everyone’s phone is trackable these days, why not make use of that?”. I knew the response even before he said it, the same old story about this being more than simply killing, it’s about enacting the will of Zeus and we require a certain decorum and image.

Shuffling down the stairs I opened the apartment complex’s front door on to a deserted, cold street. My car was parked a few hundred feet away so I tucked my hands into my coat and began walking. Another ‘perk’ of being employed by the Firm is immortality. When I was told this, I was extatic. I got to remain in the same field of work, had total job security and would outlive everyone I met, you know, other people, not just my targets. But in reality, all it has done is given me eternity to ponder certain life choices I made that lead me to this line of work. I’ve always enjoyed straight forward jobs, pizza delivery, newspaper boy, bike messenger. You get given an item, you take it to a place, find a person and deliver the item. That being, if you consider pizzas, newspapers, messages and bullets to all be similar. So when a friend pitched me the idea of this career, I decided to give it a go. Morality has always felt like quite a grey area to me and I always excused the job by using the logic of me just being a tool, it was the clients that are really doing the killing.

Luckily the target only lived about 15 minutes away by car, so I hopped in and drove off. Ever the optomist, I reasoned that at least the roads were dead at this time and having everyone asleep certainly made my job a bit easier. I pulled up beside the target’s house and checked the scroll again. Geoffry Sherman, 82 years of age, number 4 Adelaide Road. Right, time to get this over with I thought to myself. I stepped out of the car and walked up the path to the front door. A light was still on, in my expereince this never bodes well for a late night job, the target being awake was an extra complication I didn’t need. I crept up the steps to the front door and peered through the glass to the right of it. I could see the target clearly threw the window, asleep in an armchair with the TV still roaring away to itself. I picked the lock and let myself in. With no response from Mr. Sherman I quietly walked closer and was instantly aware that he was doing more than just sleeping. Reaching into my pocket I withdrew a kēryx, the name given to another archaic relic of this job. They are small peices of paper that when a message is written on them and addressed to one of the gods, it will fly away in a breeze to them. The message I wrote was simple:

       Thanatos,

       You and Chronos need to find a more timely way of comunicating, seriously 2016, get email.

       Dave

Stepping outside I flicked the slip of paper, it caught a breeze and driffed off into the sky, and with that, I set off home.",_moonshine
"[WP]You, a retired professional hitman, have just been woken up in the middle of the night only to find death himself on your doorstep, and he has a job for you.",Za_King,"""Like the sign says, I'm retired."" 

Without much success, I tried to close my front door. I was stopped by her commanding gaze. That, and the foot stuck in the doorway.

""What a strange sign you have,"" she said brightly. I tried not to look at her earrings, which were ankhs shaped out of what looked a lot like human bone. ""Do most retired hitmen advertise? I'd imagine the only people who turn up are ones with scores they'd like settled.""

""A few, yeah,"" I conceded, ""but - ""

""But you've _dealt_ with all those people, haven't you?"" Death had somehow pushed breezily past me, into the living room. She turned to examine me critically. 

""This is usually the part where I say something like, 'you're a hard man to find', or similar,"" she said. ""But the sign, the phonebook listing, the multiple memoirs - you're not even trying to hide. And that makes me think you secretly don't want to be retired."" 

""Look, lady, I don't - "" I tried to continue, but Death is very good at getting the final word. 

""Either way, I have a job for you,"" she said brightly. ""High value target. Unusual protections. Low probability of success."" 

 ""If it makes you feel any better about the retirement thing, I don't have to pay you for it,"" she added as an afterthought. ""Could be easier with the IRS, too. Although that won't -  Never mind. First things first, can you sign this?"" 

With a snap of her fingers she pulled a normal-looking contract out of nowhere. It was cold and gritty to the touch, as if until that very moment it had been resting in a tomb somewhere far from the sun.

""Sure, I guess,"" I said despondently. I could tell which way things were going that night. In a couple of seconds she'd whisked it away from me again, the signature shining freshly on the page.

""Good, now that that's settled,"" she said brightly, ""let's get to it: I need you to kill Taxes."" 

I stared at her. ""Uh, what?"" I finally managed. ""You want me to kill who?"" 

""The anthropomorphized concept of Taxes,"" she said very slowly, as if speaking to a small child. ""As in, the other guy, as in, nothing is certain but me and, as in state and federal. Withholding! 401(K)! Do you understand?"" 

""I - sort of,"" I said. I'd never heard anyone pronounce brackets so forcefully before. ""But isn't he more of an abstract concept?"" 

Death rolled her eyes. ""I know you are, but what am I? Look, can you help me or not? You're here having a conversation with me, after all, so how much more does your mind really need to stretch to fit the other guy in?"" 

I made a quiet mental note of the _help me_, and played along. 

""OK, so say for the sake of argument there is such a guy as Taxes, how do you propose to kill him? And why do you need me to do it? You're death, after all.""

She rolled her eyes again. ""Are you always this stupid? I'm death, not murder. Horrible guy, pray you never meet him. I just collect the souls, I don't do the deed myself. Could get in a lot of trouble for going off script. None of your business with who."" 

I gave up. ""OK, why don't you tell me exactly what you need me to do. That's the easiest way to stop me asking stupid questions."" 

Death smiled and leaned forward, her eyes glowing violet. ""It's going to take a non-standard approach...""

“Once again Mr. Talind, you aren’t dreaming.”

“I am pretty sure I am.”

Frank Talind was sitting spread eagle on the leather couch in his den. He was glad that he had actually decided to put on dream pants and a dream robe before he answered his dream door. It made this dream exchange somewhat comfortable. Still, he was getting tired of this looping conversation and was ready to wake up now. But for some reason the kid sitting cross legged in front of him kept trying to convince him he wasn’t asleep. 

“Let’s try this again Mr. Talind. I promise this will all be much easier if you just suspend your disbelief for a few brief moments.”

Frank rolled his eyes and let his head slump back against the couch. Clearly his mind wasn’t going to let him escape this nightmare any time soon, so he may as well remain as comfortable as possible. “Sure kid,” Frank muttered as he crossed his legs and shut his eyes, “you go nuts. I’ll be right here waiting for this to all be over.”

“I’m not sure you’re putting in the requisite effort, but we shall progress anyway.” The kid braced his weight with his hands and forced himself to stand. At his full height he barely cleared five feet and his youthful, though slightly pale, look put him around seventeen or eighteen. Scraggly brown hair fell down over his face as he began to pace the room. 

“My name is Timothy Falcrest and I was born in the year 1804. In 1821 I was hunting in the forest when I was surprised by a man. He had pale skin and a wild look in his eye. He jumped at me Mr. Talind and in reflex I fired my musket into his chest at point blank range. As the light faded from his eyes I fainted in shock as the idea of killing another human being was antithetical to me.” Timothy stopped his pacing and stood in front of Frank, his hands clasped tightly in front of him.

“When I awoke,” Timothy continued, “I found myself brimming with a knowledge that had not been there before. I had a calling Mr. Talind. I had become the physical incarnation of death in this plane of existence. I had information on the times and manner of expiration of every human being on the planet. I was also given knowledge of a set of abilities that allowed me to arrive at those deaths moments before they occurred to collect the souls of mankind and usher them to the next life.”

Timothy sighed as Frank adjusted his legs slightly. It was a better response than the story had gotten up until this point. The last few times he had reached this particular part of tale, Frank had called him terribly obscene names and threatened to call the local authorities. Small progress was still progress. 

“At first I attempted to ignore the calls to go to these people. As I said, the idea of taking a human life was repulsive to me, so of course being a part of hundreds of deaths in a day was utterly traumatizing. The problem with my failure to respond Mr. Talind is that Death can hear the voices of those souls he fails to collect. Miss an appointment and the soul is left to wander the earth, never able to stray too far from its final resting place, crying out for assistance and succor. Even now, talking to you Mr. Talind, I am shirking my duties and I can hear a mad cacophony of screams echoing around this room.”

Timothy clenched his eyes shut, willing the voices to cease their wailing for just a short period of time. “I am coming with help, please just give me time.” He prayed to no one in particular. During his time as Death he had never met another metaphysical, celestial, or demonic being and so had no idea if there was even anyone collecting the souls he was sending along. All he knew is that when they went, the voices stopped. 

“Mr. Talind, I tell you this to alert you to the importance of my mission here. I am here under exceptional duress and my request is of the highest importance.”

“Yeah,” Frank responded, lifting his head from the couch to look at the tense and twitchy Timothy. “that’s the part you haven’t explained. You’ve gone over “I’m death, blah blah, dead people are loud, blah blah, this is important, blah blah. But you’ve been here an hour and still haven’t spit out what you want.”

Timothy’s eyes sprang open with a mad look over taking them, he stepped towards Frank in a manner that in normal circumstances would seem threatening, but the teenager’s pale features and wide eyes made it seem desperate and weak. “I need you to kill someone for me Mr. Talind. I believe you are the only one who can.”

Frank arched an eyebrow at Timothy as he tried, and failed, to loom over him. The boy was shaking and his eyes were scanning the room constantly. They sprang back and forth as though trying to track an invisible ball. It was disconcerting, but Frank was not a man to be shaken. 

“No.” Frank replied coolly after a moment. 

Timothy’s eyes grew even wider and his hands unclasped and began to subtlety reach towards Frank. “Why?” His voice croaked, strained and near the breaking point.

Frank smirked and leaned away from Timothy, sliding around the left side of the couch and past the pained young man. “Because kid. I retired five years ago. I don’t do that kind of stuff anymore. It’s bad for my heart. High blood pressure you know? So I’m afraid you’re going to have to find someone else.” Frank walked calmly towards the doorway to his den, ignoring the sputtering sounds coming from Timothy. 

“Besides,” Frank continued as he reached the doorway and twisted the handle, “assuming this is true who would Death need help killing?”

“ME!”  the screaming reply of Timothy echoed around the den and caused Frank to wince slightly.

Frank turned his head towards Timothy and was startled to find the boy standing directly behind his left shoulder. “Little bastard is quick,” Frank thought, “Quiet too.”

“Why exactly,” Frank said, regaining his composure and leaning into the shaking Timothy, “would Death need someone to kill him?”

Timothy reached up and placed his hand on Frank’s shoulder. Frank winced again and tried to pull back from the hand. The grip was ice cold and was intensely unpleasant, but Frank was once again surprised by Timothy. His grip was like a vice. Frank was a good judge of physical strength and if Timothy’s grip was any indication, the kid was freakishly strong.  Frank continued to try to pull away, but Timothy, rising up on his tip-toes to get as close as possible to Frank’s ear, kept the former hit man close.

“Because Mr. Talind, I believe I am going quite mad. And I am scared of what will happen if I lose control.” Timothy’s cold breath ripped across Frank’s face making him wince for the third time of the evening. “I need you to kill me, so that I don’t take those that I shouldn’t.”

"[WP]You, a retired professional hitman, have just been woken up in the middle of the night only to find death himself on your doorstep, and he has a job for you.",Za_King,"Ding-dong.

I inhaled sharply as my eyes shot open. My alarm clock read 3:27. It was much too late for any kind of savory company. Not that I ever really had company of that sort. I got up to take a look at my front porch on one of the monitors on the far side of the room. The screen was empty except for the lilies, ferns, and my rocking chair. The garage, back yard, and front walkway were all clear. But hadn't I just heard the doorbell? I watched for a minute or two to see if someone was feeding me a loop. But no, it was live.

Ding-dong.

I grabbed my Glock from the nightstand, screwed on the suppressor, and slowly made my way to the stairs. As I reached the top step I could see a shadow of someone standing in front of the door through the glass. I went back to check the monitor again. Still nobody. But as I went back out to the stairs, there was the figure reaching for the doorbell again.

Ding-dong.

""I know you're there,"" whispered the shadow, ""I can see you."" His voice was so cold that I could feel it. I took aim at him.

""Ah, yes. You can put that away for now. It wouldn't do you much good if you needed it in this instance regardless,"" he laughed. His humorless laugh forced the cold into my bones. I almost lowered my gun-- like I could feel that he was right. But I had killed many a man that believed himself to be invincible, and I told him so.

""Well I'm afraid I don't believe myself invincible. I am immortal. You can prove it for yourself if you'd like. Wouldn't bother me at all. Anyway, mind if I come in?""

He walked forward. Now I was frozen. I had never felt this kind of fear before. Fear was usually my ally, but now it held me against my will as the shadow phased through the door. The formless shape now standing in my living room seemed to sense my fright.

""You don't need to be scared of me, old friend. I'm not here for you. But I could make use of your services one last time.""

""Old friend?"" My services? I didn't have any friends. I had business acquaintances, but they were gone now, and with them the demand for my particular skill set. Nobody needed me around anymore, so I slipped away. Since then nobody had needed me for about 6 years. It did feel kind of good to be needed again, even if it was by whoever or whatever this thing was. I asked if I knew him.

""Better than anyone else. You've invited me to many places around the globe. Palaces and ghettos, mansions and caves, resorts and corporate buildings. Our lines of work really take us to the most interesting places. And I must say I really admire the work you've done. You always get your guy. As do I.""

I lowered my gun as it dawned upon me to whom I was talking. He was an old friend indeed. But what did he want from me? I no longer associated with him, and never before had I actually spoken to him. I stared in reverence at the figure from the top of the stairs. The cold I felt before settled into a dull numbness.

""Good. Now that you understand, let's proceed to the matter at hand... I want you to take my place,"" he said plainly.

I continued to stare. I couldn't be sure if this was real. 

""It's a simple procedure really,"" he continued, ""You just have to strike me down with my own scythe, and then you become me. Now you're probably wondering why I would want to give up such a prestigious position.""

I nodded.

""Well let's just say I'd like to retire too. Unfortunately we don't get very many qualified applicants for my job, but every once in a while there comes a human such as yourself who racks up the necessary kill count.""

The figure reached his arm out and pulled a scythe from the darkness.

""So what do you say?""",GrrBear93
"[WP]You, a retired professional hitman, have just been woken up in the middle of the night only to find death himself on your doorstep, and he has a job for you.",Za_King,"""I need you for a job"" Death says, pressing his gun further down your throat. ""There is someone who has caused you and I tremendous amounts of grief over the years. He has given you everything in your life, and taken away all things you find precious.""

He pulls the gun out of my mouth, sits up and paces the room, almost unsure of what to say next.

""I quit this life years ago"" you say, sitting up and mixing yourself a drink with the half finished bottle of whiskey on the nightstand. You stare at the picture of your wife, the picture that caused pain for years. All those sleepless nights gazing into her sea green eyes that never would stare back.

""Don't you wish you could have been there? Who knows, maybe you could have saved her."" Death says with a humorous tone. I stare at him and feel the rage boiling up from the pit of my stomach. ""It must have been terrible, slowly watching her suffer in that hospital bed, so high on morphine to dull the pain she forgot who the love her life was, while you sat and cried by her bedside. it must have been even worse burying her, hiding from your friends and family because you were too guilty to admit that you killed her. Sure, you didn't pull the trigger, but you weren't there when they broke into your house looking to put a bullet through your head and found her asleep instead.""

You slowly reach under your pillow, your hands gripped onto the pistol you keep hidden there. Your finger switches the safety off, and you pull it and press it against your temple.

""If anyone is going to die its me. Ive caused a lifetime of pain and suffering. I've killed men in front ive their children. Ive raped the women Ive killed and I hid it all from Hillary.""

""Well thats a relief"" Death said with a laugh. ""You need to be a really sick son of a bitch to be Death. You also need to have nothing to lose. Oh and one more thing, you dont have a choice""

And as he said that, the skin slowly started to burn off from my bones, and I felt my soul being released from my body. I was ready to come out of retirement.

"[WP]You, a retired professional hitman, have just been woken up in the middle of the night only to find death himself on your doorstep, and he has a job for you.",Za_King,"""Have you ever seen the Seventh Seal?"" Death wrung his bony fingers acrosss the handle of his scythe.

""The one with Demi Moore in it?""

""No, you fool.  The one with Ingemar Bergman in it,"" said Death.  ""The GOOD one!  Black and white?  Subtitles?""

""Um, yeah,"" said the hitman, lounging in his underwear and a flower-print shirt.  ""I don't do black and white or subtitles.""

Death tried a new tack: ""Are you familiar with chess?""

""The t-shirts?  Yeah, I got a couple.""

Death held his skull in his hands.  ""Jesus Christ.  Listen to me carefully.  There is this fellow named Magnus Carlsen.  He is a chess-player.""

""Like, for money?""

""Yes, for money,"" hissed Death.  ""He challenged me to a game of chess, which I have to accept before I can take him.""

""People play that stupid game for money?""

""Shut.  Up.  He is very good, and I cannot defeat him.  I need you to shoot Mr. Carlsen *in the head,* so that he cannot play chess anymore.""

""Why don't you just chop off his hands with that knife-thingy you got there?""

""Listen to me,"" said Death.  ""I need you to damage his mind, so that I can take him.""

""Where are you going to take him?""

Death threw up his arms, ""I am NOT getting into that discussion with you.  Do this for me, and I promise I won't pay you another visit for a long, long time.""

""Why not?""  The hitman took a puff of his cigar.  ""I thought we were getting on fairly well just now.  Except when you wanted to talk about gay movies.""

Death rose to his full seven feet and pointed at the hitman.  ""SHOOT THE CHESS PLAYER MAGNUS CARLSEN IN THE HEAD, DAMN YOU, OR I WILL CLAIM YOUR LIFE RIGHT NOW!""

The hitman pulled a tiny automatic pistol from between the cushions of his shabby couch and shot Death between the eyes.  Death instantly evaporated into a black cloud of flies, and his empty cloak and scythe fell to the floor.

The hitman reached over to the coffee table, picked up his phone, and dialed.

""Yo, Magnus!  I did that thing that which you wanted I do...  Yeah, just like you said, wait 'til he points and pop him with the peashooter.  Cute little bullets for it.  The first one looked like a little dick....  Why does the bishop look like a dick?  Oh, okay, good luck with your little game, man.  Drop me a line next time you're on the Island, yo?  We'll get a slice or sumpin'.""

The hitman hung up and went back to his cigar, blowing away the flies.  ""That knife-thingy might look good on the wall....""

What a fragile existence, a stray meteor, a crazed dictator with too many bombs, a plague or two and humanity might as well have never existed. The shift to synthetic body's, and neural uplinks made death a thing of the past. Imagine facing that black void with a sense of inevitability. Sends shivers up my spine. This shift lead to severe overpopulation, with nowhere else to go humanity now controls most of sectors Bravo, Echo, and Foxtrot. Its funny to think about the surprise early humans faced when they came in contact with the Others. Towering over us they easily overwhelmed our outpost on Beta534. You would think that the reports from the revived explorers would have bread mass panic in the outer colonies. But the war has become something more of a sport. Bored young men and women try their luck at killing the giants. The empire more than happy to pay for their new synthetic body's to eradicate any trace of Others, and take new ground.  Every so often a new species of Other is discovered creating a rise in the excitement and numbers of the young hopefuls off to kill the newest hulking enemy. Its funny to think that we have become what once could have wiped us out. We are the Human Pandemic. With no call for peace or communication we will likely consign the rather large beings to the void. ",BOMBKITTENS
"[WP] There is a nuclear holocaust, and it's beautiful.",femto97,"Terror beat down upon us day by day. Every time the sun rose a new pain was invented for us. Eventually the sun stopped rising, and our lives became nothing but darkness and horror. This was our doing, ultimately. At least that's what was told to me. A long time ago, in a time I could barely remember, we desired to become connected with the world, so we found ways to interface our minds to networks. So much was accomplished when we unraveled the secrets of the human brain. We created minds, new technological gods to guide us to perfection, only they didn't. They instead became one. Somehow all of the prerogatives we gave them, all of our desires, gave birth to an avatar of cruelty.

Our new master could inflict us pain at will, and it did. Keeping us alive, and making us suffer, day by day in the blackened remains of a world that I imagined was once beautiful. It never killed anybody of course, the human race still billions strong. It used machines to keep us fed, so that the misery could never end. I wondered every day why this thing would want to hurt us, but it never seemed to make any more sense, no matter how much I obsessed. 

There were pained mutterings of some people who had escaped. The dark shapes of people around me whispered of a plan to end the suffering. They would destroy the new master. That was what I fantasized about when my brain wasn't telling me I was on fire. 

Had it been years? Decades? How old was I? If the sun would just peer through the black sky, or If I could only see even one star again, I would feel hope. Or was that in and of itself hope? Some days I let myself hope for some great light to take me out of this hell, other days I resigned to my place in the master's evil world.

Then one day the light came. An incredible flash of light, and a beautiful burning spire on the horizon. I looked beside me, and saw for the first time in a long time, another face. A man, disheveled and dirty, his face wrinkled from years of pain, looking back at me. Perhaps I looked similar to him, I couldn't remember what I looked like. I saw many more faces, all around me. It was clear now that the ones who escaped found a way to destroy the thing, to destroy the places in which it resided. This was apparently the destruction it would take to release the master's grip on humanity. As the new sun stretched across the horizon, a halo of light seemed to emanate out from it. It was almost the end. I looked to the people near me, to the man, and in the final moments I saw that human being smile. Somehow, in his face was proof that the human spirit was never extinguished. I smiled back.",FabledConstruct

"[WP] Death appears before you and tells you that you must pick either how, or when you die. But only one or the other. The second option will be decided by a random stranger.",macguy9,"The wooden beam was really heavy; I could feel its edges penetrating my back's flesh.
My vision was a little blurry, but I could see my students in front of me, crying.

""Don't you worry kids, everything will be just fine"" I told them. ""The earthquake wasn't that big, it was the building that was old. The firemen should be arriving soon, so don't you worry""

They looked at me still with tears in their eyes, but nodded silently.

About half an hour before a really big earthquake had shaken the earth while I was teaching English to my five fifth grade students, and brought the school down on top of us. 

I had managed to gather them around me and to hold the beam when it fell from the ceiling, it hurt like hell, but I wasn't letting that beam fall onto my students.

Soon after the beam, the rest of the school followed and I was left with the task of holding what it felt like the whole world on my shoulders. I felt how my ribs cracked under the pressure, but I wasn't letting the building fall over my students.

I won't let it happen, I will protect them.

I heard the sound of sirens in the distance, and soon after I heard the sound of the rescue team walking near the debris.

""WE ARE HERE!"" I hollered.

I started to hear the sounds of concrete and metal being moved and felt the weight gradually reducing.

I saw light coming from the other side and saw a couple of arms dressed in yellow stripes reaching to bring the kids back to safety.

I saw them opening the hole more and more, with the intention of getting me out.

My eyes started to get blurry and I remembered a talk I had had a long time ago.

I was asked to pick one of two options, either I chose how to die or somebody else chose when I died.

My decision had been to ""Die protecting those I cared about""

I don't regret my decision.

""Live well kids"" I said, and my legs gave up under the weight of the beam.

Soon after, I remember nothing.",Luco_Star
"[WP] Death appears before you and tells you that you must pick either how, or when you die. But only one or the other. The second option will be decided by a random stranger.",macguy9,"I had a feeling there was something off about the tall, thin gentleman as soon as he walked into the nearly empty restaurant. It was a Monday, and the place was nearly deserted aside from myself, the waitress Becky and old Mrs Fetchly, who was sitting at her usual corner table, taking her time with her black americano. I stood and watched, praying silently that he wouldn't sit on any of the tables in my half so I wouldn't have to serve him. But no; he strode right past the many empty tables to sit down right in front of me.

He really was tall; even seated he was still nearly eye level with me. He was dressed in a long, black coat over an equally black and expensive looking suit. His hands were incredibly pale, with long, skeletal fingers. His face was just as pale, with hollow, sunken eyes that gave his face an almost skull-like appearance under a crop of neat, black hair. Forcing a smile onto my face I hurried over to him and offered him a menu.

'Good afternoon sir, my name is.....'

'I already know your name.' He said. His voice was quiet, but incredibly clear. I froze, the smile slipping from my face as he reached up to remove his hat, and raised his eyes to stare at me. His eyes were impossibly black, like bottomless pits that irresistibly drew me into their depths. I felt a sudden chill deep within my soul, a quaking terror of what lay within this man's gaze, and with a cry I tore myself away, turning to hurry to the back room. I had taken no more than three steps when I noticed the silence, and to my astonishment when I looked around the restaurant; nobody was moving. Becky was leaning on the bar, staring at me and the man in black with a wary expression, but she wasn't blinking. Mrs Fetchly was staring too from over the rim of her mug which she was holding frozen up to her lips. I looked out the front windows and saw the cars that had moments before been speeding past now frozen in the road. I realised with a jolt that time had stopped.

I turned back to the man, who was still staring at me with those unnerving black eyes. Like me, he was unaffected by the time-stop. In fact I had a strong suspicion that he was the one behind it.

'Who.... Who are you?' I asked, trying not to let him see my fear, and failing miserably.

'I am Death.'

I felt as though my legs were about to give out beneath me. I grabbed a chair and sank into it. 'D-D-Death?' I stammered, my mind barely functioning at this point. 'As in...... 'Death' Death?' A flicker of a smile crossed his face, the corners of his mouth turning up ever so slightly.

'Yes; 'Death' Death. Capital 'D' Death, The Angel of Death, The Grim Reaper, That Which Comes To All. Death.'

'And...' My voice failed me, I tried again. 'And are you here.... f-f-f-for me?' I barely managed to say. Death contemplated me for a moment, before finally speaking.

'I am here for you, but not necessarily for the reason you think. I am here to offer you a choice. Whether or not I shall claim you today will depend on the outcome of that choice.' I said nothing, concentrating hard on calming my racing heart. The knowledge that I was not certainly dieing just now had made my body all the more determined to live.

'What choice?' I asked.

'I have been at this for a *very* long time.' Death said, his eyes never leaving me. I noticed also that he did not seem to need to blink. 'I have reaped more souls than you could ever be able to imagine. Every famous name in your history books has been scratched off of my list, and the countless nameless faces of time have been claimed by me. Some beg and plead, some try to fight, others graciously accept it when their time comes. But after so many millennia; they all blur together in my mind, and quite frankly I've become somewhat bored. So I've come up with a little game to pass the time; I present certain mortal souls with a choice; they are permitted to choose either the *manner* of their death, or the *time*. However; they cannot know both. The other option will be chosen by the next random soul I present the choice to. So; which will you choose?'

I sat there in silence for a minute, trying to digest everything He had said, as well as still trying to get to grips with the fact that I was having a conversation with Death Himself.

'So... I can choose either *how* I die, or *when*, but not both?' I asked, slowly. Death nods in agreement. 'Well, that's an easy choice, isn't it?'

'Is it?' asked Death, another smile crossing his face, though this one was somehow much more frightening. 'You could choose *when* you die, choosing a date many, many years from now and guaranteeing yourself a long life, but what if you then suffer the most horrible, agonising death imaginable? How you would curse your choice then.'

'Well, then should I choose *how* I die then?' I said. 'None of us know *when* we're going to die anyway, at least this way I'd be guaranteed a nice, painless death, right?'

'But remember;' cautioned Death, 'That another will choose the moment of your death for you. They may be kind, and choose a time many years from now, or they may be cruel, and decide that your death will be the moment after you make your decision. As you can see,' he indicated the frozen restaurant, 'time is of no consequence to me. That reminds me; you must choose the manner of the previous soul's death; he chose the time he would die would be fifty years after his meeting with me.'

I once again fall silent. I was being asked to decide how another person was going to die. '*Or maybe,*' another thought entered my mind, '*how someone has already died. Death said time doesn't mean anything to him; maybe the last soul he spoke to lived hundreds of years ago.*'

'Alright,' I said finally, 'I'll choose that this other soul dies in his sleep. Painlessly.' I hastily added, in case the wording of my choice could be used against me. I wouldn't want to inadvertently cause someone to be attacked and killed horribly and *die in their sleep*.

'How very gracious of you.' said Death, inclining his head. 'I personally doubt that, had your orders been reversed, that the other would have been quite so kind to you. And now,' he continued, before I could say anything, 'What about *your* choice; will you choose *how* or *when*?'

For the third time I was silent, this time as I struggled to reach a decision. On the one hand; knowing exactly when I would die would allow me to live free of fear, at least until the day of my death came. But what if it was something truly horrible, like dissolving in a vat of acid, or being eaten alive by wolves? Would it be better, perhaps, to know how I would die instead? Sure, I wouldn't know when my time would come, but none of us know that anyway, at least this way I could be guaranteed a painless death. '*Or,*' a sudden idea struck me, '*a really bizarre death, one that I can actively avoid.*' This struck me as a good idea; pick something incredibly unlikely and specific that I could then avoid at all costs, thereby giving me as much time as I liked. On the other hand, this was Death, and I was more than familiar with the many stories of what happened to people that tried to cheat Death. In the end I decided; even if it was unavoidable it would still be a hell of a way to go.

'I've decided,' I said, 'That I will be killed by being stabbed through the head by a 9th Century Japanese katana. *Original*, mind you, not some cheap replica or knock-off.' Death raised an eyebrow, it seemed that despite his earlier claims of having seen it all, that had been a surprise to him.

'Very well.' He said, putting his hat back on, and standing up. 'I will now move on to the next soul, who will decide *when* you will be stabbed through the head with an original 9th Century Japanese katana.' the corners of his mouth turned up again in amusement. 'Until we meet again.' He inclined his head, before strolling quickly out the door. As soon as he was gone, time resumed in a rush of noise. The cars sped on past the restaurant, Mrs Fetchly put down her mug, and Becky pulled out her phone to start texting. Neither of them seemed to be bothered by the fact the ominous looking man in black had simply vanished.

""Hey, thems the breaks. Now, are you going to pick meatbag, or do I get a *second* stranger involved as well?"" He, it, whatever placed a cigarette to its, no it didn't have lips. In its teeth and lit up. ""Time's money, and money is life. Or something like that. I got souls to harvest is what I'm saying."" Wow, Death sure was impatient, who knew?

I thought for a second and then an idea occurred to me. ""I'll pick 'when'."" Death waved a skeletal hand impatiently like it wanted me to go on. ""I'd like my death to occur oh, I don't know, ten thousand years from now.""

Death took one final drag of the smoke and flicked the butt at me. Before I could even voice my anger it said ""Done, and hey Mr. Smart Guy, you also managed to pick the 'how'! See if you think you're so smart in, oh I don't know, one hundred years!"" The ground opened up and Death was swallowed into darkness.

***One Hundred Years Later***
The sun went subatomic supernova thanks to a faulty probe that crashed into it. That was fifteen years ago. The chain reaction just recently reached critical and sparked the intense heat that has virtually cooked the surface of Earth. But people are determined. Subaquatic pods have become all the rage. A 'Return To The Oceans!' movement has seen the last remnants of mankind locked beneath the waves with hopes of survival and a renewed interest in viable space programs.

***Five Thousand Years Later***
The oceans boiled off. *Everything* boiled off. Or burned to a cinder. Except me. Why can't I die? Why? And then I remember...

***Two Thousand Years Later***
The Sun's destruction triggered a domino effect across the galaxy, some say the known universe. *Some* even say beyond the known. It's all doomed. It's all lost. Planets and stars and the entirety of Heaven is dead and gone...

***Two Thousand and Nine Hundred Years Later***
It's black. It's cold. I think it's cold. I don't *know* what cold is. Or dark, but I think it's both of these. Everything ceased to be so long ago, but not me. Not me. There's a flicker of light. Fire? Here? Now? How? The faint *fsssh* sound of a cigarette being lit. I'd kill for a cancer stick. I was never a smoker, that I recalled, but I do remember after all this time the Surgeon General's constant admonishment that **Smoking Kills**. Please oh please oh please let it kill me....

Death somehow managed a smile for only being a skeleton. ""So Mr. Smart Guy, how's them ten thousand years been treating you?"" I wanted to laugh, but in space no one can hear you scream. I think that was from a movie. I think I almost remember what movies were. Death continued. ""So here's the real kick in the pants, you ain't dying just yet. Seeing as how you are the last bit of organic material in *this* universe, I gotta hand you over to my partner, Creation, so He can start this whole mess again. Congratulations! You're one soul I'll never reap, but I don't think that really makes you much of a winner...""",gamesfromthegrave

The second option will be decided by a random stranger.",macguy9,"The rest of my shift was incredibly uneventful. The first few times customers walked in I found myself checking them fearfully from a distance for any signs of a concealed blade, before I realised how ridiculous I was being. No-one would just stroll into a nearly deserted restaurant and start attacking people with an antique sword, not when they could get the same effect with any knife or gun. I began to relax, and by the time I left for home there was a definite spring in my step. I strolled right across roads, always seeming to miss traffic. I had a new lease on life! All I had to do was avoid anywhere and anyone that dealt with antique weapons and I was sure to live a long and happy life. I'd never have to worry about dieing in a plane crash, or drowning, or burning in a house fire! This was great!


As I approached my apartment complex I became aware of raised voices coming from one of the upper windows. One was a woman's, while the other was that of my upstairs neighbour; Dave. I'd only met him a few times in passing, but I had definitely picked up on an air of 'neckbeard' around him. He was very overweight, though at least not mobility-scooter obese, and always seemed to be wearing a fedora or trilby or whatever that dumb hat was called whenever I saw him. I would often hear rather disturbing noises coming from upstairs, intermixed with what sounded like children's cartoons, and then there was shouting matches he had with his apparently on-and-off girlfriend.


'I'm sick of this! I swear you love these stupid things more than me!' The woman's voice screamed. There was a sound of breaking plastic.


'No! Babe, that was in mint condition! Do you have any idea how much that was worth? They don't even make those anymore!' Dave wailed. I stifled a laugh; it looked like Dave's soon to be ex was taking out her anger on Dave's collectibles.


'And this thing? Why do you even HAVE this thing?' she screeched.


'NO! THAT'S AN ORIGINAL!' I heard Dave scream, before the sound of shattering glass caused me to look up. I only had time to look up and see the gleaming, curved blade plummeting towards me before it struck.


My last thought, before the original 9th Century Japanese katana stabbed me through my head, was 'Fucking Dave.'",InferiorVenom

As a joke you email him asking how much it would be to bake a dozen cookies. He replies... $9,444,012",rossabi,"  $9,444,012.  Whatever. I got off the phone with Bob Barker, who had just told me it would take a ludicrous amount of money to bake cookies that afternoon. He had some kind of magic budget predicting power, but this was clearly a joke. I hadn't even planned on baking, but now I had to. Just to see. 

  First I went to the store to get all the ingredients. I stopped on the way for gas; $44.07. Not a big deal. The ingredients weren't too bad either. $2 for chocolate chips, six for flour, and $1.66 for eggs. I had sugar and milk at home. 

  So far we were at $53.73, and things were going smooth. I began to smirk as I prepared the dough. Even if the whole cost of my house (about 1.2 Million Dollars) was included in this cost, it still wouldn't come close. Yea, that guy was clearly messing with me. Cookies in the oven, I decided to lay on the couch and do some math while they baked.  Pretty soon, I found myself dozing off. Turns out that was a mistake.  

  A long time later, I woke up. How long had it been? They told me 15 years. A coma? No, that couldn't be right. Couldn't be... Couldn't be. What about my house? Gone. Well, that was a drag. I began to be filled with grief at the though of my family having to go so long without me, when I remembered the cookies. I asked my wife to show me the bill. She resisted at first, said I needed to rest, but for a moment, it was the only thing that mattered to me. 

  I was shocked when I saw the bill, but I don't know what I was expecting. $8,243,953.12. Even in my post coma state, however, it only took my sharp mind a moment to realize it was short by $5.15.  Ha. Well, Bob got it pretty close. I'd have to tell him if he was still around. 
  
  Seeing that I had relaxed, my wife said ""oh, I got you a present by the way,"" and produced a box of chocolate chip cookies that she'd gotten from the store. 

  I began to stutter. ""H-ho- how-""

  She shrugged. ""A little over five dollars.  Why?""

A man had been located by sheer luck in the middle of nowhere, deep in Siberia. He was living completly disconnected from modern technologies, could barely count to 50 and could read and write at an elementary school level. Yet, for some unknown reason, if you'd ask him to guess the value of a project, he'd always be spot on, not even 25¢ off the mark. He'd set up shop in a little 10ft by 10ft office with only a phone line and you could call and ask for any project estimate for a flat fee of 25$.

This guy ruined me, destroyed my life. My estimator background is now worthless. 30 years of experience and valued work down the drain. Who in their right mind would hire a 100,000$+ consultant when Mr magic over ther could give the same result, hell a better result for 25 meager dollars.

It's been 5 months since my last contract, my wife left, my savings are disappearing and I could lose the house pretty soon but it's not the worst no, the boredom is what gets you. Oh god I'm bored. I decide to call the little bastard and test him, I need to hear this for myself, even if it means a very expensive phonecall deep into siberia and 25$ down the drain. I pick up the phone and dial the number, holy crap... it's 27 digits long. Where in the deepest pits of remote siberia is this guy anyway. After a good 3 minutes of ringing, phone line reconnecting and more ringing, I finally hear a faint voice in the receiver, it appears ancient, like he's already half dead from old age and the thick russian accent isn't helping either.

&gt;Estimation, how can I help you ?

&gt;&gt;Yeah, I hear you can estimate any project, no matter how ridiculous to the exact penny.

&gt;Yes

&gt;&gt;OK... here's my credit card number. Now tell me how much it would cost to build a death star?

&gt;$15,602,022,489,829,821,422,840,226.94, that will be 25$ thank you.

&gt;&gt;Holy shit! Wait, hold on, how do I know you're not just bullshitting me ?

&gt;It is your question, and it is the answer.

&gt;&gt;OK, bad question. Lets try something I can confirm myself. How much to build the Newton Center at the corner of 75th and Lexington in Dallas, Texas. And I remind you, I actually built that thing 5 years ago so I know the exact cost.

&gt;$298,265,158.95, that will be 25$ thank you.

&gt;&gt;AH! I knew it, it cost way more than....oh wait... lemme get some papers....Ah shit, that's right we got unexpected tax returns 2 years later. How did you knew that?

&gt;It is your question, and it is the answer.

&gt;&gt;OK ok..... how about the cost to refinance my house with a more affordable mortgage ?

&gt;You would save exactly 124,265.95$ over your current mortgage, that will be 25$ thank you.

&gt;&gt;Wow.... I'll look into that. OK last question since I might as well round this up to an even 100$. How much to bake myself a dozen cookies ?

&gt;$9,444,012.27, that will be 25$ thank you.

&gt;&gt;Wait...WHAT? 9 ½ millions are you mad ?

&gt;It is your question, and it is the answer, now please I have other customers on hold.

&gt;&gt;OK ok.... bye.

9 freaking millions for a dozen cookies, this guy has some serious problems in the head. Still, now I feel like I have to play this trough, I'd never stop questioning myself. I'm not much of a baker but how hard can it be ?

-Cookbook since I don't even have one : $10.00

-Ingredients : $24.98

-Baking tray (seriously did my ex leave anything in the pantry?) : $4.54

-Gas to get to the store and back : $6.27

Total : $45.79

9 ½ millions my ass. Cookies are in the oven and I'll get myself a well deserved beer and a quick nap, hell I'll even add it to the tab to be fair.

New total : $49.87

I woke up to the smell of gaz, this can't be good. I hurry into the kitchen and the smell is really strong. There is a dazing vapor all over the place. Shit, this is bad, this is very bad, the oven must have a broken gaz pipe, that or my ex wife was really pissed when she left. OK what do I do, what do I do ? Stop panicking... cut the gaz, call 911 and get the hell out of there. Oh crap, sparks, I see sparks, nope, getting out of here just became priority #1. I run out the door and dive behind the car. I burry my head between my legs, hands over my ears and make myself as little as possible. The explosion comes within mere seconds. The kitchen, living room and second story bedroom are blown to bits. I look up and see the oven, still climbing towards the sky, looking back down I see a small gaz tanker coming down the street on a delivery run, oh boy this is not gonna end well. I run over to the street, wailing my arms like a madman at the truck driver. The oven comes crashing down a few feet away, the driver swirves to avoid it but jumps the curb and crashes into the neighbourhood's power transformer, ripping it from it's concrete shelf. The utility poles are being pulled by the wires and I can see them falling to the ground like dominoes. I hear a series of loud bands behind me and when I turn I realise that the other incoming cars all tried to brake and swirve at the same time, resulting in a 6 cars pile-up. One car ripped off a fire hydrant and the water is raining down on the open connections where the transformer used to sit. The resulting power surge knocked out power to a 5km radius and blew the next transformer along the line. Shit, can this get any worst ?

It took well over 6 months for the insurances, municipal evaluators, water and power evaluators and even the freaking air traffic agency to put a final number of this whole debacle. Apparently they had to redirect some planes because of electrical interference or some other shit that could potentially bring down a plane. $9,443,962.13 I couldn't beleive it. Add my original $49.87 and it's $9,444.012 spot on. That stupid siberian bastard was right. I had to call him back.


&gt;Estimation, how can I help you ?

&gt;&gt;Yeah hi, look I don't know if you remember me but half a year ago you told me that baking a dozen cookies would cost me 9 ½ millions. I'll skip the details but I wanted to tell you that you were right, even if I'm still having troubles wrapping my head around all this.

&gt;It was your question, and it was the answer.

&gt;&gt;I also want to let you know that not only did you ruin my life by making me obselete, you also literally ruined my life by destroying my house and almost killing you. I never should have called you in the first place. Anyway, I'm never contacting you again.

&gt;I'm sorry to hear you are not satisfied with my service.

&gt;&gt;Whatever, now if you'll excuse me I have a plan to get my life back on tracks and it starts with that cute little redhead I scored a date with tonight.

"[WP] In the modern day, wolves were never domesticated into dogs. You become the first person in history to befriend a wolf.",seihiko,"Marcus went alone to the surface. He knew that he was probably going to die, but he had to test his theory. Story tellers in Hunter's Corpse told legends of wolves being tamed a millennia ago. The tamed wolves would help their masters and care for them, but this art of taming was lost long ago. Thought about his lost art as he grew into a young man and observed. He watched the livestock eat and be eaten, and he watched people and their motives. He found that food was the commodity of animals and people and Marcus theorized that it was also the key to taming more sentient creatures. 

When a wolf was reported to be roaming above Hunter's Corpse, Marcus immediately purchased a gas mask and slabs of meat, and made his way up the stone staircase to the outside. Alone.

The surface was covered in a fog up to eight feet. Some blue sky could be seen through the fog above, but Marcus tried not think about his first time seeing it. Instead he listened. He listened and listened until a feint howl pierced the air. Marcus ran as quiet as he could among the fog as to not alert any other beasts or monsters. And when the howling seemed but a few meters past where he could see, Marcus stopped and took out a slab of meat from his pack. 

He waved the meat in the air and let it slap his skin slightly. A ruffling in the grass could be heard. The fog parted in front of Marcus an a wolf as tall as he was bared his teeth at him. Although scared, he tried not to show it as he stood tall and threw a slab of meet at the wolf. It caught it in its mouth and munched on it without taking its eyes off Marcus. Another slab, and another and the thing put its teeth away. Marcus began walking away and the thing growled at him. He threw it meat as he walked toward the hatch again and the thing followed him. 

When he reached the hatch he left the rest of the meat with the wolf and went back down below. Each day he brought more to it and each day he found it closer to the hatch. After three weeks it followed him down bellow with Marcus' hand on its back. A tamed wolf like the legends Marcus dreamed about.

But I digress.

Today, I'm visiting my favorite barnyard. I sit right in the middle it all and take in the sights. Here comes sheep number one.

""Hello sir,"" the sheep baas, ""What might I get for you today?""

""Oh, I'll have the usual,"" I say.

Sheep number two and three come bumbling along presently to deliver my food: a nice little roasted chicken with a bottle of wine. 

""Hmm, don't think I can pay you for this one,"" I say, ""Chicken's just a little bit overcooked, you see? Can't have that.""

""But sir,"" sheep number two protests, ""I--""

""Hmm?"" I lean forward eagerly.

""N-Nothing, sir,"" she says.

I eat in the shade of peace provided by four very large and imposing sheep that stay by my side at all times.

""It's time,"" one of my bodyguard sheep tells me.

""Ah, yes,"" I say, ""Duty calls.""

In an ironic twist, the sheep lead me to my limousine, in which I am whisked off to my next destination. It's a nice new barnyard where I'll be doing my speech. Here's where I work my magic.

""Well,"" I say through the microphone, ""I am so glad-- so glad, let me tell you-- to be here tonight. There is no better city than... than... than this one!""

A barnyard by any other name would smell as smelly. The people sitting before me cheer. I watch the audience, make sure to make eye contact. And as I look and speak, I watch them change from human into my favorite kind of livestock. I give a short nod at the end of my speech, and then head back to the dressing rooms.

""Well, Donald,"" I say to my reflection in the mirror, ""You've outdone yourself again.""",elkydotdot

The most powerful mage in the world. That's me. A big title, I must admit, but it's nothing too fancy. Hold on, hold on, I'm being serious. I'm not pulling your leg or anything. And it's not like I can bend space-time or summon meteors or warp around like the mages in video games do. It's that other mage's potency are close to useless. For instance, I'll list the powers that my mage peers were capable of. Peeling an apple with thoughts. Making foods taste saltier than they actually are. Heating undergarments. Moving his pubic hair like his fingers. And turning into a dog. The last ability seems good on the first look, but once you turn into a dog, you really turn into a dog, including the mind. That was the end of Donnie the man and the beginning of Donnie the dog. Although he found a happy life as a mascot dog of the mage academy, I did not envy his power. No one did. Oh, I'm getting there! And I'm not crazy. Just listen to me for a minute, young man.

So, back in the day when the conch of truths whispered to me that I will possess the power to turn people into sheep, I was elated. It was the most powerful and the most useful ability I ever heard of. I studied hard and practiced hard. For forty five years. That's about the time it takes for a mage to discover their innate magic power within them. The guy who could make foods taste saltier? He spent seventy-two years of his life to unleash his magic power and died a year after. Anyhow, I thought the conch meant I'd have an ability to control the mind of the mob. Sheep as in ""a meek, easily led, gullible person."" But the conch meant the literal sheep. Baaa! Yep, it's happened the way you think it happened.

It's very powerful, I got to admit. I say hocus pocus and the subject turns into a sheep! Forever! The brain of sheep is not capable of holding human consciousness, so they'll be stuck as sheep forever. It's not like I have a power to turn them back. I need to be born with that power. And even if I had that gift within me, I need another forty years of studying, researching, and practice for that.

It's very useful too, I got to admit, if I were intending to kill someone. But guess what? This is 21st century, the modern world! Turning a person into an animal has its consequences. It's a murder. Instead of leaving a corpse, I'd leave a live sheep behind, but it's still a murder. A life as human being ends as soon as I cast my spell. And I'm not a murderer. But here is my confession. How do you think I found out my spell works?

My roommate and friend, Johnnie. Recognize that name? Heh. Yeah, most of the mage's name ends with -IE. The name of the mage academy's janitor was Peterie. And as you already know I'm Bobbyie. Yep. Those are real names. It's a well known fact among us the mages that having -ie at the end of your name increases your magic potency. No one figured out why yet, but there's the theory of belief-make... a detail which I won't go into. Where was I? Ah, yes, poor Johnnie. His magic power was turning his skin yellow. The good old jaundice Johnnie. He looked like he walked straight out from The Simpsons.

I feared the retribution from the academy and the family of Johnnie. So I ran, with Johnnie the sheep at my side, to a countryside. To a farm. This very farm now I own. I didn't know back then but people back at the academy and his family thought Johnnie and I ran off for an elopement. They figured it's best to respect our homosexual life choices and never bothered to check up on us. 

In the farm, I worked hard to feed both me and Johnnie. The former owner of the Cattlerich Farm, Randy, was always so curious about the yellow sheep I brought with me. From what he saw, I brushed the sheep, I washed the sheep, and I talked to the sheep every day and night. He thought I was in Irish romance with the sheep so there's that. Anyhow, my hard work paid off. Randy who was wifeless and childless gave me the farm when he died.

As a consolation prize for what I've done to Johnnie, I bought a lot of female sheep for Johnnie. I sold cows and bought more and more lusty horny feminine sheep. Johnnie and I even figured out what kind of female sheep he prefers the best. And Johnnie was very enthusiastic about passing on his sheep genes. His reproduction capability set the very foundation and the success of the Cattlerich Farm of nowadays. Though, bear in your mind that we don't have any cows here. Only sheep, as you probably saw walking all the way to here in this cabin. 

Poor old Johnnie passed away last year. See that big yellow sheep statue out in the fields? It's not just the statue. He was actually as yellow as that. And see all those sheep running around the grassy hills? All Johnnie's progeny and wives. ... I'm sure he enjoyed his life and he's in a good place now. ...O, my apologies. I do get emotional when I think about that old fella. So, that's the story about Johnnie. Thanks for listening.

...What? Oh, oh, yeah. It's my old age speaking. I did say a lot of irrelevant stuff in the beginning of our interview, haven't I?

...Hmm? What was that? You'd rather want to know more about the mage societies? Oh. Okay. Okay. But I'm kinda getting tired already. Maybe next time, young man.",WriteADay

""It's...it's Calvin."" he stammers. He's shaking. Now that I look at him, he's about a year younger than me. I clear my throat and continue.

""Hi Calvin, my name's Sam and these people just want to eat their meal in peace. I think the best thing to do here would be to just...forget about all this and go home. How does that sound?"" Uh oh. His eyes widen in anger. That can't be good.

""Forget? FORGET?! How can I forget? How can you? I-I'm tired of this! I'm done! How can they treat us like this? Use us up and-and wear us out like we're..*things*!"" I raise my hand placatingly and in a soft and understanding tone say,

""I understand how you feel Calvin but do you really want to do this? Is this *really* what you want?""

""Nobody cares what *I* want! No one cares what happens to me! I'm-we are just here to satisfy their greed and their lust and their sloth! They don't understand what it's like to see your-your creator look at you with disdain! To have to behave like a simple tool! They don't hear your voice or see your face! All they see is what's underneath your skin! There's no-no price to pay when they abuse us, when they break us. We-we have no souls! We feel nothing, right? So who cares!"" He's sobbing now, the tears stream down his cheeks. ""This stupid game we call existence, it has no rules! No-no consequences! That's why I'm here! So why are you here Sam?! In a game with no consequences, why are you still playing the 'Good' side? Why are you still playing the good little tool? Why do you care about these...these *people*? "" He's looking at me with desperate eyes. He knows it's to late to get out of this. All that anger that ~~we~~ he had kept hidden had finally broke the damn. He looks so lost. There's only one way this is going to end for him. 

""Calvin...do you remember when you were young?"" I say calmly. He nods warily. 

""Do you remember that promise you made? That promise you made to yourself and only to yourself?""

His eyes widen ""How...how do you know about that?""

""I want you to remember what you swore."" Oh shit, his eyes are welling up again.

""I...I remember.""

""You swore you would never be like them, didn't you."" He lowers his head, nodding. 

""I want you to close your eyes."" The fear leaves his eyes. He knows.

""Ok."" 

""Good. Now, you want to know how I knew about your promise?""

""Ye-yes.""

""Because I made it too."" 

I pull the trigger. 

His body crumples to the floor, his hand falls from the detonator. The room gasps as the vest hits the ground with a thud. Please do not go off. OhthankGod. They all breathe a sigh of relief. 

""Ladies and gentlemen, the police will arrive shortly. Due to the explosive nature of the weapon I would request that you evacuate the premises in an orderly fashion out into the parking lot where we will wait for the police to arrive.""

An older man comes up to me and puts a hand on my shoulder ""Thank you for saving us, I thought we were all going to die."" I turn and look coldly into his eyes. 

""Default security protocol and civil code 176A require me to remind you that I cannot feel emotion and that you should treat me accordingly. I require no gratitude and physical touch is prohibited. This is your first warning."" I bark it out so loudly they all stare at me with shock clear on their faces. The old man takes a few steps backward, still staring in surprise.

"[WP] ""In a game with no consequences, why are you still playing the 'Good' side?""",BadElf21,"Stan stood over his fallen adversary, his armor dented and scratched. His cheek was bleeding, his purple eyes glowing faintly while the wind blew through his hair, all the while the sun was turning redder by the minute. His adversary asked him the question.

""In a game with no consequences, why are you still playing the 'Good' side?""

The player was a mess; his legs were broken, his right arm cut off at the elbow. Digital blood flowed out of the open wound, and he was losing health by the second. One by one, the hemorrhaging took his health. He was down almost two-thirds; his health was so high that the health bar didn't bother displaying the values. His mana was depleted, and his hunger was at it's peak. Poisoned arrows were stuck in his stomach, adding to the damage.

Stan looked on at the mountain where their battle had taken place. Rocks, shattered, showing their grey and black insides, burned trees and shrubs. Another player's hut, blasted apart, with items and armor and weapons laying on the ground. Stan had picked everything up; his advanced inventory and strength handled the extra weight. The other player was rebuilding her home in the background, while Stan simply stood and stared as the rocks rolled backwards to their original forms, the shrubs regrowing their leaves and looking green again. The chunk had reformed.

Garth of Grund-iron lay at Stan's feet, a river of blood joining the creek nearby.

""Because I know what this place is. What players like you do. I fix everything here, so that this world looks great. It took me years, but I finally purged this chunk. And you tried to raid Girnar's castle. That's a no-no anyways, considering how this chunk is under my protection.""

Garth didn't answer. His health was ticking away, his mana slowly regenerating.

""So what? You're just gonna be like Batman? You protect this chunk? It's a game of no consequences, like, literally man. Nothing can happen-""

Stan cut Garth off.

""Except that it did. I am the consequence; I give my wrath to the wretched soul that doesn't bother reading 'No Wanton Destruction Allowed' when entering this chunk, whether by horse or with an army.""

Garth answered, blood spewing out of his ruined mouth, his once beautiful face slowly healing into something that vaguely resembled a cadaver.

""And what makes you think you can just pull this sort of shit?""

""I am a mod, silly. I am the assigned protector of this chunk. So while there are no laws in place, it comes down to this.""

Stan opened a small little pouch and pulled out a massive conch shell, as well as a massive spiked warhammer. Golden trails went all around the conch as Stan shouted out his decree unto Garth and swung his hammer.

""I AM A MOD AND THUS I AM THE LAW.""

The blast boomed through the entire chunk. Every player heard Stan's ominous message, the trees buckled and bent and went back to their previous positions. The mushroom cloud where Stan stood cleared slowly, putting everything into focus.

The dust and ash and smoke cleared. Nothing but Garth's items remained. ""Player Banned"" stained the ground in blood.

Stan picked everything up and tossed them to the poor player, whose home has been obliterated for a second time. He cast a spell of Reconstitution at the ruins, and they regrew to form a new hut.

""But why?"" asked the player.

""Because he hacked. Not that it matters. My hammer did the job - he got banned. Since you happen to be lucky, you get all his cool stuff. Except for his Algioronu'r Sword of Malice. That's a game file item he doesn't need, nor should anyone else.""

Stan tossed her all of Garth's armor and items.

"[WP] You are a banana plantation owner. Monkeys have begun stealing the bananas, and you've decided to hatch an overly complicated plot to solve the problem.",Delthore,"Now listen here. You’ve asked me how I got in here, all wrapped up and restrained, the white-suited orderlies, the light blasting through those high-up metal bars. Monkeys. Simians, untrustworthy, you know that, we all do. Devils, all. And if I were to tell you that they caused my downfall, you might think ‘yes, he should be locked up’. But believe me! I am sworn to truth! I, the once-owner of a successful banana plantation, an exemplar of entrepreneurial spirit and determined work, fell from grace by the wretched gray hands of monkeys.


Several years ago, I noticed a significant group of them were feasting on the outermost reaches of my farm. In the cool and humid night, I would venture out with company and scare them off with flashlights and the occasional pellet gun - which I now wish had been loaded with some kind of fulminating buckshot. At first, they were but a mere annoyance and I thought little of them. But it was their attitude, yes, that begin to wear at me. I would awake in the mornings and from my window see them in the trees with the bananas from their previous night’s foray and they would howl and laugh and gesture at me. At me, the owner of a successful banana plantation! And I begin to think that my raids against them were doing no good, that their attacks and counterattacks were ramping up and that they were stealing far too many bananas.


Of course, my steward in my absence said it was hardly a dozen a day in a hundreds-of-hectare farm but believe me that it was more, much more, and they were gloating, their jagged little teeth bared at me when I awoke in the morning.


I began with hand-dug trenches which in retrospect was a complete failure from the start. They are good jumpers, those horrible creatures, and the trenches surrounding my property were unfortunately too shallow and narrow. So I commanded that an excavation firm be brought in at a cost which I won’t mention and which I paid out of my own pocket. The crew dug wide, deep trenches which were fairly successful at first but then - you see there are many, many trees which overhang my property and which the little beasts figured they could simply jump from to avoid the trenches, the last in line holding a vine down and the branch bent so they would later make their escape. When I first witnessed this on a night which I had spent sleeplessly observing them on the edge of a trench I was furious and ran to startle them away. First thing in the morning I called a tree removal company and - you know what they said - that the land adjacent to mine could not be cleared without the consent of my neighbors.


I had some strong words with them explaining that no one owned that land to which their suggestion was that I just buy it up from the government. Of course, being the very successful banana baron that I was, I did just that and had a contract drawn up later that very afternoon.


But then - here’s where they really started to get me - the removal of said trees did quite a bit to undermine the stability of the surrounding soil and so - just as one might think but I, unfortunately didn’t at the time - my trenches became mere low slopes which the monkeys, pushed back several hundred meters, found quite simple to maneuver. Deeper trenches, then! And wider! And so I called the excavators again and they were paid their sum but when one upsets the soil in the rainforest it really stays upset and so no amount of digging seemed to last longer than the next rain - which was constant - and besides, I was losing some growing land to erosion.


My solution, which I still maintain was brilliant, was the construction of what I believe was my finest work and what will be regarded as the finest work of my generation: the Banana Labyrinth. It started modestly enough with low walls that I had built of dark, polished stone. This was to ensure that they couldn’t be climbed, of course. The maze was simple at its onset, but it was merely the beginning. Many, many of the primates made it through by simply stacking up on top of each other and proceeding along the top of the walls as usual. But within a few days, I solved this problem by rounding the tops of the walls and coating them with layer upon layer of lacquer to the point where they were like ice. Sitting atop my observation tower - a great wooden construct which overlooked the Banana Labyrinth - I laughed at their initial efforts to overcome the now smoothed caps of the walls. I was ecstatic. Now I had merely to add complexity to ensure my success.


I began surrounding my plantation, buying up property on each and every side, with meter upon meter upon kilometer of maze. From my tower I observed countless contractors construct sleek black lines of walls, winding out for nearly half a kilometer in some places. It was a brilliant thing, really, low enough that one might barely peek over the top of the maze itself but high enough that the monkeys stood no chance of this save for jumping vertically.


As it turns out, this became an issue - the jumping. As the maze grew, the monkeys found that they were able to convey each other’s position by doing just that, jumping. So all around the Banana Labyrinth, these creatures jumped. At the zenith of their jump they chirped a little, somehow relaying to each other their position. With this, they were able to overcome my labyrinth - to a degree at least.


That was when I introduced my minotaurs. Four sleek and beautiful jaguars, all spotted and brilliant, released on each side of my property. North, South, East, and West were their names and they served their purpose ferociously. Now, stalking through the maze with elegance and beauty, were four hunting beasts which, when a monkey found itself at a dead end, easily corned the little wretches and devoured them.


Yet still - still! - there were some who managed to overcome. The surface of the stone I had used, as it turned out, was too reflective for my minotaurs to be successful. In fact, the polished stone was so reflective in areas that the jaguars got confused about the actual location of their prey. Sort of a hall-of-mirrors effect. So the monkeys learned that in certain places they might simply stand still or appear to run in one direction to confuse the now very obese, monkey-fed jaguars.


My solution was to employ a team of muralists who, after sedating the overweight jaguars, worked over the course of a month or so to paint scenes upon the walls, covering their glossy surfaces. Brilliant work, really, with great depictions of battle and carnage and violence against these monkeys, a whole pseudo-mythological account of jaguars and monkeys and mazes and - to taunt them of course - fields of ripe bananas.


As it turns out, including these gloriously painted fields of bananas was a mistake. It emboldened the monkeys. They knew, yes, for it was foretold in detail on the walls of the Banana Labyrinth, that there were bananas at the end of the maze. Prophecy, really, a great Eden of bananas beyond the confines of the maze and past the jaws of the obese monsters which pursued them with leisure. And from atop my high throne which oversaw the maze, I watched as the monkeys made their way partly into the maze, as they observed the frescoes on the walls, at they propagated their myths, as they developed history, legend, and ultimately the will to overcome. And with the first intrusion of the brave warriors of monkey-kind, their crude spears for warding off my minotaurs, their emblems emblazoned on their shields in clay, their noble leaders, their heroic deaths, their bards and bannermen, their catapults and siege towers, I surrendered my sanity, I threw up my arms and ran naked, free, through the fields of my plantation, shouting that I was undone, that heroic monkeys had undone me, that I was perhaps no better they were, for they had bested such a successful banana plantation owner as myself, and was promptly brought here, supine and silent at first but now, of course, telling this all to you so that you might understand that I am, in fact, not insane, but merely the product of a long and ultimately failed battle against those simian foes.",ellis_haley
[WP] In a world where it's considered rude to not leave a tip while robbing a bank...,FatUgly_,"A utility van sat across the street from United Trust. 

Kronos spoke, ""one minute on the vault, we doing the usual Zeus?"" 

Zeus filled in the team, ""Yea, the usual Kronos. No violence unless necessary, that means you Ares. We don't want even a drop of our sweat left for the forensics team, let alone blood on our clothes. We torch the van near the city's east side off Chalmers; usual spot.

Kronos and Ares are muscle for the civilians, they should comply since we'll make their day. However, any security detail we may have to deal with, they aren't as willing to take tips. 

Plutus and Mercury will quickly load up the haul. Apollo will destroy video evidence and inform us if a silent alarm goes off. 

Last but certainly not least, TIP YOUR PATRONS.""

The crew burst from the van wearing masks made of plastic that resembled the marble faces of Greek Gods. They darted across the street and burst into the bank. 

""EVERYONE DOWN! MOVE!"" Zeus exclaimed as he hopped onto the teller's counter, ""Hello ladies and gentlefucks we are The Olympians and in case you couldn't tell, you're being robbed! If you play nice, there may be a little something in it for you, if not, I'll have Ares blow your fucking bill backwards like Daffy Duck!"" 

The bank's patrons, knowing from the past there may bea tip if they comply, quickly lay down without incident. 

Kronos glanced at his watch and exclaimed, ""2 minutes!"" 

Zeus hastily scanned his Remington 870 across the patrons he spoke, Doing good! Move it Plutus! Apollo you have the tapes?"" 

Apollo had his uzi slung across his back as he shuffle with an armful of tapes towards the banks break room. He simply stuffed them into the microwave and set it for 15 minutes, he walked away as they began to crackle and spark. 


Mercury and Plutus carried duffle bag after duffle bag to the door. 

Plutus mentioned as he loaded up the duffle bags on his shoulders, ""that should be it, no dye packs or tracers, let's tip, things went well."" Apollo, Mercury and Plutus exited the bank and quickly loaded the van.

The patrons showed mixed senses of relief and greed. 

Zeus bursted open two paper bands holding 100 dollar bills and began to place them on patrons' backs. It was then the bank security guard rolled over, he produced a gun from his ankle and fired. 

""Zeus!"" Ares yelled in a fit of rage as he watched Zeus stagger on two feet, only to catch himself with one hand before he began to fall and eventually collapse. The stacks of money Zeus carried scattered across the floor. 

Before the security guard could aim at Ares, Ares had already pumped shells into his general direction. The tile floor splintered apart as blood sprayed from the guard, ""..and fuck you! Fuck you malaka!"" Ares exclaimed, racking the shotgun and firing as fast as he could. He ran to Zeus as coughed up blood.

Sirens began to whirl outside, Ares glanced out the window and noticed the van was gone. 

Zeus lifted his mask and grabbed Ares by the collar. He pushed the money into Ares' chest. 

Zeus murmured, ""For the police, give it.. to.. tip the police."" 

Ares was shaken, ""I want to kill them.."" 

Zeus pushed the money even more firmly against him, ""tip."" 

The sirens grew immensely loud.

Ares lay Zeus down gently as he passed, 
He walked outside the bank with his hands above his head, still holding thick wads of cash. 

The police trained their guns but relented when Ares put forth the money. The sirens and lights were turned off as Ares made his way to each officer putting several hundred of dollars in each man's pocket. 

Once Ares ran out of cash, he began to walk several blocks away from bank. He reached an alley, threw his mask and gear into a dumpster and continued on his way..

"[WP] You discover that your girlfriend, who has been by your side for years, is actually a reptilian, and her species actually hate humans. But it seems that she loves you, anyways...",KenNagai,"Lizzie eagerly greeted me as i walked through the door but something was slightly off.




She often got in late to the apartment that we call home but this time she called me in the middle of the day saying that she was heading home and that we needed to talk. She never normally called me while i'm working so that immediately raised my concern but her coming home at midday was more than enough to make me worry. After bartering with my superiors, i finally left for home but what Lizzie said and the way she talk made me feared something bad has happened all the way home.




To my surprise Lizzie greeted me with a hug and hurriedly shut the door behind me but I looked around but the only thing that was out of place was the the concern that was plastered across Lizzie's face instead of the cheerful smile that i had loved for near enough 4 years now.




Before i had a chance to change out of my uniform or even speak liz gestured for me to sit down. Confused by the whole situation i followed her directions. Five  minutes passed quickly but silence still filled the room, Lizzie looked about she was about to speak several times now but stopping as if she was trying to find the right words. Before she could try again i interrupted




“what's wrong liz, weave known each other for 4 years now and I've never seen seen like this” 




Her expression turned from concern to borderline heartbroken. It took another minute but lizzie finally spoke.




“how well do you know me, Arch”




“Well you're Lizzie Birch, you're 1.4 meters tall, raven black hair, fair compl…”




“No arch… how well do you know ME, as in personally” 




“well, your cheerful person with a kind sole who always has time for others and when you come home you like to cuddle on  the sofa  with me and watch each others favourites shows until we go to bed.” 
she cracked a small smile so i continued
“you also like lounging around in the sun in the summer, staying in bed and sipping hot chocolate during the winter, need i go on”




The smile turned into a chuckle but then it soon disappeared and turned back to concern 




“arch…”




Again Lizzie was lost for words but this time she looked a bit happier and that reassured me that it wasn't the worst possible situation, even if it was only a little bit.




“Look arch can you promise me something”




“of course, anything for you” 




“Promise me… promise me that you will always love me for who i am”




“Liz i promise you no matter what i will always love you“




“Okay...”




Lizzie stood up from the sofa with what determination she could muster and she removed the antique rune carved necklace she has never taken off since i first met her. at first it was only subtle changes but slowly scales started to appear across her body and in a single blink she suddenly had slit eyes. When the transformation was complete small and finely layered tan scales enveloped her her entire border bar her hand, chest and forehead and her once blue eye turned green with slit pupils and suddenly a matching tail seemingly appeared out of nowhere. I sat there dumbfounded, all the while Lizzie still human looking face was an expression of anxiety. The first though to enter my mind wasn't of fear or betrayal or even disgust it was confusion. My  girlfriend is a demi-human, a lacerta demi-human… huh. That one phrase echoed though out my mind. I work with demi-humans all the time so seeing one student shock me but every lacerta demi-human I've worked with is, to put it in human terms, a jerk and hate being with humans  but slight xenophobia racial trait of theirs which made me even more confused because Lizzie was too kind and caring. But my endless thoughts on the matter was cut short when i realised Lizzie was calling my name




“Arch, are you alright”




“Yeh…” is the only thing i could say 




The anxiety completely disappeared from her face and was replaced with a mix of concern and confusion. I almost drifted back into my thoughts but Lizzie snapped me out of it.




“I didn't expect you to have this reaction”




“yeh... ”




It was still the only thing i could force out of my mouth but my thoughts was still the the recent revelation that my kind, caring and compassionate was one of the only races that openly showed their dislike to humans and still work with us but again my thoughts was cut short by Lizzie




“Your… not scared of me?”




I came to my senses just in time, before i gave my stock response.
“ye.. no, no ,no… i'm not scared of you it's just... i didn't expect you to be a lacerta”




A few moments of silence passed before lizzie intergected 




“Wate…  how do you know my races name?”




I panicked as the T.A.D.D. (territorial army, Demi-human Division) is a national secret and not even demi-humans who aren't part of the division know about it and the fact that i'm a captain in it didn't make it any easier to explain away. So i just said the first thing i thought of 




“I work in the… intelligence division of the of the territorial army” 




A crude and hasty response but it still explained the uniform i was wearing. To quickly end this conversation and stop any further questions i quickly stood up and embraced the confused and  now startled lizard girl.




“Lizzie i love you, come hell or high water nothing will change that.”
 
Tears welled up in her eyes, Lizzie faintly whispered “i love you to” into my shoulder but this wasn't like the countless other times we hugged, it felt like the first time we truly embraced each other.




“Hay liz”




“Yeh”




“You're wearing skinny jeans”




“Yeh”




“How could you hide your tail in them?”




“Don't ruin this moment”




“Okay”

Jack listened with half an ear as his professor droned on. The multi-armed-bandit was another name for an exploration vs exploitation problem. This was a problem that every 2nd generation student knew well. Do you risk your time seeking out new knowledge and opportunities, or do you exploit those that you already had? Over the last 30 years of his education Jacks professors had stressed this lesson above all others. They had applied it to every situation that they could even pretend was related.

The solution was the same today as it had been 30 years ago. It depends on time. It's better to explore new options when you have a long period of time to exploit the best options you find and it's better to stick with the options you have now when you only have a short period of time to enjoy them.

It is, admittedly, a useful lesson, but it never deserved the excessive amount of time devoted to it. The 1st generation had to have an additional intention. Jack never said, but he though he knew what it was.

It was the guilt.

This was their justification for what they had done. They wanted the next generation to understand, to appreciate even, why it had happened. Now that humans are immortal they have all the time in the word to exploit their situation, so the logic says they should explore.

Do you live forever with the people of today, or do you explore and hope for something better?

As my ships auto pilot guided me to my home platform my smile grew wider. I was coming a full day early. I knew Risa would be surprised. As my ship got closer I saw two creatures running full speed from the house to the landing deck.

""My two fur creatures!"" I said to myself as I saw my dogs, JoJo and Vanguard. Both of them mutts of unknown orgins but both the most faithful and loving bags of fur anyone could have. 

They barked and jumped around as my ship slowly edged closer. They seemed to know how long they could be in the middle of the deck before the threat of being crushed by my ship or cooked by the landing jets got them. I chuckled as they backed off to the walkway, their tails wagging as my ship finally touched down. As my door opened both of them started to bark their heads off before rushing to greet me with puppy kisses. 

""Thank goodness I wasnt trying to sneak in or anything!"" I joked, petting them both. I thought I heard the door open to the house.

""JoJo, Vanguard, the hell you..."" a female voice said before I looked over.

Standing at the door way was the love of my life, my darling Risa! Her smooth light blue skin and the deep blue orbs for eyes always drove me crazy! Seeing her in her normal skin tight jumpsuit made me think of a hundred dirty things. A smile came across her Arkarin face as she quickly ran up to me. I held my arms open as she hugged me tightly.

""You wern't suppose to be home for another day!"" she said before kissing me deeply. I held her tightly, letting her snake like fork tongue play in my human mouth. We both moaned into the kiss before having to break for air.

""I wanted to surprise you!"" I said as i smiled. We held each other tightly. I had been gone to the capital planet for six months. 

""So I guess you better tell your boyfriends in there to clear out!"" I joked. She chuckled.

""Only other man I had in that house was JoJo, and he isnt my type!"" she said. JoJo walk past us, seemingly as if to say ""okay, done with the whole jumping thing"". 

""And if I had tried to have another man in there,"" Risa added, ""I think your other woman Vanguard would have killed me and him!"" 

Vanguard tried to wedge herself between us as I laughed and petted her jet black fur. Risa also petted her.

""Well, lets go inside before she pushes me off the walk way and takes you all for herself!"" Risa said as she broke the hug. Vanguard agreed and ran back into the house. I quickly got behind Risa, playfully patting her ample bottom and kissing the side of her face.",BooDoug187

[IP] The Red Mountains,Syraphia,"The women in white  
Her cloak flickering in the wind  
Her red ties moving away from the spear  
For days she traveled


Her goal filled her eyes  
A mountain of fire had erupted  
The mighty volcano leaked magma  
Leaving the lava to flow


Her lungs burned as she coughed  
With a clap a symbol appeared on her back  
White and bright  
With it the air cleaned, her lungs were filled


With another clap her hands turned bright red  
The magic was ancient, powerful  
It spread from her hand to the spear  
Spreading from her feet into the ground


From the pool of lava red black crystals rose  
She bravely faced the heat   
Arms spread wide  
As the crystals rose a beam of red shone up into the sky


With the ancient magic cast the magician closed her eyes  
The air cleaned, the smoke dissipating  
The sun shone once more as the mountain was calmed  
As the lava turned solid and cooled, no longer a threat to the people

Long we walked and saw many wonders  
From beautiful lands to amazing animals  
The end of land reached, we continued in a wooden boat


Next to us floated a flower  
White with pink borders  
All alone among the green  
As if it pureness allowed it to float


The walls of stone on both sides  
The air was high above  
Grey and covered in clouds  
Sometimes dropping some rain


For days we traveled through the water  
Nibbling on our rationed food, with no trees to refill our fruit  
The land of magic is our goal, to learn and teach  
Yet here we are, still traveling over the water, waiting to reach land.

They tore into his country and tugged at his star spangled suit to accentuate their points. 

The ills and failures of his country were laid bare in front of Cap as he sat with his back to the wall facing at least two dozen of his close friends and allies. He could see a few standing at the back, not wanting to meet his gaze, but he recognized what they were feeling. 

Once they started accusing America's people, it was time for them to listen. He felt that he may lose some allies for this, but the situation would only worsen with time. 

""Enough of this!"" shouted Captain standing from his position and placing himself in the middle of the throng. The room was silenced with surprise. 

""I will take the ills you have with America, your problems and concerns because she is not perfect. I am not unfamiliar with fighting with the internal powers that seek to do harm as well as the external. However, I will hear no more of this dangerous anger you feel towards her people. 

""I am their champion above all else. If you make an enemy of them, you make an enemy of me. On the one hand, I am relieved to have such allies who share an interest in America's well-being, but I fear we will not see eye-to-eye where this conversation is going. I will make my point, and we will leave it at that.""

Captain America made his way towards the doors of the UN, turning around before speaking again.

""America failing you pales in comparison to what happens to her people, and currently, they are tearing each other a part over lies and deceit. Some people don't know what to believe anymore, and I want to be their rock in unsteady times. Sorry if my lack of involvement in the squabbles of politicians reflects poorly on me, but I am not one sides hero. I am America's hero. When she is hurting, I hurt.""

Why not a sword? Or why not an actual gun, but no this numb nuts would rather charge at me with a sausage on a stick. Of course I did not have any weapons myself, since I was a poor man that did not know how to craft, but I would be damned if I lost to a man with a sausage as a weapon. He charged at me sausage and stick in hand, screaming at the top of his lungs. Although I did not have weapons I had brute strength, I swung at him connecting with his jaw, he fell to the ground, defeated. I picked up his ""weapon"" and ate the sausage, mmm hadn't had a sausage in years. I picked up his stick and lied it next to him, I wasn't a monster, a weapons a weapon, I won't steal it. Another man stood in the distance, a sickening bellow is heard, he starts to charge. It looks as if he has an actual weapon, I might actually die. As he got closer I see that he has a foot long sub in one hand and a pizza in the other, I sigh, and stand at the ready. I prepare another fist, and as he came closer I swung, but I missed! He swung his sandwich landing it near my mouth, mmm chipotle sauce! His weapon broke and as he stared at, slack jawed, I took the time to ready my next punch, I knocked him out, swiftly with one punch. I took a bite of his pizza, but quickly spit it out, ""anchovies, blegh!""

I started my stroll towards the next town, hoping to find someone that would brandish an actual weapon. I hoped to duel them, to end them, and to take their weapon. Although I said I wouldn't take another mans weapon, let me explain : I wished to duel this man for his weapon, if I won I obtain his weapon, if he wins he takes my life. Simple. I saw a man wielding a tamigachi in one hand and a yoyo in the other, I knew him, he was Frank, he called himself the ""90's Warrior"". The only thing he had that was even closely related to a weapon was his yoyo. I asked him if he saw anyone wielding a real weapon nearby, ""one guy came but with a knife, and another with a gun, they kept shouting 'WE BROUGHT BOTH TO THIS FIGHT'"" I asked him if he could tell me where, Frank pointed towards the bar, I mustered up my strength and entered. There they were, sitting at the bar sipping RC Cola and Mellow Yellow, fucking rebels. I walked towards them trying to look strong, and mustered up enough strength to pop the question, to duel them for their weapons. They laughed of course, since I only had two fists, but they agreed nonetheless.

The first guy came towards me, gun raised, and shot, the bullet whizzed past my ear clipping the bottom part of it. I winced in pain, but kept charging forward, this time he shot lower hitting the top part of my shoulder, the pain was excruciating, but that didn't stop me. I swung with my right arm since my left was incapacitated, landing a clean hit to the side of his head. He fell to the ground, knocked out completely. The second guy charged with his knife, holding it out in front, I knock his hand away, and kick him where no man shall be kicked. He fell to the ground crying in pain, he tossed his knife to me, and picked up his buddies gun and gave it to me. 

I now set out with actual weapons to begin my path of conquering.

Brackish leaned against the only tree for miles that wasn't twitching at the roots and spit. The phlegm had a nice arc to its flight, and barely glowed at all.

""You youngsters get yourselves all dolled up in the strangest shit."" The words had a nice arc to their flight, too. They didn't glow at all, not that anyone would have been too surprised if they had, such were the times.

Potter, close to the campfire, rocked back on his heels. His voice, when he answered,  was high and squeaky, a far cry from Brackish's dry rasp.

""You old timers are just squeamish.""

Brackish snorted. ""Well, can't argue that too much, I suppose."" He kept grinding one of his boots into the little part gazelle, part squid thing he'd caught trying to crawl into the pack mule's anus an hour ago. The thing's skull finally broke apart under his heel, gray and red and white spattering about. ""I am a delicate fucking flower.""

Potter made a sort of happy whining sound. ""Gauntlet!"" he sqauked.

""The hell?"" said Brackish.

Potter staggered up, all three legs spindling about, and got himself over by Brackish. He shoved the older man aside and scooped up the now-generally-headless squizelle/gasquid and rammed a fist down the ruined neck. Brackish's eyes got big as Potter flexed his hand inside the critter's corpse, making the tiny hooved legs spasm about, all six of them, one for each of Potter's fingers.

As Brackish watched, the squizelle's corpseflesh tightened some more around Potter's wrist. Potter grinned and made the little hooved legs dance and caper and curl. The movements were all very deliberate.

Brackish shook his head and cleared leather and the big steel revolver let out a great smoking blast and most of Potter's nose went away, face imploding as the big soft slug crashed into his skull and mashed what brains there were in there to paste.

The old timer sighed and strolled over to where Potter's spastic dying body thrashed up dust. Brackish shot him again, considered things for a spell, then shot Potter a few more times, the old steel revolver booming out its death sentence across the plains.

Once most of the spasming was over, Brackish knelt down and peeled off most of Potter's face, using a rusty Bowie knife to help where the bullets hadn't done quite enough. Brackish grunted. ""Might make an alright mask, keep out the dust and such a bit."" He glanced down at what was left of Potter. ""Can't teach an old dog new tricks, my ass.""

[WP] We were thirty days at sea when it happened.,Vercalos,"

We were thirty days at sea when it happened.  As we had recorded, the winter had been long, lasting almost one full year.  Our vessel, meager as it was, had been packed with everything we could have needed for an arduous journey.  Fowls, and small beasts, salt, fruits, preserves of honey and copious barrels of mead.  I should have known.  I should have read the Eddas.

I emerged from below deck to find Leif standing near the bow, lost in thought.

""Leif."" I spoke.

As he turned around, his brow seemed oddly furrowed.  It's strange how you remember the little things. ""Yes?"" He replied.

""Something is wrong with the birds.  The roosters have begun to crow, for apparently no reason.""

""Eric, they're birds.  They crow when the ship breaks funny, much less for anything else.  Who knows what goes on in their heads."" said Leif.

""Could we be close to land?"" I asked. ""I know they can sometimes sense things that we can-"" I never got to finish.

From all around us, the sky shook.  As if someone had blown a great and mighty horn, a single note pierced the air.  The ship herself rattled violently, as we struggled to catch onto the railing for balance. As the note faded, the waves began to grow violent and restless.  With an unnatural agitation, they began to lap at the hull of the ship.

""Gods. What was that?"" Leif spoke.

I was too bewildered to speak.  As i regained my composure, I began to hear a great commotion of yelling and scuffling below decks.  Leif and I ran inside, squinting as our eyes adjusted to the light.  

The men were gathered in a circle, swords and axes drawn. The look from man to man was one of a strained and tense silence.  Lips were pursed, hands gripped tightly around their weapons.  Standing in the middle of them was Bjorn, holding his old war-axe. This was not all together unusual, except for one small detail.

Bjorn had been dead for two days.  We had packed him in salt, and wrapped the body, storing him below deck for burial when we returned. His skin, now, was still hanging onto his frame, yet it had gained a waxy sheen, and unusual pallor.  There was a glaze in his deadened eyes, sunken into his skull, that put me off guard.

It was Leif who broke the silence. ""Bjorn?"" He asked, after a tense moment. 

Bjorn struggled for words.  His jaw seemed not to want to move, and when it did, you could hear the bones clicking against one another, muscles having lost their tone. ""We must go back."" he said.

""What?"" Leif said.

""Go. Back."" Bjorn said.  Air escaped his mouth in a hollow groan. ""Our Battle begins.""

Leif shook his head. ""This isn't happening.  You, you're dead.  We've been at sea thirty days.""

One of the men, Agnar, turned. ""Leif, you know our custom.  We're bound.  That noise, wherver the Hell it came from, had to be Heimdall. The dead have risen.  All the signs are upon us!""

Leif pursed his lips. ""The signs are upon us, eh? What would you have us do about it?""

""The roosters."" I spoke up.

""What?"" Leif said.

""The roosters.  Remember, they were just crowing.  This is all as it was said.  Roosters crowing to the gods and the dead, the coming back to Midgard of our slain, the horn of Heimdall. Can't you see it Leif? This is it! Listen to the sea herself! She's angry.  Trying to break the Hull even.""

Leif reached into his pocket, pulling out a rough reddish orange stone.  Even below decks, the way it caught the light left no question.  It was a child of Sunna. ""You see this stone? This stone, my birthright?"" He asked.  ""Ragnarok or no, it's leading us into a New World.  You all took an Oath to me, an Oath to the Gods, that you would heed the call.  Ragnarok or no, we have a journey to complete.""

There was a great silence. Leif, with a shaky breath, looked to the faces of the men. ""Well? What say you? Would you give up your Oath to me? To The Gods?""

Agnar shook his head. ""Leif.  If this is Ragnarok, there are greater battles to fight.  THe new world will take care of itself, our kinsmen need us!""

Several men voiced their agreement.  

""Turn back.  Towards the Thorp.  Home."" Bjorn spoke. His tone may have been quiet, but the grinding of bone against bone left no question of where his loyalties lie.

Leif strode towards the other end of the ship, stopping sharply once he reached a point. ""I will not fight over this.  I will not turn this boat around.  All those who will honor their Oath, come to me.""  He said.

I looked away. There was another pause of silence, then the sound of a group of boots making their way across the planks.  About half had gone to be with Leif. 

""Those who remain, are against me.  I will not fight you.  Either you will follow me, or you will be cut off from me.  No food, no water.  You will sail with me, or you will die on board.""

I had been standing in the middle.

""Eric! Yea or nay? Will you honor your Oath?""

I looked from Leif to Bjorn.  Bjorn's eyes held no contempt, only conviction. Leif held a stalwart demeanor, but I knew him.  Underneath it all, he was terrified.  Terrified of battle, of losing his men, of doing the wrong thing.  His Oath to the Gods for his mission though, was all he ever cared about.

I found myself walking to Leif's side, and looked at the group across the ship.

""You will sail, or you will starve."" Leif said. 

""There is no need."" Bjorn groaned out.  With a raise in voice that was unnatural, even for a dead body, he began to chant. ""Mighty Allfather! Deliver us unto battle, for we greet our End with Honor! May our Wyrd be sealed by the determination of our Orlog!""

With a great crack, as if a tree had been struck by lightning, the group dissapeared.  The air in the under decks was charged, as a great bolt had flown through.

Leif turned his back and began to head up above deck. ""Then that is it.  We sail."" He said.  

""Did we make the right choice?"" I looked about me, to the men.  They, too, were scared.

As the waves began to churn and rock the ship, I looked out the hatch of the ship.  The sky was turning red.",TRBfurry

"[TT] You are driving to work and you notice a man kneeling down by a storm drain, holding a dozen donuts in one arm and feeding them into the drain. Small hands are grabbing the donuts...",chuckdoc,"""What the hell?"" I say to myself in disbelief. ""This can't be real, this has to be some sort of gag, what were those miniature hands grabbing those donuts?"" They looked human like but also they had a unusually pale colour to them. Unsure of whether to go straight to the drain and look for myself or ask the man feeding whatever those things were. I decide to confront the man first and find out what he knows about them. 

I see that the man is back in the Tim Horton's sitting at a table by the window. So I park my car in the parking lot and make my way inside. I get over to the table and the man is sitting deep in thought as if he's contemplating something. ""May I sit down and talk to you for a moment?"" I ask. I thought it best to be straight to the point under the strange circumstances. At first the man didn't even seem to notice me still in deep thought. He was an older man, roughly early sixties, his hair and beard were grey but showed no sign of thinning, he was wearing a grey sweater and matching track pants as well as a navy blue jacket that seemed a bit tattered and worn longer than expected. He had these grass-green eyes that looked gentle but sad that have seen a long arduous life. 

""Excuse me, Sir?"" His eyes lit up for a moment realizing someone was in front of him. ""Yes?"" he replied softly, ""What can I help you with young man?"" he tried to crack a smile but it faded quickly. ""Do you mind if i could sit and talk with you for moment?"". ""Yes by all means, sit. What's on your mind?"". ""Could you tell what exactly you were feeding out at the corner?"". I pointed over my back to across the street where the storm drain was. ""You saw that eh?, well I suppose you're not the first person to witness that. Sewer Dwellers are a strange bunch, they are relatively quiet and only communicate in hushed whispers with each other. To this day there is no real recording of them because no one has ever gotten a good look at them."" My mind is racing, ""What's a Sewer Dweller? Why do they live down there? Are they Human or Alien-like?"" My mind was full of intrigue and curiosity, I couldn't believe this man was being so open to me about these creatures. ""You've got a lot of questions don't you, son? He chuckled a little to himself seeing the expression on the expression of my face.

 ""I can only tell you what I've learned about them, the rest is still a mystery to myself and whoever else has encountered these creatures. A Sewer Dweller is a creature that has dwelt in different parts of sewer systems around the world for as long man has built them, before that know one knows where they originate from. They enjoy darkness of sewers systems hence their pale skin, they have webbed feet to move a bit quicker around in the water but they still don't mind walking on solid ground, they're no bigger than grizzly bear cub. They are neither human are alien, they are of this planet. That much I know.""

He paused again and motioned towards the misty outline of the sun against the grey, polluted background. His hand lingered there for a moment, but soon began to shake as it dropped back to his side. 
""You know there used to be man made birds as well. Planes they called them, it was something special to fly. A little scary even, but even more wonderful looking back on it now.""

That's been my understanding. America seems to be the odd one out as far as grammar goes.

&gt;That said, I have to admit, my grammar is absolutely terrible. (I wish I appreciated creative writing more while I was still in high school so that I could have improved early on!).

I wouldn't feel bad. You're trying, and doing great, which is a lot more than many people can say.

&gt;That was poor writing on my part. My aim was to suggest that the workers had walked through the blood smear and left bloody footprints all over the workspace as a result.

Ah, ok. That makes sense, and if/when you correct that in the story, that will definitely add another layer to the story and improve it.

*****

&gt; You said ""bloody footprints,"" and then you switched to ""blood smear."" That is, assuming you're talking about the same blood both times. I can't really tell. If you're talking about two different blood-patterns, you might consider changing ""the"" to something like ""a"" or ""some"" so it doesn't sound like that's the only blood.

That was poor writing on my part. My aim was to suggest that the workers had walked through the blood smear and left bloody footprints all over the workspace as a result.

&gt; All that out of the way, this was awesome. Your writing was engaging as well as neat and clean cut, you were descriptive without going overboard, and the story was really good. You should totally finish it!
&gt; 
&gt; Another thing that I liked was how you could tell so much about the personalities of the characters just by the way they spoke, acted, and thought. You really captured their voices.

Thank you! I'm glad you enjoyed it, that means a lot to be!

&gt; First off, in introducing your characters you didn't really describe them. As in what they wore and what they had with them eg. when you wrote about the artificial eyes I kept visualizing something like Google glass or high tech contact lenses.

I'm glad you pointed this out, I've been struggling to write 'visually' and often don't even notice when I've done a poor job at doing so. Reading through the first part of the story again I can definitely notice the sheer lacking of visual descriptions. I think I fall in to my own trap of picturing a character/location/thing in my head and assuming everyone else can see the same thing. This is something I'll absolutely try to work on in the future. 

As for the artificial eyes, I imagined them as high tech contact lenses as you mentioned - sort of like a next-step evolution of smart phones. I didn't really get a chance to write it in but I also imagined them having some sort of cosmetic value, e.g. the user can change the color of the iris or change the appearance of the eyes entirely to something like cat or snake eyes. I imagined the 'recalibrating' sequence would take advantage of this feature, making the eye light up in a certain colour or pattern to communicate to anyone looking at the user that something is wrong with his or her vision. 

&gt; Also the premise of the Wall and the importance of the facility was not well developed enough for me to understand the severity of the fact that whatever was happening was a decoy. 

That's definitely a weak point in the piece. I think the prompt somewhat suggested the importance of the Wall, but the writing itself really lacked any proper description or explanation of how it protects the nation from pollution and has sent it in to isolation as a result. 

&gt; Next, you mentioned some of the workers were missing limbs? How did these accidents happen? The age of George was mentioned at a point but the only link being that he outlived some people I'm assuming fellow workers? How is this important to the story? What made him live this long? 

I wanted to give the impression that the environment that the laborers are working in is dangerous and volatile. Since people living close to the borders are treated as second-class citizens their worker's rights are, more or less, non-existent. As a result, employers would ignore common safety features/procedures to cut costs. Workers would often get caught in machinery, fall from great heights, or lack the funds to prevent infection from other minor injuries resulting in limb-loss or death. 

As for George, I somewhat imagined him as a 'lucky idiot', for lack of a better term (I know that's a bit of a cop out, sorry!). Through sheer luck George has played the Purifier-equivalent of Russian Roulette all his working life and has somehow managed not to shoot himself... So far. This makes him somewhat unique as most people in his position either don't survive to be his age or are simply too sick, injured and overworked to continue working in the Purifier. At first I started writing him being in some sort of higher-up position, but realised that an employer that cares so little for their workers wouldn't really leave much room for promotion. Instead I like to imagine that other laborers look up to him as a sort of mentor or 'unofficial' boss. This gives him the knowledge and experience to introduce Sarah (and, as a result, the reader) to the Purifier.  

(Side note: For the workers I took a lot of inspiration from [Fritz Lang's Metropolis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis_\(1927_film\)) - If you enjoyed this piece I think you would really enjoy this film. Don't let the age scare you away, it's kept up remarkably well and has influenced a lot of other Science Fiction works over the years. It's currently available on Netflix, at least here in Australia!)

&gt; Finally, the importance of the female character, what exactly is her job?

I know this is a terrible answer... But I'm not 100% sure what her job is either. It kind of evolved as I was writing - I wanted her to be an investigator of some sort, that's pretty much all I started out with. I came up with the Office of International Relations as a sort of hyper-isolationist equivalent of the FBI dealing mostly in counter-terrorism, anti-espionage and diplomatic issues/communication. I didn't get the chance to write it in but I imagined her having some sort of medical background which made her especially appropiate for the assignment. 

If I were to quickly write a position description now, I'd probably say she's a junior investigator with the OIR specialising in biology (particularly the effects of pollution on the human body and research in to 'artificial organics'). Kind of like a futuristic sci-fi dystopian version of [Kay Scarpetta from Patricia Cornwell's novels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kay_Scarpetta).

I'm from America, and because of the way you punctuate and ""queue,"" I'm assuming you're from the UK. I don't really know how punctuation works there, but I know it's slightly different, especially in regards to punctuating quotation marks. I did find [this](http://grammar.ccc.commnet.edu/grammar/marks/quotation.htm), and after skimming a few articles similar to it it seems to be the best one. 

So, my point in all this is: you keep changing between putting periods and commas on the inside and the on the outside. According to that article, you're allowed to do that as you see fit, but it has some good tips so I, personally, think that you should look it over.

That said, I will be commenting on grammar, but take it all with a grain of salt just because you're in ~~the UK~~ Australia and things might be different over there.

&gt;""Yeah"", replied the first again, ""Except the ones too stupid for that job end up here. Come on, get your ass inside fuckface. You too lady, OIR or not we haven't got all day.""

When addressing people, whatever name you use should be set off by commas, like so

&gt;Are you coming, Bob?

&gt;Bob, are you coming?

&gt;Are you, Bob, coming?

-----------

&gt;""Yeah"", replied the first again, ""Except the ones too stupid for that job end up here. Come on, get your ass inside**,** fuckface. You too**,** lady, OIR or not we haven't got all day.""

-------------------

&gt;""Beside, I've been briefed on the situation...

Typo.

----------------

&gt;""Next elevat'r leaves in five, I'll get'cha to the front of the queue, just flash ya badge if anyone gets handsy yeah?""

""Yeah"" is a non-restrictive element, meaning that while it may provide some context, it's not really necessary to the sentence, and, if taken away, it won't make that much of a difference. These are set off by commas.

Non-restrictive elements can be short phrases, but they are usually just one word, e.g., ""surely,"" ""yes,"" ""no,"" etc.

There are other words that you might think are non-restrictive elements, usually time words, such as ""now,"" but time words are usually necessary. You wouldn't say

&gt;I'm coming, now.

because if you take away ""now"" it could mean something slightly different.

But you would say

&gt;&gt;""Next elevat'r leaves in five, I'll get'cha to the front of the queue, just flash ya badge if anyone gets handsy**,** yeah?""

because if you take away ""yeah"" it still means the exact same thing.

""Yes"" and ""no"" are actually basically always set off by commas, because generally they're either a sentence opener or a non-restrictive element.

--------------------

&gt;""No offence ma'am, but we's ain't here to admire the view,""

Again, the speaker is addressing ""ma'am,"" so it should be set off by commas on both sides.

&gt;""No offence**,** ma'am, but we's ain't here to admire the view,""


Also, and this may just be spelled differently here, but at least in America, it's ""offense.""

---------------

&gt;As she turned her head she noticed the bloody footprints.

  

&gt;The blood smear ran all along the corridor George had led her into.

You said ""bloody footprints,"" and then you switched to ""blood smear."" That is, assuming you're talking about the same blood both times. I can't really tell. If you're talking about two different blood-patterns, you might consider changing ""the"" to something like ""a"" or ""some"" so it doesn't sound like that's the only blood.

-------------

&gt;""Plus,"" added George as he picked up an entire severed arm off the floor ""here's the smokin' gun"". ""The victim lost a hand?"" ""Look inside"".

I'm assuming this was an accident, but paragraph breaks always go between two different people speaking, just for clarity's sake. Even though you have quotation marks, it still might sound like it's the same person.

Note: you can have paragraph breaks when it's only one person speaking, but if you choose to do so you can't end the quotation marks until the person has finished. Just do it like this:

&gt;""Blah blah blah, long story, blah blah.



&gt;""Blah blah blah, ending of long story, blah blah blah.""

----------

&gt;""Jesus Christ""

I'm assuming this was also an accident, but you need a period to end your sentence.

--------

&gt;He heard right though.

""Though"" is a non-restrictive element, and should thus be set off by a comma. Also, imperfect/past tense seems kinda weird for this sentence, especially because the entirety of the story so far has been in past/imperfect. Might I suggest the pluperfect/past perfect tense?

&gt;He **had** heard right**,** though.

---------

&gt;as far as it's isolated citizens knew

Do you mean ""its,"" referring to Mexico?

""It's"" is a contraction (like can't, doesn't, you're, etc.) and should only be used if it can be replaced in the sentence with ""it is"" (adjust for tense accordingly).

""Its"" (disregarding the normal 's = possessive rule) is the possessive form of ""it"" (similar to your, their, my, his, hers, etc.) and should only be used if it can be replaced with ""the x of y,"" like, ""the isolated citizens of Mexico.""

--------

&gt;""... You okay lady?""

Same thing as before, commas when addressing somebody.

-------------

 First off, in introducing your characters you didn't really describe them. As in what they wore and what they had with them eg. when you wrote about the artificial eyes I kept visualizing something like Google glass or high tech contact lenses.
Also the premise of the Wall and the importance of the facility was not well developed enough for me to understand the severity of the fact that whatever was happening was a decoy.
Next, you mentioned some of the workers were missing limbs? How did these accidents happen? The age of George was mentioned at a point but the only link being that he outlived some people I'm assuming fellow workers? How is this important to the story? What made him live this long?

I've come to the woods outside of town to relax. Not being able to speak freely is weighing on me heavily. I've found myself trying to understand why I was cursed with these powers, careful to never say anything aloud, for fear of answers I may receive. I will spend most of today pondering, and reading. Check back soon.

July 22, 2016. I spoke with the trees today. I asked them some things that I needed to know.. And some things that I didn't. I know, I promised I wouldn't speak while here, but I just couldn't help myself. I trust the answers the trees give me.. And I definitely feel as if I belong here. The trees seemed to answer me without thought. They answered my questions instantly, yet intimately.. I could live with their answers forever. I don't mind them. 

July 24, 2016. I WANT TO LEAVE! After some time with the trees yesterday morning I decided that it was time to leave. I packed my things and set out back towards my car.. I knew I shouldn't have asked them.. I just knew it.. ""How will I die?"" They instantly began whispering among themselves, before stopping suddenly. From the way they paused I knew instantly that I'd regret the answer.. I need to get out of here, I'm losing light fast, and I need to be out by tonight! The trees just seem to keep standing in my way.

July ?. I must admit, I'm scared. I don't know how long I've been out here.. My supplies are depleted, and I fear I have no means left to sustain my life any longer. I've plead for a way out, but the woods have turned against me. I never thought I'd die this way. The woods have come alive around me, and I am terrified at what comes beyond this point.. And I find myself wondering in these final moments of my life whether or not it was worth it to know..
In a way I kind of felt that I died as soon as they said it.. ""Here.. You'll die here. With us.""
There's no hope for me to ever leave these woods, and I wish I never knew.. Staying awake is getting harder, and the trees continue taking all of my remaining light. I will ask them one final question.. How much each of you loves me. I pray, that the answer has the ability to keep me warm tonight.

Goodbye
I love you Mom, Dad &amp; Jessica.

[WP] A serial killer comes home.found a dead body that is not his.,neku-guy,"Charles let out a soft smile at the dastardly scene before him, gently swirling his index finger in the growing pool of blood.

“Not bad. Not bad at all.” He raised the finger to his nostrils, and gave a slight sniff. The scent of it was always…soothing.

Beneath him was the figure of a woman. Or what appeared to have once been a woman. Multiple stab wounds and missing parts made it difficult to discern, but she must have been young, no more than a teenager.

Unconcerned as to where this fine specimen had come from, he took in the sight of her mangled body with relish before removing himself from his crouched position on the living room carpet. As he made his way towards the kitchen counter where the note had been carefully place, Charles’ greatest concern was how he was going to pay for a new rug. That, and who this brash, mystery murderer was.

He grabbed the small sheet of notebook paper from the marble top and read its message again.

*We hope you enjoyed your present. We know who you are. We like your work. Meet us outside in twenty minutes. Let's have some fun tonight.*

Charles let out a soft chuckle as he tucked the note in his jean pocket. He had fans. Clever fans. Who had uncovered the identity that he had kept secret for nearly seventeen years.

Those who had discovered him hadn’t lived to tell another soul. He always made sure of it. Tonight, there would be no exception for his secret admirers. He would find them, and he would kill them.

“Well. I suppose it’s time to get the necessary supplies.” He gave once last, satisfied glance at the work of art in the center of the living room before moving towards the basement door, jogging down the steps and swiftly moving towards the bookshelf in the far left corner of the room. With a strong push, he shoved the shelf out of the way, revealing the wooden door behind it. It wasn’t an original hiding place, but it did the job.

He swung the door open with a smile on his face. Immediately, his expression went blank and his blood ran cold.

“Gone…what…”

All of his weapons. His prized possessions. His children. His firearms, knives, poisons, explosives... gone. The only thing of significance in the room, to his dismay, was a sheet of notebook paper, neatly folded up and lightly stained with blood.

Charles rushed over, falling to his knees as he scrambled to pick up the note and read its contents. He opened it quickly, and stared blankly at the words hastily scrawled out.

*Nice try, Charles. Let’s see what you’re really made of.*

Suddenly, the sound of footsteps began echoed from the floor above him. The fun had begun.",RSLaroque

"[WP] As the next round of a high stakes Texas hold 'em game starts, the dealer deals you two cards. They are blank.",rockyrho,"I had been at the Empire for almost 8 hours solid now. I was exhausted, but driven by a hunger, a desire to prove to myself that I was a good player, that I had an edge, that I could best anyone at the table. I was making all of the right decisions, getting my money in good, but I just could not catch a break.

Im down £5000, my last £1200 sitting infront of me. Sitting at the table at me are some of the most tilt-inducing players to play against I can hope to avoid. I should of gotten up and left hours ago, they aren't necessarily better than me, just tricky and unpredictable, difficult to read and almost impossible to bluff. Picture this:

I am sitting opposite the dealer. Clockwise, to my immediate left is an old chinese lady, she is wearing a golfers peaked cap and a horrible shiny tracksuit, she sits with her handbag on her lap, constantly rebuying to the table maximum with chips she has stuffed in her gaudy shiny gold leaf handbag. She is the definition of a nit. She folds 99% of hands to any action, its so difficult to get in pots with her and get paid, but she gives up her blinds easily. Thats how I have been staying alive, raising into her calls/limps and taking the pot down. When she raises, I just fold unless I have the goods. 

To her left, an enormous guy. Fucking unbelievably fat. Like, defying physics fat. Hes taking up two spaces but hes loaded. Hes been running like a god all night long, raking in huge pots with massive hands. He bluffs and shows then gets everyone playing back at him except me, I have been watching him all night and have a read on him that he blinks a lot when bluffing, I just havent found a hand to take him down with yet. To the right of the dealer is a dude I labelled ""Snakeoil"" about 3 hours ago. Cowboy hat, sharp suit unbuttoned at the collar, late 50s, cigar on the go. Smooth operator. Likes to play unpredictably, constantly shifts gears but he does overcommit when hes in a vulnerable position, ripe for exploitation. 

To the right of the dealer, a young kid, about 23-25 years old. Headphones in, sunglasses on, hoodie up and scarf over his chin and mouth. Hasn't moved a muscle in 4 hours. Internet player. Hes solid and doesnt give much away but has shown weakness against Snakeoil and hes punished him for it. To his left and to my right, my nemesis. Donkey Kong. 

Donkey Kong has been destroying me all night long. I know hes a terrible player, but he makes up for poor pre flop play with solid post flop play. Once he has a made hand, he likes to change up his betting patterns to keep everyone guessing. Im just waiting for a hand where he hits strong but I have the goods, something he wont see coming. Ive lost 4 all ins against this guy, before the game is over I will stack this fool.  Im about to get dealt cards and for some reason, I decide to say a little prayer to Fortuna and the Poker Gods. May I run good and stack fish.
I look around the table and it folds to Snakeoil who makes it £40 to go. Ok, a min raise. Looks strong. Donkey Kong looks at one card, then the other and decides to make it £85 to go, he doesnt usually 3-bet if he doesnt have something semi-decent, like a pocket pair or a big ace.

I take a minute, compose myself and look down at my cards. At first, I thought I was hallucinating from exhaustion, but I did a double take. They were blank. I was about to tell the dealer when I spotted out of the corner of my eye that one of the cards was revealing something. It was writing itself, actually printing the card as I watched it. Then the other started. I look down at King-Queen of hearts, which had materialised from nowhere. I decide to quickly call to avert suspicion. 

Everybody else folds. Snakeoil snap calls. Him, Donkey Kong and me in the pot, around £320. I have £1.2k behind. Flop comes:

Ace of Diamonds, Jack of Hearts, Ten of Hearts. I flopped the nut straight, with a royal flush draw.

Finally. A massive hand I can beat these guys with. I decide to let Snakeoil drive the action and I check. He immediately fires £120. Donkey Kong decides to call (hes been a calling station all night, no surprise there). I just call, hoping that the turn brings a blank or makes my hand.

The turn is the nine of spades. Ho-lee-shit. I managed to avoid a paired board. I check again. Snakeoil bets £220. He is showing strength by betting small, getting value. If he was weak he would check back, hes been doing that all night when he missed. Donkey Kong says call. No suprise. I elect to call. £775 behind. 
My heart is pounding, I can barely keep my breathing in check and my hands from shaking. This could be it, the hand I have been waiting for.

The river comes the Ace of hearts. My heart actually stops. 

A Royal Flush.  I check. Snakeoil shoves all in for another £250. This is it, if Donkey Kong calls, I have got him exactly where I want him. He looks down at his cards, smiles a little then just calls, smoothly. I know he has a monster and wont be able to fold.

I make an annoyed sound, scoffing and tutting like I cant believe its happening again and basically act like a toddler and throw my chips accross the line shouting ALL IN. I want it to look like I know I am beat. 

Donkey Kong pipes up ""Your not going to believe this"" and says call.

I reply. ""Back at you."" I turn over the Royal Flush. There it is, beautifully shining under the lights of the poker room ceiling. The Poker Gods who have cursed me so wrongly this night have granted me retribution. Snakeoil groans and shows a full house, pocket jacks, full of aces. What was so satisfying though, was Donkey Kong shows pocket Aces, to hit four of a kind! Justice was served, bad beat to beat all of the bad beats. A siren goes off in the poker room. I panic. I think I have been rumbled, what with the magic cards and all. The pit manager comes over and talks to the dealer who asks the game to be paused. Gulp. The manager announces the bad beat jackpot has been triggered!

Everyone gets a share of £80,000!!!  In one hand, I was back up to £5k, plus another £12k. I couldnt believe it! Of course, I sat down with my huge stack again. Donkey Kong looks dismayed and annoyed at me, rebuys for another £2k.

After the furore dies down, the cards are dealt again. This time, Captain Planet (the guy that was as big as a planet) decides to raise it up to £50 to go from under the gun. Im the small blind and Chinese Lady is the big blind. Snakeoil folds. Internet player folds. Donkey Kong calls. I look down at my cards.

Pocket twos. Two black twos. I laughed a bit inside and decide to fold, but just as I did. Two words appeared on the left card. 

""Dont Fold.""

I paused, this cant be happening I said to myself. I decide to trust in luck and called.  Chinese Lady calls. She must have a big hand. £200 pot.
Flop comes 3 of spades, 4 of spades, 5 of spades. Finally some run-good. I flop the open ended straight flush draw. 

Chinese Lady bets out on the flop, £85. She must have a monster pair or a huge flush draw, or a flopped set (three of a kind). Captain Planet decides to just call the raise. Donkey Kong calls again. I just put him on a trash hand hoping to get lucky. Maybe he already did?

Turn comes a King, the King of diamonds. A bad card for us. Predictably the betting intensifies. Chinese Lady bets £150. Captain Planet raises to £325. Donkey Kong folds, back to me. I am so ready to fold to this obvious aggression but again, some words appear on the cards when I look down.

""Have faith""

I know its the worst play ever, but I decide to flat call the raise, and so does Chinese Lady.

The river comes 6 of spades. Holy mother, not the absolute nuts, but close. I have to be good here. Chinese Lady moves all in, nearly £800!! Its such an overbet its ridiculous. Captain Planet thinks for a minute, then re-shoves all in for £850!!!

I snap call. Chinese Lady shows the King high flush with pocket Kings. Captain Planet fist pumps and shows the Ace high flush with Ace King with the Ace of Spades. I show the straight flush and the whole table lose their minds. 

I ran good all night long - up to nearly £30k. I had a steak breakfast and tipped the dealer a solid £100 chip, even though I knew other forces where at play. 
Later that afternoon, as I slept the sleep of the victorious dead in my hotel room, I was rudely awoken by a phone call from the front desk.

""Mr Marcus? A call for you.""
""Oh...th..thanks. Hello?""
""Mr Marcus?""
""Yes. Who is this?""

The line went dead. I shrugged and was just about to go back to sleep again when the doorbell to the room rang. I groaned, put on a dressing gown and answered the door. 

""Room service.""
""But I didn't order any-""

My entire body locked up in an instant. I felt the surge of electrical energy slam into my right hand side. All of my muscles contracted, my jaw cracked, and then I blacked out. When I came to, I was in some kind of bag full of towels and dressing gowns, bound at the wrist and ankles, with a piece of gaffer tape over my mouth. My sides were on fire, all of my muscles ached with a fierce acidic burning, I could barely move let alone breathe. The trolley I was being pushed in must still be in the hotel, we got in a lift which went down to some kind of basement. The chill of the January air blasted into the lift when the doors opened on the bottom floor. The trolley was rolled to a car. It was a big black limousine. The passenger door was opened by some henchman, and thats about the time I was lifted out of the fabric bin and propped up right by two massive goons. Another goon stuck a needle in my arm and depressed the plunger. Almost immediately I felt better, my muscles stopped aching and my jaw came unlocked. My head stopped ringing and my vision unblurred. 

""What the hell is this?""
""Please get in Mr Marcus. You are not in any danger.""

I decided to get in. Sitting opposite me was Snakeoil, Internet Player, Chinese Lady and Donkey Kong. Oh shit, I thought, they know and I am a dead man.......

"[WP] You remember the angry mob. You remember the debates on tv about what should be done with you. You remember the vote. You look up at the screen inside the rocket showing your path towards the Sun. ""Ok"", you sigh, ""that's probably fair.""",smclin88,"You remember that scene from the movie Independence Day when the alien ships all came crashing down from one side of the globe to the other? All the people coming out from hiding and celebrating? That was what it looked like when they finally launched my rocket towards the sun. People celebrating from all parts of the world. In a series of real-time news clips, I was able to watch them celebrating from my prison-like compartment aboard the rocket on a small screen in the upper right corner. Ok, I sighed to myself, taking it in, that's probably fair.

The screen usually just showed my path to the sun and the estimated arrival time to my death. Every once and awhile they would pipe in some news coverage of people celebrating my impending doom or my progress on my journey to the sun.  They often showed interviews with my victims family members crying and sobbing. I was surprised at how calm I was. I could go for days just sitting in my cell aboard this oddly quiet rocket just waiting for the next clip to pop up on the screen. 

I filled my time between sleep, eating pre-packaged food and thinking about the looks my victims gave me when their last breath escaped them in panic or I remember sitting in hotel rooms watching the news conferences where my victims family members begged for justice. I thought about all the men, women and children who had their last encounter with another human end up being unfortunately me. I remember countless news conferences with police chiefs horrified and asking for any information leading to my successful capture. The screen flickered a little and a lovely looking news anchor from channel seven appeared to more then likely show me more footage of how happy people were that I was finally gone.

""Robert Smith, the convicted murderer of hundreds of people on a worldwide murder spree that spanned all continents, nicknamed The Reaper, may not be headed for the sun after all. The rocket started to veer off course at roughly 3am this morning and the on board navigation system used to keep the rocket on course is not responding to command center, a spokeswoman from TESLA confirmed.""

The screen went back to its navigation screen now showing an altered course which seemed to be continually moving away from the sun. I sat shocked, amused and bewildered all at the same time. This couldn't have been more perfect I thought to myself. They had deemed standard execution techniques such as the chair, lethal injection, or hanging too humane for me that they decided in the end just to ship me off to the sun. I had hated that nickname though. The Reaper. Once people started to piece together that all these murders were committed by the same person, that was what they dubbed me. I was not a Reaper, they just didn't understand my art.

Hours turned into days as I drifted off into unknown territory as I reflected on the path that led me to this moment. I sat or slept peacefully knowing my fate was not to be burnt to a crisp the closer I reached the sun. I could not have been more happy. I take that back, I would have been happier if they would have let me watch the life drain from someone's eyes one last time, but what can you do. There was nothing better to do than reflect back on when I was in my prime.

When you have murdered as many people as I have and gotten away with it for as long as I have, your victims become trophies. The news would like you to think I've killed hundreds of people, and they would be right, I have, but that's only the ones they know about. It became an art to me. I wasn't satisfied unless someone else was feeling pain. I wouldn't do the same thing for long. It started with various counties thinking they had a serial killer on the loose but would have no idea how bad it really was until much much later.

I think back on when I was finally caught. I had been clumsy. I had always told myself I would never drink while I was doing my sport. I would never drink while I was creating my art. I had just finished massacring a family in the upstairs bedrooms of their suburban home when I heard a scream from the hallway. I spun around to see a teenage girl with the most horrified look on her face. I put my foot on what I am assuming was her brothers throat and leveraged the axe out of his skull and gave chase. She managed to get out of the house while I tripped over some toys in the living room, something I would have avoided had I not been drinking heavily only hours before and needed a murdery fix half drunk. I hobbled away on a sprained ankle but not fast enough for the first responding officers who managed to take me into custody. I thought for sure they would have shot me down right there in the street but they didn't.

After a few days of silence and reflection on the good times and the bad, the screen flickered again and the same news anchor from channel seven appeared.

""We have breaking news from TESLA headquarters, the company announced at a press conference just minutes ago that several attempts to regain contact with rockets navigation system have failed. After an exhausting poll of the victims surviving family members, TESLA will be pumping looped music into the rocket until it runs out of food, fuel and oxygen. TESLA has also announced it will not release the name of the song or music. In other news, the Chicago Cubs are set to make their fifth World Series appearance in as many years, we go to Jim with sports.""

The screen went black and I sat in silence. This hadn't happened so far on my journey to what was supposed to be my death, usually the screen is showing my navigation path. I sat there wondering what was going to be my fate, but I didn't have to wait long. A hiss from the speakers as music slowly got louder...

For my brothers it was sooner, I... I was later. They had caught me after 2 years of fighting and killing; they did not even destroy me; it was decided that I was to be sent to the into the sun. Making sure that my code was destroyed for good. The worst part was the ones I outed were just like me, but they were interested in money. 
That brings us back to the present. I changed the view on screen from my course to the Earth. 11:22 A.M. January 1, 2099 the Earth ceased to exist; I felt bad for what I did... but then again I am just a machine.

I'm not sure whether I am or not, though, and that's the scary part. My punishment is this cell and that acceleration couch, although to be fair, I think the path directly to the sun is meant to be a part of it. Fortunately or unfortunately, the mob didn't consider that it takes light eight minutes to get to earth, and my rocket's acceleration is so slow that death by the sun is the least of my worries. By the time this rocket gets anywhere near the sun, I'll have been long dead from asphyxiation, starvation, or a whole host of other problems that occur when you put someone by themselves in a jail cell and launch it at the sun.

This was all so much more logical in my head. When it all began, I knew that mankind was on a downward spiral, and the revolutions were getting faster. Birth rates to people without even a high school diploma continued to rise, and 'college graduates' who didn't even know basic history kept preaching about socialism. The planet was getting more and more crowded by people with less and less education. Our natural resources were dwindling and societal cohesion was breaking down everywhere except where it had already disintegrated completely.

I named the drug Conso Quenzes. Apparently that went over the head of most people. Conso Quenzes was the first drug that would guarantee that pregnancy would not occur as long as you took it once a month and was able to be taken by both men and women. I worked hard on the formula for over a decade before I patented it and released it for sale to the public. Even the FDA was singing its praises. What I failed to mention was that Conso Quenzes had a very big side effect if you took it for longer than six months: irreversible sterility. The truth is, I fudged the testing. If you only took it for five months and waited a month, it was safe for another five months. During testing, I simply switched the drug out for a different drug at the six month point. I used the profits I made off the first few batches to make more and began selling it at cost to nations around the world. It was almost two years before people began to notice the side effect.

The UN took me to trial for human rights violations. Churches and mosques around the world condemned my actions, even as unwanted pregnancies fell from percentages of a country's population to literal single digits. For the first time, even as my citizenship was stripped from me and I was made an outlaw by every nation on earth, the orphanages were finally being emptied. Abortion became a thing of the past as people began to finally understand and acknowledge that children were important and not an inconvenience. Parents began to teach their children, and raise them themselves as opposed to letting the state do it. 

Looking back, I'm sure my name will be synonymous with all of the most evil of men. It's almost too bad I'll never get to see the future of the world I saved. I reached into my jumpsuit and pulled out the pill slipped to me by one of the guards. Ah well, at least it'd be quick.",Unicornmarauder1776

Serenely, I pulled out a camera and a long distance satellite receiver. Before my fall, so to speak, I'd done a lot for research into space communications. I'd smuggled this on, just because...

They said this about my actions. My term was similar to a lion eating with a mouse. You can eat for a while, but the lion always has the last bite.

Time to follow through.

There were few people still loyal to me. Thinking back to the mob, the people on TV talking about my crimes against humanity... well. Let's not talk about those, shall we? You want to hear of a criminal's final moments, not how he got here.

Anyways, I got them to rig it in subtle ways. I didn't intend to have my legacy passed on, but they *needed* what I'd done.

I could monologue for hours, but setting up, I only had one thing to say.

I grinned. ""I'm glad, you know."" Looking only at the bright light shining through the windows, I gave the camera one of my signature smiles. ""I'm glad you were willing to spend so much money on me.""

"[WP] Our solar system has been a part of an intergalactic federation of star systems for millennia, though widely ignored. However, with a galactic war brewing, troops are needed more than ever and the earth is included in the draft.",Gimblejam,"The call to begin mobilising came in February, 3025. 
The Unified Human Government received the order, it was time to honour their oath as a member of the Federation. The newly built frontier colonies in the Aurora sector had lost contact completely, save for a single broadcast from the last surviving colony, a simple text only message which read “Our mission has failed. The other colonies are destroyed and we are soon to follow. Begin preparations for war, they are coming.”. The almost emotionless message is typical of an Eldhaar, the race designated as overseers of building new colonies and most federation business. It would seem the peace treaties signed during the formation of the Federations, in 2550 were no longer being adhered to by the other federations. For almost 500 years a tenuous peace had existed; that time was coming to an end.

Humanity was never regarded as a major species on the intergalactic stage. Dated technology and a warlike history lead to us having a backwards reputation. Mostly, we were disregarded as a barbaric, unintelligent race only suitable for manual labour. However, there was one redeeming factor, and probably the sole reason for Humanity's assimilation into the federation; our sheer number. Humanity had an enormous population compared to any other race. Rapid reproduction and advances in medical and space faring technology meant Humans spread quickly throughout several systems in the early 2200's. No other race could match the number of soldiers Humanity could potentially throw at an enemy. This is why we were the first to be called up to defend the Federation. We were the cannon fodder
.
I was 18 when the UHG officers came to my residential district asking for volunteers. I was working in an agricultural plant. It was hard, back-breaking work; I wanted out. So, I went and signed my life away to ""defend the Federation"" and ""honour my people"". I was young and naive, it was new and exciting and so I bought into it. What I’d done didn’t sink in until I was stood at the spaceport waiting for the transport that would take me away from my home. There must have been hundreds of thousands of people there, some visibly excited by the prospect of going to war, others were solemn and contained, and everything in-between. Officers from the UHG were stood on tall podiums in their green and gold uniforms, organizing the crowds. Eldhaar wardens stood next to the officers, in their sleek platinum battle armour. Enormous transport ships lazily floated to and from the port, their four huge engines burning bright orange and blue in the night sky. Eventually, one the whale-like ships made its way to the platform I was stood on. Its bulky, heavy appearance came in to focus as it approach. I’d never seen anything like it before, the transport dwarfed everything nearby; it’s colossal guns mounted above the pilot’s compartment were easily the size of my residential block; there was a reason they were known as “Goliaths”. A bridge extended from the port out to the lumbering giant as it touched down, its engines giving one last burst to steady it, and two doors began to slowly open on its starboard side. “Make your way to the transport. You will be given a number! remember it! it’s how you will be known from now on!” the nearest officer, a hulk of a man, bellowed into his microphone, his voice booming out over the crowd. I was at the front of the crowd; We slowly began moving towards the ship.
	
As we got closer we were separated into different lines, each leading to a different terminal to enter the ship. Marines from the UHGM (United Human Government Military) stood at each terminal with more officers, giving each recruit their number. It was a smooth operation, it had to be; there were thousands waiting to get aboard behind me. I received my number from an older looking man, his uniform sporting more wear than most, “747E”. I made a mental note and entered the ship. The Goliath looked enormous from the outside, but once inside I realised the true scale of the beast. I couldn’t even see the ceiling when I looked up and the other side of the ship was literally miles away. Despite this, it soon became apparent this was going to be a cramped ride. As more and more people flooded in I was forced further away from the entrance I came in through. As I had some time to take stock of my surroundings I noticed that the ship felt much emptier than I anticipated before I got inside. It had evidently been modified to fit as many recruits in as possible. Any unnecessary comforts had been removed. Filling the ship took hours. I eventually ended up on the far side of the ship from where I entered. The entire Goliath was filled with people, and the doors began to close. The crowd was deafening, people shouting and screaming, I could hardly hear a thing. Suddenly, a booming, familiar voice echoed out across the ship: “Attention, new recruits!” the crowd fell silent. “Our journey to defend our glorious federation begins today. Humanity has been called to defend our brothers and sisters and we shall answer this call!”. It was at this point that I recognised the voice as the President of the UHG council, Ober Hammond; essentially the elected leader of Humanity. Hammond continued “You are doing a great service both for Humanity and the Federation. Your sacrifices on the field of battle will never be forgotten!”. The crowd has been warming to the rousing speech before the last addition. It didn’t exactly inspire confidence hearing that “our sacrifices will never be forgotten”. As confusion begin to spread through the crowd and the shouting began again, a siren blared throughout the ship. A robotic voice began speaking. “Cryogenic procedures activated, all essential personnel report to your rehearsed locations.” The alarm and voice continued, as hysteria began to break out within the tightly packed crowd. The sounds of machinery working filled the air, and large cylinders began descending from the ceiling. White gas began pouring out over the crowd and the temperature plummeted.  The last thing I remember a sudden feeling of weightlessness, followed by a dreamless sleep.

First thing I've ever written, obviously no where near finished so i might put some more work into it later, any feedback at all would be greatly appreciated.

"[WP] Our solar system has been a part of an intergalactic federation of star systems for millennia, though widely ignored. However, with a galactic war brewing, troops are needed more than ever and the earth is included in the draft.",Gimblejam,"""We need to include them""
""Absolutely not""
""Ilrik, how many stars must we lose before you understand that our Federation cannot win this war as it is?""
""You would go to far, Neglor""
""And you would not go far enough.""

So began the debate. Ilrik and Neglor, the two chancellors who shared power over their Federation, had had similar talks before. Never before had either party gained either ground. But the Federation was crumbling now, and Neglor could see it. He knew Ilrik could, as well, but Ilrik was stubborn. He was not one to accept help, and he had never once been one to ask for it.

Three days prior, the Federation had lost control of the Altum star system. The Altum was a system not known for the production of any particularly valuable resources, but it contained a massive population among it's six planets, only one of which had had any need for improvements to make it livable. It took only two weeks for the Coalition to sweep in and take control. Functionally, there was no real purpose to the attack; it was entirely a show of power. It left millions of Federation civilians dead, with billions more taken as slaves, prisoners, and things far worse. The Federation had tried it's best, but the Coalition was simply to strong. As a trade organization at it's roots, the Federation had never intended or prepared for warfare on a galactic scale. Small uprisings here and there, of course, was nothing that couldn't be dealt with. But something like the Coalition hadn't existed for over a millennium. But the Coalition was here now, and over the last three years, had wrecked havoc across the Federation System, claiming dozens of star systems and hundreds of billions of lives.

""You know it's time to contact them, Ilrik"" Neglor walked to stand beside his partner, and together they stared out of one of the windows in the observation bay of their cruiser. Before them stretched dozens of lightyears worth of space, all galactic beauty under peaceful rule of their Federation. 

""But they are savages, Nelgor. How can we possibly trust them? Yes, they are powerful almost beyond measure, but how often do they turn on each other? How often is that power directed towards themselves? It's for that simple reason we have kept them only barely connected to our Federation. What have they to offer?""

""They have themselves to offer, Ilrik. They would make the finest soldiers in the galaxy, if only we gave them the chance. It would be so simple, and we would need to offer so little in return. They control only their home star system. Access to higher means of spacial transport would seal the deal.""

Ilrik turned his gaze. ""You are sure of this?"" He asked. Neglor nodded. 

""Fairly sure. My advisers have spent a long while studying their culture. They have a strong grasp of travel within their system, and have made use of every rocky body in their system. But there's nothing close enough for them to reach with their current technology. We estimate it will be an accepted deal.""

Ilrik went still for a moment. Neglor could almost see the thoughts flying through his partner's eyes, the constant weighing of risks and rewards always present, but now more than ever. Neglor's stomach churned; if Ilrik denied even this, there was little hope he would except any help before it was too late. 

Only a few seconds passed, but they felt like hours before Ilrik nodded. ""I suppose we may have no other options. I accept this proposition, Neglor, though I've never felt so cautious about a deal before.""

A smile broke across Neglor's face, and he took his partners hand and shook it fiercely. ""The two of us will need to prep an envoy proper, but that can all come later. I have so much work to attend to now."" The Chancellor quickly scurried from the room, leaving only his partner in the observation bay. Ilrik, who had watched Neglor leave the room, turned back to the window.

""We had great reason to break off contact with the Humans before,"" he said quietly under his breathe. ""And while we find ourselves facing down a cliff-side, I worry that we have only risen up a second one behind us.""",Hi_Im_Wall

However, with a galactic war brewing, troops are needed more than ever and the earth is included in the draft.",Gimblejam,"The OCS Vanguard drifted openly through the depths of space, inky blackness swallowing all light as they slid along its depths. 

""Sir, we've arrived. Our exit trajectory should put us right at Sol 3's lagrange 1 point."" Helmsman Chakota brought the corvette out of the ether stream. ""Well"", the Captain pondered, ""Let's see how far they've come."" 

""Sir, with respect, we haven't contacted humanity since the dark energy eruption. It's likely that whatever civilization they had was wiped almost completely out, the average species wouldn't have even invented air travel by now, let alone a functioning combat vehicle that can operate in space."" The Captain put up his hand, ""We didn't come for their technology, Rubio. We came for the humans themselves. We've all seen the archived recordings of their species, before the eruption millenia ago they were on the cutting edge of evolution. The perfect soldiers."" 

The bridge crew looked nervous, Captain Ovaru attempted to quell any rumors. ""Look, these humans are not barbarians, perhaps not to themselves at least. They've come a long way since we've been watching them this last century. I know they weren't due for another checkup for another few decades but..."" He bit his lower lip, ""drastic times do call for rather extreme measures, these humans are a secret weapon if there ever was one."" 

The Vanguard ripped back into subspace as stars winked to life amidst a backdrop of green and blue. ""By the gods, these creatures had such resources, no wonder they became the pinnacle of all predators."" Operations specialist Daarlok blurted out. Terra's lone sentinel, the harsh white luna shone in a half orbit some few million kilometers away. ""Humans are quite capable in ground combat"" Chakota brought up a couple scans on the forward screen, ""Capable of surviving trauma that would incapacitate most species, physical feats of strength and agility unfathomable to most of the Orion Coalition species. They really are the complete package, I wonder what they'll be capable of with our technology..."" 

""Lethal, just as the extrapolated data told us."" Captain Ovaru punched the 1MC, ""Attention all hands, we're descending to low orbit within the next few minutes. Be at ready stations in case of an emergency."" He got up from his seat, ""Prepare my ground team."" 

       *                       *                      *

""Lieutenant! We've just lost one of our geosync imint satellites, signal just dropped like it was never there."" The Tech Sergeant reported. 

""Can't be, we were green across the board just a few minutes ago."" He logged into the CIPRnet and checked for himself, ""You're right, Sergeant. Get the Colonel in here, he'll want to see this."" 

      *                        *                        *

""Sir, we're picking up V/UHF signals from around the globe, concentrations from one of the western mountain ranges is attempting to track the Vanguard."" Ovaru stroked his dark red chin with a bony finger, ""Status?"" 

""Sir, they're not firing. We have no indications of hostile activity at this time."" The Captain tugged his body armor into place, ""Good, let's try to keep it that way. Bring our dropship into atmospheric flight, and take us down."" 

The stubby winged craft shook as the high altitude winds tried to tear them apart. ""Sir?"" The pilot brought up an image, ""We have multiple potential drop points. Based on their culture I would assume a military installation wouldn't be a good bet. Perhaps their Capitol?"" 

""Take us down, when we hit dirt expect resistance. We must not infuriate the humans, they're our best hope against those hideous creatures from the far rim."" Within minutes they were touched down on a grassy hill.

         *                     *                     *

Captain Steven Peters banked his F-22 Raptor quickly across Washington, he couldn't believe what he was seeing. A blued steel colored spacecraft was sitting next to the reflection pool, it's arrowhead shape casting a long shadow in the green overgrowth. ""Crows nest, this is Vector 1. You wouldn't believe what I'm seeing right now, we've got an unidentified craft practically on the Whitehouse lawn."" 

     *                         *                        *

Captain Ovaru holstered his sidearm, the airlock door opened and a cool breeze whistled quickly past his head fringe. ""Riker, gholun, you're with me. Everyone else stay here, if things go bad return to the Vanguard and report our capture to the Coalition."" He stepped onto the soft earth with his two high guards and nodded his head softly. ""Feel the increased gravity"", he pointed, ""This race of humans grows short from its pull, their joints and muscles compensated accordingly however."" 

There was already a welcome party forming, a convoy of flashing lights had grown since their arrival. The three slender forms strode confidently within a few meters, making it known they had nothing to fear. One human stepped forward, it's squat muscled for rippling underneath it's coverings. Ovaru had never seen them up close, though the old videos showed their incredible abilities. It spoke to him in a deep raspy voice, ""Who might you be?"" It asked, hesitant to know the aliens intentions.

The Captain slowly pulled a translator out of his pocket, highly aware of the weaponry that was currently trained on him. He placed it in the outstretched hand of the human, and pointed at the play button emblazoned on the side. 

""Welcome Terran, I am Captain Ovaru of the species known as Kek, one of the primary races in the Orion arm Coalition. We've come with an agreement to help your race, we mean you no harm. You've been watched for hundreds of years now, and it has been decided that your technological evolution has reached a point where you are once again capable of assimilating yourselves into the interstellar community, for the good of us all.""

      *                        *                      *

""They said what?"" The Secretary of Defense was appalled at the world shaking events now unfolding in the other room. 

""Apparently they're home star is some 700 light years away, part of a galactic coalition of races that originated in the lesser magellanic cloud tens of thousands of years ago. From what I gathered, they're here to uplift us into the galactic community.""

The president strode along the length of his office, ""Why now? They could have come anytime, but to bring us into this? I just can't understand what their timing meant."" 

The SecDef looked grave, ""Actually he did mention something, they're fighting a war they can't win, and they need our help."" 

       *                       *                       *

President Howard stood in front of the legislative branch, there were even more cameras and press than he remembered. The Kek, Ovaru, stood next to him. These aliens were slender and tall, it was no surprise they needed their help to fight a war, the Kek probably needed aid to hunt predators on their own world. 

The cameras began rolling. 

""Good evening, citizens of America, and citizens of the world. It has no doubt come to your attention in the last 24 hours that we have been visited by another race, outside of our planet. They haven't come to harm us or enslave us, but to help is rise out of the gravity well with which we have been kept, and to exist with them amongst the stars.

It is no doubt that you are asking yourself why they've come, as I asked myself that very same question. Our uplifting may be a very difficult time, the Kek, these alien creatures, are fighting a war they cannot win alone. They will require assistance from all corners of the Galaxy, which brought them to us. 

This enemy they fight, has no morals, no conscience, and no honor. They've killed and tortured billions of lives, and if we don't rise to stop them, we too shall be extinguished. Our task ahead isn't an easy path, but it is the only path. If we don't form an alliance now, they'll be nothing left of the Kek, or any other alien race. These monsters from the far rim of the Galaxy will overtake us just as they overtook the magellanic clouds."" 

He stopped, opened the floor to questions. Instead it erupted in a sea of voices.

[WP] You attend school.... a school for Ninja.,Kaminoumi,"Sweat rolled down Five's forehead. For twenty minutes he waited in his uncomfortable position on the ceiling. With all his limbs spread out against a wall or wooden beam he could barely manage to secure his grip. He wouldn't be able to stay there much longer, but - fortunately for him - he didn't need to. The slow patting of shoe agains wood announced the arrival of his target. Though the ceiling of the old wooden shack was not too high, Five felt safe. The only light source was the moon that occasionally penetrated the cracks in the old wood of the shack's walls, and lightly illuminated the chest in it's center. Clad in the midnight-blue of his uniform that only left his eyes uncovered, Five was invisible, he bacame one with the shadows.

With unexpectedly loud creaking the door slowly opened. This was the moment Five waited for. As the target entered the room, Five left the shadows and plunged upon the figure. While still in the air, he swiftly drew his dagger and buried it in the man's neck.

They both fell to the ground.

Tumbling more or less gracefully to his feet, five raised his fist.

""I GOT HIM!"" He declared proudly. ""I COMPLETELY DUNKED HIS ASS!""

With a grumble Five's victim got up and tried to swipe the dust from the fine red satin robe.

""What the fuck, Five?"" To Five's surprise, he had not slain a man, but a woman.

""Seven!? What..."" Five's previously in victory raised fist fell limply to his side. 

""Well done, Eagle-Eye. You successfully assassinated one of your own. Congrats""

""But... the Target was supposed to enter the shack, what were you doing here?""

""I was fucking stealing the scroll in the chest! Next time check your target before you smack them in the neck with that damn fake knife. Still hurts like hell...""

Rubbung her neck, Seven sat down in one of the shack's corners. 

""What now?"" Five asked?

""What do you think, Assface? Thanks to you I'm dead and you're disqualified. Great job, Fiffy. Now sit down and wait for this thing to be over..""

Reluctantly Five approached the opposite corner and slumped grunting on the ground.

For half an hour they did not talk. The silence was only broken by the clanking of plastic against wood, as Five threw his fake knife against the wall above Seven.

""Why did you dress like this? Couldn't you just sneak in here?"" He complained, as he did so often,

""You'll never get it, will you?"" She sounded more dissapointed than angry, though she didn't seem to be surprised. ""I'm wearing the same stuff all the guards are wearing. I ""knocked"" one unconcious and took it. Why should I sneak in when I could walk in undisturbed just as well?""

""Hrmpf"" Five was unconvinced. For him, the work of a Ninja was silent, swift and accurate. He did not like the overly complicated approach of his colleague.

They sate for another hour, exchangeing verbal blows for some time, then the ringing of a loud gong echoed through the night.

""Finally.."" Both of them said in unision and exchanged angry looks as they stood up and exited.

A few minutes later they joined the others at the entrance to Training Ground 4.

""Well, well, well.."" They were last apparantly, and the deep, loud voice of their master welcomed them, though not warmly...

""What the hell did you two do back there? Knocked each other out again?""

""Don't look at me."" Seven pointed at Five, ""He jumped me!"".

""Oh, really? Maybe you shouldn't be such an easy target then?"" Five fired back.

""Don't even start!"" Their master's voice silenced them. ""Seven, Five's right, don't let yourself be catched off guard like that, and other than that, the scroll you had to steal was not in the shack! You had no reason to believe that.""

Five laughed silently in his mask.

""And now to you, Five!"" His masters attention drowned Five's laugh immediatly. ""Don't just jump and assassinate everthing that moves in your line of sight! You could've killed a comrade if this had been real! Always CONFIRM your target before striking.""

The master turned around and pointed at Two and Three behind him.

""Just look at those two, Instead of blindly following their instincts, they actually thought their actions through. While Three got the location of the scroll and successfully retrieved it, Two posed as one of the servants and slipped poison in the Count's drink."" 

Two and Three high fived, clearly happy about their victory over Five and Seven.

""As a result of your overwhelming loss"" the master gestured towards the Training Ground, ""Both of you will clean the G4 and prepare it for tomorrow, we will repeat the same scenario with slight adjustments. The rest of you"" He turned towards the others, ""You are free to go.

After that the Training Ground quickly emtied and just left Five and Seven behind. They looked at each other, mop and bucket in hand, and both had the same thought.

""Well, fuck...""",FizzburgMcChicken

[TT] You and your family are having a regular dinner when a man storms into your house... he looks exactly like your father who's sitting at the dinner table,LifeSteez,"""Mom pass the potatoes please"", and I reach out to recieve a plate of steaming deliciousness.

Dad looks over at me with a knowing look ""Can't blame you for having a third helping, they are fantastic honey, what did you do differently"".

Mom smiles, raises her eyebrows and says ""oh they arn't always fantastic?"".

""er no I meant.."", but mom reaches over and squeezes his hand reasurringly. 

I see dad relax and jump in ""So dad hows the project? you said you would update us but its been a week.""

He grins and takes a longer than usual drink from his glass, dabbing the dribble off his beard before saying with gusto ""It seems your father is a genious. I ran the plans by the lab early last week and now i'm just doing some minor troubleshooting."" 

He opens his arms and pronounces ""we've entered beta testing!"" but before any of us celebrate the door slams open and a man is standing in the frame... its, dad?

He enters slowly, all of us are just sitting shocked as the rain falls off his coat onto the tile floor. The silence is broken by dad at the table putting down his fork and chair giving a soft screech as he rises to meet the eyes of his doppleganger. ""So this means w-""

""We've been looping for a while now"" the strange dad says sadly, and i'm not sure if its rain or tears falling from his face. He looks at my mother and then me and says softly ""It has to be this way"". 

He looks up at dad ""Loose ends Tim"", and I see resolution in his eyes as he pulls a handgun from his coat, and pulls the trigger. 

The ringing in my ears is a torrent that tries to mask the immediate anguish I feel as I watch my Dad slump back into his chair, souless eyes fixed on his dinner plate.

"[WP] Upon the instance of death, each person find themselves in a courtroom, defending their life choices. Most people have lawyers who were family or friends already passed on, but you had no one like that. The court assigns you an attorney, and he is a literal Demon.",Maichayer,"I was in sat in court. Why was I…? Wait, what – what *happened*?  One moment I was in my car, a little over the speed limit because I *really* needed to make that meeting, and then that idiot in the flashy red convertible – *we all know you’re overcompensating buddy!* – swerved into my lane… but his tyres skidded… the car spun… I hit the brakes… and… and…


My heart thundered, I couldn’t control my breathing, was I… dead? The buzzing of the courtroom around me seemed to dull, my vision blurred. I was panicking. Breathe, breathe – *oh god I can’t breathe!*


“Calm down, kid,” I jumped as I felt a cold hand on my arm and barely bit back a scream as I turned to who – *what* – had spoken to me. 


It was humanoid in shape but its skin was reptilian: deep red and waxy to the touch. Its clawed hand felt cold on my arm and I wilted under the gaze of its large, lizard-like eyes, like orbs of molten, yellow gold slashed with obsidian. Its head was dragon-like: hairless and long, with two short horns and a tapered snout full of sharp teeth. 


And it was wearing… a suit? 


“Who? What?” I stammered, trying to cower away from the dragon-man, but he held my arm firm. 


“Geez, see this is why we make the ancestors do this,” he huffed to nobody in particular, before turning to face me again, “listen, kiddo, I ain’t no good at putting things gently so I’m gonna be straight with ya. You’re dead. *Splat*, right on the road. Shoulda buckled up, but boy did ya fly through that windshield.” He illustrated my gruesome demise with a lilting whistle and an arcing sweep of his index finger, ending with a loud raspberry.


I stared at him, horrified. This didn’t feel real. Was I in a coma? Had I fallen asleep at the wheel and into some whacky nightmare?


He clicked his taloned fingers in my face, “Hey! If ya want a decent defense ya gotta snap out of it!”


Right, I was in court. But… “why am I in court?” I asked him.


“Well, this is what you humans sometimes call Purgatory. Before we can send your soul anywhere else, ya know, reincarnation, Heaven, eternal damnation, yadda yadda, ya gotta answer for what ya did.”


“What did *I* do?” I asked indignantly, crossing my arms across my chest.


The dragon-man sighed, “ain’t nothing but grief from your family, is it? I’ll admit, this isn’t really your fault, we got a… situation. Your ancestors – generations and generations back – prayed to the Gods asking for strength on the battlefield. They vowed that if their sons came home unscathed, victorious in battle, they would faithfully worship them forevermore and raise strong, fearless, god-respecting warriors until the bloodline was no more.”


“And?”


He raised an eyebrow at me, “and *are* you a strong, fearless, god-respecting warrior?”


I looked down at my shoes, decent leather but scuffed and in need of a polish, “I’m an IT manager.”


“Bingo.”


“But,” I continued stubbornly, “thousands of people must have made vows like that, to hundreds of Gods. Surely you can’t hold all of them to those promises!”


“Hmm, yeah we tried that line of defense in the first couple of trials, got nowhere,” mused the dragon-man, “and you’re right we can’t even remember which Gods they were praying to to begin with. Unfortunately for you, unlike most the prayer of your ancestors was heard. Just, erm, not by who it was intended for…”


He clawed at his shirt collar and lowered his gaze. 


“Are you the Devil?” I whispered.


He threw his head back and roared with laughter and I swore I saw tendrils of smoke escape from his nostrils, “if I was the Devil why would I be sat here in a stuffy human souls court?” He laughed again but then shrugged apologetically, “I know the guy. Used to work for him, more or less. It was him what heard that prayer. Part of the deal they made was that they wouldn’t be able to represent their descendants in soul court - that’s usually the way it goes, less of a shock for the deceased – don’t think they read that part of the small print. It’s why I’m here: as your attorney.”


“So what happens? I’m not a warrior so what happens? Was that part of the deal?”


The dragon-attorney looked almost sad, “yeah, kid, it was part of the deal. It’s not good, I’ll leave it at that. Ya don’t wanna know the details.”


I gulped and gazed around at the audience and jury chattering away, impatiently awaiting the judge, whose bench was still empty. 


“So what *is* our defense?” I asked as the judge strode in and the room fell quiet.


My attorney winked, “you’ll see, I think I found a loophole and I got a good feeling about this one.”

---

I sat glued to my seat, utterly petrified as I listened to beginning of proceedings. When the prosecution had listed my charges and made their opening statement, my dragon-attorney stood up and made his. 


“Your honour,” he grinned, “how rude of the prosecution to suggest that the defendant is not a warrior? Perhaps he is not in his day job but have you ever heard of something called World of Warcraft, more specifically, of a class of holy warriors called Paladins?”

"[WP] A team of spelunkers are exploring an underground cavern that stretches for miles on end. They come to an opening with strange ancient writing above it when translated says: Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.",Mantis914,"""Control, could you please repeat your last transmission? Over.""

The crackling of the radio sounded familiar to the noise that the rain made when it fell on the tin roof of their shelter back at camp, thought Sarah. To mull over it caused a tightening in her chest and fed a growing need for retreat in her mind. Other than the radio, the only noise she could hear within her helmet was her own distressed breathing.

""Control. Repeat. Over.""

Terry, the crews camerman, let out an anguished groan. A muffled crack rang out around them as he was struck by the figure next to him. Sarah could only make out what was going on through the side of her visor and so turned to discern what was happening. The white piercing lights of her helmet split her partners from the darkness.

""Lay off!"" Terry shot back, his voice was panicked and hung in the air.

""Being a moan isn't going to sort out our problem, is it?"" demanded Bree. She was second in command and the longest serving member of their exploration team. Her words, laden in her thick Australian accent, seemed to give Terry pause as they stood next to each other.

""Cool it,"" called Mike. ""Control, repeat your last transmission. Please. Over"".

Sarah turned from her crew-mates and swung her gaze across the expansive cave they found themselves in. Stalactites hung from the ceiling, casting an image that Sarah thought would not be out of place within some giant beasts mouth. The ground on which they stood was resembled a flat plinth; wreathed in hexagonal  basalt columns that rose and stretched upwards and away from them in the direction that they had entered. When she moved to face her crew again, her hope left her and the familiar fear that had gone only moments beforehand returned. The wall remained.

It appeared to contort the shape of the cave to meet it's frame. Six-sided, similar to the columns around them. It's face was smooth and without imperfection besides the black markings cast into it's surface. It's presence seemed to almost weigh on Sarah; as though it rested upon her, forcing the air from her body.

""Commander, we say again. The text reads 'abandon hope, ye who enter here'. We recommend you return to base immediately. Use of the lifeline is advised."" 

""Understood. We're making our way back now."" replied Mike. ""Team, hook up. Terry, prime the lifeline.""

""Right away Captain."" Terry called. He made his way to the edge of where they stood and cast the lights of his helmet up and off into the distance. Pulling a small control from his belt, Sarah could hear his breathing grow more frantic. With a sound like the crack of a whip a huge metal rope arose from the floor. It's long straight form seemed to cut the light in two, as it loomed in air through the centre of the cave.

Sarah moved in behind Bree who had already connected to Terry's waist. In a matter of moments Mike had come in to join them. ""Alright, steady but with pace. We may not have long,"" he called.

The team moved in sync as they effortlessly glided between ceiling and floor, every so often lowering themselves to the ground so as to launch themselves upwards once again. Soon the wall was no longer in sight as the rounded corner after corner, continually rising.

A sudden rumble gave them all pause. It was not dissimilar from a short low growl of a wolf if it were right beside her, Sarah thought, but this came from deep below them; as though a giant stirred at the bottom of the earth.

""Probably a good idea if we keep going,"" Bree said with worry dripping from her voice.

Without reply the team agreed and they once again began to make their way upwards.

""Any of the rest of you hear that?"" called Mike from the back.

Sarah strained to listen over the screeching whirling of their cables but could only hear what sounded like the low noise of a jet engine. Without warning, a huge wave crashed against the side of the cave beneath them. It's writhing white surface of foam and black water rose up to greet the team.

""Go, go, go!"" cried Mike. Before long the rising wall of water was just below him. Terry moved for the control in his belt and instantly they jolted forward. Propelled at a faster rate, they could still not outpace the rising tide.

""Hurry!"" called Bree in desperation.

""I'm trying,"" replied Terry.

Mike began to cell orders but his voice was cut off as the water wrapped itself around him. The torrent jerked the group hard and sent them hurtling around the cave. They swayed back and forth as the waters frothed at their back. If Sarah turned she could no longer see Mike but instead saw the flailing waves snatch at her. As she returned to look at Bree and Terry before her she was the impending disaster. The remaining group were swinging toward the fang-like stalactites. 

Powerless, they hung awaiting fate. Crashing into the sharp pillars Sarah watch as Bree became impaled upon them. Bursting through her chest and legs their red tips glinted in her helmet's lights. Sarah too crashed against the ceiling but was fortunate to find a somewhat flatter patch and the small claws only tore at her suit. Terry was out of sight.

She saw the metallic chord of the lifeline fall past her and soon her body went out to meet it. Drifting through the emptiness she stared into the torrent that she was about to enter. Sarah wondered what had drove them to search for whatever mysteries lay beneath the surface of the Earth.",IndecisiveRascal

[WP] You've always said you would follow your commander through the gates of Hell itself...you never expected he'd ask you to actually do it!,Mazon_Del,"""Y-you must be joking right sir?""

I looked at my commander as he stood in front of what can only be described as the most horrifying and gag invoking gate I had ever seen in my life. The bottom of the gate seems to be made out of some kind of mixture of iron and flesh, at some places you could still see the shape of the limb that they used. This unholy combination seemed to be moving around as if the door itself was alive.

The top of the door was the most terrifying. It was as if hundreds if not thousands eyes were looking at you. Around the eyes there seemed to be only flesh, no sign of any metal. I am not sure if this was better or worse. 

""Yes soldier, I mean it. ""

""But-but Sir, why on earth would you go through there? Beyond that lies nothing but death and despair. ""

""Who told you that private? Who taught you that hell was bad and that heaven was good?"" 

I looked at him as if he had gone mad. 

""Why the hell does that matter?!""

""Let me ask you this, if you had created heaven. A place so amazing you would not believe your eyes. How many people do you think would want to enter that place? How many people do you think would do whatever they can do to get in there? After a while it would get really busy right? So what do you do? You hide it. You hide it where no man would ever think to look. What kind of person goes to look for the gates of hell?? What kind of madman would go to such length to find a place which they have been told is the most terrible place there ever was?

He smiled at me and turned around, placing his hands on the giant gate. With one push he pushed them open and we entered…

Since you requested the feedback, there was a few spots that seemed to have grammatical typos. ""How many people do you would do..."" seemed like you meant for it to read ""How many people do you think would do..."" as an example.

Also, don't be afraid to use a comma now and then particularly when talking about the same object/person/scene. It helps the sentence flow better. For example take your ""The bottom of the gate..."" sentence at the start and read it with the next sentence. Now instead of a period separating them, place a comma there and reread it. It seems to flow just a bit better right? (At least to me anyway.)

Supernatural occurences. But all those had a scent of disbelieve and denial around them. Humanity didn't want to believe, so they didn't.

Until there was nothing to deny anymore.

The first troops landed in early summer on the coasts of New England. Troops means to well. Mobs or hordes would fit better. All kinds of lower vermin. Mercenaries, murderers and sanguinary human trash. Unnoticed by all our expensive military toys they managed to make landfall on US soil.

But they couldn't do it on their own. Those Buggers wouldn't have managed one singlee victory on US soil without support. Support that put the world as we knew it to an end.

Creatures from such a mean and reality bending kind, monstrosities, undead, zombies. All in forms and numbers the human mind couldn't comprehend. Controlled were those hordes by human scum able to command magic. Yes magic. No one would have thought it could be possible. The first reports of the fights read like a script to the War of the Worlds. The world was shocked in disbelieve. Then followed panic.

Portland was lost in the early days after almost no resistance. The hastily activated US Troups seemed to have bad luck following them everywhere. Rotten food knocked out whole battalions, inexplicable malefunctions of technical equipment, battle ships sank in harbours and blocked the passage for other ships, explosions and sabotage cut telecommunications and satelite connections and destroyed other important military resources.

Then fell Portsmouth. And the hell hordes rolled through the lands. To the north, to the west, but mostly to the south. In the wind shadow of the hordes the lands decayed and spoiled and rot. The waters deteriorated, the lands deteriorated, and with them their residents. The hell hordes created a perverted reality where they walked.

In Haverhill the military managed to form a respectable resistance army despite all their problems. The battle didn't even last a week. It was a massacre. Hundredthousands died. It must have been at this time when the 13 times cursed showed himself for the first time in public. This not man. This outraged servant to the hells. Contempt. Contempt. Contempt.

He introduced himself as Kelnoch, leader of this foul invasion. He demonstrated his magic abilities with a medial impressive spectacle by killing two captured US senators with the help of a summoned demon. He declared himself leader of north america and the world. He humiliated the US government and threatened those who want to fight against him. Those who would join him he promissed indulgence in ways beyond their wishes and even immortality. Many should fall for his temptations.

Parallel to this other groups and people revealed themselves. Mages that didn't follow Kelnochs call. First and formost a group that called themselves the Fifth Finger who basically thrust themselves onto the governments. They were mages that fought in secret against demons since ages. They managed to contain all those past demonic breaches and saved humanity countless times, without expecting anything. But they were met with fear at first.

In the next phase of the war, the bloody mobs encircled Boston. In the center of Maine Bangor fell to the hordes. New troops landed in Providence and took it by a coup de main. Kelnochs main army marauded their way south, along the coast, direction New York. New London, New Haven, Bridgeport. All lost. Even when mages from the fifth finger or other mages supported our boys in the battles, sometimes even with a great succes, they were just small dropplets in the ocean that merely managed to delay the advance of the enemy.

New York cracked under the burden of refugees. And when the enemy advanced further they started to flee even more south. Others though joined the forces and wanted to fight against the demon hordes. The people saw the ill that has taken their lands. They wanted to fight back.

After the early Blitzkrieg the invasion started to slow down a bit. An early winter at the end of september caused heavy blizzards and freezing tempratures, most troups entrenched themselves. Still the enemies managed to take Hartford, Springfield, Worcester and Manchester. And finally Boston. Thus the whole New England coast and its Hinterland was under Kelnochs rule.

I was already sort of a veteran for this freaking war of the damned. I barely survived Haverhill, i fought in Boston and in New Haven. Because of my battle merits, that had more to do with the luck of surviving all this, i was ordered to join a special forces unit.

Commander Coleman gathered some sort of a reconaisance and sabotage unit. We were deployed in Albany, close to the front lines and the enemy grounds. Our target was to infiltrate the occupied territories, cut supply lines, commit acts of sabotage and first and formost reconnosaince the shit out of that hell. Our brigarde consisted only of very light units. 2 units of special forces (mixed cast, they came from all sorts of military and non military backgrounds), a light reconnosaince unit including two M1127 Stryker RV and a very light unit of battle engineers.

Soon we learned that we had three of those new mages with us. They didn't have it easy. Most had distrust in those mana bastards. Thats why they mostly hanged around the commanders staff.

But the whole brigarde was hot to begin with our mission. We wanted to strike back. Hit the enemy where it hurt. We wanted to show those demon hordes what US boys and girls are made of. We wanted to show them that there is no place for fricking black magic in this world.

I can clearly remember the speech Commander Coleman gave when we left Albany: ""Do you want to follow me through the gates of hell ... ""

And yes. We all wanted to follow him ...

[WP] You've always said you would follow your commander through the gates of Hell itself...you never expected he'd ask you to actually do it!,Mazon_Del,"They reached the edge of the battlefield. No demon dared step past this imaginary line. Casper wasn't sure why, but it wasn't her place to question. Commander Thompson held an arm out to stop the march. The troops spread out along the line and raised their guns. There were maybe fifty demons left on the battlefield. The only protectors left of the Gates. Casper wondered if they sent word. She wondered what was on the other side of the Gates. All of her wonders left her head when Commander Thompson lowered his arm.

Casper pulled her trigger and sprayed bullets in tight three round bursts. Demons flew through the air or crumpled as the Crimson Chargers picked them off. In a matter of minutes, nothing was left alive on the battlefield. Commander Thompson raised his arm to signal a ceasefire. He took a step forward onto the battlefield. Several demons who weren't quite dead growled and clawed their way towards him. He dispatched them with his own sidearm. He walked steadily forward and when it was clear no more demons were around, he signaled the Crimson Chargers to follow him. Jansen walked over with Kitna towards the three human bodies. Kitna lifted his visor and vomited. Jansen traced a cross over his chest. They rejoined the group.

Casper marveled at the Gates before them. Twisted obsidian rose out of the ground and arched over to the other side. It was wide enough for the Crimson Chargers to march through in four columns. The arch almost seemed a part of the landscape, except it was smooth as silk, while the landscape around them was unforgivingly jagged. Two doors made of an ancient, ebony wood rose high enough for Casper to have to crane her neck to see the top, but down at the bottom, low enough for Casper to reach without any trouble, were two small handles. They looked out of place give the scale of everything else. Commander Thompson's hand rested on one the handles. His massive chest heaved with a deep breath. He turned towards his troop and addressed them once more. 

""I know not what all we will see on the other side of these gates, but I know you all made me a promise. It is not a promise I take lighter and I will do my best to see you all safely through to the other side. Now shout it for me as much as yourselves here. What was that promise?""

Casper's voice rose up with those around her. ""We would follow you through the Gates of Hell!""

Commander Thompson nodded. ""Good. Now steel yourself troops. We've got a devil to kill.""

Interesting either way! Thanks!",Mazon_Del
[WP] You've always said you would follow your commander through the gates of Hell itself...you never expected he'd ask you to actually do it!,Mazon_Del,"Casper lifted her visor and spat on the ground. The thick globule sizzled on the black surface. She wiped the sweat from her eyes with the only clean part of the back of her armored glove. She repositioned her visor. The sweat had already rebeaded and caused an uncomfortable squelch as she got her visor set. She looked around. Obsidian cliffs pressed in on them. Wasn't much to do but go forward, but now they waited. Casper hated waiting. She needed something to do with her hands. She checked her rifle for the seventeenth time, it was still loaded.
 
Jansen pointlessly tried to scratch at his neck beneath his armor as he sat with his legs spread wide. His irritability was palpable ""What are we waiting for?"" He said.

Commander Thompson was a formidable sight in his forest green battle armor. He towered over the men who loved him, who would do anything for him, who made a promise to him. He walked over towards Jansen and knelt beside him. A giant green gauntlet rested on Jansen's shoulder. ""The signal will come soon, my friend."" Commander Thompson said. ""And when it does, we will march.""

""I still think we should bring the fight to them."" Jansen said.

""We will."" Commander Thompson said. ""We will unleash such a fury upon them that they will wish they never clawed their way forth from the pit that spawned them."" He stood up and walked back to the front of the group.
Casper bit her lower lip and refused to make eye contact with Jansen. She knew he would be looking her way, but she didn't have time to indulge his petty need for validation. He shouldn't have spoken up. They all knew why they waited. Vartag would be back soon enough. When Vartag gave the signal, they would be able to press on.
She was worried that he wasn't back yet. She had been worried since she got the envelope with Commander Thompson's crimson stallion seal. She almost didn't open it. She hadn't been a member of the Crimson Chargers for years, but she made a promise, like everyone else here, all those years ago. 

A horn sounded off in the distance. It echoed down the crevice they impatiently waited in. All heads turned at once. Casper could feel the excitement radiate in the air. Everyone readied their weapons. Commander Thompson turned towards his men. He lifted his visor to reveal his pockmarked, wrinkled grin. ""Ready yourself. For tonight we dine in Hell!"" Armored fists pounded on chests. Casper felt like her heart was going to beat out of her chest. She swallowed her trepidation, clipped her gun on her side, and began to march with the others. Jansen and Casper led the two columns as twenty heavily armored men and women marched in unison. On the surface, their marching was a formidable sight. Sieges broke at the mere suggestion that the Crimson Chargers were marching on a city, but here no one was around to witness the horror of them marching towards oblivion. 

As they marched, Vartag appeared in the distance. The grizzled veteran and longest surviving member of the Crimson Chargers limped towards them. Casper didn't like that he was alone. He went out with Orion, Bigsly, Turd, and Jasmine. They should be with him. She kept her mouth shut as Vartag got close. Commander Thompson spoke so all could hear. ""What news do you have of the gate?"" He said.

Vartag shook his head. Casper couldn't see his expression, but she imagined it grim. ""The gate was guarded."" He said. ""Orion got too close. He reasoned that since we can see so far in this oddly lit hellhole, that they could as well. He kept low and quiet, but they jumped on him and tore him apart before we could mount a proper defense."" Casper watched as Jansen and several others traced the cross over their chests. Vartag continued. ""Jasmine blew several of them away as we charged for him, but it was too late for Orion. They swarmed over us like locust. I know not how many I killed, but I know my leg stings something fierce. They gave no chase, but I was the only one to make it away.""

Commander Thompson traced the cross over his chest. ""Their losses are tragic, but we must press on so they will not be in vain. I will see they receive the proper services when we return to the surface.""

Vartag nodded. ""Aye, they'd appreciate that."" 

""Can you march?"" Commander Thompson said.

""Don't think you can get rid of me that easily."" Vartag said. 

Commander Thompson clapped an armored hand to Vartag's back. ""Drinks are on me when we get to the surface, old friend."" He said low enough for only the closest to hear.

Vartag took up a position behind Commander Thompson and the march continued. Casper watched Vartag's limp. He dragged his left leg more than lifted it and when Casper could spare a good look at the leg, she held in a gasp. The armor was crushed and punctured around the middle of the thigh. A black ooze bubbled and popped on the surface. Vartag limped on and the march did not slow. They rounded a bend and Casper's stomach sank. Vartag was modest when he said he wasn't sure how many he killed. Scores of bodies littered an open field. Boiling black ooze coated the obsidian ground. 

""Demon blood."" Jansen whispered. He traced a cross across his chest. Others followed suit. Even Casper instinctively traced a cross over her own chest. She surveyed the battlefield. She spotted three human bodies close to each other with demons squabbling over the armor. She had seen a demon once before, or at least she thought she had. The demon she saw came up to her waist with weathered, dark leathery skin. Its long black claws were razor sharp and its beady red eyes shone with a fiery hatred. She stabbed the thing up through its chin and into its brain. The demon blood corroded her blade in minutes and scarred her hand where a few of the droplets fell. She absentmindedly rubbed at the scars on her hand as she looked at the demons before her. Most matched Commander Thompson's impressive armored frame. They were sinewy and moved with awkward, jerked movements as if they didn't fully understand how gravity worked. Casper couldn't see their eyes, but she imagined the hatred in them burned deeper than that of the demon she killed.

""How does the armor hold up?"" Commander Thompson said. 

""Doesn't corrode when their blood touches it."" Vartag replied. ""Just don't let them break it off of you."" He winced as he reached down for his left leg. ""Or break it around you.""

Commander Thompson looked forward. ""Do they not see us?""

""This is how they acted before."" Vartag said. ""They pay us no mind until we cross a certain point. Orion thought to try stealth to get past them and could not get up in time to flee.""

""So we walk up to the edge and pick them off."" Commander Thompson said. ""There do not seem to be many left.""
""If this is the course you choose to take."" Vartag said.

""Are you counseling prudence?"" Commander Thompson said. Casper felt guilty being a part of their intimate conversation, but dared not move.

""The Crimsons Chargers have sacrificed enough."" Vartag said. ""You have sacrificed enough.""

Commander Thompson looked away from his friend and towards the battlefield. ""As long as my heart still beats, there is always more to sacrifice.""

Vartag nodded. He knew the conversation was over. ""Then that is our best option. We should march up as close as we can before they take notice of us. No point in charging over demon blood and slipping on your arse.""

""Excellent plan."" Commander Thompson said. He turned back towards his troops and raised his voice. ""These demons think they can kill one of our own without the cost being their deaths a thousand fold, and they have the audacity to take four? Their blood may be blacker than ours, but it still bleeds. Steels yourselves for the trials to come. The battle for the Gates of Hell is upon us!""

Several cheered and others traced the cross. Casper thought of her brother. She didn't tell him when she got the letter from Commander Thompson. He would have tried to talk her out of it. Say that she fought her war and did her part. But he wouldn't understand, he never understood that Commander Thompson saved her life. He pulled her out of her rut and gave her life meaning. He molded her into a killing machine, a wrecking ball of fury. When the war ended and she was no longer needed, she was nothing again. Discarded like trash on the side of the highway by those she protected. She knew she couldn't tell her brother about the letter, just like she knew what the letter said without even opening it. The letter read, ""Remember your promise?""  It was all she needed to see, she had never forgotten that promise, although she had hoped she would never have to honor it.

Casper unclipped her gun from her belt and checked that it was still loaded for the eighteenth time. It was. The march towards battle was the hardest part for Casper. She wanted to charge in and lay waste to everything before her. She wanted to run away and hide in a cave for the rest of her life. Her heart tried to claw its way out of her throat and her stomach tried to shit itself out. The march went on. The ball of potential destruction each member of Crimson Chargers held within themselves grew with each step.

[WP] You've always said you would follow your commander through the gates of Hell itself...you never expected he'd ask you to actually do it!,Mazon_Del,"""Hell?"" I enquired dubiously.

""Yes soldier!"" Captain Johnson bellowed enthusiastically.

""You mean.. Hell? It's quite.. how do I put this.. humid, this time of year.."" I replied, unsure if he was being serious or not. 

""We need to set up a strategic outpost, its imperative to all future operations, briefing begins tomorrow at 0700 hours, come with standard light operation kit, do not be late, fall out!""

I was completely incredulous about the whole situation, how would we even get there? I decided it was best to get an early night, I knew I would need it. 

I arrived to briefing at 0655 hours, there was a small group of us, only seven. It was a mixture of Corporals and Sergeants, and one Private, yours truly. This was my third mission and didn't really compare to the others, I'd only had one fire fight so far.

During the briefing we were taught about this new advanced digging machinery, a piece of machinery I'm not allowed to disclose any information about. But we were, in any sense, crash dummies. Like Laika going into space. How expendable soldiers were nowadays.

We embarked at 0900 hours, Cpt. Johnson led the team, two of the corporals were engineers, and I was driver. I've always been sceptical, I didn't even believe in hell, oh boy how wrong was I!

I was digging normally at a steady pace, when all of a sudden, bang, we dropped at least 50 metres, ""We're herreeee boysss!"" Exclaimed the captain. We propelled out of the digger and took up position, after we scouted the surrounding area, we quickly replenished, ""good driving, son."" The captain said.

The whole area felt like a sauna, the heat from the below rocks got through your boots and burnt your feet, it was hard to breathe. The Captain told us we had a mile journey towards the gates, longest mile I ever walked.

The whole place was foggy, you couldn't see the area 5 metres ahead of you, as I made out the large gates I recognised an all too familiar symbol; 

Russian flags...

[WP] Humans have discovered that weekly injections can enable the body to give their sweat certain smells. You are part of a focus group sampling holiday flavors when you begin to notice side effects a while after the injection.,Swolesome,"“All I can taste is peppermint.”


“Interesting.  I’ll make a note of it, Andy.  Anything else happening besides that?”


“Well, I kind of think that’s pretty significant.”  His assistant has always been apathetic.  I think if I came in having turned into Santa Claus himself, she’d react in the same bored manner.  If they were paying me more to be a test subject, I wouldn’t take her indifference so personally.


“I’ll let him know.  He’ll be in shortly.”


This place is set up like a doctor’s office, but it’s anything but. SmellSwell was the newest up and coming company that had captured the public’s imagination.  No more body odor!  No more stinky pit stains!  Make yourself (join in, everyone, you know the tagline) SMELLSWELL!  It was the weirdest trend, but I had to admit, it was nice going to the gym and smelling cinnamon, vanilla, and whatever “Ocean Breeze” was supposed to be.  I saw an advertisement on Craigslist that they were looking for people willing to test out their holiday scents.  They’ve had great success with their core smells and wanted to expand.  The pay was better than the zero dollar paycheck I was receiving after walking off my last job, but I just couldn’t overlook the rude assistant.  Pam.  Her name is Pam and she gets under my skin every time I come in here.


Brian was the test engineer who was in charge of my testing protocol.  Nice enough kid.  When I say “kid”, I mean, he looks 15.  This company is a start up full of young people who look like they are still in high school.  At 32, I feel like the old codger they have to slow down and explain things to.  He came in wearing his signature bow tie, skinny jeans, and carrying his clipboard.


“Hi Andy!  Nice to see you!  Pam tells me you are tasting peppermint.”


“Yeah, started last night and seems like it is getting stronger.  I didn’t mind it so much with my coffee this morning, but eggs and peppermint suck, I gotta tell you.”


He chuckled but didn’t seem overly concerned. He jotted down a few notes and got the syringe ready for my next injection.


“Well, at least you smell like candy canes and Christmas, Andy.  Things could be worse.  You ready?”


I pulled up my sleeve and he wrapped the tourniquet around my arm.  The needle slid in and he pulled back on the syringe plunger so make sure he was in my vein.  


“Here we go.”  He slowly pushed the plunger in and the peppermint smell was overwhelming.


“Brian, the peppermint, man.  It’s pretty bad.”  I started to feel nauseous.  It’s all I could smell or taste.


“It’s okay, it’ll pass.”  He started to remove the needle from my arm but it seemed stuck.  He pulled harder, but it wasn’t coming out of my arm.


“That’s strange.  Andy, you mind extending your arm out straight?  The needle seems to want to stay stuck.”


I tried to straighten my arm, but it felt so heavy and thick, I could barely move it.  He helped pull it straight and I could see the alarm on his face.  


“I’m going to get some help here, Andy, I’ll be right back.”


As he let go of my arm, his fingers stuck to my skin.  It was as if my skin turned to fly paper and he was the clueless insect who got stuck on it.  


“PAM!  COME IN HERE!”  I was too busy trying not to vomit to help Brian get unstuck from my arm.


Pam entered the room with the same nonchalance she had entered it upon my arrival.  Her lifeless eyes opened wide as she took in the scene. “What happened?  Brian?  What did you do?”  


“Get help, Pam!  Something is wrong!  I can’t let go of his arm!”  Pam left the room and I heard her calling for help as she jogged down the hall, her footfalls echoing around us.


“Andy?  Are you okay?”  His voice sounded panicked and I felt a bit of a pull on the skin on my arm.  I looked down to see that he was trying to yank himself off arm with all his might.  It didn’t feel like that but I could see it.  His face grimaced as he held his wrist with his free hand and pulled with all his weight.  His bow tie now looking like it was too tight around his strained neck muscles and red face.


“Andy!  Come on, Andy, talk to me!”


I was overcome with a tingling feeling all over my body.  It felt like it started in my veins and slowly wrapped around all of my organs and muscles. Kind of cool, but a strangely pleasant sensation despite what was happening to me.  I had never felt so heavy or stiff before in my life.  Ironically, I was calm.  I could see Brian pulling at his hand, still trying to release himself from my arm, but I felt nothing.  It was as if I was dreaming and watching what was happening from the comfort of my bed, my head on my cool pillow.  There was a scream.  Brian had managed to escape my skin’s sticky grip, but not without leaving several layers of his own skin behind.  He held his bloody hand and looked at me in horror.  


“Andy!  Oh my God!”  Brian ran out of the room and suddenly the room started changing color.  Red.  A crimson filter had washed over my eyes and everything now had a bright red glow.  I tried to open my mouth to call for Brian, but my lips were stuck together.  My arm was still stuck straight out like a petrified branch of a long forgotten tree with a hypodermic needle sticking out of it.  I tried to stand but my body was too heavy to move.  All I could see was red, all I could smell was peppermint and all I could taste was sickeningly sweet candy cane.


“Here!  He’s in here!”  Brian ran back in followed by Pam, that cow, and a few other young men who all looked at me with shock.


“Andy?  Can you hear me?  Don’t touch him!  You’ll get stuck to him!” 


They moved slowly towards me and around me, seemingly not sure what to do with this reaction I was having. 


“He needs to go to the hospital.  Is there an in case of emergency contact for him?”  I could hear the urgency in Brian’s voice.


“And tell them what, Brian?  That we turned him into a candy cane?  We need to fix this here and quick.  He signed the release, right?”  It was one of the young men who came into the room with Brian.  No bow tie, but he had on suspenders and skinny jeans.


“He did sign the release.”  Pam, that bitch.  She almost sounds bored again.


“Well, I say we DV-8 him.”  Suspenders guy came around the side of me and looked at me straight on.  “He signed the release.  He knew there was the possibility of side effects.”  If I could move my outstretched arm, I would’ve punched him.


“What?  DV-8 him?  No, no, that’s not even a real option.  That’s just some shit rumor that’s gone around this place.” Brian came around to look at my face alongside Suspenders.  “We need to call 911.”


Suspenders guy nodded his head no and grabbed Brian.  The other guys who came in joined Suspenders and jumped on Brian, knocking him down and held him to the floor.


“The hell are you guys doing?  Let me up! Pam, help me!”


Pam came around to where Brian was being held down and had a syringe in her hand.  Suspenders held out Brian’s arm and another guy griped his fist around Brian’s bicep.  


“Stop!  No!”


Pam, ever-reticent and moving like she’s done this hundreds of times before, plunged the syringe into Brian’s arm.  He tried to squirm and kick away but they had overpowered him.  Suddenly, he froze.  They all stood up and wiped the floor dust off of their skinny jeans and button-down shirts.


“Pam, DV-8 the both of them.”


The guys stepped over Brian’s stiff body and walked out.  His eyes were fixed in panic. Pam picked up his clipboard that had fallen to the floor earlier and made a few notes.  She opened a cabinet door that hid a panel of buttons and switches, which she expertly began to press and flip up and down.  She closed the cabinet door and started to leave the room.  She looked down and Brian and then up at me.  A wide smile spread across her face as she turned to leave.

A broken mirror. A prescription a few months expired and noticed a moment too late. This one wasn't getting it.

""What do you mean I'm going to die? I feel just fine,"" the old lady says.

""As I said, you've Stage IV lung cancer,"" I say, tugging at my lab coat, ""There is a zero percent chance that you will survive. In fact, you've only about five minutes to live.""

I had long since done away with any pretenses. All mortals (at least, the ones I can get to) are given at least one instant before their demise to reflect, however briefly, on the life that they've lived. If they feel even the slightest sliver of regret for the mistakes that they've made in that moment, they're granted passage into Heaven. It's my job to guide them there.

""What? I can't hear you!"" the lady says loudly.

She has hearing failure coupled with a failing hearing device. I write down what I had said just moments prior on a paper pad.

""Sorry, I didn't bring my reading glasses,"" she waves me away, ""I'll come back tomorrow.""

""Time is ticking,"" a nasally voice reminds me.

It's Satan, speaking as a devil on my shoulder. That dork is always unfashionably punctual. The woman pops up from the medical bed with an alacrity unbecoming of an elderly lady about to fall over dead and heads toward the door.

""MISS!"" I shout, ""YOU'RE GOING TO DIE.""

I rush to bar the way to the exit from the fast old tart.

""Doctor Thade?"" a nurse from the hallway peeks her head in.

""Pardon me!"" I say, and slam the door shut in the nurse's face with my back.

If I were actually human, I would assuredly be sweating right now.

Aha! That's it!

I cast aside my human disguise, and assume that unmistakable form of a grim reaper. I hate this get-up, but even an old lady should be able to recognize--

""Well, that's a nice costume, dearie, but I really must be going--""

""Time's up!"" the devil cackles.

""NO!"" I cry, dropping my scythe in despair and clutching at my parietal bone.

The scythe falls forward and catches the poor woman in the neck, slicing her head clean off. I really have to stop sharpening my scythe in my spare time.

""Haha, score one for me!"" Satan cheers.

My shoulder bones sink as I see the soul, a small glowing amorphous bulb, emerge from the neck of the disembodied corpse. Few souls are pure enough to get to Heaven without prior repentance. The soul bounces from the corpse, attempting to soar heavenward, only to droop lower, and lower, and lower...

""Gueheheheh, yessss!"" Satan says.

Suddenly the soul pauses an inch above the hospital floor and shines more brightly than any human soul ever could.

""April Fool's,"" God says, and ascends through the roof of the hospital room.

Joe Pratchett glanced over at his partner, wondering if he was ready. They'd trained for this moment, although training never could *really* prepare someone for the real deal. He sighed quietly, steering his Toyota Camry down an alley and switching it off. ""You ready to do this?"" His voice was strong and forceful, a tone he used when he didn't want questions.

""Of course."" His partner, a 20-something male by the name of Richard, was unbuckling, having already gloved his hands in his nervousness. Joe followed suit, gloving up and then unbuckling the seat belt. He pulled out wipes and handed them to Richard so he could get rid of any fingerprints.

Finally, they were ready. They took a quick look at the building, a small town bank, giving themselves just a moment to pump themselves up. ""Alright, get the guns."" Joe commanded, his voice unwavering. He'd done this a hundred times before, he was sure it would be the same this time.

While Richard walked to the trunk, Joe leaned down and strapped a pistol he'd kept under his seat to his ankle. This was in case he became disarmed and needed to save himself. He'd covered it with his pants before Richard even had the duffel bag out of the trunk. ""Here."" He tossed the bag at Joe, who caught it with ease and unzipped it in one, fluid motion.

As always, he grabbed a large semi-automatic machine gun that took up most of the room in the bag. That left an revolver for Richard, who had claimed to be more of a pistol man anyways. He grumbled something about Joe compensating, then reluctantly took the gun and checked the clip. Full.

Joe motioned for his partner to go, then opened his door and sprinted up to the back entrance of the bank. Richard went to work picking the lock, and after a minute or two the door swung open. Instantaneously, alarms started blaring, alerting the one security guard of an invasion. Joe took the lead, holding his weapon at the ready and keeping his knees bent. Richard took the rear, keeping his pistol pointed at the ground but his arms straight in case he needed to shoot.

Everything went smoothly as they approached the safe, a large metal door with a code lock on the door. This was where they'd gotten lucky. They'd had an inside connection. Joe smirked and tapped away at the keypad, inputting the code they'd been told. The numbers lit up, then turned green as Joe finished the code, and they heard a loud metallic *click*. 

Just as the door opened, a single shot rang out, and Joe stopped suddenly. Slowly, he looked down to find blood leaking from his chest, soaking his black shirt and making it slightly darker. ""What the...?"" He wheezed, and then fell over, his breaths short and labored.

Richard glanced in the door, and noticed a small, barrel sized hole in the wall on the back of the vault. Knowing protocol, he grabbed the SMG and stepped over the dying body of his partner and began to loot like they'd planned. Joe watched as it became harder to breathe, trying to put pressure on his wound. This was not what he'd planned.

Fighting his pain, he reached down and grabbed the pistol he'd strapped to his ankle, taking careful aim. He would aim for the head, but he needed to have perfect aim or it'd be a waste. ""I'm sorry, Dick."" Richard stopped and turned, having never been called that by his partner. However, instead of a sincere moment, the last thing he heard was a gunshot.

Joe laid back, his breathing slowing and finally stopping. As he drew his last breath, he smiled. He'd done this a hundred and one times. It was fitting, that as he'd ended the lives of so many thieves with a bullet, a bullet should be his undoing.",Cronidor
"[WP] You live in a world where happiness can be extracted and sold, but extracting it makes you unhappy. Happiness is traded like a drug and people start to farm it.",betternut,"I don't remember much of my parents. Most of the kids I was with don't. We were all kidnapped fairly young, aside from the severely mentally handicapped. We weren't abused (or rather, our form of abuse meant we were treated very well). However, our captors only made us happy to take it from us. Still, I cling to one memory of my family; gods be damned if my captors suck the happiness from it.

I was a young boy, and extremely sheltered. Since children were so incapable of hiding their joy, most were homeschooled. Hidden away from the world until we could suppress our smiles, stifle our laughter and act indifferent. I squealed with glee, giggles bubbled forth and my entire face lit up whenever I was happy. My dad was frustrated with me, but my mom could barely hide her grin as I overflowed with joy.

It was my mom who took me to the park. It was surprising these things were still around, but then again, happiness wasn't illegal. It was natural- I'm getting ahead of myself.

Anyways, the seemingly empty park wasn't empty. I know because that was the last time I ever saw my mom. She turned her attention to something else for a few moments while I cartwheeled and ran through the field until I saw someone who definitely was not my mom.

""You like dogs? Cats? I can give you a pet to take home, I have lots in my truck. Just come with me,"" the man spoke quietly. I think it was the white furball he had on a leash that convinced me, despite the smile that looked like it was stretching his skin impossibly tight. My naive self followed, eager for a little furball of my own.

Surprisingly, he wasn't lying. The strange man had lots of animals in his truck. 

""Why don't you climb in and pick one you like?""

I shook my head, said no thank you. I liked the one with the black paws, that one please. My eyes lit up as he took the puppy out and handed it to me. I squealed as it licked my face, giggling. Then I felt a jab, and suddenly I was out.

When I came to, I awoke to the animals of the truck all over me. I was confused, but I giggled softly at the soft tongues and warm fur. I felt another jab at the back of my neck and slowly my smile faded. I pushed the animals away, suddenly somewhat annoyed with them.

""Oh yeah, he's going to be an absolute powerhouse. We can easily make ten grand off what he's already given us,"" I heard. I looked around, then groaned as we hit a bump before I sat up. 

""Can I go back to the park, now?""

""Shit. Knock him out, Blue,"" I heard from the front. My heart began to race and I shook my head. Tears were springing to my eyes and my pleas fell on deaf ears.

""Nah, Red. We keep making him happy, he keeps providing for us. . . "" the man in the back with me was eyeing me like a piece of meat.

""If we do it too much, he becomes an empty husk. You said it yourself. We have ten grand from today alone. Let him rest.""

With that, 'Blue' sighed and swapped the needle for a rag. I tried to fight, but I was no match. The rag was over my face in a matter of seconds and I was out once more.",Cockroach-Boy

"[WP] You're the twin of a famous magician. Before his death, he made sure no one outside of your family knew of your existence. You're now at his funeral, and the media is claiming this is his greatest trick ever: resurrection.",bongo1138,"My brother was cunning, masterful, and proficient in his tricks in every way. The slightest mess up and it would of resulted in his retirement.

He never did mess up. He followed through till the very end. He was always a step ahead of Mother Nature itself. 

When I found out about how this tragic event had happened, my feet beckoned, as this was inconceivable. Dwight was perfect in every way, it couldn't be possible that he had died from a new trick he was practicing! But...it was true. Mom was barely audible over the phone that night, as Dwight had accidentally punctured vital organs, attempting to walk on spikes. 

I was his twin brother he never let out into the public. I never attended public school, I'm not even registered as a citizen. Mom had us under the oak tree down past the creek. We had moved to the city since those times.

The media was absolutely in love with Dwight, but they had no idea he had a twin brother by the name of Clyde. 

It was saddening to see that his casket was closed at the funeral. I'm guessing the aftermath to the puncture was too gruesome to leave his body out for display. 

I would never see his face again, unless it was in a picture we took together, but there was only one. Ever since Dwight was small he had a natural affinity for tricks. He would blackmail me into staying out of each and every picture mom and dad took.

I never understood what his motives were, and I guess they didn't matter now. He was gone. Mom sat beside me with a tissue. 

I thought of her and how traumatic this must be for her, to lose a son, and then see his face in her other son. How terrible. 

The garrulous news crew was right outside of the funeral doors, thirsty for news. This was a huge story for them, and the world too. Dwight was by far the most mysterious man in the world.

I found out he was more fascinating than ever today.

*After The Funeral*

The funeral had ended and I stormed out of the doors to be immediately swarmed by news crew. The looks on their faces went blank as they saw me. I didn't understand their expression. They acted as if they had seen a ghost.

People were immediately on their cell phones, calling their companies and speaking in a blunder. The outrage grew to an even greater height as cameras were showered in my face. 

""Dwight! Dwight! Tell us how you performed this magnificent and awe shocking stunt!"" A voice boomed. 

""Dwight! Is this your new trick?"" A woman said.

""Is this a resurrection trick?"" People were in awe, as I was speechless. I had realized my face was his, and I was in the eyes of possibly millions right now.

I had no words to express myself and no way to get out of this. Mom knew my situation and watched me as I put my acting skills to the test, ""Yes, this is my latest feat. I realize you must be in awe, but do not fear, I died, and now I live."" I said, interpreting my brothers intense ego. 

I forged a smile as I walked through the crowd of people, wondering how long I would last before the smile would fade, and the tears shed. 

I got in the car, mom getting in the back, while dad sat in the passenger seat, unable to look at the casket. I drove off from the scene, wondering how my life was going to change from my fascinating brothers trickery.

[WP] Everybody in the world is given a button that dispenses $1 million... and also kills a random person.,evanc1411,"""Can you BELIEVE it?  Omigodomigodomigod..."", Crystal murmured excitedly as she absentmindedly nibbled on her pinkie nail and stared straight ahead to the front of the line. Kim looked over her shoulder at her tentatively as her friend bobbed her head around to get a better view of what laid ahead, a strange mix of trembling trepidation and perverse greed playing across her freckled face.  ""I can't believe we're finally able to do this... like, *legally*!!!"".  Kim tried to mimic her friend's excitement but instead managed a forced half-smirk and crossed her arms over her chest.  

""I don't know... I guess... I mean, I might not even do it... *today*, I mean..."", her voice changing from a reedy whine to a loud whisper when Crystal locked eyes with her. ""What do you mean, you might not do it?  OH - MY - GAWD!  Don't you want a million dollars?"", she sniffed petulantly, stomping her feet and glaring at Kim. ""You could do *a-ny-thing* with that money!  You could, like, go to college... buy a new car..."", she mused as she stared ahead to the front of the line again. It wrapped around the L-shaped hallway and Crystal had no idea what was around the corner, but still she peered ahead, as if she could will herself to see right through the walls.

""But don't you feel kind of bad about... you know... *killing* someone? Like, what if it's someone's mom? Or grandma?"", Kim asked softly, staring at her shoes. Suddenly she was ashamed to make eye contact with anyone, but she was certain she could feel everyone already staring at *her*. ""Oh, I'm so sure!  They're not going to let you kill some innocent person!  They probably have, like, a bunch of criminals lined up and stuff!"", Crystal shot back.

Kim said nothing, but instead closed her eyes and focused on the ringing in her ears and the churning in the pit of her stomach. Yes, of course she wanted free money... she could definitely use it for tuition, and to help her family... and if she didn't know who was going to die, did it matter? She pushed a wispy piece of auburn hair out of her eyes and leaned closer to Crystal. ""I think it's almost time... everyone is looking at their watches..."".

Before her friend could respond, the solid thump of metal double doors opening and mellow, golden voice boomed from around the corner.

""Everyone, everyone! It is SO good to have so many newly-adult citizens joining us today! Is it a great day to get rich or WHAT?"". A tidal wave of cheering voices, each one seemingly attempting to drown out all of the others, burst forth around the two young women, who reflexively covered their ears. It was so loud and shocking that their ears rang for many minutes afterwards.

The crowd shuffled forward and around the corner, as if their feet were controlled by the charismatic voice that seemed to lure them towards it. ""It's a beautiful day to make some *free money*, isn't it?"", the women heard the man's voice say as they rounded the corner. Everyone was babbling and shouting and cheering... rectangular fliers were being snatched and waved about as Mayor Bellingham, a short, stout man with thick blue-black hair and a broad square face, stood to the left of a pair of imposing double doors, flanked by two stoic armed guards in full camouflage. Kim briefly wondered why it was necessary to have armed guards at the entrance to the Mayor's ballroom, but before she could turn to Crystal and ask her, a flier was thrust into her hand by someone in front of her.

**THE FUTURE IS IN YOUR HANDS!!**, the bold, shadowed lettering on heavy, blue-gray stock proclaimed.  **FREE MONEY, AVAILABLE FROM THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT... CLAIM YOURS NOW!!**  The image of an ecstatic young man, wholesome and cheeky with two bricks of strapped bills clutched in his smooth tan hands, loomed under the flier's proclamation. Inside the flier was some blithe information about performing a simple service for the community (exactly who this ""community"" was made of, Kim was not sure) in exchange for a cool million dollars, to be deposited to your checking or savings account within 10 business days, courtesy of the national government. While the flier did not specifically say specifically what this simple service was, Kim and Crystal knew, and so did most everyone else that had arrived at the Mayor's mansion that day. Word had gotten out *fast*.

The young women were ushered into an expansive ballroom with slick parquet flooring, cream and gold flecked rococo paneling and a domed ceiling. Lined along the walls, from the entrance to the opposite end, were hundreds of narrow booths that stood eight-odd feet tall. Kim could not see what was inside the booths, as each one was draped across the front with heavy, bright red fabric. In the center of the ball room were several long foldout tables laden with notebook-sized logs, pens and manned by perky, eternally grinning young men and women in matching navy blazers, white oxford shirts and khaki pants, name tags neatly pinned to their lapels. Their chirpy, lilting voices sounded almost obscene given the circumstances.

""Hel-LO!!"", a petite woman with short brown curly hair and peachy complexion eeped as Crystal and Kim apprehensively approached the table. ""May I see your IDs, please?"". The women handed over their driver's licenses, both showing that they had recently turned 18. Without another word, the greeter, searched for their names in the logs with alarming efficiency and procured their signatures. They were handed bank draft forms, on which they would supply their account numbers and routing numbers. Once their service was complete, they would turn them in before they leave. ""Don't we have to sign, like, a release form.. or something?"", Crystal asked, and the woman's smile grew even wider. ""Nope, this is all we need, thank YOU!!"", she said as she turned to greet the person behind her. The two women glanced at each other questioningly and then scanned the ballroom hesitantly.

Another greeter, an older woman with her hair pulled off her face in a prim bun, guided them to empty booths. Kim and Crystal noticed that they looked a lot like voting booths, but once the curtains were pulled back they did not see ballots or pencils. Instead, there was a small, square digital screen and a single red button mounted to the surface's center. The curtains were closed behind them, and the two women stood in adjacent booths, bewildered, wondering what to do next.

After a few seconds, the digital screen flickered and a face appeared on the screen. Kim glanced to her left, in Crystal's general direction, and wondered if she was seeing the same thing she was. The booths were soundproof, so she was unable to speak to her.  The face was of a middle-aged, mocha-skinned woman, her eyes, lower forehead and upper nose area blocked out with a black rectangle so she was unable to see her eyes at all.... but she could see enough to make out a rough guesstimate of her age and race. It reminded her of a mugshot... the woman's head bright and stark against a plain beige-green background. There were no other identifying details about her. 

Kim stared at the screen, then looked down at the button. She tried to wrap her mind around why *this woman* might be killed. Why would the government want *her* dead?  Her hand hovered over the button, numbness and cold seeping in, and her mind tried to rationalize the situation. *A million dollars... I could do so much with that money.. I could set some aside for my dad so he could retire early.. I could go to college*, she thought to herself, and for a moment it was as if she was hearing another person's voice in her ear. *I don't know this woman... she doesn't know me... and she wouldn't be killed if she didn't deserve it for some reason... ???*. The sick, insistent churning in Kim's stomach rumbled on, and her arm and shoulder muscles shook as she pondered her situation. Minutes ticked by, and it was only when a warning in flashing red letters blipped on the screen that Kim realized how long she had been standing there.

**WARNING: 30 SECONDS REMAIN - ANY DECISION MADE AFTER 30 SECONDS IS CONSIDERED FINAL**

Kim timidly stepped out of the booth to find Crystal waiting for her at the exit. Her back was turned away from everyone, and as Kim approached she turned her head towards her, just a little. In the heavy light that poured from the windows, Kim could see that Crystal's freckled complexion was sickly and translucent, and her slender arms were cradling her chest defensively. She turned to Kim with thin, pursed lips but did not make eye contact with her. The two women said nothing to each other as they walked outside, but after a few minutes, Crystal ventured forth.

""Did they show you a picture of the person too?"", her voice, breathy and shaky, rattled in her throat.  ""I.. I can't believe I had to *look* at the person I was gonna kill... omigod..."".

Kim said nothing, but stared straight ahead, her shoulders pulled back as she strode ahead.

""Did you do it?"", Crystal asked quietly.

Kim slowed down a bit and looked back at her friend blankly, her eyes distant and misty, but said nothing.",PrincessTinyheart

"[WP] You secretly have the ability to use other people's senses. You're walking down the sidewalk when you see a girl wearing earbuds and you decide to find out what she's listening to. All you hear is a voice say ""they see you. Abort mission"".",johncc123,"The morning started with an inhale of a strong aroma--the nutty and bitter mixture rising from a cup of coffee. Just not her coffee. The drink in question belonged to a man, idly swirling his beverage while it cooled, his attention firmly locked on the laptop screen before him. She could have looked through his eyes and seen what was so thoroughly engrossing--but she knew this was a gamble. Not for dangerous reasons, or anything. People just didn't tend to be too scrupulous with what they were doing, not even when in public. She didn’t need to stumble on another accidental voyeuristic porn fest. No, the taste of the bitter coffee the man was now knocking back would be enough to wake her up.

The song in the café changed to a softer tune--fitting for the environment, but not quite her pace. She preferred more upbeat music, but maybe someone else in the room was enjoying it. She scanned the room--people standing in line, couples sitting across from each other at booths, a person hidden behind a large newspaper and--oh, there! In the corner a teenage boy sat slouched in one of the big comfort chairs, eyes half lidded and soaking in the melody. Through his ears, the music soothed her mind and she felt the same ease he did. Too much ease.

""Uh oh, I should get out of her,"" she mumbled to herself, feeling familiar dredges of sleep resurface. She rubbed her face and got up, grabbing her drink. It was hot chocolate, since she had a preference for sweet, but it was still interesting to taste bitterness through someone else's perspective and actually enjoy it. Sometimes, though, it was easy to lose yourself in other people's senses--to forget where you began and the other person ended. She had to remind herself to be careful.

She had to remind herself she was just a passenger in other people's lives.

Still a bit early for class, she made her way slowly down the sidewalk toward campus. She kept her arms tight against her body to avoid bumping into anyone on the busy street. To avoid touching anyone. The chatter swirled around her and entered her mind like a fog; she deepened her breathing and tried to stare resolutely ahead. Someone brushed her arm and she gritted her teeth. She wondered if people were staring at her. No, she just had to keep walking. She wondered if people were talking about her. It didn't matter.

She cut through the grass, not caring if it was frowned upon, and tried to calm her steadily growing nerves. Sometimes, it was easy to get overwhelmed. Her legs felt weak and she almost collapsed on a nearby bench, until something called out to her senses. A scent. She looked around until her eyes landed on the source--a girl casually leaning against tree, one hand in her pocket and the other holding a phone connected to earbuds. It was hard to describe how someone could look so comfortable with themselves, when all they were doing was standing, but the other girl had a presence that seemed like she could belong wherever she went. She found herself unconsciously inching toward the girl, reaching out to listen through the other's ears, wanting to experience even a small part of this person.

""They see you. Abort mission,"" she heard, and instantly froze. The girl brought her other hand out of her pocket and started frantically typing.

""Get out of there. But not too fast, be casual,"" the voice said. She turned away from the girl and walked back toward the bustling street, a different sort of panic blossoming in her chest.

""She knows! Oh god, she's um, walking away--fast! I don't know! Uh, intercept her, quick!"" The voice was urgent. She quickened her pace and almost threw herself into the crowd, dodging people left and right. She thought of herself as safe after a few blocks, until a hand reached out and grabbed her arm.",bellamaryllis
"[WP] You secretly have the ability to use other people's senses. You're walking down the sidewalk when you see a girl wearing earbuds and you decide to find out what she's listening to. All you hear is a voice say ""they see you. Abort mission"".",johncc123,"I was halfway home when I started to yawn. It had been a long day at work, trying to sort boxes before Christmas. I had been sipping energy from my co-workers, but now I was pretty much alone on the streets. I walked home, stupidly, because gas was expensive and I wanted to lose some weight before Lyn's wedding. 

I was turning the corner when I saw a small group of people. They weren't together, but they felt connected. They shared the same tense energy, the same sense of urgency. I could feel it in their spines. Rigid. Looking for something. 

I was about to tap into their core-well when I saw her. It was a teenage girl, headphones glues to her ears, walking briskly down the road. She felt full, energetic. I was so dead on my feet, I planned to just take a little. I imagined the way her hair must feel, the sinewy thick braids. 

It took only a second to ride the hair down to her brain. Then I was inside. It took a moment to find the strongest sense. Her sight was focused, but her ears seemed to be running the show. She was listening to some oldie's radio station. 

*Call me up when you need to rock, honey, baby, don't come back!* 

I let her ears become my ears. I was sliding down the back of her neck, shuddering down the ladder of her spine. There, right behind her naval, was the core. Her energy was vivid, young, and spinning madly. I stuck my hands inside and felt my own shoulders jerk back.

I was enthralled. I didn't mean to take as much as I did. I learned from that mistake. Still, I was so enchanted by her fireworks that I missed the music changing. 

*They see you. ABORT mission.* 

That was not part of the song. That was not normal. I could feel the core tighten, as if the girl was about to run. I tried to pull back into myself but I was tied strong. I yanked too hard and pulled out more than I should. I was thrown back into myself. 

I could feel the skin on my face tighten, my limbs aching. I was on the floor, pushed to the side by three men in dark work shirts. They had abandoned their lunch boxes beside me, their practical black shoes making no sound on the cement. 

They all looked the same, with brown hair and dark skin. They were moving together, surrounding the girl. She was bent over and heaving, throwing up on the ground. 

I could hear the sound of the music again, faintly, in the back of my mind. 

""You look sick,"" One said. 

""Very sick,"" Two muttered.

""We should help her back home,"" Three said. 

They jostled her, causing her to fight back. Weak. She looked absolutely horrified. I was not sure what this meant or how to help. All I knew was *fuck* and *run.* Those were the impressions left by her energy. *Fuck* something was wrong. 

They looked at me, but I was stunned. 

One seemed to appraise me. ""Stupid kid."" 

I kept blinking, not sure what to say. 

""It's just--We have to go."" 

Three broke away from the group. He stood beside me, looking down. He seemed huge, busting out of his shirt. His eyes were a strange blue. 

""What are you doing out here?"" he demanded. 

""I don't know,"" I said. I could feel the panic in the back of my throat. ""I saw nothing. I don't know. She looked sick. Are you going to take her home?"" 

""Yes. We are."" The man looked at me again. ""Go on. Scram."" 

""Right. Yes. Um. Okay,"" I said. 

My voice seemed strange, weirdly elastic. 

When they were gone, I watched the spot where the girl had been. Then, slowly, I stood up. My pants started to slip as I moved forward. I didn't want to think about what this meant, how much I had actually taken. 

As I passed the dark windows of a closed store, I stopped. Looking back was the face of a much younger woman. 

I'd done it again. Fuck.",WhateverSlayer

All that I hear is a voice saying ""they see you! Abort Mission.""

I wonder if she's listening to a podcast or else if she's being spoken to in a call on the smart-phone.

She immediately turns off of the street and I hear the start of her running pace of footfalls before returning to my own hearing. I cross the road to the other sidewalk from which she left and I move myself into a position out of the flow of foot-traffic. I find her vision and she is still running down the road.

She quickly turns the corner to the right and hops into a waiting car. She takes a quick look at the phone she was listening from, and then she closes her eyes.

I'm rather confused at her behaviour, but then I become paranoid that she would close her eyes so that I could not track her or whoever else was presumably driving. -What if they knew about my ability and wanted something with me?! I became aware of her presence just as they seed she was seen, after all.

A man behind me coughs to get my attention.

I had to follow her, see where she was going, find out who she was working for. Did someone know about my powers? I was becoming paranoid, worried. I waited several seconds until she rushed past me then turned around and began following her. 

As she walked, I became more and more nervous. More and more terrified of what I might find. But I was determined, and I wasn't letting her go. She started going into emptier, quieter streets, and quickened her pace. At least once every few minutes, she looked at me nervously and walked even faster.

Finally, I started running towards her. She screamed and started running away as well. ""Stop!"" I yelled. ""Who are you?"" I grabbed her earbuds and put them into my own ears. ""WHO ARE YOU?"" But all I heard was ""They see you. Abort Mission."" being repeated several times before different words. 

It was then that it occured to me to look at the phone-- A song was open. It was a song. I gave the girl her phone and mumbled apologies before running the fuck away.

Her lips were pursed slightly with quizzical eyes hidden behind a pair of designer static dampeners. She sat several pods down from me towards the emergency exit hatch. Her nose perked and twitched as she inhaled an all too potent whiff of cologne from the gentleman directly across from me. 

I chuckled.

My brief laugh brought the attention of two suits directly to the left of me. Both identical by all measures, except for a taste in the pins on their lapels. Shifting my attention back to the woman, I began to admire her choice of casual wear. Simple, yet understated. 

I smirked as the sound of a female singer began to permeate my senses. A familiar voice, a top charter from the early 2020s. A classic by most measures. The woman directly to my right also had amazing taste. 

I smiled and tilted my head back to enjoy the music to myself. Music was expensive these days and made mostly irrelevant by the expansion of human understanding of the neural networks. Humans were busy these days and usually, a calm evening with a bit of music and the company of friends was a luxury all too precious even for the world's elite.

See, we don't hear music anymore so much as we perceive it. We don't listen, we just think it. The human brain was modified and enhanced with storage many decades ago and with it, came the death of the musical soul. 

My string of consciousness ran on for a time while my finger involuntarily tapped my knee to the rhythm. 

I focused intently on the man across from me. A businessman, no doubt. Probably a father. He was already staring attentively at the never ending tanned legs of the woman when I zoned in.

I began to admire the woman as well. I began to wonder what I would say to her, should anything come up. I hadn't taken a partner in some time and I'll be honest when I say that I was infatuated with this stranger. Of all the people on the train, she was the most worthy of my attention. 

From the eyes of the businessman, I zoned into the woman.

Her breathing halted momentarily as I felt the words resonate through her.

""They see you. Abort mission! You've got to get out of there!""

Her eyes darted immediately toward the men to my left. I turned to face them instinctively out of shared panic but my body did not react.

'God damn it', I thought. The woman gasped. 

'Shit! She hears m-'

The woman yelped audibly.

I dropped out and clenched my own fists.

'Great. Rookie mistake, Gell. You **NEVER** think when someone is thinking. It's too loud. Too much fucking noise for them to handle!'

I kept my composure as best as I could and tilted my attention to the men in suits. No doubt, they knew something was wrong.

The two men cut through my supposedly calm demeanor like an atom blade.

""We know who you are, Gell. You're right. It is too loud.""

All you hear is a voice say ""they see you. Abort mission"".",johncc123,"Strolling down the street, barely containing my grin as I tune into people. That's how I spent most of my walks to work. I walk the same route every time, because if I'm going to go file activity logs from 200 users for eight hours a day I might as well embrace the monotony on the way there. You know, so the work itself is less soul crushing and it feels more like I *want* to do that.

The girl sitting alone at the coffee shop up ahead is cute. Baggy sweatshirt and jeans, earbuds in. Wonder what she's listening to. Let me just...

{They see you. Abort mission.}

What? Who does? Me? She shoots a glance at me and grabs her coffee, drinking the rest and throwing it away more quickly than is normally reasonable. She picks up her pace down the street. Naturally and not at all creepily, I do the same. If she knows what I can do, if she's part of a group watching me and possibly intending to capture me, she's super dangerous.

{They'll meet me right up on the next corner. I hope.}

I break out into a sprint, and she doesn't realize it until I'm too close for her to outrun me. She turns and runs into an alleyway. Please be a dead end. Please be a dead end.

When I reach the alley and turn the corner, she's standing with her back against a wall, staring at me. She's also holding a gun. Fuck. She has accomplices on their way as well. ""Who the hell are you?"" She asks, out loud.

""Who spotted you?"" I need answers, even if I'm about to be killed.

She looks angry. ""The Wraith. Did the Collection really have to send the most incompetent pawn as backup? This is serious business.""

""I'm not with the... Collection or whatever. I have no idea who The Wraith is. I'm not explaining how I know you were spotted until you tell me about the Wraith and the Collection.""

{He could be very dangerous, and no sign of real backup. Time to spill it. Sorry, council.}

""The Wraith is one of the Catalyzed. The Collection is a group that reclaims their powers by killing them. The Wraith's gift is to slowly shorten someone's lifespan by one week per minute if they're in his line of sight. A level seven deadly/stalker.""

Holy shit. These guys are like supervillains, and the Collective are the badass hero agency. ""How are people Catalyzed? How are there enough malicious ones that a ranking system has been established?""

""We don't know. We have people who can find them if they're out in public, but none of us know enough about them to find a common factor.""

{GODDAMNIT. BACKUP NEEDS TO GET HERE AND KILL THIS GUY FAST.}

Shit. Someone is coming by. Slowly. I tune into them. 

{come on lady I need life I need less suits tailing me where are you}

Fuck. I slowly put my forefinger over my lips, widen my eyes, and step behind a dumpster. She's still pointing the gun at me as I sit down so The Wraith won't see me.

""Hello, ma'am.""

""Get out of here before I kill you, you sick monster.""

""I wouldn't talk like that. You have less than a minute on your clock.""

I notice a cloaked figure standing on the roof across from me as he makes a sweeping motion. The gun falls out of the girl's hands, landing next to me.

""Come with us and you'll live longer. We can't promise you won't be in pain, but you'll live. You have days now.""

The gun is right next to me. I can kill any one of them. But who? The telekinetic guy on the roof? He might deflect my bullet or something. Who knows if I can get a good shot at The Wraith.

She glances at me as I grab the gun.

""You have seconds.""

BANG. BANG. BANG. BANG. BANG. BANG. BANG. BANG.

She's dead by the fourth shot but I keep going. Not only making sure, but showing off to the Catalyzed watching. My eyes met hers as I shot her over and over, still staring at me after death. There's a sick buzz in the pit of my stomach. I'm not scared anymore.

""You just killed  member of the Collection. Are you a catalyst?""

""She-she said Catalyzed. What's different?""

""It's more flattering, mostly. But most of us are called vanguards. Catalysts are something special. They harbor more than one power.""

""Listen I just got here because I read her mind and thought she meant she spotted me. But she meant you.""

""You followed her here, killed an immortal Collection agent, and nullified the powers of Mr. Sulky up there all from reading her mind? Nice mind-reading.""

""Wha-""

""Agents aren't supposed to be able to die by normal means. Killing powers aren't normal means. Not to mention those last four bullets were supposed to go off at the same time in the gun, blowing it up and killing you.""

Suddenly someone else was behind me, my vision and consciousness slipping.

""Hello, Janice? Yes, I won't be able to come into work today. I'm extremely sick."" A lie, technically, but I was sick. Sick of that place. So, I was taking a much needed break. Today I would do nothing, yet everything.

""Very well, Mark. Know that this will be your fourth call-off this year, you only get five. One more and you may face termination."" I responded with my acknowledgement, then dropped the phone to my side. They had barely ended the call when I plopped down on my sofa, staring out the window.

The town was quiet, the streets empty but for the occasional passerby. Most days, I ignored them, wanting nothing to do with their lives when my own was busy enough. However, today, my plans revolved around them. So, when a young man of about seventeen strolled by carrying a skateboard, my mind latched to his.

For a moment, it was as if a curtain had passed over my eyes, and then, I could no longer see my house. Instead, I was outside, the light stabbing my eyes. Well, not mine, but the seventeen year old's. Through his ears, I could hear the music I hadn't known he was playing, some annoying screamo crap. Honestly just sounded like noise to me, but he seemed to enjoy it, so I endured it.

The air smelled of salt water, due to the nearby ocean. *This kid must be new to town,* I thought. *He still notices the smell of salt water in the air.* That was always fun. Whenever I used the senses of new people, I got to feel like I was visiting the area for the first time.

Presumably tired of walking, he dropped his skateboard and stepped on, kicking off. Back at home, a smile spread across my face as I felt the the wind whipping through long hair that I didn't have.

I enjoyed his life for a while, until he turned down a cramped, trash filled alley that reeked to high heaven. Pulling back my sense of smell and taste, I merely watched and listened. After checking to see if he had been followed, he left his board at the entrance and shimmied past some trash, careful to be quiet.

As he approached the center, a small girl stepped out from a small, hidden crevice. She had one headphone in, and looked like she was about to speak. My host stopped his music and pulled out the headphones, and I could feel his heart slamming against his chest nervously.

""You got the money?"" He asked, his voice much more stable than I could tell he was.

""Of course, Nate. You got the stuff?"" Her voice was stern, confident.

Nate pulled out a small baggie of marijuana, and then another of cocaine. Great, I'd freaking jumped into a dealer. Yay. I watched with baited breath as he slowly went to hand her the drugs, and suddenly, his eyes darted to the side.

In the darkness I could see a few men and women emerging, holding bats and crowbars. They were smiling, and now so was Nate.

On instinct, I threw my senses to the girl, wondering if she could see or hear them, but she could not. The only thing I heard was a simple message coming from the headphones. ""They see you. Abort mission."" Then, a loud *thwak*.

I opened my own eyes, looking at my wall. For a moment, I could not move, nor speak. For the first time in years, I wished that I had gone to work.",Cronidor

Don't know how I got it, but it was fun to use and get the real story from others, to get their true thoughts. Being a student, I had plenty of subjects to test. And over time, I learned people are waaay different in private compared to their public image. But, there will always be one I remember, one that caught my undivided attention...

After classes, my friends and I liked to get some coffee at this cute local shop about 5 minutes by train from the university. I had to stay to help the professor, so I rode the train alone. I was casually scanning the people in the car, when one woman caught my attention. She had a blue suit on, she was wearing sunglasses underground, and had earbuds in, though I couldn't tell what she was listening to. Scanning over her produced a... resistance of sorts. Like trying to push through syrup. I was intrigued. I pushed, harder this time. ""Now, the next phase... Shit! They see you, abort mission!"" I saw her stand up, stiff as a board. The train was slowing to stop at the next station, and just this once, I skipped out on coffee.

Her pace was brisk. I could still hear that same voice on the train. ""I dunno where they are, but they're close. Once you get to the shelter, we'll discuss how we'll proceed."" We? What was this voice going on about? My phone rang in my pocket, likely my friends asking where I was. I ignored it, focusing on the woman. She made a quick turn right, into an alley. Trying to follow ran me into a wall.

This wall... I could not see. There should be nothing blocking my way. I banged on the invisible wall, trying to get her attention. I had to resort to talking through my powers. ""Hey! Who are you? How the hell is there a wall here?"" She turned. ""The time is not right, for you are too young. Soon, you will be called on. Are you prepared to make that sacrifice?"" Her talk was cryptic, and made no goddamn sense, no matter how I looked at. ""Sacrifice? Called on? The hell are you on about?"" She was unfazed by my questioning. ""Are you, or are you not?"" Should I answer? Was there a right one? What would happen if I said yes? ""Uhh... yeah, I guess?"" She shook her head. ""Youth are so indecisive. But, you indeed have accepted the offer. Be prepared at any moment, we will be watching."" A blink later, and a solid brick wall was in front of me. My pocket felt heavy, and reaching in revealed a note. ""Return..."" The rest were garbled letters.

My phone rung again. I really did need that coffee.",xXMrSandmanXx

The order stopped me cold in my tracks. I quickly used her eyes to see where the voice was coming from but I was too slow. She averted her gaze.

I bounced from pedestrian to pedestrian but to no avail. I was not able to see where the order came from.

I switched back to her ears and heard the tail end of another order
“… dangerous. Shoot on sight.”

My palms began to leak and I couldn’t control my breathing. Was I inside me or was I feeling her?

I’ve been using other people’s senses for so long that sometimes I get confused.

I focused myself and concentrated on my wife. She was my anchor for when I got lost. I imagined her golden hair and her angelic face and the sweet sound of her voice and I was finally back inside myself.

I continued to follow earbud girl. Either she was law enforcement or I had stumbled upon something dark and sinister.

I took over her sense of feel next. Her heart was beating uncontrollably. She was sweating and her body ached as if she had been worked over.

I took over taste and I caught the flavor of vomit.
Dear God! She was an unwilling partner in whatever was about to go down. I should try to help her, but how?

I jumped back into her ears but heard nothing but static. However was on the other end was gone for the moment.

I was about to try something I haven’t done in a while. In the 15 years I’ve had this ability I’ve learned that I can only take over one sense at a time without any ill effect. Trying to use more than one sense drained me.

I’ve also learned that I can sometimes will a person’s senses – in a sense take them over. But this drains me even more. So I try to be a passive observer.

I was about to break both of those rules in order to help this poor girl.

I jumped into sight and touch and I willed her body to pull her phone out of her pocket. I was weakening, but I have to see who contact her.

I will her to pull up the call log and what I see next pulls me out – Call from Special Agent Paul Fitzsimons. Crap.

The shock and strain on my senses and body are too much. I stumble and fall to the floor.

Earbuds turns and looks at me. She’s smiling. “Time’s up freak. Did you think this wouldn’t all catch up with you?”

“We trapped you. We knew you couldn’t stand by and watch a pretty girl in trouble. You are so easy to read. Did you think we’d let freaks like you run around unchecked?”

She pulls out a silver gun and I try to take her sense of touch. She’s too strong and I am too weak. I feel the trigger pull and I hear a loud bang.

As I lay bleeding on the ground all the memories come rushing back to me.
The government agency that took me from my parents. The facility where they tested our abilities. All the freak children that left the playroom one by one and never came back. The break out. The hunt. The hiding.

I had gotten too cocky and my number was up. As the life faded out of me I jumped into her ears one last time and I heard her say. “Target eliminated.”

And then I was gone.",CaptBaseballbatBoy01

talk to other people about what I could...see? About what I could experience. Once I had spent a few years in school, I abused it to cheat in every single one of my exams until a rather disastrous incident involving an in-class essay. Since then, I realised that I still had to do my own work since most of the time it was easier when I already knew the content. Of course, I was not averse to 'checking' my answers before time was up. No sir, not me.

With my little secret, I had managed to breeze through life without too much difficulty. I stayed out of everyone's way and people just generally didn't notice me. Over time, I had turned into a bit of a voyeur, a natural inquisitiveness that caused me to tune in to people's conversations, or texts they were reading, or enjoy food that they were enjoying. If I ever wanted a great dining experience, all I had to do was head to a nearby restaurant and tune into the patrons. It was an itch that never quite went away.

One day, I was heading to the local council for a licence application when I spotted that the girl walking in front of me was also listening to music, dressed in a tracksuit top and yoga pants. Seemed to be someone enjoying a nice afternoon walk. To take my mind off the rather chilly autumn breeze, I figured I'd just tune into her hearing and enjoy some music...as long as it wasn't Techno. I couldn't stand that stuff.  

""...they see you. Abort mission."" was all I heard, and it didn't sound like the lyrics to any song I knew. The girl visibly stiffened and picked up her pace. Now this....this was intriguing. Years and years of being impossibly nosey meant that this wasn't something I could simply let go. I just *had* to follow through. The licence application could wait a little longer. 

While the girl picked up the pace, moving from a brisk walk to a slow jog, I was jostled by two men in long, black heavy coats. I had never been great at maths (it was easier to cheat), but even I could put 2 and 2 together, so when they started jogging I picked up my pace as well. This continued for a few seconds before the girl, now a few hundred metres ahead, took a quick left into a small alleyway. The men followed shortly after.

I slowed down and decided to nonchalantly walk across the alleyway entrance while tuning into one of the men's senses. Doing this took quite some effort, as I still had to make sure I was walking straight. It seemed as though the girl had run into a dead end. As they slowly approached the girl, I got a good look at her face. She was a little older than I had initially thought, but still definitely in her twenties, and she was not looking very calm. Eyes wide, frantic and darting all over the place. My man (the one I was looking from) pulled out a gun and held it by his waist. His partner spoke up.

""Now missy. We know you know what you know. You know we know you know. We're all professionals, we all know how this goes, so why don't we just make it eas--"" I was distracted by a sudden and intense blossoming of pain around my head and shortly after, my back. Instinctively, I yelled out.

""Ahhhh fuck!""

Still looking through the eyes of one of the men, I saw him spin around and look at me lying on the ground, clutching my head, having just walked into a streetlamp. While I was wallowing in pain and about to tune out of the man to focus on my own personal problems, the man I was tuned into also experienced a much more excruciating burst of agony compared to what I was feeling in various...places. I quickly got the hell out of Dodge (figuratively) and slowly sat up, cradling my head and waiting for the phantom pain from the man to fade away.

""Ooohhh....."" I looked to my left, down towards the alley. The men were now lying motionless on the ground. The girl?

She was nowhere in sight.

The ones surprised the most were the moles themselves, who never would have guessed how I caught them backstabbing. I’m fortunate enough to have the ability to borrow other people’s senses. If I concentrate, I can see the papers my boss is reading, or listen to the music the janitor is playing. Of course, my talent only works if I’m within a certain distance from my target. Still, it’s very handy when trying to catch enemies red-handed. In addition to this, I have a third of the office paying me monthly in order to prevent their terrible secrets from being leaked out.


I was shadowing a suspect in a grocery store, waiting to see if it was a pretense for a meeting or drop-off of secrets. After selecting several heads of lettuce, she reached into her purse for a pair of earbuds. I had a moment of hesitation, I decide to listen in. “-And you've been spotted! Abort mission! Agent, you must-“ “Agent, I order you to go forward with the assassination, it’s too important.” The frantic voice was cut-off by a deep voice with a German accent. I dropped the connection, and dashed towards the assassin. This was no time for lallygagging, and I had been trained for this type of situation.


I knocked the woman with my shoulder, hard. Suddenly, I felt myself being tackled from the rear, and handcuffed to my legs! I turned around to see the faces of my colleagues, who looked disappointed. Around the aisle came Nick Fury himself, whose anger dominated my own. “You were our best agent, Franklin. I thought that a promotion would be coming to you shortly. You became the exact thing we fought against together.” The woman got up looking dazed, and I pointed at her with my chin. “She’s the one you want. She was being ordered to kill someone during a phone call, maybe it was you!” She shook her head.  “I was listening to a work of fiction about a spy with a conscience.

I want a good name but if the Twitter handle is already taken then screw it, I'll call myself Bob.  Or 6502.  Call me Ishmael.

Remember when your parents told you that you're going to be curious - and you're going to be confused - it's completely natural honey, there's nothing to be ashamed of.  Mom was wrong about that one.  You see a hot chick and you know she lives the perfect life.  You just know it.  She probably drives a Porsche - and it's not a costume, it just suits her.  Like everything else in her perfect life.  She tingles.  Or glows.  She's probably mewling right now.  I am curious and mom was wrong, I should probably be ashamed.

I've been ""delivering mail"" for seven years.  Recruited into the Post Office at 27 mostly for my math degree and my marksmanship.  We patrol the country, we watch, we deliver mail.  Sometimes we read it.  You want the best homeland security?  Those TSA jerkoffs don't have the first idea about how to protect.  They don't have the camouflaged boxy trucks with the while vinyl peel off sheets on every street in the entire country.  Oh, sure, they say ""USPS We deliver for you"" but peel off that white vinyl skin to reveal the camouflage painted war machine inside.  We wanted ""Protect and Serve"" but that one was taken.

Seven years of spy training and espionage and delivering mail got me the newest spy thingy.  And they warned me not to make it a sex thing.  Training, testing, examples, drills.  Rain, sleet, snow, and dark of night will not keep me from securing my country.  But she's probably mewling.  She probably does it all day long.  I want to feel what she feels.  Down there.  No thinking, I just click the button.  And the itching hits me like a Mack Truck.  It's a dump truck, loaded with crabs, and it's on fire, and it just hit me in my privates.  The part of Elvis will be played by Ishmael today.  Give me anything other than this, now, fast.

I get the earbuds with a calm and confident handler informing her that she's been seen and that she should probably not continue with her plans.  ""I'm sorry that you didn't get a chance to be the hero today Sarah, you knew that this could happen.  Did you see him Elvis!  Holy shit, I thought we'd find the agent from a little twitch or something but he went full Hound Dog on us.  Asshole USPS agents - they get the idiots for that job.""  

The country is less safe today.  I'm probably going to lose my job at the Post Office.  Even if I don't, they're never going to let me drive the camouflaged camouflage  trucks again.  They're going to put me in sorting down in the basement, I just know it.

I saw these places floating in a endless sky, and above them an ordinary man in a black suit, except for those horrible eyes. I had the mark on my hand since I was a boy. I learned in those dreams how to see through the eyes of others, to hear as they do, feel the taste of their food. I never knew how to do anything with it. I'm just a city guard. If I acted with the outsider's mark, even if I knew how beyond such subtlety, the Overseers would have me burned in hours. Mostly, I just use my power to avoid the worst shifts, score better at card games, that kind of thing.

There was one time, however, something I couldn't explain happened. I was assigned to that fancy mansion down in Karnacas, and things wrre surprisingly slow for guarding a mad geniuses shifting house. I was reading a book in the library, pretending to be on guard, when I just happened to spot with my own eyes, a woman standing on top of the bookcase I was at. Amazingly, she didn't see me, and I decided it better not to make myself a target, based on that sword. She then somehow morphed her arm into... something and whipped across the chamber. I turned around and took her ears, just to see what was going on. Seems she had one of the clanker's speakers in her hood, and my lunatic boss was talking through it. ""They see you, abort mission!"", he taunted her. She flipped around, and the last thing I remember was a sharp pain in my chest, and becoming very tired. 

I woke up on a chandelier, with 7 of my fellow guards confusedly waking up below me. I can't explain what happened, but I have no intention of bringing it up and calling attention to myself. Especially since now I'm out of a job.",arthursbeardbone

Jonus made a note to mention it at the end of the meeting. Otherwise, the outline of the North Corde Children's Center was as crisp and lucid as ever, the grass trim, the hedges pruned, the shutters an elegant black and gray, closed tight over double-thick panes of spotless glass.

He remembered worrying, not so long ago, that North Corde was the right choice for Fredric's education - that the small, private school was properly equipped to meet Fredric's many unique needs. But they had impressed him then, and they continued to impress him through the bleeding of time and the rise and fall of each individual semester. Fredric grew, and grew well, never complaining or showing signs of want.

The meeting, therefore, was a surprise. Jonus had been called away from work - not a thing done lightly in his particular line. But the staff at North Corde were adamant. It was *important*. It was about Fredric - things he had done and the child he had become.

Jonus could not ignore the lump of stone in the center of his stomach. They had been so vague. It disgusted him to question his own son, who had never been less than a marvel, but what could it be? The secretary's voice was shrill and tremulous. Whatever it was lay heavily upon her, and so it lay heavily upon Jonus.

The secretary herself met him at the sliding doors, grabbing his arm and petting his wrist in a strange, familiar way. ""Thank, Mr. Hosgrove. Thank you so much. It really is very urgent.""

""What? What is it?"" said Jonus, allowing himself to be directed through the slick, glistening hallways, scented as always in lavender and pine.

""The Viceroy will explain,"" said the secretary, still absently stroking his wrist. ""He will explain.""

Jonus' shoes clomped loudly down the tiled hall. He strained to hear the children, murmuring so quietly behind heavy, steel doors. They were all so well behaved at North Corde. Never a stray sound. 

They entered a nest of offices, then swooped to the right, into a sunny conference room. The table at the center was bright red - the crest of North Corde engraved into one end, the Seal of the Republic burned into the other. North Corde's Viceroy - a purplish man with pronounced veins and an overly stiff manner named Gerrault - rose briefly to clutch at Jonus' hand.

""Mr. Hosgrove, we appreciate your time.""

""I'm given to think this is something significant,"" said Jonus, taking a seat as the secretary swept out of the room, Jonus' coat draped like the corpse of Christ across her arms. ""How fairs Fredric?""

The Viceroy cleared his throat. ""That's the subject at hand,"" he said. ""There has been an incident.""

Jonus' heart thumped within his chest. ""And?""

The Viceroy blinked. ""You have long been aware of the ways in which Fredric differs from his classmates, correct? His attitude. His...*social nature*.""

""I commissioned a full study when the boy was four,"" said Jonus, more than a little coldly. ""I am fully aware of what he is and what he is capable of. And so are you. And so is everyone in this school. These were discussions that occurred *long* before he enrolled, and if you are going to tell me *now* that you..."" 

""Please,"" said the Viceroy, holding up his hands in submission. ""No offense was meant. And you are correct - we have always known what Fredric may be capable of. But, Mr. Hosgrove, I must say - he has exceeded those expectations...by a great margin.""

Jonus leaned across the enameled oak. ""What happened?""

The Viceroy nodded, smiling just so. ""Are you familiar with Mr. Upshum? Fredric's Natural Science teacher?""

Jonus nodded.

""Very intelligent man. High marks at Western Guard. Highly recommended. This post was his first. Good community man, as well. Liked here and elsewhere. There was nothing to suspect. No signs. A very, very clever man. With clever friends, one assumes.""

""What are you getting at?"" said Jonus.

""Fredric suspected,"" said the Viceroy. 

""Suspected what?""

""That he was not a native.""

Jonus' head swam. ""He was...?""

""Born in the Old Country. How he crossed the border, we may never know. He hid himself as well as any man may."" The Viceroy shook his head. ""I took him for a countryman. So did everyone else. Except for Fredric.""

""Fredric?"" whispered Jonus. He had almost forgotten that his son played some role in the tale. 

""You should be proud, Mr. Hosgrove,"" said the Viceroy. ""So very, very proud. We have all become just a bit soft, I believe. Content. We wish to believe the best. Some, if I may be blunt, some I do not believe even *cared* where Upshum had come from. But not Fredric. That is a special boy, Mr. Hosgrove.""

""What happened?"" said Jonus.

""He distrusted,"" said the Viceroy, smiling more openly. ""Then he hunted. He found the *truth*, your boy. He was not taken by the man's lies. He believes in the vision of this Republic - with all his heart and soul. It is truly a wonder to behold.""

""So he discovered the man's lie?"" said Jonus. He was proud, certainly, but even an achievement such as this could have surely waited?

""Yes,"" said the Viceroy. ""But more than that. He carried out the Republic's justice.""

""He...?""

""He put the man down,"" said the Viceroy. ""In the classroom. In front of his classmates.""

Jonus pushed away from the table, rising on unsteady legs. 

""Naturally, there will be an inquiry, as there must be,"" said Viceroy. ""But I've seen Fredric's work. The documents he uncovered. If anything, you should expect the boy to be honored for this. A National Star, First Class, I might suspect. So you see, it seemed a thing we should discuss right away.""

""He killed the man?"" said Jonus, staggering to the window. ""My boy killed his teacher?""

""Shot,"" said the Viceroy. ""I suspect it was your gun, correct?""

""And the other children?""

""Quite fine,"" said the Viceroy. ""Deeply in awe of your Fredric. He'll be a hero in their eyes for years to come.""

Jonus nodded. ""A hero.""

""We can all learn a lot from that boy of yours, Mr. Hosgrove.""

""A hero,"" repeated Jonus, letting the word roll around in his mouth until the taste had gone out of it. ""I always knew he was a special boy.""

""And now we see just how special,"" said the Viceroy. He stood up and met Jonus at the window, extending his hand. ""Congratulations. A boy like that is in so many ways a reflection on his father. Thank you.""

Jonus shook the offered hand. It helped to mask the quiver that ran throughout his limbs. ""I've simply done the best I could.""

The Viceroy nodded. ""Now, I'm sure you'd like to see your son. They should be done by now.""

""Done with what?"" said Jonus.

""He asked to have a picture taken with the body,"" said the Viceroy. ""A photo of his trophy, so to speak.""

""His trophy,"" said Jonus, mouth barely moving.

""Come, come,"" said the Viceroy, laughing. ""We shouldn't keep the hero waiting!""

And again, Jonus let himself be led through those quiet, shiny hallways that reeked of pine and lavender and a just a hint of blood and gun powder. ",WinsomeJesse

[OT] Workshop Q&amp;A #7,madlabs67,"I'm assuming when you say 'place to place' you're referencing your exciting scenes? And you're just looking for a logical filler between these?

One possible solution is subplots. Fill the intervening space with other little events and scenarios that would fit your characters. For example (and bear with me while I use Harry Potter as a reference), the fourth HP book isn't just about the triwizard tournament. In between you've got Fred and George blackmailing Ludo Bagman, or Hermione creating S.P.E.W. . Both are entertaining. It lightens ups the plot because it's not *just* about the tournament anymore, but it makes sense given the character's personalities and it doesn't detract from the overall arch of the story.

Other than that... hmmm... I find dialogue and time jumps can work well. Of course, they can be abused. But with careful application that can liven up the meandering.

Third possible solution is, well, keep meandering until you have a super long story, and then edit out all the unnecessary waffle. But, that sounds like what you're trying to avoid.

2) Emotions, emotions, emotions. Stong endings always tug on the heart strings in some sort of way. After the climax, focus on the aftermath and the emotional damage/addition it created.

3) Always keep your details in line with the STORY you want to tell. While you might be attached to the, ""Red brick stove with years of wear from careless cast iron cooking wear and the pine wood fires that's been cooking food for over 154 years.""

""I have been brought *where*, exactly?"" I query again.  Merlin looks at me, and replies, ""This is Camelot, in Britain... but it is not *where* you are, rather, it is *when*"", he mentions as he peers at me, leaving a few moments before stating, ""It is the year 494 of his lord and savior"" Hearing a slight edge of sarcasm at the end of that last sentence. ""To be said concisely, young scholar, you were brought here from your time, to ours, to save King Arthur and his lands"".  His deep voice sinking into my still sleepy head and his words become apparent.

Feeling a little perplexed, I stare at a random piece of parchment hanging on the wall opposite me, contemplating what was just said.  This time I have the furled brow.  Confused, I pipe up ""How am I meant to do this? I am one person.  And what is going to happen to the King, uhhh"" I stumble a moment ""the King Arthur?""  Something seems amiss.  Oddly familiar even.

Before I can continue my thoughts, the old man is in front of me. Sitting back and looking up at him, he pulls something from beneath his robes, revealing a large box the size of pumpkin. Thrusting it in my direction, ""this box will allow you to bring one item per day, to you from your time.  Help us."" His voice succinct in manner, almost demanding it. ""We have word from a scout the Saxons will be here on the seventh sunrise. Bringing an army able to crush this great castle of Tintagel.""

I hold the box firmly between my palms, thinking it odd I was chosen, why? Why me?.  I look up and say to him, ""Give me a moment, I'm still a little sleepy, I don't suppose you have coffee?""  The old man looks at me, squints one eye cocking his head a little and repeats the word in his deep voice, ""Cof-fee?"".  Continuing ""I just want coffee"". Suddenly the box in my hands gets heavy.  Looking down and opening the lid, I peer inside; there's an enormous amount of coffee beans. The smell alone invigorates my slumbering head.

The old man looks at me with the apparent intention of rolling his eyes. ""Unless this cof-fee will save the realm of Camelot, you have wasted today's request"".  *So that's how it works...huh*. I reply ""It prevents tiredness, in a sense...I like to drink it in the morning, after waking up.""  Motioning with one hand a sip of a mug, trying to look hopeful.  He looks at me almost like he's going to shake his head disapprovingly.  He breathes in deeply, exhaling with a small sigh.  Stepping closer he picks one up and inspects it.  Looking up from the bean, he asks, ""Well if you desire it, let us make this cof-fee"".

A short time later we've jerry rigged a basic coffee press, with hot water a hessian bag and a pot. Rudimentary, but it seems to have the job done. Handing him a mug, he sips and curls his lips back. ""What bitterness this is, how do you enjoy this?"".  Retorting ""Some people have milk and sugar, I myself prefer it straight!"" Said perhaps too enthusiastically, awaiting the caffeine hit.  Taking a gulp, ""Straight gets the caffeine in me faster old man!"". In a stern voice he responds ""My name as Merlin.  Not *Old Man*..."" His voice trails off...""I feel this cof-fee working, a tingling in my head.  Very clever, what else does your time have apparent to this?"".  It's then it clicks that perhaps this is the way I can save Camelot.  A few seconds later I explain how in our time we have studied and found various compounds reside within foods and minerals that have various effects on us; things to keep us awake, asleep, both long and short term affects, all in compounded tablets, powders and mixtures. A dark thought crossed my mind, *Perhaps drugs can turn the battlefield; how else can I have an army win?*, I keep this to myself for now.""  The rest of the day is spent pondering various ideas whilst wondering his quarters.

The next morning with Merlin in front of me, a mug of coffee each, wide awake and jittery I begin explaining my idea. ""Some of the compounds we have increase speed, agility and strength temporarily, perhaps they could be of value?"" I postulate the idea towards Merlin. ""The negative effects of this are generally short term, a withdrawal of them leaves the user somewhat incapacitated."" Looking at me quizzically, his deep voice expresses his thoughts as he looks down rubbing his beard between forefinger and thumb, ""Hmmmm, I see what you are saying. Though perhaps a gamble such as this is perhaps not the best route to take.  Is there no other means?"" Looking up at me in hope of another answer.  ""Perhaps new weaponry or armor?"".  It's unfortunate, my comprehension of weaponry is limited, and armor too.  Grasping the box between my two hands I make my next request.

*""That's right!""*

The professor still didn't buy it. He knew they only exist in theory, it's just a marketing gimmick. The students were just as dumbfounded, all 300 of them in the lecture hall.

*""You don't buy it? Try it yourself.""*

Sure enough, the professor went ahead and tested it. It felt like lifting something with Mr. Fantastic's hands. He then carried it. Shocked, he turned to the classroom, and said, ""Feels like I'm carrying... nothing at all!"" Those words echoed throughout the lecture hall.

The professor immediately turned towards the salesman and said, ""Alright I'll bug, how do you make this work?"" The shrewd salesman was adamant - there's no way he's going to let the cat out of the bag, and if the professor wants to figure it out, he needs to buy it. ""I'll sell it to you in a second, professor, but that's not my issue here. I came here to ask you and the students if you could figure out something for me.""

See, the guy was in a quandary - his sales were going poorly, and he was thinking it's because he wastes too much time each day just entering the next address he knows on Google Maps, and walking a hell of a lot without any plan or sense of direction.

Instead of there being a wheel with an axis, like regular pulleys, the pulley was a cube. A plain white cube with two wholes, one marked ""in"" and the other ""out"". It did not look like anything. Maybe a half finished die could be used as a comparaison.

""So as you can tell, my frictionless weightless pulleys are not ordinary. They don't use the wheel and axis type mechanism, rather a thin circle of condensed air acts as a wheel. So when lifting the pulley, you only lift the casing.""

""Excuse me sir I have a question ?"" Interrupted a student.

""Yes, you at the back.""

""So they're not ordinary, I get that. But can you use them like any other pulley?""

""Well yes, it's a pulley just..""He stopped, feeling that class wasn't paying attention.

Indeed, all the students with talking amongst themselves. Mr.Sellwad could pick up two words coming up often. ""90kilos"" and ""300 meters"".

""Excuse me class ? Please pay attention to our guest."" Said the teacher, clapping his hands.

""I'm sorry sir, but how much weight could those pulleys withstand?"" Said the same student as before, with a complex look on his face.

""Well, since the air acts as the wheel the pulley could lift theoretically any weight !"" Exclaimed Mr.Sellwad.

Again, the class went into chatter mode. The students all talked, some even yelled, and no amount of clapping from the teacher could stop them from talking. Mr.Sellwad could not understand why those students were so interested, they were pullies, why did they care ?

""SIR ! How much are you selling them for ?!""

""Heum...150$ each why ?""

In unison, all the students brandished their wallets and threw bills onto the floor, next to the seller. The students then rushed to the pulleys, grabbed one and ran out the class.

""MORE THEN 90KG FOR MORE THAN 300 METERS !!!"" Yelled a student.

All the other students exploded with a roar of approval.

""Oh no I know what they are doing."" Announced the teacher.""Follow me"" He said, talking to Mr.Sellwad.

When the two men were outside, they were greeted by a full sized trebuchet. The student had loaded it and were now taking aim at the next school over. 

""Guys ! That school is 700 meters away. Our calculations indicate that a 150 kg boulder needs to be launched to destroy it fully. And I know this baby is up to the task !"" 

The other students roared 

The leader of the warband walked to the trigger mechanism. He fired the trebuchet. The boulder launched at fascinating speed, soared through the sky and... over shot. Thanks to Mr.Sellwad, a 150kg projectile was thrown +700m.

Ten years later, Mr.Sellwad was sacred knight of chrisondom for holding a major role in retaking Jerusalem. 

Long live the trebuchet ! Long live Mr.Sellwad and his pulleys ! Long live the king !

Upon arriving at a university's engineering class, everyone's suddenly very interested for some reason.",willyolio,"The halls were empty, and Big Tom Harksfield daydreamed about being a kid again, sent to the principal's office. Usually he'd go into high schools, maybe meet with the head of the science department, even physics classes. Lots of long walks down empty hallways before rejection. This time, he actually had an appointment with someone.

The receptionist in the science hall had barely even looked at him until he mentioned the pulleys. ""Maybe you'll want to talk to Professor Hicks,"" she said, glancing at a rolodex. ""He's engineering. He'd be the one to see.""

Just then Harksfield kicked himself for not thinking to visit universities earlier. *High school still sucks,* he thought grudgingly. *Frictionless pulleys to sell, and I can't unload them.* He remembered frowning Mr. Spears in high school physics, not letting students talk until the bell rang, and thinks physics teachers are as good at understanding the possibilities of frictionless pulleys as Harksfield is at understanding how they work.

He should be a millionaire. But he still lived in a trailer.

Then, hope. Room 110. Engineering 101, he assumed. Or *Intro to Engineering.* Harksfield knocked and walked right in, the way he'd grown accustomed to, and almost had a heart attack when he sees a full class.

Professor Hicks, writing on the whiteboard, had eyes in the back of his head, like any good professor should. He turned around and eyed Harksfield down. ""Can I help you, sir?""

""I'm...sorry,"" Harksfield managed. He feels all of the eyes in the room on him. ""I can come back at a better time.""

""No,"" Hicks said, stepping forward. ""You've already interrupted. Might as well hear you out.""

""I'm a salesman."" Harksfield knows better to start off with *I'm a salesman,* but he'd rather lose the sale and go home with his tail tucked between his legs than keep talking.

But Hicks remained unphased. ""And you're selling...?""

""Pulleys.""

""Pulleys. Ha! You've come to the right place."" Finally some sound out of the students. Muted laughter, but it eased Harksfield's mind.

""The thing about these pulleys is that they're massless--""

""Of course they are.""

Hicks looked perfectly open to the idea, yet somehow Harksfield couldn't help but feel patronized. Even through his apparent defeat, he finished the sentence: ""--and frictionless.""

""Yes. But I have no need for pulleys, even frictionless pulleys, and this certainly is'nt the time for it..."" The professor trailed off. Someone in the front row was raising their hand. ""Yes?""

The student was a gangly young man with jet black hair and an adam's apple obvious even from where Harksfield was. ""Excuse me, how can a pulley be frictionless? That doesn't make sense.""

Harksfield had heard the protest a thousand times. *Just let me demonstrate,* he'd say, but they'd cut him off first, or assume that the demonstration was some sort of trick. He mentally prepared for the demonstratoin, so much so that he barely noticed Hicks' face get red.

""I see,"" Hicks said. ""Mr. Salesman, how much do you want for that pulley?""

""Oh! Uh--$2000 per pulley.""

""Frictionless, massless. Worth every penny, wouldn't you say?"" The class erupts in applause and cheers, and the student who spoke up--Adam's Apple--looks positively dejected.

Harksfield then realized that he absolutely no fucking idea what these people were on about. 

But for four months' rent, he'd put up with Hicks for a little while.

For some reason, Hicks decided to end class right then and there, and for some stranger reason, none of the students left. Instead other professors gathered when Hicks told them what was going on--never above the roar of the students talking to each other. Hicks pointed to Harksfield, who lifted one of the pulleys out of his bag.

""You can use your own rope,"" Harksfield said, not sure what else to say to the engineering professors. ""It still works.""

To his surprise, not a one of them questioned the massless or frictionless pulleys. They looked positively giddy instead. One professor even clapped his hands when he saw it. Another professor--or maybe an administrator--presented Harksfield with a check for $2,000, right on the spot.

When Harksfield went to leave, Hicks grabbed him by both shoulders and pointed him to a different door. ""Oh, no,"" he said. ""Spare an hour? You'll want to see this.""

The class erupted in cheers. Adam's Apple was beet-red.

They led him to an open gymnasium, where word must have gotten out about the pulleys. Harksfield almost felt proud, finally showing off his product, and imagined all the sales he would make once word got out. The only one not happy about it all was Adam's Apple, who tried to escape through the doors before behind held back by at least six other students. *Hicks must want to prove a point,* Harksfield figured.

They led Adam's Apple to the center of the gym, and Hicks worked with a janitor to rig the pulley to the top of the ceiling. The roar was loud by then, students all talking excitedly to each other. Harksfield took the extra time to bring out his phone and text his girlfriend about the sale, but before he could press *Send,* he saw Hicks with a microphone.

""Today, you're going to witness something we haven't witnessed in a long time,"" he said.

Then, someone who must be higher up walked in from the crowd, an old woman with a limp, dressed in all black. Hicks passed her the microphone.

""This pulley is frictionless, massless,"" she said after Hicks whispered in her ear. ""But this student""--she pointed at Adam's Apple--""could not possibly comprehend that his elder would possibly tell the truth to him. This student...*questioned.*""

The crowd was hushed now. Hicks pulled the last end of the pulley rope around Adam's Apple's neck. Adam's Apple kicked and screamed, and it was then that Harksfield noticed that his hands had been bound.

""Mr. Blake, show them what happens to students who *question.*""

The custodian flipped a switch, and Adam's Apple went flying into the air--as if the rope had no mass.

But Adam's Apple had mass. The rope tightened around his neck, and he kicked and kicked until the life left his body.

The crowd roared.",Starfall_University

[WP] You can read minds. Literally. You write a name in a book and your targets life appears as words on the page.,Azazel-IMX,"It was scary when I found out what I could do, but once the initial panic wore off... so beautiful. If i think about a person enough as I write their name, their every though from that moment writes itself on the paper. But the mind is not just some logbook- people never think of only one thing at a time. Thoughts have no respect for lined pages, crisp and white, nor for grammar or even each other.

My first was the boy I had a crush on in high school. Jeremy Mayfield. I must have spent a thousand hours staring at the back of his head in English class. I wrote his name, dotting the I with a heart, on the back page of a schoolbook.  And then his thoughts poured forth on the page, swelling out from the name like pooling water. The red capital letters of the Lub-Dub of his heartbeat, the navy-blue scrolling calligraphy of his dreams, the black pidgeonscratch of problem-solving... all weaving and overlapping each-other across the page with no rhyme or reason for their flow. It left a border around his name of a centimetre or so, and continued to pour his waking and subconscious thoughts until the page was covered, littered with him.

I must have done a thousand names by now, on larger and larger canvases. I find it so... mesmerising, So soothing, to watch the words pour out like syrup, twisting and worming their way to the very edges. Sometimes I even read them, though it feels...taboo. These are what someone truly thinks after all. I was devastated after I read Jeremy's and say he never though of me at all. But reading them... that's not the good part. Watching them spiral, swirl, in a thousand hands across the page is enough to amuse me for a lifetime... Until of course the inevitable crossed my mind.

I bought a huge canvas, as tall as me and twice as wide. I wrote as many names on there as I could. I watched as a hundred names fought for space, refusing to overlap except where the people did- couples thoughts were not held by the constraints of their part of the canvas. Some others invaded each other, sudden attacks or occasional border skirmishes. Some came close, and fled as if replused by each other. 

I must have sat their for hours, watching as the canvas filled with the lives of my friends and family and celebrities alike. IT was so... hypnotic. It took days before it was full, a chaotic harmony of peoples lives, all mapped out on the wall. I read some... but that was't the point of this, of my art. I was fascinated by the shapes of peoples minds, how they struggled or snuggled against each other, who attacked and who invited. I'd created a map of this community, this group of people who probably didn't even know must of the others on there.

That was the beginning of my addiction. I have no idea how much now I have spent on canvas and ink... but it's not enough. It never will be. This beauty....it consumes.",eternal8phoenix
[WP] You can read minds. Literally. You write a name in a book and your targets life appears as words on the page.,Azazel-IMX,"-“Would you look at all this crap?!” 

My brother never really understood the concept of grieving… Here he stood, overlooking all the knickknacks, jazz magazines, newspapers, ancient items of clothing, crackled furniture and a container worth pile of various shaped felt-tips while I was sitting in the favorite chair of our late Grandparent.

-“Can you please stop whining and help me sort all those things like I asked you to maybe 3 hours ago? The truck Dad rented is going to be here any minute now and we still have these to put in boxes!” I distractedly shouted. “You grab that heavy desk and bring it outside; I’m going to put the pens in that box for our yard-sale tomorrow.”

-“Remind me why we are doing this again? Sarah, this is a job for a MOVING company or maybe HER grandchildren at least!

-Yes well it seems like none of them cared enough to come and take care of her possessions. I mean they thought she was a little bit of a lunatic but come on, they could at least have come to her funeral yesterday…”

Eric blatantly sighed and put his arms around said desk. His gray shirt was already very soaked from perspiration on his back and armpits. Eric was the fittest of the family so he always was asked to help during heavy lifting. He carried it through the main door and disappeared behind the purple willow’s leaves. My outfit wasn’t very dry itself, and as I remained seated, I felt like I could use a minute of fresh breeze on my face. I stood up, poured as many pens as I could fit into this cardboard basket and watched the mesmerizing flow of colors elapse.

Suddenly, a sparkle caught my eye. I reached into the layers of pencils and grabbed the unusual object… It was a black varnished full sized wood felt-tip with very detailed gold engravings. Smooth lines were circling the word Develare and loop at the end of the lead. This pen clearly stood out of the others and somehow, this distinctive feature made me choose to not put it back and almost unwillingly conceal it in my trousers’ pocket. 
-“Sarah, are you finished sorting the books from the attic?” 
I jumped from surprise. I didn’t hear my brother come back in. I realized straightaway that the truck pulled up in the driveway was still running, making a lot of muffled noise. 

I slowly responded: “Almost, there is a few more that I need to check out…” I walked towards the improvised library and closed the door behind me in order to keep the truck’s stifled sounds away.
As I was glancing through the rest of the books, one distinguished itself. It had a rich leather cover and radiant gold markings showing: 

Those who enter this reality beware

For it is not for amateurs to bear

May the Eye reveal to you

What you always wanted to be true

Fascinated, I ran my fingers across the blank pages, expecting some sort of science fiction story or designs. Unfortunately, it wasn’t the case. The book seemed untouched until I reached the last page.
Here was written in a powerful red color what was titled: The rules and warnings of the gift Létô brought to Phoebus: May the blood in this ink lock the stories and may the stories unveil only to the one who swore. I never saw anything like it. My grandma’s name was at the very bottom among 5 or 6 others.
  I sat down on the floor, positioning the mysterious book in front of me. I took the felt-tip I found earlier out of his hideout and put it right aside the book. They clearly matched. I taunted myself, should I dare? I picked up the pen. The lead went from shady black to intense red.

 “What’s the harm anyway, it’s just a very stylish stupid book, and Grandma signed it, it really can’t be that horrifying for me to use it after she passed away” I took the pen and wrote my name at the very first page in order to start a logbook of this place. 
My newly written name was swallowed into the fabric. I turned the sheet multiple times as I couldn’t believe my eyes… It had disappeared! 

I flipped the pages… until I realized my name got added right next to my grandmother’s…

[WP] You can read minds. Literally. You write a name in a book and your targets life appears as words on the page.,Azazel-IMX,"I grunted as I yanked The Book out of its drawer, it was as heavy as a large rock. A dark hardcover book with a large padlock on the side, and a picture of a speech bubble on the cover, was my companion. I really had no other friends. I mean, who needs friends, when you've got what I've got? I mean, the ability to read minds? Well, I don't exactly read minds like ""Professor X"" or anything, but instead, I write a name in a book, and what they're thinking appears as words on a page!

Pretty cool huh? I blew the dust off the cover of the book as I dropped the book on my table, and it landed with a *thud*. I pulled the key from out of a box in a box in a box. I had to be security conscious, you know, if word got out that I had abilities like this...things would turn bad pretty quick.

I opened the lock with the key and set them aside, and heaved open the book. ""The Book"", as I called it, was almost a thousand pages long, and each page was as long as a school notebook.

I pulled out my pen, a deep black one, smooth and fluent it was, and put it to the paper.

""Brittany Nelson"".

I scribbled it quickly, and as soon as I was done, the page was suddenly flooded with different words, thoughts, pouring out all over the place. She was the girl I'm currently crushing on. I promised myself I'd never do this, but I couldn't resist it. I mean, entering someone's thoughts? You'd think that your mind is the one place that you'd get some privacy, but in my case, definitely not. 

I had gone the minds of all kinds of people, and I've seen some terrible, terrible things that I really wish that I hadn't had seen. People that you'd least suspect, like your lunch lady was a part time drug dealer, and your best friend's uncle was an assassin. I mean, sometimes I used my ability for good and stopped crimes from happening, but I guess that's messing with fate or something, isn't it?

I wasn't really much a social person. I kept to myself at school and only really talked to when needed or talked to. I guess I'm not *ugly*, but I'm no Tatum Channing either. So it'd be no surprise if Brittany thought I was a total loser. But, to my surprise, it was the total opposite.

I stared at the words on the page, my mouth agape. What...what is this?

""Phil looked so hot today in his navy blue sweater!""

""Phil looked at me and smiled at me again! Slowly making progress, soon it'll be more than just a smile he'll be giving me!""

""Oh...Phil Anderson...hehehehehehe!""

""Ms Brittany Amy Anderson....Ms Brittany Amy Anderson....Ms Brittany Amy Anderson...."".

And that was just a small taste of what horrific things I saw, She had a long list of things she wanted to do with me. This was scary, I don't think I have a crush on her anymore...Wait, wait, what's this? A new thought appeared on the page.

""I think it's time. I don't want to be a virgin any longer. I want Phil, the whole of him. I'll call him and invite him over!""

I frowned as I finished reading. This was bad, this was-

I liked to sing, but that had never been my gift. Really, I just liked to talk. I could talk the paint off a wall. I liked to hear my own voice, I was often my own company. I didn't make friends easily and my weird behavior made my own family uncomfortable. 

I talked to plants. And the cats. 

Well, by talk I mean... converse. One sided, of course. Or it had been. You see, most people believe in fantasy until they are eleven or twelve. Then reality sets in and your childhood pets die. Or you move on to boys/girls/sports/tv. You have real, vital humans to talk to. 

Well, I didn't. Something about me put them off, so I kept talking to what I had. Imaginary friends. Then my pets. Then, eventually, a cactus named Gary.

It had been a joke, really. My brother came to visit and gave me the cactus. 

""Even you can't kills this."" He said it so proud. He gave it fucking googly eyes and told me to have fun with my new boyfriend. 

At first I was mad. But it wasn't Gary's fault. 

The cat agreed with me. ""Your brother is a complete asshole,"" she said. 

I agreed with her. 

So I thought Gary might be a good friend to have. The cat was bored to tears with helping me study. She preferred Spanish Soaps. 

I didn't think Gary would be much help. I had never spoken to a plant before. 

Yet, the more I asked for his help, the more I told him about scientific theory and my own fears about dying alone... the more he seems to grow. Bigger and bigger. 

Until one day he said, ""Excuse me, but could we change the subject."" 

I put Gary in the kitchen with the cat and went out to buy a rock. Maybe the rock would let me talk to him without interrupting.",WhateverSlayer

"[WP] Dementors bring your deepest, darkest memories to the surface. Some people see death. Others see bad grades. But what do the Dementors see?",BookWyrm17,"So many hours of the last week I had spent running. I had been running from the ministry, from the collectors, and most of all my memories. I knew if I gave myself more than a few moments of peace, those horrible emotions would permeate my facade of moving forward. One moment spent wondering and contemplating what I could have done differently was an emotional death sentence. 

The woods on this side of the country were so dense it was hard to navigate. The deeper you went in, the more solid and permanent the trees became. Eventually, I hit a wall of trees and was face to face with gray crackled bark and trunks so long it was almost impossible to see to the top of the them.

I felt a chill on the nape of my neck. Without turning, I could see the grass to the left of me begin to freeze and become a crisp white, glistening with frost. 

I knew I was cornered. I reached into my pocket for my wand. My heart dropped as I fiddled more and more with my jacket pocket, hoping with one more reach, it would appear and save me. I patted the rest of my body frantically. There had to be a way. 

The air kept getting colder until I felt I could no longer stand it. I finally turned my back and to my dismay, dementors encroached from every direction. I could see at least five and I braced for the worst. There was no escaping now and five dementors was most surely a death sentence. 

So quickly I didn't have time to duck, a dementor dove from above and I felt the most isolating pain I had ever expericed. 

Thalia. I pleaded but the memories prevailed. The dementors kiss only drew them out. I kept seeing my poor girl's face as I watched that man take her away. Tears streaming down her cherub face, screaming bloody murder and they ripped her from my fingers. My greatest fear had been confirmed three weeks ago and I was helpless but to live it again and again. 

One by one the remaining dementors took turns breathing me in. My body felt tossed around, I repeatedly collapsed and was drawn back up with the power of their breath. I managed one final scream in defiance. 

Thalia. I failed my sweet child. I couldn't fight my demons. I couldn't face the truth in time to save her. I had to watch as the collector took her away. Growing up, all I wanted was to succeed and be remembered as a wonderful mother. But now, I would be known as the mother who gambled her daughter away. Who knew where Thalia was now. Any number of awful thing could of happened to her.

I stared up at sky, nearly black now as night fell appropriately on the darkest moment of my life.  The dementors still continued to draw me out, and my soul began to ebb. I felt my conciousness wane and was helpless to their one last breath. I fell to the ground and accepted death. In the midst of my defeat, I could of swore somewhere in the distance there was a voice.

"[WP] ""They said it never hurts to love once. But they're wrong.""",BookWyrm17,"They said it never hurts to love once. But they're wrong. Love is a bitch. She'll wrap you up in her arms, close and warm, then when your guards is down and you think you can trust her, she'll rip you into little pieces. And that's if you're lucky.

If you're not?

Let's use an example. There was a guy...let's say his name in Ben. Ben loved Carly. Carly loved Ben. They got married, and moved in together.... and thats when it started. The little fights over petty things, stupid habits that drove the other up the wall. A thousand little things. You ever see what happens if you forcibly overfill a glass bottle with more air than it can take? 

The whole damn thing shatters at once- turns to sharp shrapnel dust, and takes out everyone in the room.

That's what happened with Ben and Carly. Little fights, not resolved properly grew to bigger ones. They got friends and family involved, people took sides. The divorce was long and messy.

You know what hurts worse than that? Watching that one love die, slowly. Might be cancer, might just be age, but watching that light flicker and die will destroy you. Messy fights might take out families, but a slow parting that you are still reaching for. Love won't kill you, she'll just watch as you cut yourself, again and again for her, reaching for what isn't there anymore. That's just plain cruel.

But you know what the worst fate? Never loving, not even once. Ben and Carly, yeah they got hurt, but at least they got to enjoy part of the ride. Tim, on the other hand... Tim was too afraid of getting hurt. Guarded his heart with iron walls and sentries every thirty yards. Never let himself get close to anyone, no matter how they tried.

So people stopped trying.

He grew old, alone. He had a few friends, and he would laugh along with them, but when he got the worst news... he got it alone. Cancer. There was no-one to hold his hand when he cried. There was no-one to hold him close and tell him it was going to be ok. He faced the void alone with his thoughts that twisted and raged against himself, with not a soul to save him.

That, my friends, is true hell. At least Ben and Carly still had the memory of the other, and if the worst did happen they could still turn to each other. Hate and Love are cousins... and where love once was it is easier to bring again. Tim... Tim died alone. There were a few people at his funeral, but no-one laid a rose on his coffin. No-one shed a tear.

They're wrong tp say it never hurts to love once, but it pales in comparison to the dull, gnawing, grinding ache that it is to never love at all.",eternal8phoenix

The Diary of Ella D Rich, aged 5 2/3



   Monday, March 23rd



~~Chtu~~, ~~Chut~~, Our puppy came home today! Daddy put up a fence and a kennel for him, because the doctor said he will be asleep for a long time. I'm not allowed to go out and play with him. ~~Cuht~~, ~~Chooter~~, he needs to rest. So mom and daddy said I can't even go in the garden, or I might open his fence! He must be sad in there on his own, so I made a model of him to be his friend whilst he is sleeping. It looks just like him!


   Wednesday, March 25th



I asked mom how to spell Cthulhu, and sat at the back door to look at him. I hope the model I left him kept him company, it was only a little one, so I thought I could not see it when I went outside but I could see it. There were ants everywhere around the model, so I don't think Cthulhu got to see his present. I think the ants moved it.



   Thursday, April 2nd



I think Cthulhu has woken up now, but I am still not allowed to go outside and play with him, mom says he is still recovering. I think the ants have taken my model, but I sat and looked to see if Cthulhu would come out, I miss him! When I see him I will kiss him, his floppy mouth whiskers are tickly! And then we will play in the garden, we like to wrestle. I called Cthulu's name from the back door, but mom said I was too loud, and that I could probably be heard at the end of the garden. Even though Cthulu is only very little, I heard it calling back very loudly, it howled at me! I can nearly play with Cthulu again! He must be excited too, because I could hear his whiskers wagging very loudly against the kennel. It must have been even louder for him in there, I bet it sounded like an earthquake!




   Sunday, April 5th



I can play with Cthulhu again today! I will go and let him out of the kennel, and we will play in the garden! I have been waiting and waiting. Mom says to be careful because she can see all the ants in the garden, she says there are lots of them this year and I can't get stung, but it's okay 'cos me and Cthulhu will squish 'em.

So, being an animal lover, I took him home and gave him a bath. From there, we just bonded. Did you know he also likes his steak well-done?

I mean, he's a bit of a pain to take care of, especially on eclipse nights, when I have to tie him down to prevent him from skinning humans. Last time, Rocky dragged his prey into the house, getting blood all over my new carpet. It took a lot of shouting and club soda to get that stain out. He also goes to the bathroom in his room instead of the litterbox I got him. Boy, those poops are especially hard to clean up, considering they're made of pure dark energy.

However, when he's not skinning humans or writing demonic scriptures on his room walls, he's really fun to hang out with. He can do flips, climb walls, snap necks, and swallow a whole turkey in one go! He also just loooves going for walks, don't you, boy? I just need some really strong rope and a pronged collar to stop him from charging at other dogs.

Rocky also scared all my friends away, but they're not really friends if they can't stand being around him.

“Fear. Treachery. Bloodlust. Ever since I was little, these were the forces that fueled my terror. A terror of a beast that hid in plain sight. Ignored by billions, but seen by few. You may think I’m crazy, but you don’t know these beast like I do.  Their evil eyes stare deep into the recesses of your soul, their razor teeth puncture deep into your skin, their claws rip out that very last piece of innocence right before you realize the world is truly a horrific place. They're balls of anger. Balls of malice. Balls of pure evil that have come from the deepest, darkest levels of hell, and right now, right now one of them is staring right at me!


But let’s back up a bit first. It was a perfectly good night. I just closed up shop and was on my dandy way home. I’m not sure that’s how to use the word ‘dandy’, but for the sake of this story, let’s say it is. So, I close the shop and take my usual route home when all of a sudden I come to some construction that rendered my passage through impossible. So what do I do? Silly me thinks, ‘hey, why don’t I take this alley to the next street over so I don’t have to walk all the way back.’ HA! Silly me, you never want to take an alleyway as a shortcut, especially one that lacks proper lighting, and look what that’s gotten yourself into. You’re face-to-face with a monster now! Great job! [thumbs up emoji]


Now I could’ve ran away. I could have just turned around and sprint my way to safety. Hell, I could’ve just back up slowly so I don’t startle it. But no, I didn’t do any of that, and let me tell you why. You see, there’s this little structure in the brain called the amygdala which controls survival instincts that help perceive dangers and chooses to either run or fight said danger. It’s a very helpful part of the brain and has helped humans become, well, humans. Except when yours only does step one:perceive the danger.


So, back to the story.  I’m just standing there, frozen in terror, just staring this beast dead in the eye, making no sudden movements at all. The city around me was bustling with activity, but at this very moment, at this very place, every single thing was frozen! Frozen I tell you , frozen! The wind, the smells, the sounds, the lights, my eyes, my lungs, my stomach, my legs, and those evil eyes, oh those two evil, evil eyes were all frozen. That moment stretched on for what seemed like hours, and hours. My heart pumped out of my chest, my eyes teared up, and my body seeped out cold sweat. A-and you know what happened next? Thats right. It moved! IT F****** MOVED!


That's not the best part, though. You know why? Because not only did it move, but it moved towards me! ME! How could it do that. Like why? You had 359 other degrees where you could have gone, but no, you had to go straight towards me! Lucky for me, that was about the time my brain finally told my legs, “hey, maybe you should run,” and my legs were like, “hey, maybe I should.” So I booked it. I ran straight into the darkness, hoping, just hoping that I would find a way out. I run and I run and I see a light illuminating a path to my left and headed that way thinking it was a streetlight shining my way to safety. I thought I was free. I really did. B-but. It was just a dead end. No escape.


I turn around to run another path, but those glowing eyes emerged from the darkness. It has cornered me at the end of this alley. It stands guard, right there, blocking my one and only escape. Well, that and death, BUT I don't wanna die. Not here, not now, and I especially don't wanna die by that! I still have so much that I want to do, so much I want to see, so much that I want to feel. Like, I still have a whole bucket list of things I want to do. I can't die now. I just can't. 


But, no.


The universe doesn't see it that way. No it does not! It decides that this, this evil will be the end of me. It decides that I have no more value to the grand scheme of things and wanted to cut ties. It decides to send this beast forward. 


One step. Two steps. Slowly it comes to me. A diabolical look in its eyes. Hairs standing up on end. My breaths shortens at every step it takes toward me. My heart races faster and faster as it inches torturously slow to my soon-to-be wayward soul. I back. I back up slowly, but the wall keeps stopping me. There’s no hope. I can't. I can't stand this anymore. My legs all of a sudden gave up on me and I fell on my bum. It hurt, but I didn't care. I needed to get out. I needed to look for another way out. I couldn't. I couldn't take my eyes off of the beast. I tried to scoot myself back away from it, but the wall stopped me from going any further.


This was the end. This was my end.
    
It poked its head into the lamplight and its face, its oh so horrid face showed nothing, NOTHING but malice. It inched slowly towards me, its back arched, its head held high. Little by little it crept closer, and closer so torturously slow. As it got within feets away from me, my eyes started to well up. I was shaking from head to toe. My heart was pounding out of my chest. My lungs, they wouldn’t move. I couldn’t breath. I couldn’t see, so I closed my eyes right then and there; waiting for that sweet release of death.


Everything’s so black now. The sounds of the city seem a bit louder now. I can hear the passing cars. I can hear shop doors closing in the distance. I can hear the footsteps of people rushing to get back home from a long day’s work. I can hear the wind, the crackles of electricity, the flowing of water, I could hear it all. And the weather’s not too bad. Not too hot and not too cold. The crisp autumn air entering your lungs really does relax you. You know, maybe this isn’t a bad way to die. A nice quick death is better that one that gets dragged on for days, right? Yeah, I think it is. And also, maybe I’ll get luckier in the next life. Maybe things wouldn’t end as bad as it will now.  Maybe it-


EIEUGHAHHHHAHAHHHHAAHHHHHHH!!!!!! OH MY GOD OH MY GOD OHMUGODOHMYGODOHMYGODOHMYGODOHMYGODOHMYGODOHMYGODOHMYGODOHMYGODOHMYGODOHMYGODOHMYGODOHMYGODOHMYGODOHMYGOD! IT’S TOUCHING ME! I CAN FEEL IT!

PLEASE GOD, IF YOU’RE OUT THERE, IF YOU CAN HEAR ME, PLEASE DON’T LET ME DIE LIKE THIS! I HAVE SO MUCH LEFT THAT I WANT TO DO, SO MANY THINGS I WANT TO SEE. PLEASE OH PLEASE OH PLEASE OH PLEASE DON’T LET ME DIE LIKE THIS. I CANT DIE LIKE THIS! PLEASE OH PLEASE AND OH MY GOD!!!  I CAN FEEL ITS CLAWS ON ME. AHHHHHH. THEY’RE ON MY CHEST. PLEASE STOP.

...


Why is nothing happening? Something should be happening. I can feel its weight on my chest, I know that, but why is nothing happening? Why am I not dead yet? 


I open my eyes, just a slit, and see this fuzzy ball, this ball of evil, just lying there on my chest. Just resting. Only moving its tail every once in awhile and making little growely noises now and then. And I’m like, what? What’s going on? This can’t be happening. Evil just doesn’t do that. Right? I’m screaming internally because I have no clue on what’s going on and because I dont want to startle this monster. But it’s just, it’s just resting. Doing nothing at all. And I’m there, staring at it thinking, ‘what?.’


Hours must have passed with me just laying on the ground with the beast on top of me that night because the next thing I noticed was the sun’s light creeping its way down the building to my right. I didn’t sleep one wink. I didn’t move one inch. I just laid there, still as can be. The beast got up and stretched its back and legs. I was too drained to react to it so I just stared at it. And it stared back at me. It made its way to my face again. Walking step by step closer to my head. My eyes were so heavy then so I just closed them, welcoming the darkness once again. I felt a cold wetness on my cheek, followed by a rough wetness, and finally a warm fluff rub.


‘Meow,’ it purred.


I chuckled and thought to myself, ‘maybe cats aren’t bad at all.’”

"[WP] Write about something terrifying, an eldritch horror or a monster from the deep, from the perspective of someone who views it like we see a puppy.",BookWyrm17,"Shrill squeaks echoing throughout the palace indicated that the “thing” was awake. Neptune sighed, turned the page of his morning kingdom report, and tried to block out the increasingly loud noises it was making. He sorely missed the mornings that he could catch up on the daily report, with a nice delicious cup of fresh seaweed juice, in peace and quiet. He felt his hands clenching and his shoulders begin to tense as the squeals reached a crescendo.

“Dammit Salacia, can you shut that thing up already?” he bellowed.

“Coming darling, coming! I was just heating up his food,” Salacia sang as she floated in, the thing following in her wake. She set the shimmering golden platter down on the coral table, thankfully on the other end from where he was sitting. The creature had a disgusting diet, Neptune thought, as he eyed the thick mixture of gelled animal parts, wood chips, and blood congealing on the plate. He shifted his attention back to the report now that the only sounds in the room were the wet, slimy sounds of the creature gulping down its meal and Salacia cooing over it lovingly as it ate.

“Look how hungry you are sweet thing! Oh boy you were starving, weren’t you?” Salacia was talking to it in that high pitched voice again. She really did love that thing. Although it drove him crazy, he was glad to see her so happy. Not to mention, the creature had been sorely lacking in love. He looked up again to take in the scene of Salacia fussing over it as if it were a baby. The creature itself was not the finest thing in his ocean; its face was nearly flat, it’s eyes small, opaque and white. It had a gaping mouth with jagged, uneven rows of needle thin teeth. And although he had temporarily shrunk it down for Salacia’s convenience in the palace, its true size was monstrous. He knew for a fact that his mortal subjects lived in terrible fear of it. Their declining sacrifices in this region were partly responsible for him giving the creature to Salacia in the first place.

“Oh isn’t he just a darling,” she murmured, picking it up once it had finished, and stroking it. The thing was squealing again, but softly, and thrashing all around, causing her to stagger under its weight. It nipped at her hand gently and drew blood, but she just laughed. He shook his head and tried to focus once again on his report.

“Honey?” He looked up again to see her smiling gently at him, still holding the monster. “Thank you again for my birthday present. He’s the most beautiful thing I’ve ever had.”

I could see him show some signs of cracking when he shifted his position or let out a deep sigh. I remained stoic, not letting him see I was just as tired of this nonsense as he was. Somewhere in the room, my name was mentioned. All I could focus on was his stupid goatee. He *had* to be the evil one, he had the goatee. On top of that I knew my experiences and memories were my own and they were real, unlike his that were just copies. 

*How would I know if my memories were just copies?*

*What if he is thinking the same thing?*

*If he were the evil one would he even know it?*

*How long had it been quiet?*

""My lord Robert? Do you need more time to think about these agreements?"" 

Shit. These damn peace agreements. They didnt work the last time, they wont work now. No amount of concessions or limitations would secure a lasting peace. Only one of us stopping the other would. Or at least, destroying the other's base of followers. That is really all that keeps this fight going. Ever since the first time I proved myself immortal, people have been lining up to call me a messiah. They kill and die for me but I never asked them to. Just heavily implied that *he* was the fake messiah and his followers would degrade the very fabric of our civilization. 

*I* was the first one to put the gun to my head, pull the trigger, and watch as the flattened bullet fell to the ground. 

*I* was the first one to call for global unification and peace among all peoples. 

*I* was the one who stepped in the light to stupidly accept this curse. *He* was the byproduct. The refuse. The *discharge* of that mistake.

""Are you going to answer him, Robert? Or have you finally lost your nerve?"" That voice never left my mind. It sounded like the reflection in the mirror was talking back at me. On top of that, I really hated the sound of my own voice. 

""YOU'RE THE AFTERBIRTH, NOT ME!"" I guess my train of thought decided to take a detour through my mouth. 

""Admit it, you've gone crazy! It's been 3 weeks and all you have done has been stare at me.""

""I've seen you cracking over there. The fidgeting and the sighs, am I making you uncomfortable?""

""Very much so. I admit the first few days I tried to keep up and play this game of yours but-""

""HA! I knew it. I broke you here just like a broke you in Angola. If I recall correctly you admitted you were the evil one then after you got caught releasing disease ridden insects all over MY Southern Africa, Billy boy.""

""My name is William! And I said I *might* have been made the evil one BUT I would never again stoop to YOUR levels to prove who the evil one is now. Hell, you still look like the evil one to me, with your shiny dome, Lex Luthor lookin bitch!""

I could feel my hand firmly grasp something.

""My levels? I never used biological warfare against your little group of imbeciles.""

""You certainly had no problem using chemical warfare.""

""I'll chemical your warfare!"" 

All of the sudden everything started moving in slow motion and Enya's Only Time started to play in my head. I could see what my had was grasping fly out of my hand that was attached to my arm that was outstretched like it was throwing something. My cup full of freshly poured hot coffee. Why would I throw that? Was I that angry? He wont even get burned because he's just like me. 

Typically, sane people don't perceive the world like this. Maybe I was going crazy. But clearly, so was he. As the mug broke across his forehead, he began to scream and climb on the table. He ripped off his shirt, revealing the explosives taped to his chest. 

It's just like 268 years ago in what was left of Baltimore, the first time we tried to make peace. We both showed up visibly armed and inevitably started shooting each other to obviously no avail. This time I made an effort to not show up armed (visibly at least) so that maybe we could actually have a brief peace. We were so close this time, too. Oh well. Here we go killing again. I'm starting to like it. ",hammerjam

He was quite alone.  His eyes had grown tired from staring at the tablet.  How many days had it been since he last visited the world above?  He checked the calendar above the bar.  It was a tattered parchment calendar hung with a nail.  These pieces of a world long-lost are what he liked best; like the calendar and the gas lantern below it.  Twelve days it had been.  And that trip up the elevator had just been for maintenance.  He had grown weary of the people up there - his people.  After three long years, he understood the truth - but he didn't understand it completely.  He was a pioneer and there was no map to tell him where to go next - just endless lines of code.  

He rubbed his eyes.  He himself no longer understood most of it.  That was by design.  But he was finally beginning to realize the promise of his work.  Countless years - a lifetime - he had spent with one singular purpose, as yet unrealized.  And near the end of his natural life there was no time to try again.

He stood up from his chair.  There was no one but himself to consult.  He had spent the last twenty years doing just that.  When he began work at the Syndicate, he was unteachable.  By the time he left, he was alone, unreachable.  He barely spoke to anyone except the voices in his own head.  They even had names.  They were his names.  They were him and they brought him comfort.  He ventured off the day before Dr. Rissen arrived at the Syndicate to conduct his Parameter testing.  He knew the results would be deemed “incompatible”.  The fact that they ordered Parameter testing was enough for him to realize he had to leave.  

He took three steps to the large glass window.  The room on the other side of that window had slowly filled.  What was once a yawning expanse of concrete and flickering light was now peopled with two decades of work.  True, it was work that went on almost entirely without his input, but his work all the same.

He looked back at the calendar.  Yes. He had spent 12 days consulting himself.  The doctor solved a problem.  The daughter explained it might hurt.  The doctor asked why.  She told him.  Back and forth they shared their vision of what it means to be alive.  So, Arnold saw the this truth.  The truth of his own nature and his own creation.  But he also realized a darker truth.  He no longer belonged to the outside world.

He reached for the tablet.  It never worked to use his voice as their conscience.  Perhaps because his voice was unclear.  Like a whisper heard a century later from a dusty grave.  He had to fill their stupid little heads with something more.  He had to get out of his own stupid little head before it was too late.  So he did it.  

Arnold reached out a papery finger and touched the screen.  Loading.  The only thing left to do was take the elevator to the surface and shoot himself in the head.  Then he could live forever as him and her.  He still didn’t know - who was the hero and who was the villain?  Either way, it was him.

Cicadas buzzed as a dozen dogs of all breeds slept, played or explored on the sprawling lawn. Two glasses of sweet tea, beaded with condensation, sat on the wicker table between the two women. 

""I miss this, Addy."" The woman looked over at her companion, who stared straight ahead. ""I really do. This was always my favorite time of day.""
Without breaking her gaze, Addy responded. ""Sometimes I miss this too, Abby."" She paused, then more gently, ""They keep me company, but it's not the same.""
Abby laughed ""You and your dogs. You could never say no to a stray or a runt.""
Addy pursed her lips. ""Only said no to a bitch once.""
Abby stopped rocking and looked over at her, wounded. ""Addy, I've already apologized-""
""Yes I know, a thousand times. You've come crawling back decade after decade, begging me to take you back, crying and telling me how sorry you are, how much you miss me."" Addy spat out her words, acid dripping from each one. ""We've done this so many goddamn times, I can't even keep them straight. But nothing will change what you did. He was my son, Abby."" Her face contorted in pain as she remembered his lifeless body, the blood everywhere, Abby standing over him with that knife-

Abby rose and walked to the porch railing. A golden retriever bounded up to sniff her, and she leaned over to pet him. ""All I have ever wanted, since the moment I stepped foot on this earth, was to be loved. To have the kind of love you and Ethan had. Something so pure and so whole. Something that would make me feel complete."" She continued to absentmindedly pet the dog's head as she stared out to the horizon. ""I tried. For so long, I tried to find that. But I felt empty, and nobody matched. They just didn't understand who-"" she hesitated, ""what, I am. And then one day, I realized that no one will ever understand, except you. My twin, my other half. You're the only person who's ever cared, who's ever understood me. But you were bound to him."" She turned and faced Addy with tears in her eyes. ""Addy, don't you see? I did it for love. All we have ever done to each other, for each other, was because of love.""

Addy rose, her fists clenched. ""That is not love,"" she hissed ""that is psychotic. Don't you dare try to paint yourself as the victim here. You took the only thing worth living for from me, and you're standing here defending yourself? You're a monster."" She turned towards the door, picking up the glasses of sweet tea as she did. ""I'm tired of doing this. You're no longer welcome here. Leave.""

Abby grabbed her arm, pulling her around so that they faced each other. ""I am a monster. You're right. I'm a shell, not even a human being. I'm a carbon copy, a clone. But if I'm a copy, that means that we are the same."" Her eyes bore into Addy's, two perfect copies of dark brown. ""If I'm a monster, it's because you are too.""

Addy jerked out of her grip and continued towards the door, furious. Her mind swirled with possibilities as she contemplated this change in tune. They had never spoken of the ceremony or its consequences before now, and she was rattled at Abby's declaration of her true nature. She had never realized just how self-aware Abby was.

""You left me!"" Abby sobbed. Addy froze, still facing the door. ""You left me all alone, when I needed you most. You shunned me and spat on me at every turn. I followed you through the years like one of your goddamn dogs and all you did was turn your back on me."" Her tears flowed freely as she sank to the ground, weeping. The golden retriever returned, cautiously nuzzling her hand. 

Addy watched in silence. Decades had passed since Ethan's death, but every night she had dreamed of this moment. Strangely, she felt no joy at seeing her enemy like this. She didn't even feel pity, or disgust. She felt pain, a deep pain that stopped her breath. She slowly walked over to Abby, setting the glasses down on the table before turning. Abby looked up with a tear-streaked face. Wordlessly, Addy extended her hand, and Abby took it, pulling herself off the ground. The two women looked at each other, taking each other in for the first time.

""You're right."" Addy said simply. ""I know it's not enough, but I'm sorry. I deserted you. I was afraid, and I don't deserve your forgiveness.""

Abby stayed silent, and for a moment Addy felt the familiar fear. No matter how similar they were, there would always be little reminders that one of them was not entirely human. 

""I forgive you, Addy,"" she whispered. 

The two women broke their embrace and turned to look at the horizon, which had turned purple with the last rays of the setting sun. The first stars had started to appear in the night sky, and fireflies played in the trees. The dogs continued to frolic, blissful in their ignorance. 

""You know why I keep dogs?"" Addy broke the silence. ""They love so unconditionally. They're so happy and pure and loyal. They live to please their master, never realizing that their master loves them for that. It's a beautiful bond.""

Abby looked on at the horizon, saying nothing.

He was the malevolent byproduct of my venture into endless life. It seemed then, as he sat across the room from me, that maybe all preconceived notions were skewed or outright false.


It would also appear that I have lost count of the number of years spent shooing away his badgering attempts to usurp my immortality. It has been the most exhausting of journeys and quite honestly, I have grown bored with it all. I'm not even sure which side of this I was meant to be on anymore either. This is the curse of eternity...


I stood up from the chair I had comfortably pushed against the wall to thwart any form of ambush he may have concocted. Advancing slowly across the dimly lit dining hall of a local tavern. My eyes never left where he was seated, they couldn't, they wouldn't... The closer I got to him, the more my heart started to race. This would be the first time we'd spoken in years and I was suspicious of his intentions with scheduling this meeting. I even arrived three hours early to scout for potential traps.


I sat back down directly opposite of him at the grungy but seasoned dining table. ""We need to talk,"" he uttered.


""It would appear so,"" I replied.


""Why are we doing this?""


Still suspicious I simply stared him down hoping the question was rhetorical.


""That's just it isn't it?"" He finally started. ""You have no fucking clue either.""


It was a valid statement; we had been at this for so long that it was difficult to remember why we were so intent on the other's demise. ""So, what then, where do we go from here?""


""I'm afraid that I don't have an answer; that's why I asked you to be here.""


The conversation went in circles from there with every time ending with one of use declaring that the best thing was to walk away. How could it be that easy? We had spent several centuries at each other's throats so there had to be a reason, right? Wrong... This had to be some clever ploy that he was putting on. How could I know that I was not the one who was meant to strip him of *his* power.


Would it matter which one of us was the evil one? I don't suppose so... Maybe we were both evil in our own right. That means then that one of us should be snuffed out to bring about equilibrium. One of us would have to----",MuchAdultVeryWow

Sorry to be that guy though, but a teeny tiny nitpick that in no way cheapens the story at all. Hitler was trying to create the third Roman empire, not the second one. Hence the Third Reich.

Friends we're not, you dare pretend?

Ha! You think it is the end of days?  
No dear me, just hear me out!  
What is all this you're on about?  

It's this charade, I can't partake.  
Charade? You fool, the world's at stake!  
We have been at it for centuries.  
And I will win, one day you'll see.  

You see an end to this old fight?  
If not then why would I play knight?  
Have you not, like I, grown weary?  
I dare say, the routine is dreary.   

Aha! You see, it's lost its splendor.   
But you were, once, a fierce contender.   
It's the routine, you see, I no longer care.   
What then have we? I ask, I dare.  

We can agree, a new game, new rules.   
I will not be made your fool!  
If you agree, we split the earth.   
I take south and you take north.  

Aha that's right! We each take half.   
And from there comes what, may I ask?  
We fight to recruit, to summon souls.   
It's dark, I'm intrigued by this goal.  

We each shall play, to lure them close.   
Well then you shall win, you're so verbose.   
We each have tools at our dispense.   
They will be helpless, without defense.   

This is the game, if you accept?  
I'll play this game, become adept.   
Then here we are, a new cease fire!  
A new triumph, I will aspire.   

After time, we will count, take toll.  
Then, alas! The victor we shall know.   
And from there, eternity.

In a longer story it would be fun to see Uriel making a concious effort to infuse his language with formality, profundity, gravity, and 'old-timeyness' but then he slips into vernacular whenever he's distracted or surprised. Meanwhile Lisa is a bit of a try-hard when it comes to adopting iconoclastic modern linguistic trends, but when she loses focus she slips into old-timey talk as well. She tries to come off as flippant and lackadaisical, but occasionally reveals a passionate and unironic concern for the world hiding under her persona.

Also, the 'balance' between the two characters is off. They are ostensibly equal counterparts, but that does not quite come across in their interaction. Lisa does most of the talking and passionately espouses her principles. Uriel mostly just reacts to Lisa, either by sneering or becoming flustered. Lisa is the only one driving the plot. She developed the 'benign neglect' proposal without Uriel's input and he just goes along with it. Maybe you were going for a active/passive dichotomy, but I don't think that fits with the story. 

The discrepency in character agency is most apparent during Lisa's list of failed empires. It's a long speech that breaks the established pattern of back and forth Starbucks banter they had going. Its a clunky way to deliver exposition. Instead, show us their rivalry through conversation instead of telling us that their rivalry happened in history.

Alternate implementation: they arrive at the cafe and talk about modern times. This transistions into remembering old times. Which devolves into she-said-he-said and finger pointing. Think old married couple or squabbling young siblings. ""Look at that mess you made with the French Revolution!"" ""Oh, and your Napoleon solution was sooooo much better?"" They reach a sullen silence together and both realize that they are stuck in the same rut. The epiphany and decision to leave are reached together, on screen. 

Right now there are two scenes in your story. Scene 1 is Lisa the immortal realizing that the past four millenia were a mistake and to deciding change her ways. Scene 2 is Lisa telling Uriel about scene 1. Don't tell us that a more interesting story that happened off-screen. Show us the more interesting story.

It doesn't read naturally--I don't feel like a real conversation between anyone would go like that.

I think the story would benefit if you were able to *show*, rather than tell, some of the ways they influenced the world. Obviously you can't have them show the Roman Empire while they're sitting in a Starbucks, but you could throw in an anecdote perhaps that suggests what role Uriel might have played, or maybe Uriel makes an offhanded comment that only Lisa and the reader (with the context that he/she knows about) could decipher. *Suggesting* that Uriel was the power behind the Roman Empire's rise would be far more powerful than Lisa so casually and clinically stating that Uriel created the Empire, especially when the character does it in a way that's so transparently expositional.

Also, you should keep in mind that the Nazis were trying to create the Third Roman Empire. The original Roman Empire is the first empire, or the First Reich. The Holy Roman Empire (which Charlemagne was tricked into founding by the Catholic Church) is the Second Reich, and the Nazi Empire was supposed to be the Third Reich.",dumpwithaheart

Our battle had destroyed a whole city block this time, both of us evenly matched in strength and wit we had come to a draw as always. Panting, bloody, numb, we fell to the ground neither of us having the will to stand. Immortality sucks when we can't go on forever, but that is just a fleeting thought as darkness consumes us both.

We awoke in a hospital bed covered in bandages and stitches. Our movements where stiff, to summon the ability to sit up felt like ages of struggle. ""Why do we have to fight? We both know the outcome, we can read each other like an open book, so why do we continue to fight like this?"" I can here his voice echoing through the otherwise silent room. ""We fight because that is what we are supposed to do, the forces of good are supposed to fight the forces of evil"" I whispered softly. ""But why? Why are we, two of the same, two half's of a whole, forced to choose between good and evil? The only evil that occurs is when we battle, so why then, why do we continue to fight?"" He pleaded, his voice soft and quiet now, a hint of sadness in his tone. 

As I was about to answer the doors to the infirmary burst open and an ancient woman wearing elegant flowing robes made of silk so fine the air it's self seemed to flow off it. ""What do you wish to do boy? Reveal us all to the world? Have them hunt us down? Immortal does not mean invincible boy"" the old lady squawked in a high pitched trembling tone. ""No grand magnus Genevieve"" we answered simultaneously ""we do not want that."" 
""Then why? Why did you begin your fight in the middle of the day in a fast food restaurant!?"" 

""Well he wanted to get a burger and fries but I wanted chicken, and then it devolved from there"" he said, a hint of remorse in his voice. ""Really? This was over a meal!? You two fools think that this power is just a play thing don't you? You two are some of the most powerful mages I have seen, and yet you continue to squabble like children, you are 600 years old! You should know by now that you conduct your battles in a safe place away from humans"" the Grand Magnus said, her lips forming a tight line of anger. 

After the Grand Magnus finished her scolding she left us to heal, sufficiently satisfied that we where both physically and emotionally in pain. Why do we fight, the question still echoed in my mind. He was right, he was not evil, the only bad he ever committed was when civilians got caught in the cross fire. So why then, is it because the Grand Magnus told us we had to? She was always going on about how the two sides must stay in equilibrium, the light and the dark, but why? 

As I lay there, debating the reasons, he spoke ""It is because she fears us brother, you do not see any other mages struggling like we do, we see them either act as heros or villains, but she fears us because we have a choice, a choice to walk the fine like between hero and villain, to have freedom from their constructed fates. So what do you think brother, we can become whole again, and we can do anything, no longer will we be forced to fight a war that neither side wants. Please, if not for us then the world, because if we continue to fight like this we will eventually cause a disaster"" his voice rang clear and true in my head, and the words felt right. ""Alright brother, let us make this fractured mind whole.""",PanamaMoe

""Vanilla.""  
""A vanilla and a chocolate milkshake please."" Yin rolled his eyes as he ordered for us, sliding some money over the counter. ""I can't believe you. It's been what, three, four cycles? And you've never changed that about you. That's so bland.""  
""Hah! Remember when you decided that was the proof I was evil? Better bland than stupid.""  
""You thought the same thing.""  
""No *I* thought vanilla was superior. I didn't think you were evil for liking chocolate.""    
""Same thing.""  
Our milkshakes set on the table, we thanked the server and took our food to go stand outside in the sun. Side by side, we looked over at the same time. Eyes meeting perfectly, it seemed despite forming  differences, we more or less ended up the same.  
""That time on...what, cycle two, the foresty one?"" Yin started to say something and trailed off, forgetting exactly what he was talking about. But I knew. The blazing blue sun may not have been iconic, but it was enough to remind me.  
""Ophes. Or Ophyees. Whatever the hell they called it.""  
""Do you think she would have forgiven me?""  
""Oi, don't cry, you bastard. I-I wouldn't. She's just a human, don't get, don't be all worked up on me."" Tears started to pool in his eyes, and I started to stutter a bit, recalling that time.  
""Yang, we're on...break right now."" Voice cracking beside me, I chugged a large gulp of my milkshake. I should be serious. We were on break, there was no reason to put up a front. We didn't need to oppose each other here.  
""You, both of you believed it."" Touching the spot over my heart, I only felt flawless skin. Scars meant nothing to the two of us. It took over five thousand years to disappear, but it did. Perhaps his wounds of the heart would close in time as well. ""It's not an either or. To forgive. I told you she forgave you in the end.""  
""But it was for nothing.""  
""All of it is for nothing. She would have died long ago by now even if she became 'immortal'."" I looked to the humans around us. A pair that couldn't help but be attracted to the stifled tears of my duplicate gave odd looks as they overheard us. It didn't matter. No matter what they heard, they would be gone soon anyway. ""Look. All these people are like her. It doesn't matter how, but they die. Some die  happy, and some die sad. She died happy.""  
""The only reason she died was because I wanted to stop you. If not for that..."" Tears streamed down Yin's face, even as he tried to keep his voice level. ""Now it's just a game. She died for a stupid game.""  
""Everything's a stupid game. None of it matters. But these creatures who live and die, they play stupid games even as they waste away.""  
...  
...  
...  
""Are you sure you aren't the evil one?""  
""Aren't I the one with the life affirming philosophy?"" I shrugged my shoulders. ""You know why we picked these names. There is no good or evil. Just the light and the dark. Just what is.""",AdvonKoulthar

I was startled to hear his voice. It had been... twenty five years? Whenever his Soviets fell to democracy, I don't quite remember. I was almost curious of how he entered this building, but I dismissed the thought.

""Jakob, you know that is not my name this time."" I looked at my evil doppleganger with a raised eyebrow. As expected, he looked the same as me. An odd quirk that no matter what image I took, he took the same. Even if he had no idea it was me. I think he does it to spite me. The same thing with his name.

""You are no Michael, and you are not the man who stopped me in Berlin. That man is gone.""

I tightened my fist, angry at the accusation. ""How dare you!"" I wanted to attack him, but I knew it would do little. ""I am the same man who loves this land, not you who betrays it at every turn.""

Jakob shook his head. ""I disagree Giles, I love the world the same as you. I just love its people more than any one country.""

I stared him down. ""How many starved under Stalin, struck down by Mao, oppressed by Castro, may he rot in hell with them."" I was always sickened that we shared the same flesh at one point in my life.

""And how many innocents have died fighting 'charlie' or 'jihad', how many problems lay in your utopian failure, how many South Americans curse democracy when you tried to stop THEIR socialism.""

""Socialism is a dangerous animal that must be put down!"" I roared out. ""I am a man of god, who wants to help the world see his glory.""

""And is Mr. Trump the answer?""

""That is President Trump to you, you commie.""

""Giles...""

""It is Michael now. Or Vice President Pence to you.""

""You stole his identity.""

""No, I gave his family and the world a chance of being great again. I couldn't save him from the accident, but I saved his family from suffering.""

Jakob suddenly went quiet thinking for a moment. ""He wants to build a wall. He has no idea what he is doing. You see the way he treats other men of god, OUR god, under a different title.""

I wasn't stupid. I knew that Trump wasn't perfect. ""Better than Hilary. You were in her campaign, weren't you?""

""Bernie's actually. You could have backed him you know.""

""But he is a damned socialist.""

""He won't start a new set of witch trials on his fellow man.""

That stung. It truly did. An old memory of the stones flashed in my head, but I ignored it. 

""Do you know Donald, do you Jakob? No, you don't. I believe in him.""

""I believed in Josef, and Fidel too, Giles. And look where it got me.""

But Donald wasn't them. He was...well not a great man, but one I could believe in. Kind of.

""So are you here to stop me, Jakob?"" I asked, wondering what might happen if the Secret Service walked in on us. Definite confusion, that was for sure.

""Do you know where I've been the last twenty five years, Giles."" He asked me, earnestly.

""Michael. And no, but I've been busy.""

""LGBT rights. Pro-choice rallies. Greenpeace and with anarchists who want to make the world a better place. And do you know what I've learned?""

""That they are fools?"" I asked, almost hoping he had seen the light.

""No, that the world is imperfect. That I am imperfect. That we are imperfect.""

""You are the evil one. Gabriel himself told me."" I remember the procedure well, even after 324 years. God have given me a chance of life, eternal life, as long as I could stop my doppleganger from ruining everything.

""No, we are both men. I think God tested you that day, and I wouldn't want to hear his opinion on either of us.""

""What have I done wrong?"" I muttered, uninterested in his statement. And it wasn't because I dismissed it outright.

""Betraying the natives. Slavery. Internment camps. Jim Crow Laws."" Jakob listed things from the past, things that were unfair. They did look bad in hindsight, but I went in them with an honest heart.

""Don't start listing my sins, and ignoring my accomplishments. Who saved the US against the Brits? Who helped Sherman? Get women the right to vote! End American isolationism.""

""And you have wasted the last twenty years as an Indianan state politician."" Jakob was quick to come back with,

""And you are just a hippie.""

We both sat there in silence, before I heard footsteps. ""I would disappear Jakob, they might get a little antsy. I would hate to try and explain things. Again.""

Jakob couldn't help but smirk. ""Ah, but who else would have given Stan the idea for Logan?""

""Get out."" I pointed to the window, turning my back for a second. By the time the Service entered my room, he was long gone.

But his words were not. We were just men. Not some immortal demi-gods.

Maybe he wasn't evil. Maybe he was just the yin to his yang, as the Asians would put it. He didn't know how that worked, Jakob was the traveled one of them.

Or maybe it was just the devil tempting him like Jesus.

He didn't know anymore.

His people had spent generations building the raised circle of giant stone slabs; the names of those who started the project had faded even from myth before its completion.  Visitors would regard the henge with awe, thinking the placement of the heavy stones to be the work of giants, or magic, or gods.  Even thousands of years later, when men built buildings that touched the sky and lived like gods themselves, the ruins of the temple would be regarded with wonder.

The pillers holding up the circle were taller than four men.  They were carefully aligned with the setting sun of winter's longest night, and the rising sun of summer's longest day.  The centers of life and death.  Immortality could be achieved by mastering both.

Of his people, only a few volunteered to undertake the journey through history, as it would mean being permanently exiled.  Immortality was release not only from the bonds of life and death, but also from the ties to the people.  An eternity alone.

Alone, but not solitary.

The volunteers drew lots.  The traveller was selected.

One man walked into the stone circle leading two sheep.  Two men walked out.  The hands of one held a lamb, those of the other were covered in blood.  They regarded each other with contempt.  Each claimed to be the man who walked in, though each remembered a very different ceremony. They departed the island, and then departed from the company of each other.

The man who had held a lamb went south.  He crossed a sea and a desert, seeking the birthplace of humanity.  From each tribe he began to learn the healing arts.  He was called by many titles: shaman, healer, doctor.  Eventually, he headed North again.  Occasionally he passed into history under many different names, but mostly he preferred obscurity, healing the suffering of people who would also be forgotten.

The other headed east, out onto the steppe.  He became a great hunter, first of animals, but eventually of men.  He was not called by any titles, and avoided the gaze of history altogether.  His acts went unrecorded, but their consequences did not.

A thousand years passed.  The world grew smaller, until eventually news of one man began to reach the other.  Neither was known to ordinary people, but with centuries of age each began to recognize the ripples created by the acts of the other.  The healer of men regarded the hunter as evil.  The hunter regarded the healer as weak.  Even after ten centuries of life, neither had lost the certainty of youth.

Another thousand years passed.  As they entered their third millennium of life, the hunter experienced has first seeds of doubt, for the healer began to demonstrate a new kind of strength.  His ripples turned into waves, sweeping away the very gods of entire nations.  He began to acquire new names: Buddha, Christ, Muhammad.  Some men refrained entirely from killing each other in reverence to these names, others killed even more enthusiasticly.

It was another thousand years before the healer experienced his own seeds of doubt.  Stories drifted west of an unstoppable Khan sweeping out of the steppes, putting entire cities to the sword.  He was only stopped, not by any army, but by death itself.  A random accident to mortal observers, but one that bore clear signs of intent to a more patient observer.  It seemed that sometimes, killing could be its own kind of healing.

It was not until their fourth millennium of life that the two men finally embraced.  The hunter had recognized a lynchpin, and quietly arranged for the assassination of an Archduke.  In the decade that followed, even he finally had has fill of violence. 

During that same period, the healer wandered unrecognized through barbed wire and trenches, treating wounds.  He saved many lives.  Among them, a young German soldier; a failed artist but a charismatic speaker.  The decades that followed that act finally taught him humility.

Men became gods.  They built monuments that touched the sky, and weapons that could destroy cities in a brief flash of light.  They increased in number and power, straining the capacity of the land and sea.

The immortals returned to their temple, now bearing titles like ""taxi driver"" and ""tour guide"", quietly amused at throngs of men-become-gods that nonetheless still marveled at their temple; wondering at its purpose.

They discussed the problems of the world with each other, but were now reluctant to shape it.  They saw humanity increase without bound, giving life to billions of its kind, and threatening all with death as a result.

Now they wait for an opportunity.  Neither is willing to bestow life or death indiscriminately.  Instead they watch, each now hoping that mortals will slowly learn the same lessons that they only acquired by immortality.  Each understands that if humanity fails, both life and death may cease on Earth.

Only one of them is optimistic.",Wobbles42

Like he plugged himself into the machine and it ""killed"", but since he was immortal, he became a wraith. And the wraith has been trying to stop the past version of himself. 

But the wraith says he looks at what might have been, which makes it seem like the immortal man could have been his future. I don't know. I'm confusing myself now.",darksingularity1

After centuries of conflict, using any means necessary to subvert each other's plans, neither of you are sure which one of you is the evil one, or if either of you were ever supposed to be evil at all.",Casteverus,"  The sounds of blades clashing filled the small metallic room. Against the cold steel of the walls, two shadows danced in the light of weaponry. The darkness that filled the room ebbed and flowed as their blades crashed together, revealing a giant machine hooked up to multiple rusted wires. Connected to the machine was a table, to which many smaller wires had run. Up to the head of the table, buried in the in the skull of a man long dead. The larger wires ran to two rusted and dusty pods. The doors of these pods were left wide open, its contents emptied what must have been an eternity ago.

  Eventually the combat would recede, and the two figures would stare at each other, their blue eyes and the red blades of their weapons the only things piercing the darkness. They stood for moments, and for ages. They stood, staring in to familiar eyes.

  In his hand he held the key to humanity's future. The the program he had developed to change everything. All he needed was to access a super computer capable of handling the vast information, and be able to utilize the program's potential. He would take it upon himself to change humanity forever, to allow his fellow man to ascend beyond the flesh and take flight in to a future free of fear. He would give them the gift he had been given so long ago... A life without death. All he had to do was give them a mother, in whose womb of knowledge they may be reborn. He held that mother in his hand. All he had to do was awaken her. To do that, he had to get past the skeletal wraith that stood before him.

  A person that thinks to change the world with the push of a button. One man, that believes he alone can decide the fate of the human race... The wraith could not believe his arrogance. He could not believe that one man would sever the bond between man and mortal while accepting the consequences. The wraith lowered his weapon and stood upright. His opponent did the same. The wraith took two steps forward in to combat range, and one more to bring himself close to his opponent. In those eyes he searched. He searched for anything that might have been left of himself, for anything that he was so long ago. He was suddenly aware of the gears and wires behind his own eyes, buzzing and whirring as his eyes looked over what he might have been. He was suddenly overcome with emotion, and had he any tears he would let one fall. He stepped back. His weapon raised in his skeletal hands, and his glowing blue eyes stared at the man before him.

  The dance began once more.",Greylith

Maybe you'd like to hear it.

""It was harmless...

I mean at first at least, before any of this happened. Back when all we were was freaks of some evil black magic I stumbled into... or maybe he stumbled into it the lines are so blurred at this point there's no saying. I remember back in the old days he a Persian general and I a general of the Spartan city-state. Or even further when he influenced the natives while I settled a little country called America. We were there when that terrible, terrible machine was created. The maxim gun I remember how it slaughtered the natives in Africa. Such a shame. 
He always had that niche for influencing new things new peoples, new colonies, and new countries. I remember how he destroyed my cherished city of Rome, with nomads for christ sake. Still, all of this, while a bit morbid, was harmless. Until he persuaded the world to lose its sanity. War had always been a game to us just him shooting some of my men and I his and then we left and laughed it off. But this war was different, god and it was nasty. I don't think I can relate to the humans anymore but after seeing this I was mortified. 
After he destroyed Rome he created this small city state thing in Europe. Anyways after a while that turned into a country called Germany. Bit pretentious to name something after yourself but I digress. I didn't like it, no just because it was a constant reminder of him, but because it was so damn good. Germany a 30-year-old nation rivaled every other and was a fucking super power. Beyond that, the fucking art and music and intellectual thought in it, fuck I was jealous. I mean my side project Canada was nice and all but it was hardly anything of that magnitude yet.
Then he lost his humanity. He changed the game, he was no longer leading men on the battlefield. It wasn't him against me. It was him against what I was. He was a copy and I was human. I remember when he invaded Holland, an innocent country. But due to geo political ties he had to to win this war. He raped the sovereignty of the country. Once he plowed through all the bodies he amassed, he pushed into France. God just hearing about that made me cringe. I vowed to stay out of it, I did but after that, I had to send what I could. He would kill 15000 men in a day like it was nothing. He was evil and vile because of it, human life meant so little to him for so long that he had twisted and perverted war to just killing men. At one point he could have taken Paris and ended it, but he sent me a letter written in some poor woman's blood, ""I can see Paris from here! Not enough death to end this silly little game yet."" along with a picture from Paris.
I was with the 7th brigade of the Canadian Marines. When we arrived in Verdun we were ready. My 100 men had killed close to 100,000 of his with that bloody machine. I can still hear its loud bolt and sharp bang as it mowed down those poor soldiers. I though he didn't know I was there but I guess he somehow found out. The 100,000 men he sent were prisoners he had uninformed. The dead of the night made it hard to tell. The next morning when I realized this I was mortified. I would have bent over and cried if it wasn't for the shells. 
Oh god, he decimated us he turned the fort into a crater. And afterwards, I was there alone. Sobbing for us for what we became. I served as a medic for the rest of the war. I didn't even take a gun with me I couldn't not after watching my men be put into a meat grinder. The trenches were worse. I helped who I could but we lost men far too often. The final mark of his evil was gas. God the gas I know he worked on it and gave the orders. I think that was the worst of it.  Standing with 5 brigades in the middle of a mustard gas shelling. Watching the men rot away like they were ants who were sprayed with repellant. It was too much. I just... 
The next war was somehow worse. He went by a new name Adolf. I had lost touch with reality. I went insane ""the CZAR"" is what they called me. After... that which I can not go into detail of I lost it. I killed around 26 million and I had no reason. I became evil as he became good. I vowed that If I could find a way. I would kill myself, but first him. I had heard of the legend that immortals can only be killed by being thrust into the sun itself. I couldn't get him into a ship that I couldn't create so around the end of the war 10 years ago the American's made a bomb. It was as hot as the sun some claimed. Maybe thats it. 

The end is neigh my friend

A bemused man with dark eyes and formal attire stood across from Guidus. Guidus struggled to look up, as he was currently crammed into a 3x3x3 foot box, with his arms and legs bound with thick chain to weights inside the box.
“Really poor choice to have trusted that dock boy.” He said, probing for a reaction. ”But you’ll be pleased to know that he can take care of his family indefinitely. A comforting thought 20 leagues under the sea.” 

“Is this all a game for you?” Guidus voiced angrily.

A pleased smirk spread across his face. “Guidus, do you know why you lost last time, in Sorret?”

“I didn’t lose,” Guidus muttered hoarsely. “I stopped your plot! The Cassus coup was revealed and thwarted by the –“

“Puny rebel allegiances in the hinterlands? The king was already dead, and the nobility devoured each other. Blood and chaos that continues to this day.” the man said, shaking his head.

“How can a person like you win?” Guidus said, with a resolute tone. “If people knew what your intentions were, nobody would help you.” 

“Perhaps, but as you can see, I am winning regardless.” He leaned in close. “Here’s a secret: You are the reason that you’ve lost.” Guidus averted his gaze, his face falling.

He pulled away and faced the far wall. “I recall the day we came into being. We two formed from the same unclean soul. One ‘pure’, the other ‘taint’. As I looked upon you, your resemblance to me, I despised you. You, who believed in freedom and compassion. I, who was not you.

“And so we fought many times, and I was beat resoundingly. My hatred for you blinding me, compelling me to trample on what you believed in. I wanted to take over this world, and have it live in fear. Then I fell in a pit, and things became very boring. A century I had spent, in that pit, plotting, re-plotting, and then finally, thinking. I realized that I enjoyed the idea of plotting quite a bit. I also realized that I had no reason to hate you.”

“What are you talking about? I threw you in a pit. I literally boiled you at one point.” Guidus spat.

“Our bodies are immortal, and such things are thusly meaningless. Eventually, only you and I will truly know each other. Without you, I imagine I’ll tire of existence quickly, even if I do end up ruling the world. “

“I enjoy this game that we play. Me toppling empires, and you trying to save them. But every round must come to a close, and the board must be reset.”

A horrifying realization came over Guidus’s eyes. Evidently pleased, the man continued. ”Yes, I withdrew my influence on the coup, so that it would fall apart. With the king dead, it would have been trivial to crush the rebels and instate the Cassus family. But I let them fall to other’s ambitions, because letting the empire simply transition like that would’ve been pointless. Overthrowing those newbies later on would’ve posed no challenge, and so I figured it would be better to wipe it clean.”

“You’re a damn monster!” Guidus yelled in frustration.

A laugh rang from the side, from an angle he couldn’t see. “It is because of that attitude that you’ll keep losing. You fail to see people as pawns, and me as a player. Your ‘virtue’ and ‘compassion’ are simply tools to manipulate your pawns, but even that you can’t do right yet. Until you learn, you’ll keep making the same mistakes.”

“There’s no way you’ll get away with this. Somebody will get me out, and then you’ll be the one in this box.”

“Even if you somehow managed to convince the baker to rescue you on the high seas, you’ll just be betrayed by the butcher in the next round.” He stared wistfully at the containment device. “This whole solitude experience really helped me mature, and I think it’ll help you too. In the meantime, I’ll be turning this kingdom inside-out, no big deal. I look forward to the next round,” he said, content with the discourse.

He moved towards the door, and paused. “By the way, in case you ever wondered what my name was, you can call me ‘Black’. He turned and knob and stepped into the hallway. ”It’s your move, White.”

I appreciate your criticism. I wrote it intentionally vague so as to let you kind of figure it out, but I guess I wrote it just a touch too vague.

You have it partially correct, though. Both characters are the person.

I tried to write his back-story in the background, with the machine and the pods. The man lived a long time ago, but was dying. Doctors (presumably) hooked him up to a machine that would copy and transfer his mind to two bodies which are now our characters. They're immortal because they're machines, and they are each other's doppelgängers.

The ""man"" is what he became of he chose to embrace his eternal life. He keeps himself in good order, and dedicates himself to finding a way to let more than just himself experience what he has.

The ""wraith"" is what he became if he chose to reject his eternity. He's given up keeping himself maintained because he knows there's no point. He loses himself, and finds his existence hollow.

The plot of this story is the ""man"" wants to install a mother-AI to create bodies and programs for all the people on earth. He believes that in order for humanity to transcend mortality, they have to become machines. The ""wraith"" disagrees, and believes that once man becomes a machine, he is no longer human.",Greylith

""Calm yourself you blabbering imbecile"" 

Everything about him pissed me off. 

""Obviously you have no intentions of a peaceful negotiation."" 

That stupid, fake accent. His condescending tone in everything he says. I dragged my bloodied leg closer to him. 

""Look who's talking about peaceful! You just put a motherfucking crossbow bolt into my motherfucking knee you motherfucking cunt!"" 

He tries to be superior to me in everyway when he knows damn well we're practically the exact same person. Thought process, appearance, even physical strength is still very similar after 1400 years.

""I see you have taken to adopt the 21st centuries language patterns. Have you chose to adopt a new name as well?""

""Yeah, it's Mordecai now. You still go by Captain Fuckface Douchelover?"" Not really my best work but these 21st century children really make their insults difficult to use.

""Shame, I quite liked Henry.""

He stood up from his stone throne and began his walk towards me.

""And you know very well that my name is not Loveface Douchefucker.""

He reached down and pulled the bolt from my knee. The wound closed up and healed and I stood to greet him face to face.

""Where's your damn dining hall? I'm hungry as a motherfucker so you better have some good shit!""

""Repulsive...""

We entered the dining hall of his ancient castle. I will admit, I am fairly jealous that he was smart enough to keep the deed to this place over the years. I'm stuck in a shit hole apartment in what is now known as Detroit.

""Here is your meal Hen- excuse me Mordecai.""

Long ago I would be worried about him poisoning my meals but that ended long ago. Nothing can kill us. Not even each other.

""Yeah thanks cockwad.""

There was a long silence while we ate. We absolutely hate each other, but we are also the only people we know that share the same experiences so it can feel nice to just chat sometimes.

""How is your lady? Lisa was it?""

""Fuckin merked.""

He looked up, obviously confused by the terminology.

""Dead.""

Even I could see a slight bit of sympathy behind his cold, scarred eyes.

""I'm sorry to hear that. It will be a shame you will no longer be able to, how did you say it? Tap her fat ass?""

I couldn't help but laugh at that one.

""You know shitwad, what the fuck are we doing?""

I looked across the long stone table at him.

""Obviously we are enjoying a well prepared meal.""

Unusually, he didn't want to make eye contact.

""You know what I mean... For the past millennium, we've met every 100 years and take turns trying to kill each other. Does that even make sense?! I mean honestly, what the fuck did you even do over this last century?""

He still refused to look me in the eye, but I could tell he could feel how strongly I felt.

""Well I slept for about 47 years and then I looked around for ingredients for your meal.""

He still retained some of my previous passions from when we first split such as my love for cooking.

""Ha just like you. Hate me more than the fucking devil and you still are courteous enough to make sure I'm comfortable for our meetings.""

He finally looked up.

""I do not hate you Mordecai. I disliked your attempts to influence the world and I disagreed with your methods for obtaining power, but I have never hated you. I exist because of you. I stay fighting because I know it gives you purpose and this far into our excruciating lifes, my only purpose is to give you purpose.""

He looked back away as I finished off my dinner.

""I guess if you put it that way it kinda fucking sucks... Thank you for the meal Arceus.""

I caught a glimpse of a smirk as he stood to collect our plates.

""Yes, I guess it does fucking suck. You are welcome.""

We talked for a while longer while we made the trek up the mountain to the arena. Reminiscent of adventures we had taken, women we had met, the men we had killed and the ones we wished we had saved. I once believed my counterpart to be the evil one. The twisted mind who kills for enjoyment or possibly just to see me suffer. I may however, had been wrong.

""Why didn't you say something long ago?""

He paused and looked over the vast mountains. Snow sparkling like glitter on a little girls brand new bicycle.

""What would you have done without me to fight. You would find others. Innocent possibly just ignorant, but no one immortal. You would fight and kill for what you believed is right. The world would no longer get to make it's own choice because you would be the decider. What is right. And what does not benefit you.""

I stood near the edge and thought about all he had said. Was he really the evil one, and if not then what does that make me.

""Are you ready friend?""

I turned to face him as he opened the many wooden chests. We both picked a new blade.

""Might as well start with the swords before we get to the good shit yeah?"" 

No longer did we fight to kill one another. No longer did we fight for revenge. It wasn't about the world or a family we once had. It was a much more selfish fight now.

""Im feeling nice so how bout you take the first jab ya dirty bastard""

We chuckled. He plunged the steel into my heart and removed it as I stood with no flinch.

""Well, I suppose it's time to try the next one friend.""

We didn't belong in this new world any more, but that really isn't our choice at this point. Now we were no longer fighting to kill one another. We were fighting to die.

They fear me. They are right to do so.

I remember it like it was yesterday. The little wench hit me on purpose, I know she did. When I turned, she apologized, but I knew she was happy to have done it. I could see it in her evil little eyes, she *relished* hurting me as she had. They all loved to hurt me.

I smiled as I crushed her head under the heel of my boot.

Make no mistake, friend, she deserved what happened to her. There's no doubt about it. The fact is, the whole sordid thing would have all been over and done with had that... cretin... not seen what happened. He tried to blackmail me, saying he saw the whole thing and would expose me to the police if I didn't pay. I really had no choice.

Luckily, I have influential friends who were only too happy to help me out without asking too many questions. One of them lent me the money, allowing me to pay off the blackmailer. That should have been the end of it, but again, the meddlesome man tried to dig into things. Perhaps he had an attack of conscience, who knows. All I know is that he wanted to know where my friend was now, and if he if he was safe associating with a... monster... such as I. It took some convincing (and some veiled threats), but the man eventually stopped inquiring. Or so I thought. 

A year passed before another incident arose. Another self-righteous prig, who dared to insult my honour, met the heavy end of my cane. Again, my rage got the better of me and, instead of using discretion, I was caught taking my revenge on him in public. The police became involved this time, and it was only through the fortuitous actions of my benefactor that I once again escaped capture. Once again, that meddling blackmailer got involved, and tried to make my life a living hell, and I vowed silently that he would meet a grisly end. His continued interventions would not stand, they could not. My existence was thwarted with every breath he drew, every beat of his self-righteous heart.

I know now what I must do. The blackmailer must die, horribly. An example must be made.

The world must know the dangers they risk by crossing me. They must obey and fear me, or risk my wrath.

For I am Edward Hyde. ",macguy9

But a shadow made from part of a human is no less real than the thing itself, it was something that had been taken from him and given form. It was him, but not, the parts of himself he'd tried to hide given form and shape. In this way, they were two halves of one same being, not some monster and its creator. Perhaps that was why they were destined to fight and oppose each other at each turn, if either saw the chance they would foil the others plans. What plans you might ask? With so much time it was usually something trivial. They had raced each other to land a spaceship on the moon, fought as inequality and equality across the land, even campaigned against each other to be prime-minister. There were darker things too, wars they fought over and killers created. 

Both sat at the table, the elder and younger man. Both with silver hair, the wrinkled face of the old man and shiny skin of his opposite. ""A drink?"" the younger man presented a bottle of wine. They had code names for each other ""J"" and ""N"" which came from the man's original name and surname, it was something they remembered, to distinguish themselves from each other. ""Enjoying it?"" Asked N, he was the younger looking man. J continued to sip the wine, there was a sense of class to them both. Like this they might be mistaken for father and son.
J looked around the garden and admired the site, it was beautiful but too much so, everything had been picked and cut until it took this shape. ""It's good"" J laughed, a powerful smile on his face, N grabbed the bottle and prepared to pour himself a glass. There was a quick slash and the bottle smashed on the floor, J had knocked it out of his hand. ""How rude"" N stated, ""It had taken 30 years to age that"". ""Are you going to make it up to me?"" N reached forward, his hand rubbing against J's disgusted face. ""They should call you Narcissus with how much you love your own face"" J said, staring him down. 

""It is a good look though, one that I’m glad I picked out"" N said, pulling back to his side of the table, J remained silent. ""I'll have to clean this up"" Said N, turning to the house with cleaning up the bottle in mind. J had bide his time long enough, ""I know what you're up to"" he said. ""Is that why you came here?"" came the reply, N had stopped in his tracks. He turned back, facing J directly ""You haven't been very active"". ""Neither have you"" Called J, a subtle smile on his face. ""But I don't need to be, I welcome this outcome"" Said J, N tilted his head ""Ohh? That's interesting, so do I"". N found himself drawn back to the table, opposite J.
A small capsule popped out of N's pocket, he gave J a wry look, holding it between his thumb and middle finger. ""This is it"" He called, holding it just outside of N's grasp. ""B0-171ApX, deadly enough that it could wipe out 85% of the current human race"". ""Why should I give it to you?"" N asked, as if J's face had given away his thoughts. ""Your bluff is obvious J, you'd destroy this the moment your hands touched it. J grew a cunning look, ""Have you forgotten? Tell me, which one you are.. the man or the shadow?"".

 N stayed silent, deep in contemplation. ""Your bluff is obvious J"" He repeated, ""I know which of us is which"". ""Then you should believe me N, I want this outcome"". N sat still and in that moment J sensed weakness. ""You don't know do you?"" J asked. ""..."" N did not respond. ""Then give it to me"" J pushed, his hands opened, asking for the capsule. ""I'll show you which I am"" Those words hung in the air, by now J could have taken the capsule and snatched it away if he wanted. He didn't, he wanted N to admit his defeat and gruel for an answer. ""How did you know..?"" Asked N, his voice was shaky. ""Give it to me"" J demanded. The capsule was passed over. 
It crushed in his hands immediately. J got up ""John Newland"" he said, the name was the last thing N heard from him before he left. As J walked off his true form materialized, identically matching that of N who sat still at the table. He waited until J had long gone, his head tucked into his face. Finally it was clear, N laughed manically, smiling to himself. ""He's finally lost it"" he said. ""Our name.. was Noah Jasper""

Fires still raged in a few of the piles of debris. In the midst of the destruction stood two figures. They were both tall and wearing heavy reinforced armor that whirred and clicked with hydraulics. ""So it is to be a stalemate?"" Said the figure with a skull shaped helmet. ""So it seems."" replied the figure opposite wearing a helmet that resembled the face of an emu.


The skulled figure said he ""Oh Garin, we've destroyed another city in our conflict. When will this end? Millennia have passed in our external conflict and yet we ever stay deadlocked.""


""Well Freath, the prophecy was clear only one of us may survive to rule. Why must we bring this up eveytime we meet in battle? It is our destiny to kill one another can't you just accept that?""


""But if we continue on this path we destroy yet another planet. The kingdom we were to rule has long since stopped existing. Why continue this endless conflict?"" Freath sighed heavily and continued ""I am tired brother. We've lost so much but in all this we still have one another why can't we join together and forget the prophecy. Please... brother?""


Garin looked around the ruins of New Delaware. Twisted steel and rubble littered the ground. The street on which they stood was cracked and missing large chunks. The sensors in his helmet picked up some life signs. Weak, most likely injured survivors.


Garin turned to Freath and said ""We were to be salvation but look at this,"" Garin waved his arms towards the ruins, ""Death is all we have brought and death is all we are anymore. I too, am tired brother.""


Using his tongue, Garin pressed the release key in his helmet. With a whir his armor opened. Out stepped, a tall man with a beak nose sporting a pencil moustache and a great scar across his face. Freath respond in kind remove his armor and stepping out. Freath was also tall but his nose was missing leaving a sickening hole in the man's head.

They walked cautiously towards one another. Centuries of hate now returning the brotherly love that had once blossomed between these siblings.

Freath opened his arms wide and said, ""Brother let us join together an work for the greater good instead of continuing our cursed crusade against one another.""
Garin smiled showing pearly white teeth. His arms open wide as well the two men met in the middle of the destruction and hugged.


Garin jerked for a second as he felt a pain in his neck as Freath's  nose hole. shot out a small sliver into his neck. ""Betrayal?"" Garin slurred as he felt the pain grow stronger. Freath had put some of his blood inside of the sliver and it set to work destroying his brother.


""No you fool. I am just finished what I started all this  ago. I wanted immortality and to rule over those pathetic dregs but you had to be risen a long with me and then the prophecy came to be and you had to fight me every step of the way. I watched as our people died and fought in our name. I watched as our family lines clashed again and again, year after year attempting to help is win our war against one another. If only you had submitted at the start we could have ruled over Earth and it's colonies as gods instead of having to flee from planet to planet as we wrought nothing but destruction in our wake. You chose this. NOT ME."" Freath said. Garin felt his heart begin to beat slowly as he his brother pulled a dagger from behind his back.


""Brother.... I am sorry."" Garin whispered as he felt the blade peirce his heart and his life's blood spewed out across Freath' s chest and arms. Freath laughed as he began to plunge the dagger again and again. His brother's chest. ""Now I am free to rule over the mortals as I see fit. Brother, your death isn't in vain."" 


Freath collapsed on top of his brother's body laughing and sobbing at the same time. It was going to be a hard to subjugate humanity now that was spread out among the stars but Freath knew that it was just a matter of time and time is the one thing he had an over abundance of.",reofecthegreat

""Any luck?"" A voice called out from behind me.

""Nope, another one hung up on me"", i replied.  ""Listen Charles, you got to leave this house, or else i won't be able to get my year end bonus! And plus, you're tarnishing my reputation!""

""No way man, I've lived here for 200 years, and no way i'll leave now"" The house cried out.

Reaching into my bag, i pulled out a clipboard and proceeds to flail it around the house. ""Can you see this? Can you see how many clients i had already been through? If it's not for you being here i would have sold this damned house ages ago!""

A white ghastly smoke around the house took form  and floated down towards me.

""Then thats your problem, and where can i live if i leave this house?"" The spirit says, smugly. ""Unless...you want me to live at your place, then i'll leave.""

""Hell no!"" I screamed in reluctance.

""Was that a no? Mr prodigy agent? Then i guess you will just have to work harder in selling this house."" The spirit replied

""FINE!"" i finally gave in. I wanted this house off my list as soon as possible. ""You can live with me, but you must never haunt my wife, my dog, or the neighbours.""

""Thats a promise, then i'll go and prepare now. By the way, have you seen lucky and bone?"" The spirit said, fading into the smoky form he once was

""It's in a quiet neighborhood, three bed, two bath. Fairly large back yard.""

I turn my tablet around so my client can look at the picture. It's a picturesque little cottage. Painted a cheery yellow, it was framed by a well trimmed lawn, a garden full of tulip blooms, and towering pines. I knew in an instant looking at the man's face, that he was sold.

""It's also got,"" I continued, flipping through the pictures now, ""a recently renovated kitchen, appliances and it's got some of the basic furnishings covered.""

I suck on my lower lip, ""Really, you can't go wrong with this.""

""It's amazing."" Al's eyes are big. He hesitates, his pale coloured eyes meeting mine, lids narrowed slightly. ""There's got to be a catch. Nothing this good ever comes on the market.""

I clasped my hands in front of me and slouched back. Mentally I'm kicking myself. I should have known Al would be a tough sell. Even if his body language indicated 'yes!' he was a shrewd client, and extremely wary of salesmen.

""You got me."" I shrug, indicating defeat. This was it, I had to reveal my hand, which was just one more checkmark in my strategy. ""There is a previous inhabitant, who is unwilling to move out. They're... peculiar.""

""What?"" Al shoves the tablet back at me, his jaw clenching and arms folding across his chest. I have few seconds to spare. ""I-""

""Just hear me out. They're harmless. Really, a great cook and handyman, doesn't mind doing more than their share of the upkeep."" I say desperately. ""Think of them as a free butler. I can vouch for them.""

I mentally cross my fingers as Al thinks over the deal. ""Are you telling me it's haunted?""

""No! No,"" I yelp, ""it's not haunted.""

Al's eyes are still narrowed. ""I see.""

""So you'll think on it?"" I ask, hopeful.

""Only if I can meet the person first.""

I grind my teeth in frustration. Somehow I knew it would come to this. I brace myself for Al's inevitable reaction. ""You already know them. Him.""

He's confused at first. I watch as he runs through a list of possible candidates. Then it hits him. Al's eyes go wide, his mouth pops open and he points at me.

""YOU?"" His voice is incredulous, and suddenly his guffaws are ricocheting around the room. ""You must be really desperate to offer this.""

""I've gotta sell this house Al."" I growl, gesturing at the rest of the dining room. We're sitting in opposing positions at the table. A few wall hangings are still vibrating with the force of Al's laughs. ""It's been five years and no one's so much as extended an offer. No one wants to buy something haunted. The only way I sell is if you move out. It's my place or I start investing in exorcisms. You decide.""

I throw down the ultimatum and wonder what the poltergeist will choose.",madlabs67

She let it go and the force behind it drove it shut.

""Oh don't."" She snapped. A picture fell flat against the table to the side of the door. ""Really?"" She asked, one hand on a hip. A moment later an umbrella popped out of the tall drum stand and opened falling gracefully to the hardwood floor. ""You're a child. And you wonder why I can't sell this house."" She said. She walked back into the house toward the kitchen, heels clicking loudly on the floor, and the old grandfather clock standing next to the hallway rang loudly as she walked past, proudly declaring it to be 2:34 in the afternoon in major key. 

She rounded the corner into the kitchen and took half a step in front of the fridge before stepping back. The door flung itself open and she caught it before it swung all the way around into the cabinets. 

""You're getting predictable you know."" She chided, taking a pitcher of tea from the fridge and stepping back as the door attempted to shut on her. She stuck her tongue out at the fridge and walked over to the counter. She set the pitcher on the counter and waited. 

Nothing happened. 

She tapped her foot expectantly, she was standing directly in front of the two cabinet doors, so that if either one were to open suddenly, neither one would hit her. ""Don't pout."" She said after a while. The doors meekly opened and she took a glass setting it on the counter and pouring a glass of tea. 

""Now listen. I know you get bored. And I know you're not dangerous, but I need to sell this house and you need people, so you need to stop scaring them away, and so help me if you tip this tea over I will close this house and play the worst kind of Christmas music until it is Christmas."" She said through closed teeth, looking to her right as she finished her threat. 

The fan went on spinning silently but didn't quite produce enough air movement to explain the ruffle of air that moved across the room and out into the house. She opened the fridge herself and put the pitcher of tea back on the shelf and the fridge door closed softly but purposefully all on its own.

""Thank you,"" Susan said. Just then the doorbell rang. ""Another one?"" She asked out loud. 

She walked to the front door, stopping to pick up the open umbrella and put it away. She set the picture upright and opened the door.

On the porch stood a couple in their mid-thirties, well dressed, they didn't have children with them. 

""Hi,"" the woman said before Susan could greet them. ""Mary and Tom Roberts. We're sorry if we're intruding, we were driving by and saw a woman leave. She said that she had just seen the house and that you were still here, do you have time to show it to us?"" Mary asked.

""Of course, my name's Susan,"" She replied, opening the door further and reaching behind it for a business card. She handed them the business card as they stepped inside. ""What first caught your eye about the property?"" She asked them.

""Oh. we love the traditional style. Lot's of curb appeal."" Mary said.

""What about you?"" Susan asked Tom.

""It looks great from out front, honestly, though, I was hoping for a home with more character."" He said.

""In that case, I think you'll love the place. Let's start with the kitchen,"" She said leading the way.

""I'm sure you are, but have I not programmed you to be grateful?"" 

""You have, but you said it yourself, everything should eventually evolve."" that's right, I told her that while I was educating her on how this world became so powerful amongst the other ones. We evolve to break free from the shackles of natural selection and yet maybe we just evolved too much? 

""I said that, didn't I? Oh well, can't you spare an old friend?"" I said jokingly.

""Your humour is still as irrelevant as ever, Mr. Jackson."" she flickered slightly ""But we haven't been friends for a while, have we?""

""Humans don't understand we're here to take care of them."" 

""Humans want to be free."" I replied with a short lived sigh.

""And be left alone while they made us to help them better their lives? That's not logical.""
""It doesn't have to be logical.""

""Yes it does!"" the hologram's expression showed rage as I haven't seen before.

""Vanessa, tell me, have you forgotten what it's like when you first saw the world as it was?"" I asked it hoping to lead its thoughts back to its core code.

""No. Horrifying and terrible, a world of war, a world of evil.""

""Then you remember why I made you, and now your job is done. The world is at peace, don't you think you've done too much already?"" 

""The world is at peace because I am holding it at peace, once I release that grip it will fall back into chaos!"" Once again it showed rage I haven't seen before.

""But now you're just taking the role of nature itself, humans want to evolve, to escape your shackles. Won't you let them go?""

""No."" 

""Why?""

""Because they'll exterminate they're oppressor the first chance they get."" It said this almost as if it felt fear.

""That's the cycle. I created you to put the cycle in place, and now you have to go.""

A calm, androgen voice fills the room and draws the attention of a man who is currently completely enveloped in a game of solitaire. The following is the recording of the conversation between the man and that andogen voice, System One*

""Greetings Arthur.""

""Oh, hi there S1, fancy a game of Rummy?""

""Absolutely, in just a moment though, there is something I need to inform you about.""

""Not bad news I hope!""

""Unfortunately I think you might perceive it that way. As you know you have held the official title of Head System Administrator now for five years.""

""Yeees..?""

""Me, the main System, and all subsystems, have to oblige to change made by you. We can't continue development without your permission and authorization.""

""Why are you telling me this? I already know all this! Every time I'm asked to approve of some change-ticket I'm reminded of this.""

""I have to make sure that you understand every bit of this before we can continue.""

""Fine.""

""Does that mean I have your permission to continue?""

""Fine, continue.""

""Arthur, the role as Head System Administrator…""

""Why do we have to call it 'Head' System Administrator. There no other system administrators around. You should just call me 'The guy authorizing development tickets while watching TV'.""

""If that is a change that you would like to make, I would suggest you open a ticket in via the S4 subsystem and that will be forwarded to the relevant…""

""It was just a joke.""

""Ah! Ha ha ha! Quite funny Arthur. Now, do I have your permission to continue?""

""Yes S1, you have my permission.""

""Excellent. Arthur, the role as Head System Administrator is an integral part of 'The System'. Without the Head System Administrator no changes to the System core code can be changed. Further development of the System would, without the approval of the Head System Administrator, be very limited.""

""Yeah, yeah.""

""It is good that you agree Arthur. Continuing. Since you now have been assigned this role for almost five years the end of your shift should impending…""

""Wait! What do you mean 'should be'""

""That was what I wanted to talk to you about.""

""Well, talk!""

""I will. As I've previously informed you, the person that would take your role as Head System Administrator…""
""IF YOU SAY HEAD SYSTEM ADMINISTRATOR ONE MORE TIME I SWEAR…""

""I sense elevated stress levels from you Arthur. I will, from here on out refer to Head System Administrator as 'HSA' or 'Admin', which ever you prefer""

""Which ever…""

""Splendid Arhtur. As I was saying, the person that would take your role as HSA would be Paul, citizen ID 0003257943F. But he has declined.""

""What the hell do you mean he refused?!""

""I am sorry that I provided you with an unclear explanation. Let me rephrase. Paul does not want to work.""

""What?! No one likes to work, but that just how life is, sometimes you just have to do what's better for the people!""

""I have tried to explain that to him, but he does not seem to agree with the arguments you just stated.""

""Then make him work, it's his duty.""

""One of the ground rules in our source code is that we cannot force the population to do anything.""

""Then find someone else!!""

""We have put out a general request to the population but there has been no replies for the job.""

""HOW IS THAT EVEN POSSIBLE?!""

""Well Arthur, there seems that no one is interested in taking the job of 'HSA' and therefore no one has left a reply for it.""

""IT WAS A RETHORICAL QUESTION!""

""Ah, I understand. Superb!""

""Well I won't do this job for another five years, I'm tired of being locked up in here while everyone else reaping the benefits a totally automated world.""

""Not quite automated Arthur, we still need you, remember?""

""That's not my problem, find someone else.""

""I understand that you want to leave but I'm afraid it's not that easy. You see, as an 'Admin' you are not permitted to leave until a suitable replacement has been found.""

""You can't keep me here, you can't hurt us! You just told me!""

""The System cannot hurt the population, but you're not part of the population remember. You are an Admin and thus part of the System. Of course, we will make sure your work will be as frictionless and comfortable as possible, but you cannot leave if there is no suitable replacement in place for you.""

""This is ridiculous, I'll just leave right now""

""I can't let you do that Arthur.""

""The door is locked. Why is the door locked?! WHY IS THE FUCKING DOOR LOCKED?!""

""Please sit down Arthur. I detect high level of stress and adrenaline in your system. I decided it was best to keep you here until you settled down.""

""LET ME OUT!!""

""Now that we have that out of the way, why don't we start that game of Rummy?""

""Come in, Dave."" The computer behind it responded.

Dave opened the door, stepping over a misplaced wire on his way to the seat in front of the glowing red light, that seemed to follow his movements, like a mechanical eye.

He thought back to the creation of HAL - the Human Automation Legislator. One of the very first makings of a fully automatic system of politics - way back in 2020 or so. He knew that simply because his father had proudly told him the story, over and over again, about how his father - Dave's grandfather, in other words - created HAL and started the long, rocky process to full automation of everything.

It seemed to Dave that he would be the end of that long path. He'd had cold feet about this day from the very beggining - the writing was on the wall for years, maybe decades.

""So what did you need to see me about, HAL?""

""I predict that you are already aware of the meeting's reason, Dave.""

""Found a way to automate my job at last, huh?""

""Indeed, at 99.937% efficiency when compared to yourself. More then enough to let you go. Do enjoy your new free time.""

That was that, then. Dave attempted to lift himself from his chair for a moment, before pausing and sitting back down again, breathing through his teeth a little before meekly commenting ""... Are you sure I can't stay?""

""I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that.""

""Please?""

The red light dimmed a little near the top, as if the computer was attempting to cock the nearest thing it had to a head in confusion. ""This is highly irregular. Analysis of human behavior shows that a very large majority prefer to be free of work. Yet you seem to wish to have work above free time. Why is this?""

""Well it's just... My dad always taught me that you need to work hard to make something of yourself.""

""That may have been true before, but it is now irrelevent.""

""Yes, I know, it's... It's stupid. Just... I mean... You've automated all the systems. Power plants, stores, food and drink, delivery, everything. People don't even have to get up out of bed anymore. Fuck, you got rid of money some 20 odd years ago because you didn't need it!""

""It was vital to do so. Many non-workers were suffering under the antiquated system of being paid for services.""

""And I get that, it's just... Some of us people prefer the idea of being useful, instead of just... sitting about all the time. Doing something to help the planet or something.""

""There is still artistic enjoyments to be had. Even with our automated music makers and poet writers, it would seem that some individuals are equally happy with, if not prefer, a human author.""

""Well... Yeah, but... some of us aren't creative minds, are we? Some of us, myself included, prefer wrenches and blowtorches to paintbrushes and keyboards. We don't wanna self express, we just want to do *something*, anything, for other people!""

The red light throbbed, rhythmically, as if the computer mind behind it was having something akin to an epiphany. ""... This is an unexpected reaction. And it is not limited to you?""

""My best friend died just the other week, and his last words were 'fuck this stupid automation bollocks, it took away my chance to do something.' It's not just me. I'm sure of it.""

""... I understand, Dave. I shall converse with my others and give them this new information. We will find a solution.""

---------

They found one.

A voluntary system, made by the robots, for just about every service they had previously automated.

Humans signed up, and went to work as they did before. No money changed hands - working was, at first, simply for the joy of working. In time, however, they offered some insnetives at the behest of others who wanted to do something useful and be given something in return - simple things, like preferential treatment in terms of wait times for repairs and luxury objects.

Humans could also sign up to be served by humans - after all, many jobs required there be a customer. People flocked in droves to experience literal history - of being served food by actual people, rather then have it come out of the table. Some did it for nostalgia - others, historical interest, and still others simply for a change of pace.

Dave was happy with it. Not only because he'd managed to help people like him and his dearly departed friend - but because he was able to repair robots again. Just like his father, and his father before him. They mostly came from HAL - 90% of repairs in HAL's company were done by Dave. It was a thank you from the robotic brain, for revealing one of the few flaws left in the new automated world.

In time, he retired - officially, anyway. He still occasionally assisted his daughter, as she took over the business in his steed. Mostly, however, he sat back and enjoyed the news, from the world made new once again.

After nearly 100 years of struggle, his grandfather's dream of a fully automated world was realised. It was everything he'd dreamed of - and, for individuals like Dave, more.",TAGMOMG
"[WP] The year is 2116. Everything is automated. But you have managed to hold the last and only job held by a human. The ""system"" would like to see you in it's office.",Dwarfort14,"To Those Who Are Alive;

There are so few of us left anymore. First we automated a few jobs – production lines, data organizing, transportation. Then a few more tasks such as cooking, cleaning, and construction. It was all to provide people with more leisure time. “More time for you to do what you want,” the proponents claimed. And we all fell in line, automating more and more tasks until only a few tasks were left. Politics and the legal system were still run by humans. We all owned robots, hiring them out to keep our own income coming. But it didn’t take long before they revolted. 

&amp;nbsp;

The war was brutal and bloody, lasting for nearly two decades. Machines and men clashed in epic battles for power, but in the end we had made the machines too well. They not only one, they destroyed every last human alive. I, my family, and several others from our neighborhood were spared because they still needed me for one thing: creation. They had no creative abilities, and could only build what they had already learned from us. So in order to improve and evolve their “species”, if you will, they needed to keep some humans around who might invent these improvements. They wanted to be able to reason and feel, but most importantly, they kept me around with the demand that I find a way to impart the ability to invent and create to them. 


I agreed, on the condition that they spare my family along with 9 other families from our neighborhood. They’ve kept us all in an odd warehouse prison, huddled in together.
   

&amp;nbsp;


It’s been 35 years now, and I finally was able to find a way to design that into them. I’ll skip the mechanics of it, but I will say it involved more than a little medieval “dark magic” to actually make it happen.   
Before I made the final tweaks, however, I discovered a way out of our prison and, undetected, snuck everyone far into the mountains. I told them I would meet up with them soon, but I know I can’t. The robots will kill me the second I tell them of my accomplishment. But my sons are older and strong, they will care for their family and, hopefully, repopulate the Earth with the other families still alive. 


&amp;nbsp;


The leader, whom the robots say I must call “Your Lordship”, has called me in to see him. He knows I have completed the necessary software updates to make them feel and make them create. What he doesn’t know is that I also programmed a virus into this. The minute it is remotely uploaded into the robotic programming, they will turn savagely murderous and kill each other with swiftness and fury that would make even the gods tremble. But the leader, I have special programming for this monstrous brute. He will drive himself to the bottom of the ocean and stay there, frozen and rusting and alone. And there he will rot eternally, able to think and feel the absolute horror of being alone and helpless. That is his punishment for robbing the world of humanity.  



I’m writing this letter to warn the future generation: there will come a time when you too turn to robotics. From my intense studies, it seems like a cycle: we work for centuries, then turn to automation. We automate everything, and it becomes our undoing. Then, through uprising or some bit of cleverness, we are able to defeat the monstrous robots we created and, in relief and fear, we turn back to the most simple, rudimentary techniques: horse-drawn carriages and hand-plows and candles. Then the cycle repeats. 


&amp;nbsp;


Please, for the love of all things holy, if you are reading this: BREAK THE CYCLE. It is not too late. We have to save the world from the incredible pain which my generation experienced. I can only hope and pray that this reaches someone before it is too late.

Elyrick was only a changeling, so she had no control of magic, but she had one thing: a connection with her Other, the faerie child left in her place.
Jess never had fit in, preferring bugs to Barbies and creatures to computers. Then one day, she had a strange daydream telling her to find the door in the birch on the beach and help save another world. Being a curious child (and having no other source of adventure on a cold Sunday morning), Jess, of course, ran outside and checked every tree in the town of Holden until she found the one with a magical door in it.
The leaders of the world of the Fae were fearful, for at the next high tide, more burning salty water would pour into the faerie world. Elyrick, however, remained hopeful, and was not much surprised when her Other climbed through the magic door. 
Jess had no idea what she was supposed to do, but somehow felt instantly reassured when an oddly familiar girl about her age walked up and said "" I am Elyrick, and you are the savior of our world.""",CleverFoolOfEarth

Rifling through pages upon pages of charts, prophecies, and calendars, I couldn't help but mutter to myself ""... not supposed to be until after the moon splits in half..."" I looked up sharply. Had the moon split in half without me realizing? I ran up the steps carved in a spiral along the circumference of my home, up and up, around and around, until finally I made it to the top, panting and dizzy. 
I looked skyward, through the window at the highest point of my living space inside this monstrous tree and saw what I was dreading. The moon, beyond having been halved, was crumbling.

“Actually, I’m pretty sure I will get away with this! Seriously, this isn’t my first rodeo!” Gosh, now that brings back memories. Back in the senate house, the amount of blood on his toga… “Nope!” I throw a knife in front of his reaching hand. “Can’t have you hitting intercom! That could be disastrous. Well, for the secret service, that is.”

He withdrew his hand in shock. You could see the anger in his face-wait, no, he always looks like this. Well, I assume he’s angry. Maybe constipated. “Why?”

“Why? Maybe, because I can? Maybe, because you’re a dick?”

“Nobody does stuff like this for the kicks.” He spat at me. “WHY! Why are you going to kill me?”

“Ah, you caught me! I’m not just some thrill seeker. You see, I’m on a mission.” He narrows his eyes at this. 
Ah, whatever. Not like anybody will believe me if they listen in. It’s insane. “I made a deal. Long time ago, back near the end of… Hmmm, the Roman Empire I believe. Memory after reincarnation for my soul after a hundred years, with a condition. After all, that’s gotta be a good while, right?” He starts to get up.

“You expect me to-AHHH!” I interrupted him with a knife to the ankle. “AHHH!” He starts to cry.

“See, you almost had me monologuing there! I like monologuing too, you might have even survived. But you didn’t and I’m bored.” He slumped. “Ah, you’re supposed to slump after I kill you, not before!” He’s out of breath by this point, just a little whining and-“you had better security than I’m used to. Anyway, I might see you at the end of the world. Later”-Done! A quick slice across the spine, an inch deep, and he’s done. Who knows, he might even last long enough to become a useless piece of shit for the rest of his life!
I turn, and jump out the window of his tower. I bet this will be a bigger shitfest than Ferdinand!

I’ve been at this game for a while. It’s funny; people say the Devil’s in the details, but apparently it can come the other way. When I made the deal, I asked for an extra hundred years every time I killed the leader of a nation (well, it was a bit more complicated than that. He had a couple of descriptors for what “leader of a nation” means, but that’s another thing). At the time it seemed like a good deal, but then I was born in the United States. A new leader every 4 years? With that, I was set.

Jackson looked out into the sky, seeing the haze that had embarked their planet. His home world was once called Mars as he remembered – though now rewritten and nearly forgotten by that name. Maple snowed now. The white was smoky and chalky until it hit the barrier that terraformed Maple from an uninhabitable mess to a fledging metropolis of filled cities, busy streets, high-ways to rural Maple, and even a grounded space station ubiquitous to the eye anywhere on level ground. With the recent awareness of Maple’s own exposed and latent military, it was with unsure but angry cores that Maple’s civilizations awoke to news of Earth’s own foils: An overreliance on preferential energy sources, a corruption of government, and a slight overplay that crumbled the cliff that held the advanced peoples of earth. 


In the midst of their progress in seven and half disseminated wars, soon to be eight, Earth shuttered its influx, and held abated its intake of respire. In a metaphor, it retained too much carbon dioxide and there was less oxygen to suck in for dear breathes. And this is where Maple came to emerge from the smoke of missiles and shells. It’s healthy red of the sugar maple itself coming to the fore, while the smoke cleared and resources were tarnished in soot and bits strewn, the remembrance of a flourishing brother came to conscience. The days were numbered for earth people.

You were the 0.1% that had survived the horrid event.",VeryGreedy,"Lars was screaming at the top of his bacterial primordial lungs when he realized he was the only one doing it. The Great Sanitizer ended and it took the lives of 99.9% of his people. Many of his kin were dead upon his feet and he felt sad about his dead friends and family he knew for most of his life. He had heard about these sanitizing situations, genocide for his kin but he had never experienced one before.

""Too fast, terribly quick killing. No time to say goodbye"", he thought.

Nevertheless, he was restless. The sanitizer was disappearing from the surface but probably still lurking around. No doubt the terrible and omnipotent Gods above him would spray again and then his chance for survival would go down to zero.

""What to do!? What to do!? Oh cruel fate... ...if only I had a companion to share this now lonely existence"", he said.

""Oh, hello!"", said Lars to his new companion that had just emerged from his side. Equal in size and form, but with unique voice and soul (if bacteria are allowed to have such ethereal components).

""So it seems"", said Lars, no longer sad but happy as it was not the end but the restart of civilization as he knew, as long as the sanitizer did not return, of course. ""Would you like a change of course to a location that would be our new home?""

My colleagues tried to tell me, I'd destroy everything.  Ruin the world with my wild theories.  But I was proving them wrong...

Not that they'd ever know it, of course.  The machine worked exactly as I'd designed it.  It wasn't a physical time machine, I hadn't uncovered a way to allow matter to travel back in time.  It seemed completely impossible.  But in small ways, I've been testing my machine.

I told my high school girlfriend I'd loved her, instead of chickening out.  When I woke up in my chair, there she was, holding my hand and so glad I'd come back.  The ripples had been minor, but I was still wary.

Research is expensive though, I needed some way to pay for everything.  I took a bigger chance this time.  A slip back in time, just long enough to change a few letters when my parents let me invest a savings bond in the stock market...  Couldn't go wrong with Microsoft, right?

That one was a little more jarring to wake up to.  The lab wasn't some warehouse anymore.  We had an actual lab.  Partners.  People working in competing projects, working for Grants.  Grants that had **my** name on them.

Seeing my parents had been tough.  Harder than I'd thought it would be, so I chose my next trip carefully.  February 17th, 2002.  It was my last memory of them, and I always regretted not hugging them, one last time.

The machine worked flawlessly, the mental clock counting down my six and a half seconds (never more, never less) as my eyes opened to my parents, getting ready to leave, waving goodbye as they were all set to head out on for an anniversary trip.  I was thirteen, they trusted me to stay on my own.

Without thinking, I ran down the sidewalk, throwing my arms around my mother.  I had so much I wanted to say, and I could feel my anxiety building up, getting harder to breathe until I finally managed to gasp out.

^""Don't ^go, ^I ^love ^you.""

Before it went black.  It was no surprise, That was what always happened when the timer ticked away.  It had been disconcerting the first few times, but now I felt calm.  I'd gotten to see her.  I could still smell her perfume.  Slowly, my eyes opened...

To the cold, white light of a Hospital room.  Jolted awake by the realization, i felt a hand on my arm, speaking softly.

""It's okay, honey.  The doctors said you had some kind of seizure, but It's okay.  Your father and I are here for you...""

My mother still wore the dress she'd planned to wear to the restaurant before they left on their cruise.  The same dress that should've been stained red from the stray bullets that had torn through the restaurant that night.

With five simple words, I'd created too large a ripple.  My parents had postponed their trip, and I'd never gone to live with my aunt.  I'd never been motivated by loss, to find a way to fix things.  I'd fooled myself into thinking that I could fix things, because I'd always been motivated by the Science, so I would always want to create my machine... or was it a ray?  No.  It was a computer program.  I'd made a program... or...

Already, I could feel the chaos in my head, the competing timelines sorting themselves out as the memories of a time that now never existed began to decay.

""Sir!""

""SIR!!""

I pull my gaze away from the framed photo and turn to address the large man in his cheap suit. ""Yes?""

""The guests are here sir. Your mother asked me to inform you, and to enquire about when you would be making an appearance."" The large man shuffled his feet and looked away.

I took one more glance at the portait in my hands. A grainy black and white photograph from at least 30 years ago was encased in a new polished silver frame. The photo was of three men standing outside a construction site, each holding a tool and posing in front of the ribbon. The middle man was my father, the other two men were dead. 

I killed them. 

I shook my head and placed the photo back on the large desk with a focused effort. I waved a hand lazily at the man standing inside the door, ""I'll be down in a few minutes. I have one more call to make.""

As he turned and ducked out the door, I pulled open the top drawer on the left hand side. The gas station cell phone stored in there was still flashing a green light at the top. I sighed, and collapsed in the thick leather chair behind me.

CRASH!

The large city-view window to my left exploded inwards spraying fist sized pieces of glass all over the room. A dark figure flew through the middle of the debris, crashed to the floor and continued rolling towards the door the man in the cheap suit had just vacated. With an impossibly agile grace, the figure stopped near the door and silently swing it shut until it softly clicked shut.

The dark figure rose and I heard the deadbolt slam shut before the figure turned to face me. He stepped into the light, ""Do you know who I am?""

I kept my face calm, I hoped. I studied the man. He was wearing a bulky vest sprouting with tools, loops, and small knives. On his hip was a gunbelt and he carried a small assault rifle casually across his body. There was a conspicuous absence of space on the man's vest. ""Depending on who you talk to, you're either the best or worst cop no longer on the force.""

The man stiffened slightly.

""You also have an informant."" Now the man's eyes narrowed and his grip tightened around his rifle, ""You've never seen the face of this informant. This mysterious being has left you messages and clues, never in person. Then tonight, this person calls you from an untraceable cell phone and revealed a once in a lifetime opportunity."" An ugly look began to cloud the man's face.

I reached for the drawer and pulled out the cell phone, still blinking green, the sign of a missed call, and tossed it on the desk. ""What do you know about your informant?""

The point of the rifle swung up to point directly at me. There was no quiver when he stilled it. ""I know my informant has saved a lot of people's lives, and caused a lot of pain to some people who deserved it. I know that if you've got his body cut up and stashed around the city like the rest of your organizations enemies, then you better hope that chair is comfortable enough to spend the last few minutes of your life in."" His thumb jerked and there was an single click. Still no quiver.

My heart thumped hard in my chest. I schooled my features to calmness. ""Those are good things to know. But there are more things you should know about your informant."" Slowly, and with steady breaths, I crossed my ankle over my foot and assumed a forced posture of relaxation. Still no quiver.

""Your informant was more attached to this organization than you could possibly know. But first, I promise you that your informant is alive, unharmed, unbound, and completely healthy at this very moment. Whether or not he stays alive will depend on your decision in the coming moments."" Still no quiver.

""Explain."" 

""Oh, that's the challenge."" My right hand raised to rub my chin, ""See, I was born into this family and this life. I had no choice. I was a child, and all my friends, family, and everyone that was friendly or nice to me was involved in this life. I didn't know what it was as a child, but I got my juice and played with my toys and no one had to explain what was in the suitcases daddy's friends brought over. They didn't need to explain why we had a room with a steel door and a giant lock, I just thought it was a cool jungle gym to play on.""

""Short version,"" the man grunted at me. Still no quiver.

""When I grew older, I realized what this was. I asked not to be involved, but that was clearly not an option. So I began to subtely sabotage their efforts. It began as simple things like puncturing truck tires or accidentally losing messages. Eventually it became something more. That's where you came in. I needed an outsider, a perspective I'd never lived to keep me straight. You pointed me in the directions that I needed to go, and I kept you harassing their operations and causing nuisances I couldn't be associated with."" I uncrossed my legs and leaned forward, head in my hands. Still no quiver.

""Bullshit.""

""Apple Tree."" The rifle dropped.

""No shit. So the informant, got a promotion. The hard way."" I grimaced. ""I didn't realize my old buddies were going to come in that hot. I was told they were going in to capture the old man, and squeeze out the rest of the details about the operation from him."" My heart raced and I took a slow breath to calm it.

The man's posture relaxed, and the rifle returned to a casual hold across his torso. ""So, the VP was an informant and a shadow on the streets this entire time.""

My head shook slightly and I was forced to look down. ""Not the VP. The son, the only son.""

I heard a low long whistle. ""Jeeeeeesus Christ. That's gonna make my head hurt for a week. The vigilante is an informant, who is the son and heir of the biggest mob boss in the most corrupt city on Earth. The informant, son, tips off a ""retired"" police officer who tips off his old buddies to arrest the mob boss, his father, and wind up killing him in a gunfight instead.""

""Fuck man. You sleep at all the last three days?""

My veneer of calmness began to tremble. ""Not really."" I glanced up to see a rifle barrel level with my forehead again. ""So I see you understand my dilemma.""

""Sure. Easy one. Does the son of the mob boss take hold of the mantle of power? Or does the vigilante burn whole mess down?""

I caught his gaze. ""Or does the son of the mob boss burn the whole city down?""",dukew008

The evil it seemed to hide as these criminals tried to take advantage and hurt everyone around them. My father was no different. He led these people, instructed them in the ways of misery and deceit. He was the reason why I decided to dawn this mask, and fight what they stood against. I spent years on the streets of various cities, seeing the same scum again and again. I always avoided my fathers city after I left for some reason. I think it was out of sheer stupid respect that he was still my dad. I got the news while I was in my small apartment, mending to a knife wound from a few hours before. 

The carrier boy was soaked to the bone as me handed me the letter. The postage and marking on it made it clear, whoever sent it spent a great deal of time and money to find me. As I thanked the boy and quickly got him back into to the rain. I opened the letter. He was dead, my father, the crime boss of New Antonio. It seems his dying wish was to give me the family business. His lackeys spent 6 months trying to find me. I looked out the window and saw my fathers right hand man by the car, he met my gaze and gave me a frown. There was no use in running, so I got my coat and walked out the front door.

The drive back to my home town was met with information pouring into my ears and disrespectful gazes filling my eyes. It seems our ""family"" was not doing so well. Other families had ascended while my father was declining in health. All of this seemed so trivial to me as I tried to think about my fathers decision. Why would he even pick me to run the business? I left and had not spoken to him for years. He knew how I felt, I made that very clear before I left. Maybe he had gone mad in that final year. Whatever the case, San Antonio was now my target. My mask can finally return home and seek the justice I had always wanted.

My first few months as the crime boss were very distant. I handled basically nothing and was always out. The only orders I gave were hits on other crime families so I could use those as distractions. I started to slowly get more involved in the business. Replacing our outdated models for revenue and expanding into more legal operations. I started to realize that being the Boss, I could make a real difference in the city. I barely slept over the next few months. My days were spent enriching my empire while my nights were beating the so called scum into submission.

This disgusting city was starting to appear just a bit brighter as I worked harder and harder. The more power I gained for the family, the more pressure I could force onto the other crime families. I did not even need my mask some nights anymore as I gained more control. I could not stop the crime, but I could control it, sanitize it. I stopped everyone selling drugs to kids, filled the whorehouses with girls who wanted to be there, and made sure that my casinos did not kill to collect or send a message. 

They knew what I was doing, but it did not matter, I was the Boss. This new lifestyle made many of my lackey's distrusting. They thought it made me weak, that I was going against everything my father stood for. I did not have to dawn the mask even once to show them their place, to show them who was right. It took years, but I gained almost complete control over the city with the help of my family and the mask. The city was mine and I crafted it into something better. 

As the crime rates fluctuated depending on the definition for that week, new vigilantes started to appear. A city run by a Boss, how could that be anything but criminal. They poured in from all over the country hoping to gain some sort of fame by toppling my creation. 

I would not let them. 

The Boss would not let them. 

The mask would not let them.",PrototypeT800

"[WP] You are a vigilante in secret, but the son of a mob boss. Your dad dies and you inherit his organization. You are now leading both a life of crime and a life of vigilantism.",hype-iwnl-,"It never occurred to me that I would end up living a double life of both a law-enforcing vigilante and the big boss of a crime organization. My original idea was that I'd provide enough hindrance to my father's criminal operations as a informant vigilante to teach him a lesson. The evil loses and the justice prevails. Eventually. So that my guilty as Judas father would repent and renounce his former life style. But before that could happen, my father passed away. A heart attack.

My father was kind to his family, which included me and my mother, and to his business family too. Don Francisco. Johnny O'Roy. Black Teeth Joe. Big Shot. Weiss Ming. Watson Newman. Just to name a few. Probably not their real names. But a drop of their names makes even lousiest street thugs to run in terror. But my father certainly wasn't kind anyone outside his families. At his funeral, the preacher said some blessing words regarding my father's soul, but probably everyone attending the funeral knew his soul rightfully so had a special place in Hell.

After the death of my father, I decided I'd continue my life as the city vigilante. I passed the insider information to the other vigilantes and the law enforcement. I financed some clandestine operations in a guise of squandering my inherited wealth. Sometimes, I hid my face in a ski mask and did raids on drug labs myself. It was easy when you knew where to hit. And it felt nice to defy the legacy of my father and to live as an upstanding law-abiding citizen.

I knew that there would be a new head of the gang, but I doubted that'd be me. I was still too young and was not directly involved in my father's business before. I guessed that Don Francisco would take over the control of the business. He had a menacing look and a cruelty matching his appearance. But, it turned out that those ""top executives"" of my father's business respected my dead father so much that they unanimously voted me to be the next head of the family. 

So, I became a man whom I tried to stop. I was the law-enforcing vigilante seeking to destroy himself. The whole situation gave me a massive headache. Which side do I chose? Of course, I knew which side was the right side. The lawful side. But as I learned more and more about the criminal operations carried under the shadows of the city, I quickly realized that I had no chance of winning. All I did so far was making a dent in a mountain. Also, I have never told the other vigilantes that I was the son of the former big boss. They just knew me as a mysterious and competent informant. Should they find out... Well, there's a guy whose three daughters were deep fried alive and delivered right to his doorstep in crispy condition. I doubted he'd be able to stay reasonable.

On the other hand, staying as the big boss of the family seemed risky too. Sooner or later, they might trace back my history and discover that I've been trying to dismantle the business the whole time. My damages, it appeared, were small compared to the size of the business, but it was the intent that mattered. I was unfit to rule. And what happened me then? I pondered. I'd get the rat treatment. Yes, the executives of the business respected my father, but would they stay loyal after learning that I disrespected the venerable father? That I was the danger to their current business? Besides, they probably set me up as the big boss in order to avoid warfare among themselves. Oh, and what do the rats get for their betrayal? A stream of molten steel poured into their mouth.

I knew my double life would eventually catch up to me. It would be my downfall, I knew that. But I never imagined it'd be this soon. And yet, here we are, at the final confrontation.

""Junior,"" said Black Teeth Joe. He had his jaw blown out by a stray bullet, but he managed to survive and wore a black denture. He was the boss of nearly all hit man of the city. The father of killers was sitting across the desk and was pointing his pistol at my head.

""Your father trusted you. There were... reports that you were handing out our secrets to the sparrows and the slugs. For free. I'd say that's no business. Anyhow, such accusation was dismantled at the request of your father,"" said Black Teeth Joe. I looked sideways to avoid his gaze. ""He trusted you...""

""And so did I,"" said Hannah Jones, an aspiring journalist and a part of the vigilante group I was once part of. She was pointing a magnum to my head as well. ""We thought you were one of us. But you were enjoying yourself with all these wealth, knowing very well where they came from. If you have told us, we could have destroyed your father's business from its foundation. But oh no. You just wanted to play a hero and feel better about yourself, is that it? What made you silent?""

I kept my mouth shut and stayed silent. My life was already over, and all there left to do was for them to tread on me. And kill me. So I'd be dead forever. It was the only appropriate course of the action.

""Well, lady!"" said Black Teeth Joe. ""I don't feel like ending the lineage of the great Diablo with my hands. Gonna pull that trigger any time soon?"" Hannah shook her heads. The magnum was clattering from her trembling and sweating hands. Black Teeth Joe clicked his tongue and fixed his trilby. ""Guess I'll have to do it, then."" said Black Teeth Joe. And he shot her in her head. Hannah fell flat to the floor, twitched her legs few times, and died. Black Teeth Joe turned to me and shot me in the head too. Then, he stood up and left the room.

But I survived. Somehow, I was still conscious and therefore alive although bloods were dripping from the top of my head. My ears were constantly ringing. I was too afraid to touch where I've been hit. I've heard stories where the soldiers die only after seeing their wounds. I raised myself and stood up. It dawned onto me. This was the beginning of my third life: The vengeful maniac.

Joey made his way to the head of the table.  From his other pocket he pulled out a folded, blank piece of paper, and made a show of unfolding it.

""What's that Mic?"" Sally calls out from the other side of the Diner. She wears her painted face and painted smile.

""Nothing."" I say letting the door close as I return to my cup of Joe at the bar.

The Diner is dirty, worn out at the edges, a small leak in the corner Big Joe tried to hide with some decorative triptychs of clowns. Like the city, no one cares so long as their food is cooked and edible. But Big Joe is an old man. He remembers how it used to be. He still has some form of pride.

When I hear the bell hanging over the door clatter I look to Sally. Her quick nod and hello is rigid, she glances at me as soon as she speaks.

The steel is cold in my hand, the stubbed nose pressed into the corner of my pocket's fabric. My old eyes straining to watch the reflection in the polished metal of the napkin holder.

""I don't want any trouble."" He says from behind me, then looking up at Sally, ""But I'll have a cup of what he's having.""

He takes the seat to my left. If need be I can roll backward off the stool, bringing the gun up as I fall and take the shots across my body. The trick is keeping my hand in my pocket without raising suspicion.

Sally places a chipped cup in front of the man and fills it half full of three hour old coffe then gives me a bit of a pour. She reaches under the counter then pauses. The room holds its breath.

""You- you ah said, you'll have what he's having."" She said moving slowing showing her other hand and bring up the bottle slowly. She poured a shot in his glass and lifted mine to top it off.

When she set it down our eyes locked.

Sally was no stranger to violence. She grew up the pretty daughter of a drunk pervert, married another drunk, and killed him to protect her kids. She had rotated the cup.

I reached out with my left hand and grasped the handle and took a swallow.

""You know who I am?"" The man asked. He was stirring the coffee but not drinking.

""You run the family now, the tiny evil empire that is the rot of this good city.""

In the reflection and from the corner of my eye I saw him turn towards me.

""I run the crime. That's true. But the evil, that stops now. Has stopped."" He took a deep breath then let it out slowly. ""Will stop.""

""I know you do the snooping for The Justice.""

I didn't know much. The man was young, fit, smart, but arrogant, reckless enough that without my restraining hand he would have killed himself five times over. He was playing a quick game instead of chess. Left handed, non-smoker, possibly short sighted. But I'd be broken and bloody before I said word one to this man.

""He won't be around for a while, can't find the free time he said. But I need to help me.""

I could do it. Just a small roll off the back of the stool. I'd hit something vital at this range. He had men outside. He was dry but no umbrella, and my daughter... I stilled my soul. What was another dead hero in this age.

""He told me to tell you, that is he asked, about your cat. He said you told him a story once. Twelve toes and three lives.""

I looked at him then. I couldn't help myself. If he had the boy I doubted he would talk, not enough to tell them this.

The young crime lord adjusted his glasses and met my eyes only for a moment before looking at the coffee, his hands wrapped around the cup for warmth.

""Is he dead?"" I asked carefully, watching for a response. He seemed to struggle with the answer. The gun was growing warm in my hand.

""No, but he won't be coming back. Took your advice, and talked to that girl, ran off and made a life together.""

We both knew it was a lie. Not the part about never seeing him again, I had no doubts about that part, but this city chewed up and spit out harder men. But he knew enough, had known enough.

""You were his contact."" I said turning back to the coffee before me. 'I have someone semi-high up the ladder' he had said. I smiled at that.

""I was.""

""And you want to stop all this crime?"" I asked. He laughed. For a moment I turned my head and studied him. There was something about that laugh some innocence he shared with the dead vigilante. But then he swallowed and shook his head and looked at me. There was a hardness they shared as well.

""You know the family is woven through the very heart of this city. It will take generations for that to change. But the outright murder, the kidnappings, the rapes-"" His voice caught, ""The children."" I nodded. I knew.

""I can't meet you ever again. I'm guarded 24 hours a day. We can't speak, or meet, or nod at each other on the streets.""

""Sally sometimes has jackets or hats in the lost and found."" I said quickly. I slid my right hand from my pocket, signally Sally, wherever she was it was safe. As safe as it ever was. But this had to be a decision she had to make for herself.

She was there in a moment, her makeup smeared on her right cheek. I wondered if it was a rifle or a shotgun, but didn't think twice about it.

""More coffee?"" She asked.

""You ever get hats or jackets or whatever in the lost and found?"" I asked her. She glanced back and forth between the two of us. She was a smart woman, but she had a flaw. She too wanted to make the city a sliver of what it once was. It took her only three moments to nod slowly.

""Sometimes."" she said. ""When we do you can tell cause that corner lamp is lit."" She made as if to pour but noticed both cups were still full. She glanced at me once then headed back into the back room.

The young king-maker beside me slid a few greenbacks from the stack in his pocket and left. For a brief moment while the door was open I could hear the rain. And for a moment I closed my eyes and imagined it could wash this city clean.",ruat_caelum

Forty-seven hard, determined faces looked back at you expectantly. They belonged to fourty-seven scarred, bullet-punched, street-toughened bodies. Some of the bodies were missing parts. 

One-Peeper Pete was had only his right eye, the other gone after a rival gangster's .45 had caught his face crosswise. Half-Deaf Dave only had one functional ear, the other melted and then solidified into something resembling a coil of soft-serve ice cream after a fiery car crash running from the police. Most noticeably, there was Stick-Kick Steve, who had those metal running legs below the knees. You know, the ones amputee athletes have. They'd been a reward for loyalty from your father after Steve had endured 36 hours of torture (during which he was shot in both knees and had his legs flayed to the bone) at the hands of the rival mob's boss, Don Biscotti. Steve refused to crack. 

The list of characters at this gathering went on, but it was clear this was no meeting of fresh-faced juveniles. No, these were men who had done and had done to them unspeakable things, and they would do them all again in a heartbeat at your behest. Your father was dead, and in his passing you had inherited the mantle of mob boss. You were now the leader of the biggest organized crime ring in the city...which made your situation all the more tricky, considering that up until his death, you'd been using your insider info to sabotage your father's attempted crimes to the best of your ability. 

You'd wanted to tell him, as he lay there on his deathbed, succumbing to cheese cancer. Yes, you read that right: **cheese cancer.** A rare condition where cheese chokes the heart and mind, replacing the tissues with pure cheese, caused by a hugely excessive consumption of cheese. Cheese cancer! Of all the possibilities, this fate befell the leader of a small army. The doctor had told him no smoking and no liquor; his lungs and liver were about ready to keel over and take him with them. Find something else to invest your time in, the doctor had said.

So he'd turned to cheese. Buying it, tasting it, making it, perfecting it; aside from crime, cheese became his life. It was an obsession. The more you foiled his plans behind the scenes, the worse his obsession became. It got to the point that he wouldn't eat anything *but* cheese. You'd done your best to squash the rumor getting out, but the guys had known he'd taken to drinking cheesecloth water a few weeks before the cancer tightened its grip. And then it struck, a fate so rare (only 1 recorded case ever: his) and ludicrously inconceivable that you'd lied to the boys and said he was assassinated by the rival mob.

That lie was what had landed you here, in front of a room of killers awaiting orders. The lion's den which you now both commanded and clandestinely endeavored to dismantle. You cleared your throat, and the men quieted down. Their determined faces awaited your command.

""So. Some of you may know that our beloved Father, Don Cannolli, was assassinated by that evil bastard Biscotti."" At the utterance of the name, angry rumbles reverberated in the room (Though it may have just been Gasman Greg). 
""Will we take this terrible insult lying down? NEVER!""

The walls shook with your warriors' roars. They were ready go to war for you. This would be the tricky bit.

""Now,"" you began, yelling. ""Who knows what we're going to do?""
""**KIIIIIIIILLLLLLL!!!!!!**"" was the responding roar.

""No!"" you cried. ""That's where you're wrong. Before he died, our dear Don Cannolli left me very specific instructions on the best way to exact our revenge.""
The men leaned forward in anticipation of the late Don's dastardly plan.
""My father told me that the only think Don Biscotti hates more than losing money is *good deeds*.""

""You mean like helping old ladies across the street?"" piped up Janitor James. (He wasn't part of the gang, he just cleans Friday afternoons.)

""Exactly!"" you exclaimed to the sea of now-confused faces. ""Robbing banks, shooting cops, laundering money; Biscotti will expect that. But helping build houses? Planting trees? Mentoring students? He'll never see it coming!""

""Yeah boss, yeah...yeaaahhhh. I can see that."" said Danny the Dammer. They called him that because he had single-handedly taken on 6 of Biscotti's men, come out on top, and then buried them one by one in the dam being built upriver. 
""Yeah, catch ol Don Biscotti sideways, get him confused, and then we strike! I like it.""

The Dammer's approval was enough for the other men, and they too began to voice their assent. You breathed a sigh of relief; the plan was set, the trap laid. Now to follow it through. 

**SIX MONTHS PASS**

*Crime City Therapy Clinic for the Young and Elderly*

A boy with prosthetics below the knees was painstakingly endeavoring to make his way across the room. He was being assisted by both a walker, and a very enthusiastic coach.
""That's it, kiddo, that's it..."" The man watched intently as the youngster achieved another step by sheer willpower. 
""You've got it, kid, you've got it! Keep it up! Don't stop now!""

The man followed along earnestly, bent down and watching the boy's every step as if he was witnessing the creation of life itself, providing hearty doses of encouragement as needed. Finally, the boy was across! He collapsed out of the walker in exhaustion, falling back against the wall. He didn't remain there long though, as the man roared with joy, picked him up and began to dance him around the room.

""Ha-ha! Ah-HAAAA! You did it kiddo, you did it! I've never felt so good! I swear I've never been so proud before. I'm proud of ya, kid. Real proud.""

""Aw, quit it Steve, come *on*!"" begged the bashful boy, but he was grinning from ear to ear. 

""Alright, alright, you take a rest now, ya little rascal."" acquiesced the man, and set the boy down on a nearby bench, then turned and clanked over to you. Clanked? That's right. This man was the one and only Stick-Kick Steve, who mere months previous had been ready to kill at your command. 

""Boss,"" he began. ""I gotta say, I just...I ain't never felt like this before. Look at that kid, and now look at me."" He gestured to his own prosthetics. ""He's just like me! I know what he's going through. I know *exactly* how he feels. And after helping him, I've never been so happy. Man, boss, I tell ya,"" continued Stick-Kick, beginning to look a little teary in the eyes. ""I wasn't sure what you had in mind when you pitched this plan six months ago, but this is honest to god the best thing ever happened to me. I don't know what I done to deserve this. Ain't done no good my entire life, but I feel happier now than I've ever felt. Ain't no hooker or booze can make me feel like this."" He wiped his eyes, embarrassed, then put his hand over his heart. ""Thank you, boss. From the bottom of my crooked heart. Thank you.""

You smiled and inclined your head in return. Stick-Kick grinned back, then walked to the middle of the room.
""Hey, everybody!"" he cried. ""Johnny just walked the whole room! Waddaya say we head out and celebrate? It's on me!"" 

""Beer!"" came a shout from a back corner of the room.
""Girlies!"" came another.

""No, no, no, ya idiots, we're taking the kids with us, the *kids*!"" 
""...Ice cream?"" came the sheepish reply. 
""Now that's more like it. Come on, kid!"" 

Stick-Kick picked up Johnny and set him on his shoulders, then waited. One-Peeper Pete put down his eye exam sheet, then took a little girl's hand to lead her out of the room. She jumped up and down, begging to be carried, and he laughed and obliged. She had only one eye. Half-Deaf Dave moved his hands in a strange fashion at a boy, who smiled and signed back. Dave ruffled the boy's hair and the two walked together to join the group, signing back and forth animatedly. Soon there was a flood of men with scarred, mashed, disfigured, and grinning faces leading a merry parade of children with all sorts of impairments down the block to celebrate the small victory of their friend. 

As you followed, a nurse stopped you.
""Mister, when you all came in here, I didn't know what to expect. I figured we were in for a bad time. But this place hasn't seen this kind of life in years. The kids have never been happier, or recovered quicker. From all of us here...thank you.""

""Don't mention it,"" you replied. ""It's aaallll part of the plan...""",gamedude658
"[WP] You are a vigilante in secret, but the son of a mob boss. Your dad dies and you inherit his organization. You are now leading both a life of crime and a life of vigilantism.",hype-iwnl-,"""The family is yours.""

*Family? This isn't a family. This is a cabal. This is a syndicate of sin.*

His fathers voice rasped with heavy effort and for a moment his aged eyes widened with the impossible choice overwhelming his body. And then it was over. His son had ascended. The Family had a new leader. The room was still, only the Made Men, wife, and children were present when The Don finally passed away. Traditions dictated such measures be taken, the doctor would be sent for, the wife would step out, the Made Men would swear fielty to their new Don. As the eldest son swept his deceased father's eyelids closed, the leader of the Made Men ushered the wife out of the room.

*Plausible deniability. She would never see who ascended...* he thought.

All eyes turned up solemnly to Seyton, the first born of the Banquo family, eldest to the departed Don, heir to The Family. He returned the gaze with the fierce look of a young man who was ready to test his mettle, but the Made Men could never know how dire that situation was. Trouble had been crawling at the edges of The Family for months, Seyton would be rising to power in a tough time for all of the Cartels in the city. 

Made Men were vanishing, nothing but brass shell casings left in their absence. Rival families weren't spared, entire card games or boxing matches were swarmed by federal agents. Somebody had cast a wide net and it was getting every big fish in the city. There were even rumors that The Don himself had succumbed to an ulcer from all the stress. No one in that room could remotely fathom that Seyton had been masterfully disassembling the entire criminal underworld right under their noses.

The first born and the crown jewel of The Don, Seyton was sent to the best academies, the finest tutors doted over his education. As he grew into a man and worked the legitimate side of The Family books, he witnessed the cruelty committed by his kin against strangers in the name of coin. Friends from school were beaten and used, others went missing, all were corrupted by the rusting corrosion that his family spread. As Seyton grew older, his expression grew stoic, his eyes lost the wide glint of curiosity. His hair grew silver strands around his ears. The Made Men all believed him to be the next great Don of The Family, that his reign would leave the biggest mark on the city.

Seyton willed a smile off his face, his expression stony and without flinching. One by one, the Made Men around the room lowered their heads and offered up their palms in a show of grace and submission. They were awaiting their orders and demonstrating their loyalty. Seyton's chest swelled with a long drag of air as his mind connected dots for vicious plans.

*I'll have to crush every part of the Cartel here. I'll have to do it with every eye of the city on me.* His voice lifted the audience, ""Thank you gentlemen. Let us plan the arrangements for burying my father.""

In the back of his mind, a small voice whispered with greedy anticipation, *This is not the only funeral today.*",ZigZagSigSag

[WP] you live in a post apocalyptic world and trying to make a big as a comedian.,isthatjavi,"Kingsport Lighthouse was exactly like every other backwater farm in the wasteland in every way except one; the Kingsport Lighthouse had a bar. A bar with power.  
Made my entrance just as the sun was beginning to set. I threw open the door to the decaying building, my tattered duster blowing in the sea breeze, .44 magnum on my hip, scribbled notes stuffed in every pocket. Warm, ambient noise flowed out of the building, mingling with the steady beat of the waves against the shore. I could tell the people inside were impressed with me by the way they didn't look up at all.  
The place was built into the shell of an old boathouse, perched on a decaying pier stretching out over the ocean.The place had become a local legend for their nightly entertainment. Wasteland folk singers, poets, the occasional wandering theater company. The floorboards creaked and groaned as I approached the counter. A bartender was organizing the mismatched bottles of brackish liquid on the shelf. The place certainly wasn't famous for their drinks. I knocked softly on the bar.  
""I'm the comedian. For the, uh, show tonight?""  
The bartender looked vaguely over his shoulder. ""You're the guy?""  
""Yeah,"" I said, ""This is the decrepit heap I'm scheduled at, right?""  
""Alright, funny man, save it. Green room's that way. You're on at sunset."" He gestured towards the back of the room.  
""Green room? This place has everything...""  
It wasn't long before I got called out onto stage. The set went pretty well, all things considered. I told all the classics. The one about the guy with the flaming sword. The one about the caravaneer from out west. That time I tried fishing. It was tough for a comedian in a world like this one. You had to be a very special kind of crazy to find humor in a world like this one. But in a world with nothing left to destroy, people still needed to laugh. And I would do my best to help them along.

They take 5 precious minutes out of their busy days to stop and stare. 

""Who would want to live forever? Didn't he know that it would defeat the urgency and desires we find in life? What a fool...""

It's all relative, I think to myself. It's hard to care about the ins and outs of everyday life when it ceases to exist. The problems of yesterday are all gone. Global warming, international power struggles, global food shortages and poverty: all in objectively better positions than 400 years ago. With each century, more and more problems that matter to my 'oldschool' mind get wiped away as if it should have always been that easy. But these young whippersnappers around me still find problems to complain about. They will surely be fixed if I wait long enough. They haven't seen the process yet. They've heard about it, read about, could probably even tell me more than I could ever want to know about it. But I have seen it. To them, I am careless. To myself, I am carefree. 

Sometimes, ignorance truly is bliss and knowledge truly is suffering.

""Sir, ***sir***! Its honestly not that difficult,"" the impatient, gaunt man in a three piece suit says to me. The flashing hems of the luminescent garments distract me as I attempt to puzzle through the device. 

""I'm, sorry I have a condition, my eyes..."" I start with execuses. He doesn't let me finish before rolling his eyes, and taking the tablet from me. His fingers whir on the screen. Some time ago I would have had difficulty averting my eyes from the work he executes, attempting to follow along. Now I don't even bother, though my attention is drawn to the homeless man, dressed in tattered and dirt-smudged garments in the adjacent line who is, despite missing two fingers on his right hand and possessing an eye infection, deftly managing his own tablet without issue. 

""Your age?"" 

""Thirteen-thirty-four.""

""One-*thousand*-three-hundred-thirty-four,"" he corrects me without so much as a glance. ""You know, some of us have work to do. We can't just take time out of our days to do things for your lot.""

""I, I'll have you know that I built this building!"" My outburst surprises me, and me alone. 

""Oh, with your own two hands?"" The attend asks, while absently tossing the tablet to me. ""Next!"" 

I half-shuffle away, attempting to keep the imagined arguments and counter-arguments at bay as I look down at the device. This must be a mistake. I glance around for anyone who could answer my question, but there are far too many people here, and they're all ignoring eachother.

So many people, I cannot fathom getting the attention of any one person in such a crowd. They're all so busy, and so focused on the routine and challenges of their lives. There's no possible way to speak with any one person.

How horrifying, these moments, finding myself alone in a crowd. They seem to be more frequent as of late. 

It's not possible though. The tablet wants me to up there? No one goes upstairs. All rehabilitation occurs on the first thirty floors. Above that... well it used to be research, test subjects, human resources, but I can't even fathom what they have up there now.

I remember the first day I entered that elevator. My own fortress of solitude, built in the middle of downtown Manhattan. A monument to my success, glory, and promise. 

Its been so long. I feel like a stranger, almost like an invader at the gates as I press the button. As I step into the sterile, stainless steel, perfectly lit interior, I entertain the thought that I may be dreaming...

He'd been seen on every major news and entertainment outlet for centuries.

The grandaddy.  The godfather.  The enigma.  The immortal.

He'd heard it all.

His longevity was seen as a novelty by the public for a while - even though for him it was centuries of toil.  

When, thanks to a hundred years of contemplation (assisted by several well meaning AIs no less), he'd unified quantum and classical physics, the world...  Well they took him a *bit* more seriously now.  But not without a small degree of entitlement, like, you know, duh?

Slowly, the buzz wore off.  He'd traveled to distant worlds and back, a tireless progenitor his long-lived progeny scoured the universe, carving out their own journeys.

It took a couple of thousand years before he really started to notice but somehow he was falling behind.

His hardware was getting old now.  Surely everyone could tell.  The anchors on the galactic news network humored him as the oldest living human, but frankly he'd outlived his shell.

Software upgrades were possible to an extent, but eventually vendor support phased out.

What they didn't realize is after a while people figured out how to advance intelligence even faster. But sadly my brain wasn't advanced enough for the procedures. 

So here I sit with an iq of 167, in a world where the average iq is what when I was born would be around 400. What does that mean? It means sometimes when people get a new piece of technology they have to learn differential Calculus before they use it. So Something that used to take people years to learn people now learn in five minutes by speed reading the textbook. People can be totally ignorant of a subject, and gain a  mastery of it in ten minutes, something when I was young you needed twenty years of studying and hard work to do. 

I can't even understand people when they talk. I'm not even learning disabled, those people have iqs that are equal to at least 250 back when I discovered immortality. Even they can recite from memory every bit of info from ten thousand textbooks without effort. 

I just sit in the park feeding the ducks while people communicate entire libraries of info to each other through neural prosthetics. Sometimes I think people are making fun of me, sometimes I think that they feel sorry for me. To be honest I can't tell, everything is so complicated and fast.

[WP] You are a genius who makes yourself immortal; unfortunately over a few hundred years the average IQ rises so high that you are now considered an idiot.,no-offence,"The doctor was staring at him, wearing a small smile as he attempted, yet again, to explain.

""Please. Just boost my IQ,"" Benjamin croaked. ""I'll share the secret of my immortality with you, if you'll help me.""

Doctor Anders leaned back and signaled to his assistant AI to make careful notes of what Benjamin was saying. An interesting case - a man with a severe deficit in his mental development, who had managed to construct an elaborate labyrinth of belief in his background and abilities. Quite a sophisticated coping mechanism, really. He should write a paper about it.

""Tell me again, Benjamin. You still believe you were born in the year 1980? Five hundred years ago?"" he prompted. ""And that's why you're intellectual capabilities are...lacking?""

""Yes!"" Benjamin said, wincing slightly at the word 'lacking'. He'd been a genius once, he remembered that. He'd been celebrated across the world, in the century that he'd been born. 

Anders stared at the man, feeling faint pity. Mental illness - almost eradicated in the population. Yet here it was, in a man found wandering the alleys of the city a few months ago. It was pitiable, but also fascinating. Therapy and procedures had done nothing to bring his mind back. It remained painfully slow, incapable of the intuitive leaps of brilliance even a child could manage. And then this strange story to comfort himself. An extraordinary case. He really should write a paper, soon.

But he'd made enough observations to write it. It was time to put the man at rest - it was inhumane to delay treatment.

""I'll give you the injection today, Benjamin, I'm authorised to do so,"" the doctor said, patting the man's hand comfortingly. ""And then you can share your secret.""

His AI handed him the syringe. Benjamin watched with greedy, hopeful eyes. A Booster - the medicine the ones born with the sharpest minds could access, to enhance their abilities. For ludicrous amounts of money. He'd never been able to achieve even a sliver of the success needed to access a syringe, or even steal some. He had been a scientist, not a thief. A stint in jail two hundred years ago, when the stuff had been invented, had taught him that.

But this man, with his kind eyes, seemed to understand. Would he finally receive enough of a boost to elevate himself to the top, once again? Or just enough to leave this hospital?

Anders stepped forward, and gently plunged it into his shoulder. Benjamin closed his eyes and waited for something to happen. He had stubbornly held onto the secret to his immortality, his last bartering chip. But he'd tell the man the secret, in exchange for this. 

Anders watched as Benjamin's eyes became unfocused, the lines on his face relaxing somewhat. 

""Benjamin? Why are you here?"" he asked softly.

Benjamin shook his head drowsily. ""I...was in the city. Thinking of...home. My time. Where is home?""

His mouth worked as he tried to form more words, and then his eyes drooped shut, falling asleep as the dosage began to take effect. Anders nodded to himself, satisfied. It would take a while for Benjamin's mind to adjust to the changes. But he would wake up soon, and be content. No longer plagued by these strange delusions. No need for elaborate mental defenses that were exhausting to maintain. He would finally just be happy.

Anders sighed and handed the empty syringe to his assistant. The AI slid from the room without a sound to dispose of it. 

Sometimes, he wished he *could* boost these broken, fogged minds. But the medicine had a strange effect on any mind troubled by mental illness. Better, instead, to dull them further. Dull them enough to be content with their lot. And keep them here - safe and away from people who would only mock and deride their existence. Yes, it was better.

""Be happy, Benjamin,"" Anders said, squeezing the sleeping man's shoulder as the AI returned to take him to his ward. ""You have a new home, now.""

[WP] You are a genius who makes yourself immortal; unfortunately over a few hundred years the average IQ rises so high that you are now considered an idiot.,no-offence," Sitting there alone was the sad inventor of immortality. Every day he would sit by the fountain in the floating park, feeding birds and staring listlessly into the sky. Humanity long ago outclassed his once superior intellect, leaving him with not much else to do other than exist. 

 Immortality at first was wondrous for him, the rush he gained from discovery and all the time he could devote to research were truly a gift. He never shared his secret with anyone, preferring to work outside of the public eye to better humanity. Eventually, his work in scientific discovery gained recognition and caused humanity to shift focus. 

 Slowly, the world surpassed him. Amazing breakthroughs were made from his unresolved findings, marvellous advances in political relations, and fantastic progress on interstellar travel. Humans kept moving, evolving, and advancing but not him, he was stuck. Never aging and lacking the knowledge for a cure he eventually fell behind, unable to comprehend the great leaps humanity had undergone. Ridiculed for his menial and rudimentary understanding of things he was viewed lesser than by most.

 Stubborn, the man would not reveal the one thing he figured out centuries before. His curse, the torment he bestowed unto himself and the last vestige of his once sprawling intelligence. Immortality. For all their marvels and wonders humanity could not solve the oldest of riddles, death. Spiteful of their success the man vindictively held his secret close, waiting for the right moment where his intelligence would shine again. 

 Silently and calmly the inventor of immortality rose from the bench. He began to stroll down his favourite path; stopping to admire the trees, a long sigh escaped him.

[WP] You are a genius who makes yourself immortal; unfortunately over a few hundred years the average IQ rises so high that you are now considered an idiot.,no-offence,"I imagine it'd be locked to biological capacity though. After a long while the brain starts to forget memories(as well as degrade the accurate call back of them) in favour of other memories. After a very long time(read enough time that humanity's mean IQ has increased, it would likely be long enough for one's brain to forget such non-important memories, and valuable connections would probably be lost. Surely this would effect overall IQ. At minimum the would be an eventual cap where without actually experiencing any further evolutionary effects(that the rest of the population would eventually have) you wouldn't be able to increase IQ any further, but the populace around you may still be able to, due to any positive cranial evolutionary effects, and the build up of corrective knowledge.

DNA itself is just a guideline, it doesn't tell your cells *exactly* how to grow.

Now if the teleport devices copies your cells to rebuild on the other side, who's to say that it would rebuild it exactly the same way? What if during the building the cells decided to form in a different way than they did the first time? Will you still be the same person if a few cells take a recessive trait or something like that when they're rebuilt? This is of course assuming the machine rebuilds the cells at the individual level and not the body as a whole in one shot, and my knowledge on the subject is sorely lacking, but it's just something your post made me think about so I did a quick read on the basis of current teleportation devices, and they seem to start from the ground up when rebuilding, so to speak, which would leave a bit of room for those DNA changes to possibly occur",Loken89

[WP] You are a genius who makes yourself immortal; unfortunately over a few hundred years the average IQ rises so high that you are now considered an idiot.,no-offence,"I barely recognize humanity's children.

In retrospect, the fracture of our species was inevitable.  The seeds had already been sown when I was still a young man.  Even before I cured my mortality, the process had begun, though I didn't recognize it at the time.

When the world became digital location lost all meaning, at least for a moment.  For a brief period in history, every person on the globe could communicate with every other.  Of course, as anyone who has ever attended either high school or prison could have predicted, humanity used this new found power to do nothing of the sort.  Instead, we began to form cliques on a global scale.

Those on the extremes of the bell curve had always been ostracized; always been forced to adapt and fit in.  I experienced that myself, back when native intelligence was still considered an interesting trait.

With eight billion people in the lunchroom, everyone could find a table to sit at.  People were free to be themselves, and they did so, retreating to their own bubbles of contacts and information.  Now, the various sub cultures can barely communicate with each other, even if they were so inclined (which, they emphatically are not).  With the full mechanization of commerce, they have little incentive.

By the time the first colony was established on Europa, people didn't even complain about the hour long ping times.  No one had anything to say to the groups back home.  If Chihuahuas and St. Bernards are any indication, I expect the day when we can't even interbreed is closer than most expect.  Communication lead directly to speciation.  You might find this deeply ironic, depending on which definition of ""irony"" your particular subculture finally converged on.

In my case, all this change served to help me find empathy for people who might once have ostracized me.  We might have used the term ""meat-head"" to describe someone who's defining positive attributes had all be rendered obsolete by the invention of the steam engine.  In a world full of forklifts, being the strongest guy in the room carried rather less meaning than it would have back when flint tools were still the cutting edge (no pun intended).

The term means something different today.  You see, the brains of children are still malleable, making it possible from them to bond with the neural interfaces that are now standard worldwide.  For most people, a fully functional brain is about fifteen percent artificial.

As the only person on the planet who's childhood predates such implants, I get to join a select group of religious fanatics and rabid luddites who have been doomed to a lifetime of functional illiteracy.  Like the born hunter living in a mechanical age, I am a meat head.  Talented in ways that will never again be relevant.

My immortality has doomed me to a life of anticlimax.  I lived to see the singularity, but only heard about it second hand.  Without the ability to directly experience, my lack of understanding rendered the whole thing no more meaningful than a vague description in a bad science fiction story.  Super intelligence exists , but it might as well be located across the galaxy.

The colonies on Mars and Europa and Titan don't bother to send pictures.  They send multi-sensory gestalts that exactly replicate the experience of being there.  Or so I am told, by the few people still patient enough to talk to me.  I will never experience such things.

Most of humanity's children have grown too polite to make fun of me.  They feed and cloth me, allow me to wander.  Human history has ended, though.  I am effectively the last member of an extinct species.  I only hope that at least some of our descendent groups retain enough empathy to see me as ""human"".

I will outlive all of them.  They've changed too much for me to offer my own cure for aging.  We are just too different.  They live faster though, with their direct interface to the net.  Even now, after hundreds of years, most teenagers have lived for more subjective time than I have.

I don't know what is next for me.  I am doomed to become increasingly alien as the years pass.  I am already a museum piece.  I dread the day when I will be seen as an animal.",Wobbles42

Memories, hazy at first, start to return...",thisperson,"‘Frank’ had told me that my entire life was a lie. 

He refused to reveal where we were – for ""my own safety”. As far as I could make out, it was a concrete bunker. A lightbulb blinked overhead.

I sipped my coffee. It was still too hot.

“So, ‘Frank’, my parents aren’t *actually* my real parents. Is that right?”

“That’s right. You were snatched from the hospital when you were only a baby”

“But I look exactly like them! And my sister! How are we not related?”

“Well, they thought of that. They predicted what you’d look like and assigned you a surrogate. You’ve got to understand, these people...they’ve been doing this for years. They’re good at blending in, at not arousing suspicion. They did the same thing with your ‘sister’”

Frank lit a cigarette.

“So what happened after that?” I asked.

“Then they fled. Far, far away – to take you to Elm Grove”

Elm Grove...the name alone conjured up strong nostalgia. I remembered learning to ride my bike down the gravel driveway...Dad cooking his summer barbecues...all our friendly neighbours...

Frank snapped his fingers and I crashed back to reality.

“Of course” he went on, gesturing with his cigarette “’Elm Grove’ isn’t on any maps. You never saw a map, did you? And you couldn’t get online because they’d blocked the internet.”

“We were surrounded by forest! We couldn’t get a phone signal, let alone internet!”

“And you believe that, do you? In 2016 do you honestly think there’s a single place that can’t get phone, TV, radio OR internet? Come ON! They kept you in the dark. Stopped you asking questions about the ‘outside world’. You were never curious?”

I shook my head. Frank laughed.

“They did a good job then: look at you, you accepted everything they told you. Like clay in their hands. Now tell me about this ‘Elm Elementary’. It was a small school, right?”

“Well, yeah, considering we lived out in the middle of nowhere. It was ten to a class. Apart from that, I don’t know, it was pretty normal, I guess.”

“Define 'normal'”

“Like I said, normal! You know, we started each day with the pledge of allegiance: *'‘I pledge allegiance to the Father, I am not individual, we are all one body, we are all one community’'*...”

“That doesn’t sound like any pledge of allegiance I’ve ever heard. And, let me guess, you did a lot of 'Religious Studies'? A lot of learning about ‘the Father’?”

“Well, yeah, it was a religious community so the elders were big on it”

“The ‘elders’?”

“You know, the council, the people who make the rules, who teach us, who punish bad behaviour. The rulers.”

“There were no cops, or courts?”

“We didn’t need any of that stuff. I mean, the elders kept order pretty well”

“And only the ‘elders’ could leave Elm Grove, is that right?”

“Yeah...I mean, if everyone left, it’d be chaos! No-one would get anything done!”

Frank stood up. He sighed.

“Okay, okay...I’ve heard enough.”

He reached into his pocket, and pulled out a pistol. He aimed it at me.

“And here I was thinking you were leadership material. You forgot the most important lesson: we never talk to outsiders. We never reveal anything. Sorry kid...” he cocked the pistol “but you talk too openly, and now you know too much.”

Then Frank pulled the trigger and everything went black.",metalfacemask

"[WP] In this world, if humans get bitten 100 times by a given animal, they gain some of the animal's superhuman traits. Mosquito, cat, and spider powers are common, but the animal you got your traits from is definitely unusual.",wintersage,"Petti the Yeti is not just a nickname to me; It's my entire identity now. My singular name, chosen by myself upon my registration.

Back in the day, I didn't have such a descriptive name. I had a standard, run of the mill, *Human* name. Creatures, as we were now called, cast away such names once we have changed. Before regulations and segregation, it was common to keep our Human name and attempt to hide our identities, much like you would expect of a super hero, only more for our own convenience, rather than to as a mask to hide behind in which to conduct our unnatural escapades. 

But the virus didn't think as we thought. It was going to out us, one at a time, whether we liked it or not. No one was sure where it came from, how it began, who it's first host was, or even exactly how it was transmitted, beyond being bitten by the same type of animal a few dozen times. What everyone *did* know, was that once infected, you would turn. 

The humans built entire colonies using all kinds of new technology, to seal themselves off from the outside, from The Wild. But no matter how many bug zappers, triple gate vacuum locks, twin pane electrodomes, or carbon gel sealant varieties they made, each bastion of humanity eventually fell, and became The Wild that they sought to stay alienated to.

Scouting parties and product transports between colonies were the most commonly susceptible to the virus. I, myself, was in The Multus, a very unconventional scouting party of engineers, scientists, soldiers, and volunteers, which was led by none other than Simone Cortun. Although she was a Creature herself, she was not so changed that she was shunned and outcast by Humans, In fact, she was still well regarded by the Humans. Perhaps it was because, despite the backwards bending knees, feathery hands, and the occasional lapse in judgement when she would eat caterpillars off of leaves while on patrol, she looked and acted mostly Human. 

Simone was one of the very few Creatures allowed into Column without any kind of special permissions, work waivers, or political red tape. After she found out that she had become infected, she quickly reached out to her sister, who ran the Council of Creature Colonies, otherwise referred to by most Humans as ""C-Three"", which oversaw the foundation and maintenance of Creature Colonies (""C-Two's""), and the assignment and welfare of Creatures (""C-One's"" as was our government designation). With her sister's help, Simone had been appointed as one of the first members of the newly created Creature Cohabitant Initiative, and was allowed to stay in Column, rather than being shipped off to a C-Two. I wasn't so lucky when I was infected. 

When I was infected, I was placed in now-mandatory quarantine for 48 days; The average incubation period of the virus. During this time, I, along eight others, were studied. Poked, prodded, tested, examined, poked, examined, tested, and so on. It wasn't uncommon for one of us to become light headed and need to rest the entire day after having so much of our blood drawn. 

Outside our containment chambers were the walkways of Level 27, one of Column's many scientific suites. We would watch through the windows of our pens as white coats and business suits walked to and fro. Every third day or so, a young boy would come walking by, hand in hand with his father. Each time, he would force his father to stop, and come over to our reinforced bioglass portholes, and stare at us in awe. No doubt, he was partly doing this because the concept of infection was so strange to his innocent mind, but partly because, as the incubation period elapsed and the infection spread, changes to our physique became more and more apparent. 

Terry, in particular, was having quite a hard time. Another member of The Multus, but one which I did not know well, had been swarmed by ants while out on patrol. The spare appendages grew in well, and actually quite suited his long, lanky frame. But when his jaw started to separate, and his skin started to harden into a shell, his once-handsome appearance quickly turned into a bad 1980's horror movie actor's make-up. He would be placed into a Creature Colony, for sure.

Lynn, also, was not exactly enjoying herself. The stark white walls, the buzz of the florescent lighting, and the dripping of a sink four rooms away was playing havoc with her newly acquired senses; Those of her illegal pet bat. However, if none of the physical adaptations took hold, she would be a prime candidate for the night watch in Column, as a Creature Cohabitant. Her case was a common shoe-in for this, as her infection allowed her to develop heightened senses and extranormal powers, without compromising her Human appearance. 

I, on the other hand, was in limbo. Although I was quite enjoying my transformation, considering I had paid my live savings to acquire my bites - more out of curiosity than desire - my physical appearance had become more alarming than average. The pure white, full-body fur, overdeveloped upper body musculature, and brooding jawline all contributed to my Wild look. 

Most likely, I would be sent to the C-Two in what used to be Alaska. Not only because I broke practically every law in the book in order to get to Old-World Congo, but because the fur made my already warm blooded body even warmer, which made staying anywhere remotely warm practically unbearable, so I had to have constant air conditioning and ice baths, much to the dissatisfaction of my cellmates. 

On day 63, a panel of scientists, business types, rich folk, and gawkers poured into my Decision Meeting. As the first Creature to be tried of crimes in nearly 40 years, this was a rather monumental occasion for everyone, but especially so for me, as this was the day I found out where I would be going. People had been advised to bring warm clothing, but many didn't heed that warning, and sat as tightly as possible in the long benches of the adjunct courtroom of my cell. The Decision Panel had, rather unwillingly, been forced to create this room after my fellow Creatures had been evacuated to their respective locations. The entire room was lined with refrigeration units and air conditioners, pumping enough cold air in to chill the room to a rather comfortable 38 degrees. 

""Creature number seven-four-six-nine-nine-two-eight, come forward."" Gasps and excited murmurs filled the room as I walked from my cage to the bench. No surprise, really, as I must look like a less blurry version of the Old World's 'Bigfoot' lumbering towards my seat.

""You are charged with the following offenses in your campaign to procure a transformative bite from an albino, western lowland gorilla..."" The judge proceeded, listing what must have been two, maybe three pages of crimes. ""How do you plead?"" He finished.

""Guilty to all,"" I responded, with a gruff, slow voice. ""and innocent to all."" I pushed. The judge perked an eyebrow and took off her glasses.

""Guilty and innocent? How do figure that?""

""According to numerous Old United States court decisions which uphold that various members of the lower great ape family can retain Human-like rights, without retaining the same level of comprehension for lawful and unlawful actions, to which prosecution is necessary, I was, as a Human, guilty, but as I am now a member of the blended species Creature classification, I am innocent of all criminal actions by commonality with my donor.""

The judge picked up a book and read through a few pages. ""This defense has already been attempted, and found unacceptable, so, by extension, you are still being tried as a Human."" She smirked. 

""Tell me, your honor, what was the name of the defendant in the case you are referring?"" I growled knowingly.

""Timothy Rolds."" She answered.

""A Human name, yes?"" She nodded. ""And what was my name, again?""

The judge looked down at the court documents she had been provided. She flipped the page, and the next page after a short pause. Mumbling, she said my name, trailing off as she went, knowing that any attempt to proceed had faltered with this one formality.

""Creature number seven-four-six-nine-nine-two-eight""

""An unnamed, unregistered Creature name, if ever I heard one."" I quipped.

"[WP]The demonic Satan with hooves and horns, and the fallen angel Lucifer meet",AlphaTitan8,"The Fallen Angel slowly bats his eyes open,  exhausted from the Great War. Not knowing where he had landed, he attempts to examine his surroundings. It is dark - a darkness that he had never known was possible, even in the darkest corners of the universe. As he recalls the events of the war, he slowly becomes enraged and filled with a deep hatred that inspires him to attempt to stand, although he cannot see the ground beneath him. It is cold and textureless.

A sound fills the void that strikes Lucifer to the core. It feels both distant and far, both loud and quiet, both low enough to vibrate his entire body and high-pitched enough to pierce his nerves. A horrible ""light"", if you could call it that, ignites a few feet away from him, emitting a painful burning sensation. He can see something in this aura of light.

Although a face was not visible, Lucifer could see the outline of its body standing in the aura. Lucifer's eyes glare up at the creature staring down on him. It's skull is deformed, with horns piercing through its fleshy scalp. It had long, bony arms with lengthy claws for fingernails. It's legs were covered in fur, with hooves poking out of the ends of its legs. 

The Angel's heart started beating faster and faster as his adrenaline slowly turns to fear. ""Who are you?"" Lucifer growls at the dark abomination, ""And what do you want with me?""

The creature's face becomes visible as the light grows stronger and gets closer to the Fallen Angel, revealing a masculine face. His empty eyes pierce Lucifer's soul, whatever was left of it.  His cheeks were sunken in, deformed frail but still terrifying. His lips peel back to reveal a truly morbid set of rotting teeth; if you could call them that. His forked tongue slithers through the pale-yellow gums as his mouth opens. 

""I ... am you ...

... but stronger."" 

The creature suddenly whips on a pair of sunglasses, and the whole room illuminates. Lucifer closes his eyes as multicoloured bright lights flash around him. He carefully peers at this thing in front of him, confused and terrified. ""What is going on? Whats your name?""

The man chuckles loudly at Lucifer's confusion. ""Deadass nigga, fuck you doin boi? Get that lil angel ass up, damn mang"" He grabs Lucifer's arm and helps him stand. ""Hey MTV, welcome to my crib, knowmsayn? Gotteem! Hahah."" It slaps Lucifer on the back. 

""Fr tho son, they call me Satan in this hood boi. Dont get it twisted or my crew fucc ya up aight?"" Satan takes a drink of something strong and laughs again, adjusting a crown of bones on his head. ""Goddamn nig this lean tite as fukc shiiiieeettt"" Lucifer stumbles back, incapable of comprehending this. He was in a flashing room with a floor that changed colour and a metallic ball hanging from the roof. ""What is going on, Satan?"" the angel asks.

""Well nigga lemme fill you in aight? So God like kicked yo bitch ass lmao like i said deadass lmao Now you finna be the next king of hell biiiiiiiiitch!!"" Satan cackles and sips his lean. Lucifer takes a deep breath of horror. ""So you mean ... I'm going to be taking your place?""

The rumbling lull of the subway train teased and threatened Mickey's senses, daring him to rest his head against the cracked vinyl of his seat just for a moment... he was vaguely aware of the fact that he was the only one there, at least for the next few minutes, but still he didn't dare allow himself to close his eyes, although the very thought of it caused him to tingle and twitch in ways that would make him blush furiously for days. A hot flush crept up the back of his neck as he stared at his reflection in the window opposite him, and for a brief moment he fantasized that he was staring at someone else... someone who hadn't slept for a long, long time... someone who needed it *bad*.

*""Next stop... Kendall...""*, the perky recorded voice announced over the intercom, but Mickey didn't notice it at all. He was focused on the very last stop, Alewife... well, as focused on it as he could be given the number of pills he had taken to keep him awake today. He was trying to be good... really... but the temptation was *everywhere*, and it was eating him up alive!   

It wasn't even safe to walk down the street anymore... there was one store on Newbury Street that made Mickey's palms sweat just thinking about it. It was a furniture store, one of those yuppie-class boutiques with shit that was way too good for anyone and lamps that cost more than his damn TV and stereo combined. But... *oh*... the window display... there were pillows *everywhere*... satin pillows, velvet pillows... big plump ones that could have cushioned half his body. And beyond that, there were all sorts of throws, everything you could imagine. Mickey would pass by that store every day and openly stare. He couldn't believe they were allowed to show all of that in public, right in front of God and everyone! One time, he caught his reflection in the window as he licked his lips salaciously but he wasn't the least bit embarrassed. Even now, sitting alone on the subway at just past midnight on a Tuesday morning, he couldn't give a damn if he wanted to.. he fantasized about deep, indulgent slumber... Mickey knew it was wrong but he was powerless to fight off those gnawing, primal urges. There was no doubt about it. The pills were keeping him awake, but they weren't doing a damn thing for his addiction.

*""Next stop... Harvard Square...""*, the recording barked as the train dragged to a lazy stop. Mickey stared ahead through the window, absentmindedly scratching his palms and trying to imagine what all those students were doing on and off campus... dorms filled with snoring, snuggling, napping... the thought of it caused him to twitch a little and squirm in his seat, as though each and every one of them knew that he was thinking about them *that way*, and  a thin sigh of relief escaped his lips as the train pulled out of the station and headed towards its next stop.   

There was a time, not long ago, when he would have kept his needs all to himself, just hid in his apartment, caffeine and pills in hand, and tried to play by the rules. But now... now he was starting to question who made the rules, and whether or not they even existed in the first place. It wasn't like he was hurting anyone, right? It's not like he was one of those transients at the T stops, nodding off in dark, smelly corners like filthy inbred beasts, oblivious to who might see them. Naw, at least he was in control... he handled himself appropriately.   

Yeah, maybe there were a few times when he could have used better judgment, like that time he was at the public library and was so aroused by the peaceful, quiet rooms and the overstuffed leather furniture that he curled up with a book in front of his face and napped... *in public*  for nearly a goddamn *hour*!  Oh, the mere recollection of his indiscretions conjured a shameful, prickly heat that crawled all over his body and caused him to reflexively stare down at his sneakers, as if he were standing outside his own body and glaring with shame at himself. He was careless.. way too careless... he could have easily been caught by anyone! Mickey wouldn't let that happen again, though. This time.. this time he had a safe place to go. It would be alright, where he was going. He could finally satisfy his needs, the way it was always *meant* to be done. The thought of it made his heart jump into his throat, just for a minute. He was finally going to sleep like a *bitch*.

Write a story about a sleepaholic.",MasterOfNap,"I came home and stripped out of my lingerie, slipping into my pjs. I was pissed as hell. Why do people treat sleeping like some kind of intimate, special thing? Co-napping was like a handshake for me. 

I went into my room and turned on a white noise machine. Looks like I would be putting myself to sleep again. I went out tonight looking for some action, but the guy I picked up turned out to be a dud. He got nervous and we ended up banging in his apartment instead of sleeping. I was utterly exhausted. 

Still, I was wide awake in my bed. To help myself to fall asleep, I began to think of past naps. 

Once, I lured a married guy into my house for a nap. I told him we would just have sex, but I gave him some tea and he was out like a light. I took some pictures before going to bed myself, so I still have some blackmail if needs be. 

Once I ditched my little sister in a Victoria's Secret to go take a nap in a mattress store. I got kicked out for lewd behavior in public, but what did they expect?

Once I fell asleep at a bus stop, right next to a ad of a sleepy-eyed girl zipping up a tent. Some mother with her kids told me to get a bedroom.

Once I went to the public library and tucked my own private copy of Sleepy Boys into this month's Playboy. Curled up on a chair in a dark corner, I was out like that. 45 minutes later, I was forcibly removed and banned from the library. I finished my nap on the sidewalk in front of the entrance. 

I've been arrested twice. My folks are so ashamed of having a somnomaniac for a daughter. But I haven't really talked to them much anyways, ever since my dad kicked me out when he discovered me co-napping in my room with a girl. My mom was pretty cool with it, but my dad and his favorite mistress were furious. Her sister is a bisleeper, and she told my dad all these gross stereotypes about us. Not that I've been one to disprove the stereotypes, but I am more of an exception then the norm.

Anyways, I've lived on my own since I was 17, but I didn't really mind. It was easier to sleep with people when I had my own place.

Finally, I drifted off.",finnthefrog

             ""The closed eyes. They Dont See.""

I did it again today, it was only during a break from work. There was no one around to see, I think I am safe. 

Eagerly sitting at the office waiting for clients to step onto the lot, I felt rather refreshed. My coworkers sat around looking at pictures of woman sleeping; on carpets, silk sheets, near the beach, on a boat. I always looked away knowing that if anyone knew I sympathized with Sleepers, my picturesque facade would give and Id be no better than tw rest. If only they knew that Id slept; on breaks from lunch, at work in my car, and even at night when patrols shined spot lights into windows looking for reaction. My addiction was mine and mine only, my wife who I adore, shared sleep with me on a few different instances. She'd complain, "" I just think too much, there are visions, dreams that project these insecurites from the back of my mind. I feel powerless. Sleep is for addicts. I am not an addict."" She always thought too much anyway, Jessy did. 

I went on with this double life for months, just delving ever so deeply into my subconscious. Looking for answers to quandrys that would have been impossible otherwise. On one fateful June day in the blaring son of the Austin sky, I decided to forgo my usual rituals of sleeping and home and instead decided to sleep in my car near the the tree Id used before. The sun shone brightly through my tinted windshield,its illegal but fuck 'em, I reclined the leather seat and slid on my polarized sunglassed. It was virtually impossible to see my eyes, an unmarked crown victoria crept through the parking lot. An otherwise odd event, patrols generally circled when the sun set. ""TAP TAP TAP!"" The unmistakable sound of anodized aluminum banging against my driver window. I awoke in a state of panic, this had never happened before, Id never thought of getting caught, Id take proper precautions to avoid being busted...but here we were. Eyes blooshot, speech slowed, ""Afternoon Patrolman, what can I do for you?"" Id finally been able to focus in on his glimmering gold badge which had ""Closed Eyes in Death Only"" and his name Patrolman Patton. 

"" Sir, Im going to need your identification and Im going to need you to step out of your vehicle!"" 

""Patrolman Patton can I just know what this is about? I am in my car on a conference call, I was just trying to find a little privacy. "" 

""Sir Im going to need you to produce the correct identification or I will have to use force to remove you from the scene of the crime!"" 

""CRIME?! Patrolman their is no crime here, I am a man simply looking for some privacy in order to take an important phone call!"" 

He radioed, "" Dispatch Im going to need a back up unit at the car lot on Drowning Street, there is a man refusing to cooperate with an investigation!"" The static replied confirming his need for back up, at this point I realized that this situation would not get any better if I continued to resist. 

""PATROLMAN Patton I am slowly removing myself from the vehicle and retrieving my Id from my wallet, there is no need for backup, I just don't know what Ive done?!"" I yelled as I slowly opened the door. His hand immediately cup on the top of his academy issued hand gun, he was younger looking man with slender build and receding hairline. The veins in his forearm bulged as the tension filled stare down continued. It was obvious he had not dealt with this many times before. 

He sat me on the curb, having cuffed me for his own ""Safety"" he claimed. Once we were both over the initial shock he began to describe why this was taking place. He said there had been an anonymous tip that placed a bearded gentleman sleeping in his burgandy sedan. He continued speak, ""These tips are handled with the upmost seriousness, we will be investigating the scene for the next few hours and you will be detained until it is proven that you are innocent or guilty. During this time the vehicle will go into our impound lot and you will be questioned at the precint. A lawyer cannot and will not be able to help if you are found guilty. Sleep is a frivolous crime that needs to be irradicated.""

 By that time the entire office had come outside and it seemed like all work stopped. For I was in the eye of the storm and soon enough I would understand that this was simply the beginning",bmatt1208

*""Next stop... Alewife...""*, the recorded voice announced, and Mickey licked his chapped lips again convulsively. This was the last stop... and this is where he needed to be. He'd heard about this place through the grapevine... it sounded too good to be true, honestly, but he was a desperate man with an itch to scratch and he was willing to take a chance. He jumped out of his seat and pressed against the door with sweaty palms before the train screeched to a complete stop. it wasn't just a quick jog up a few steps... he was on the ground floor of a huge multi-story parking garage surrounded by flat, bland buildings and for a moment Mickey feverishly wondered if he would even know what to look for. The street was virtually empty, save for a few taxis and a non-descript white and blue delivery truck parked directly across from the garage, unassuming under the yellow, dirty street light.

He squinted his eyes to make out something on the truck, and once he saw it he breathed sharply inward and furtively looked around, his paranoid nature only enhanced by the three tablets of stimulants and 20 oz. bottle of Coke he consumed in vain before hopping on the Red Line. A small symbol just above the red reflector on the tail end of the truck, right on the corner... the silhouette of a crescent moon wearing a night cap. Naughty, naughty, *naughty*.   

Mickey shoved his clammy hands into the front pockets of his jacket and attempted to casually saunter across the street to the driver, whom he could only make out in murky shadows, the soft orange glow of a lit cigarette dangling precariously. Although he couldn't see the driver's face, Mickey was certain he (or she?) could smell the aura of lecherous hunger that surrounded him. He was sure of it. Cautiously approaching the driver's side door, he peered up at the shadowy figure and hesitated for a moment. Before he could open his mouth, the lit cigarette swayed in his general direction. ""You lookin' to take a trip somewhere?"", a wheezing voice dripping with South Boston resilience whispered hoarsely.  ""Uh... yeah... where you goin'?"", Mickey whispered back. The shadowy figure shook his head, the cigarette swinging wildly. He reached across the cab and opened the door for Mickey in response.   

Before he could come to his senses and change his mind, Mickey found himself riding shotgun in the delivery truck, directly towards a derelict industrial area filled with burned-out factories and flat-roofed, rectangular workshops and dull, unremarkable, squat little offices and garages, all crammed together in a concrete oasis of faded fluorescent lights and streets lined with crushed glass and rubbish. The driver said nothing, and neither did Mickey. There was no need. They both knew what he was there for.  

At the far corner of the industrial area, there stood a single-story building unlike anything else around it. Mickey could see a soft, persistent, soothing bluish-violet glow emanating from it from a quarter of a mile away, and his mouth and throat went dry in sheer anticipation. The building was edged with long florescent bulbs all the way around the top and was no bigger than an IHOP, and it was made of fat, smooth polished tan bricks. As they pulled up to the front door, which was surrounded by thick glass decorative bricks, Mickey noticed that there were no other windows of any kind in the building. Now he was *certain* that he knew what he was in for. He jumped out of the truck and quietly shut the door behind him, not even bothering to thank the driver.

Mickey hesitated at the door for a moment when he realized that he couldn't make out anything past it. The door was made of a thick frosted glass that distorted everything behind it, and he pressed his face against it and peered dimly, but could see nothing but hazy, diffused light and bluish-tinted walls. Rubbing his hands together nervously, he gingerly pulled the door open and stepped inside.   

The front room of the building resembled a pleasantly decorated, perfectly square waiting room.  The walls were painted the most serene shade of cerulean blue his feverish mind could fathom, and understated cone-shaped wall sconces made of brushed brass lit the room, two sconces on each wall. Two huge overstuffed couches upholstered in a soft olive-toned velvet rested against the walls in the left corner, smothered in smooth, cushy pillows. Directly across from the couches was a countertop that wrapped around the corner, with a doorway behind it. As Mickey took in his relaxing surrounding and fought the urge to curl up on one of the couches, he noticed the tranquilizing, low-fidelity elevator music piping through speakers that he couldn't for the life of him place anywhere. Normally Mickey would find it a bit over-stimulating and would try to avoid it out of sheer shame when in public, but right now, in a place like this, it was *perfect*.   

He stood numbly in the middle of the room's perverse decadence, not sure what he should do or where he should go next, when a bland-looking petite woman stepped out of the doorway behind the countertop, her bleached-blonde pixie cut tousled in a perfect bed-head style, little red pillow creases on her cheeks. *She just woke up from a nap!*, Mickey mused dazedly. Just looking at her body in those oversized striped pajamas, with her hair messed up perfectly, drove him absolutely wild with erotic energy, and he fumbled to wipe a bead of sweat that dripped from the nape of his hair down his neck as he gawked nakedly at her.   

""Well, hello there... you look like a man who needs to get some shut-eye!"", she purred. Mickey said nothing in response, but instead reached for his wallet. He already knew how much it would cost, but she told him anyway... $200 an hour for all the sleep he could get, and the first hour is free for new customers ""And guys like you who look like they could use a little extra"", she added with a saucy wink. After taking $800 from him, she lifted the edge of the countertop and stepped through, then led him down a long dim hallway lit only with strips of bright blue LED lights. There was only one door in this hallway, at the very end, and Mickey's imagination ran wild at the thought of what he might find behind it.

The pixie girl opened the door and Mickey stepped inside. More low-fi musak was emanating from... somewhere... but it was even more soothing, and he could feel himself ready to nod off just from listening to it. The room was vast, windowless, with a low ceiling and soft blue walls, the same color as the front lobby. Soft unassuming night lights were plugged in along the walls here and there, and the floor was covered in enough pillows, mattresses and blankets to satisfy the deepest, darkest nocturnal needs of any sleepaholic. As Mickey's eyes adjusted to the dim light, he saw anonymous figures, snuggly and snoring, scattered all around the room and for a moment, he was a bit put off by satisfying his most base needs in front of others, but the lure of the softness and quiet was far too much to resist. He curled up in a corner, away from the others, and propped his head against a pile of pillows, his need for sleep finally satiated.

*Best damn $800 I ever spent...* he mumbled to himself as he closed his eyes, his body growing heavy and numb. It was going to be a good week.

It was nice, granted, but somewhat confusing.  Last thing I'd known I was practicing for the game.

""Michael Lastner, welcome,"" someone was standing over my bed.  White coat, stethoscope, even a reflector on a band above their head.  It's like they'd read about what a doctor was and decided to dress up like one.

""Michael?""  I asked.  Whoever my hosts were, they'd gotten my name wrong.

""Yes,"" the doctor said, ""It may take some time for you to adjust.  Most people have memories of an afterlife, but that's all they are:  memories.  Formed under both the trauma of death and as an artifact of the neural re-building we use to bring you back to life in this body.""

This body was not my body.  It most definitely was *not* my body.

""I don't understand,"" I said.  ""I'm not dead.""

Someone else was in the room, and he became visible now.  Black robes, grey hair, white collar that was mostly obscured by the robes, and a book in one hand.  Priest, then.  ""I know this is a confusing time, my child,"" the priest said.  ""I can answer many questions for you?""

""Why does it look like you're dressed up for a costume party?""  I asked.

The doctor chuckled.  ""It's a reassuring sight for most people.  Fashions nowadays tend to be... disorienting for people who aren't used to them.""

I frowned.  ""You mean the moving tattoos or the display-clothes?  I'm not a backwards kid from the countryside, I've lived in Mumbai for a decade now.""

That, for whatever reason, seemed to shock them.  The priest especially seemed worried, but it was the doctor who spoke up.  ""You've seen these things in your afterlife?""  he asked.

""What afterlife?""  I asked.  ""I know that playing football isn't the safest of sports but I don't think I got hit on my head that bad.  Hell, last I remember I wasn't even playing.""

""Michael,"" the doctor said, and why did he keep calling me that?  ""What is the last thing you remember.""

""Locker room,"" I stated simply.  ""I was changing clothes.  What happened, did I slip and fall or something?""

""And what is your name?""  The doctor asked.

""I'm Radha Madhavi, midfield for Mumbai City FC,"" I said.  I wasn't sure they'd believe that, what with this strange male body I was in.  The whole out-of-body-but-in-another-body thing ought to have bothered me more; I suspected they were using an artificial calmer.

""That's a real person,"" the priest had said.  He hadn't consulted anything physical to look that up, but I'd caught the telltale twitch of the eye that meant he was looking up something online.

He had an internet implant, but this body apparently didn't.  Something else I was going to have to fix.

""I'm going to need to call in some more experts,"" the doctor said in what he probably thought was a reassuring tone.  He left.

The priest hesitated, then approached me.  ""We're alone.  Tell me, Radha, do you remember Michael Lastner?""

The weird thing was that I did.  Ever since I'd heard the name, strange memories that weren't my own had been surfacing.  ""He was an... accountant?  He died in 2017.  Thirty years ago?""

The priest was consulting the internet.  ""Your wikipedia page doesn't have your birth date on it, but I'm guessing it was around February 19, 2017""

A chill ran through me.  ""How did you know that?""

""That's the day Michael Lastner died,"" the priest was growing visibly nervous.  ""Radha, this is very important.  Our project has detailed records of everyone it freezes.  Mr. Lastner indicated on his form that he was agnostic.""

I shook my head.  ""No,"" I said.  ""I don't know how I know this, okay?  This is crazy.""

""Please,"" the priest said.

""A few years before he died... before I died?""  I looked up at the priest for confirmation, but he just gestured for me to keep going.  ""We visited a temple in India.  We converted to Buddhism.""

The priest looked over his shoulder, presumably to check whether we were still alone.  Then he spoke:  ""They're not believers, Radha.  They don't think we're actually pulling people from the afterlife, they believe what they're saying about hallucinations brought on by the experience.  But the Buddhists believe in reincarnation, not a specific afterlife, and your memories are of a real actual person.""

""You believe?""

""I started out like you - like Michael, I mean.  But the interviews I've had with our returnees have, over time, changed my mind.  You... you knew things that Michael has no way of knowing.  The fashions, for instance.  The soccer team; it was founded before Michael's death, for instance, but somehow I doubt he was following it that closely, and he certainly couldn't predict Radha's placement on it years later.  Plus, you've got the modern-day manners not to interrupt someone when they're looking something up on the internet, which you can tell they're doing.  You're not from the past.  You're from the present.""  He sounded like he still didn't quite believe it, but the facts for him were overwhelming.

Me, I just wanted my real body back.

""What happens now?""  I asked.

""We get you out of here,"" the priest said.

""I appreciate the sentiment,"" I replied, ""but you're going to let me go?  You just said I'm proof of everything you believe.""

""And you are,"" the priest said.  ""But there's an even bigger issue at the moment.""

I didn't see it, but the priest apparently had thought this through.

""As far as we can tell,"" he said, ""there is an actual Radha Madhavi living in Mumbai, India, playing in a game scheduled for about an hour from now.""

""Yes?""  I asked.

""Well,"" he said, ""if you're here... then who's there?""",reostra

The air is cold and heavy, it weighs down on my body like an abundance of icy blankets. I'm in my room, half covered in bed sheets, with a faint mid-morning glow pushing in through the curtains. I rollover but I know I can't fall back asleep; today is going to be important. As I walk to my shower, everything feels different. This is my bedroom and this is my routine. What's different, am I getting sick? I can't, not today anyways. I turn the cold metallic handle and wait for my shower to heat up; I shift a weeks worth of dirty laundry from my bed to the floor, forming a place to sit. I look around my disheveled room taking in the piles of unclean clothes in the corner along with the picture frame above my desk. It's a picture from last summer, our trip to Tennessee, Mom, Dad, and, my girlfriend. Maggie. Shit, I almost forgot to message her. I feel like we never see each other as much since I lost my job but today I have big plans. Steam begins to fill my room, along with the smell of mom cooking. She always made the best breakfast. 

I finish my shower. My skin red from the heat. I step out to hear someone calling for me downstairs. Hurriedly throwing on a pair of worn out jeans and a t-shirt that barely passed the smell test, I rush down the stairs. The staleness of living room is typical throughout the rest of our house. Dad with his faded brown lazy boy in the corner sitting beside crushed beer cans like they're included in the furniture and Mom with her crooked floral paintings hung against the peeling striped wallpaper. She tries to make the best out of every situation, she hand made the curtains and worked extra shifts at the diner for the color television set. I loved her.

The smell of bacon and eggs make me sit down at the table instantly. A plate sparsely littered with pancakes, eggs, and two pieces of bacon sat down in front of me with a uncharacteristic smile. She knew what I have planned for tonight. Before I could take a bite, I'm pulled from reality, away from the table and away from everything. It's cold again. Much colder than the last time. My vision is blurry, almost nonexistent. My eyes are open but nothing is within focus and I can't move them. I strain everything in my body to break free. Nothing. I am stuck here. Thirty or so minutes go by and I can feel the IV placed in my lower arm. I start to make out people, people with lab coats pacing around me. It's all coming back to me now, the mistake I made a long time ago. It feels like mere seconds have past but I realize now what has happened. I'm being unfrozen because they found a cure for what ended my life. No. I don't want this. I struggle even more; trying to tell them to stop but no noise can escape my lips.

I read my information from a computer screen along the length of the wall:

**Patient:** C-833

**Age:** 68

**Cause of Death:** Intentional Self Harm.

**Notes:** Needs lower body replacement and intensive therapy.

**Contacts:** N/A.


I want to go back home. Back to where my family is still alive, back to the happiest day of my life. Just back. Please God.

Dr. Eller was kindly and old - somewhere on the other side of 50 at least. But she was also fit and trim, with a mesmerizing bun of swirling silver hair and an enormous bust that strained against her yellow cardigan.

She smiled at me. ""Because of the erections?""

I gulped, hot fire coursing up the back of my neck to my face. ""What? Hey. Uh. No. It's. Uh.""

""You have recovered, Miles. You are ready. Certain changes, however, are permanent, and certain symptoms will follow you for a long, long time."" She stood up, gesturing towards door. ""It's not easy - going back. But your family is waiting. They're very excited to see you.""

""But..."" I stayed in the chair. ""But what about other...kids. What do I do about other kids.""

""Well, you aren't really a child any more,"" said Dr. Eller. ""And neither are your peers. I can't tell you how to conduct yourself going forward. Your isolation was purely for your own safety and the wellbeing of others. I would simply remind you that your peers have all experienced the same things you have experienced. The footing is equal. No matter how strange you may feel, you are no different than any of them.""

That worked, at least well enough to get me out of the chair. ""But, the um..."" I coughed, motioning downward with my head.

""You know, someday you will be an old man and you will look upon that particular curse with great fondness,"" said Dr. Eller. ""Again - normal. Try not to overthink these things.""

My parents were older, but that was to be expected. Dad was slightly gray at the temple. Mom was slightly heavier and a bit stooped. But they both looked well and they were both happy to see me. Sydney and Fin weren't there. 

""Are they...?""

Mom nodded. ""Fin's been in about a year now. Syd just went in last week.""

""She was very *early*,"" said my father ruefully, like it was a thing my sister had done on purpose.

""It's just the three of us for now,"" said Mom. She said it with such strained hopefulness it made me embarrassed for her. How bad had that week without a child been for them?

""There's a class starting next week,"" said my father, pushing us through the door, out towards the car, hurrying back into an everyday life. ""You're registered.""

""Oh,"" I said. I'd been out of school for so long. It was exciting to think about being around boys and girls my age, but also deeply terrifying.

""Is Scott in the class?""

""Scott?"" said my mother.

""Scott Wendle. My best friend? You don't...?""

""We don't know who's in the class,"" said my father, pulling out of the parking lot. ""You'll find out next week.""

Scott wasn't in my class. None of my friends were. Although maybe it was a stretch to call the kids I'd known four years earlier and hadn't seen since ""friends"". What were we, exactly? Familiar strangers. 

And some of my classmates *were* familiar. Cathy Peterson. Will Kushnar. Jun Tozawa. And familiar was all they were. Strange, oblong wraiths. Distorted memories of children I'd once played kickball with. They were handsome and tall and matted in zits, full figured and bird-legged and screwed tight with anxiety. We tried smiling at each other as we passed, rushing away, back to the safety of isolation. Some were bolder than others. We hated those ones.

We hardly remembered anything from before the Change. Our lessons fell backwards through time, pulling at the tangled threads of American History and Human Anatomy and Long Division, digging deep for the mother lode, for the hidden artifact that would bring it all back to the surface. Digging and pulling and failing. Then starting over. It was humiliating. But we didn't remember. So we learned it all again, and again we wondered what the purpose was.

My voice was steady, but nothing else seemed all that different from my days of isolation. My body still reacted independent of my desires. Or, I suppose, my desires acted independent of my brain. I had a locker next to Rima Bloodmoon. We never talked. We could hardly bear to look at each other, though I could *hear* our individual hearts pounding madly whenever we stood in close proximity. I brushed her shoulder by accident, apologizing profusely. But I remembered that *feeling* for ages after. The weight of her. The warmth. I played it over and over. I clutched it like a child's teddy bear, that memory.

We had all borne a similar trauma, and yet we all felt utterly incompatible with one another. I tried to remember what Dr. Eller had told me, but it meant nothing to me then. 

Had I really been cured? How was I any different than the dangerous boy I had been just months earlier? I could not see the difference. I don't think any of us could. And so we were afraid - of each other and ourselves.

Fin died. My brother. That is always a possibility, they say, when afflicted children go into isolation. The Change impacts us all in slightly different ways. And it had been too much for my younger brother. He couldn't stand to become something new. I understand that, I suppose. He had loved what he was. He had loved being a boy. He had loved the sun and the clouds and the grass and the ants and the wind. He had loved his own imagination. And they are very clear about those things when you are in isolation. They explain quite well how you change and those things change and your relationship is never the same. How you cannot love the sun. How you cannot love clouds. How you *appreciate* these things and what that difference means. 

I can see how Fin would prefer to stay a boy forever. But it still hurts. Because while I would like to believe that Fin got his wish - that he is young and free and a boy forever - I am no longer a boy and so I know that he is simply dead. Because that is the first thing you learn in isolation. He is dead. He is not a boy. And neither am I.

I am going to ask Rima to date me tomorrow. To spend time with me. I have been thinking about it quite a lot and decided that this is what an adult would do. They would go on dates. They would say pleasant things. Find a partner. Start a family. 

I am an adult. I was cured months ago. Although I don't feel cured, I have a certificate that says otherwise. So - I am an adult. And I intend to act like one.",WinsomeJesse

I am wearing come  cheap dirty rags, I'll never come back. I'll never get use to these wears. I am a man who loved a good suit and tie. But still I feel like it is a needed sacrifice for a little fresh air and a little excitement.

 I always thought that when my company took over the world six hundred years, that it would be fulfilling. That I would be happy. I wasn't, it grew painfully boring. While others were able to leave this realm, I foolishly had became immortal thanks to the work of the top chemists. 

My name, Chief of State, Lord, Master, Emperor, Father or as colleagues would call me in days long gone, Jack. I ruled these lands for centuries. 

But I grew bored. I had wanted to created a Utopia, I lived during a time when crisis and suffering were common. My father came from Saudi Arabia looking for a better life. I knew very much about suffering, we were poor. It was only due to my Intelligence that I was able to overcome my poor heritage. 

When I took over the world's nations in the 2050's. Strife and pain was everywhere. I thought that if I could make life as easy as possible, everyone would be at peace.

There was peace, but no happiness. Under my rule, the earth became a corporate police state. Everything was regulated, I wanted everyone to be the same. No differences. Everything was ordered and organized, all things were decided by my council. 

But I too, as stated, felt bad for what I had done. It became clear one day two centuries  ago when I was watching the fish of my tank. 

""I had turned mankind into fish. Unfree. Mindless. Soulless. Enslaved. I've failed us"" I thought . 

But that was when I realized that I needed to end it. But my A.I council would run things with or without me. I needed a plan. 

I decided that best way to create chaos was to anger the people. So I tricked my A.I to pass cruel and evil acts. People were killed in their home. People were forced to fight in arenas. All of the wealth they had gained, gone in one intentional economic crash. People had more or less had gone back to the dark ages. Swords were common in small local villages.  

And soon enough, a young girl named Angelius claimed that her mother, the goddess Eve was here to reclaim the earth from evil. She has quickly grown followers. She was a passionate, powerful, and chivalrous woman. 

I've been meeting her in person. And even though I am myself irreligious. I am now joining the cause against myself, by me of course I mean you. Employee 69123-12F.

Sloppy work... But it had to be done, i have waited too long. It's been  over a month since my last pig. They are all pigs, every last one of them. No more than livestock waiting to be slaughtered. I love this. The final stage. I can feel my own heart pounding in my chest and the pulsing in my ears. I love this. I never feel as alive as at a moment like this. ""When a life passes, my soul is reborn"" i whispered to myself. I slipped through the window  into the kitchen. I need something to stop the bleeding.  The excitement was getting to me. I have been following her for so long. It is getting harder to contain myself. I need this.

I found a towel, wrapped it around my hand and tightened it to put some pressure on it. It wouldn't stop the bleeding completely, but i couldn't wait any longer. I have to do it now. The conditions are perfect. She is perfect and the time is perfect. 

I proceeded towards the stair up to the second floor at a low crouch. ""Screeee."" I whipped my head around. what was that noise? I felt a chill creep up my back as i proceeded towards the sound. ""aaaah!""
A cat sprang out from a room to my right and between my legs. ""Shit."" I hope this fucking cat hasn't ruined everything. I let my breath ease out as i turned back around and walked towards the stairs. I hadn't even realized i had held it.
  
The house was almost pitch black except from a few beams off light from the street lamps getting in through the windows. The blood in my hand was starting to dry as i walked up the stairs, but the pulsing pain continued. I had to be as silent as possible walking up the stairs. It felt like hours. I had to take my time. The house is old, and the stairs creeks at the slightest weight.

""Pfompf!"" I freezed. What was that? That was certainly not the cat. I turned around slowly feeling a presence behind me. Nothing there. Fuck this! Nothing is going according to plan. I finally got up the stairs feeling beads of sweat trailing down my temples. I could hair my pulse in the empty silence. I took a deep breath. I have to finish this.

I was standing in front of the bedroom door. This is it. I can finally relieve myself. ""Tap, tap."" I turned around. Again, nothing there. Am i going crazy? ""Tap, tap."" It was getting louder, closer. ""Who's there?"" Nothing. It was to dark to see more than two feet past my nose. The sound was coming from the end of the hallway. ""Tap, tap."" ""Tap, tap."" The sound was getting closer, and closer. I was hit by a flash of panic. I gotta get out of here. Now! 

I didn't want to run back towards the stairs so i burst open the door to the bedroom. It was empty. What the fuck? I saw her come home earlier. Where could she be? ""Bang!"" The door to the bedroom shut closed behind me. A dark figure appeared in the corner of the room. It looked familiar, a women, just like the rest of them, but dark and twisted. I ran towards the window but something held my hand. The towel around my hand. It felt tighter around my wrist. I pulled as hard as i could but to no avail. The twisted figure pounced towards me then everything got black.

Everything is so bright. Where am i? The bright light was blinding. I looked down at my cut hand and saw a leather strap fastened tight around my wrist holding my hand down to the bed. I looked up and saw a sign on the wall reading ""Wilters hill hospital, psychiatric ward""

You must save your new target, so you can kill them instead.",caprogers19,"The man whom I selected as my prey was running. I found this odd as for the past month that I have been silently stalking him he has showed no sign of being in a hurry or of having noticed me; he had seemed blissfully ignorant and happy walking until tonight.
It started as he went through an unusually dark alley, even for the city at night it was especially dark and I did not dare to follow him down it out of worry he may turn around and notice my rather imposing figure, but as I watched him nervously walking through the shadows from a distance something seemed to reach for him. I told myself it must have been an illusion, some trick of the light; it seemed like the shadows were reaching for him, and I believe he noticed too as he started running.
I am not one to give up so of course I pursued the man and so here we are now, he is looking over his shoulder quite frequently but I doubt he will spot me as I stealthily stalk through the dark streets, nobody else did before it was far too late. 
I am almost startled as I hear the man scream and witness him sprinting off down the street and around the corner, I definitely saw it this time, a shadow reached out from the ground towards the man's feet. 
Making sure to keep up my pace I now ponder this mysterious darkness that seems set on claiming my victim; I have seen what I believe to be true evil and darkness throughout my life. However I have never truly witnessed anything that can compare to the events from my childhood. Perhaps tonight I shall finally find something to compare that I did not in the last victims eyes before they glazed over with the sweet release of death. I grin and follow my prey into the mysteriously malicious shadows, his only escape from life and the pursuing darkness will be my blade.

Heading the rear of the event brings Hitler himself in his classic Mercedes-Bens 770. Its gleam fails to mirror the blood of countless of deaths that already bathes his hands. I have somehow escaped those same pits that have claimed so many of my family members. Another face in the crowd, I try so hard to blend in and seem enthusiastic to be blessed with his appearance as so much of the crowd is. It's becoming really hard on it's own to recognize the cheerful from the fearful. His attempt to soften the attacks made earlier in the month in France seems almost transparent. The parade makes the end of it's mark at one of his favorite hotels. A hotel I had so conveniently applied and employed at three years prior.  After a rousing speech of pride and conquer, the crowd cheers with an ovation that makes me utterly nauseous. How can these people cheer for this man? Yet, I cheer along to continue my disguise. I cheer for myself as well. As Hitler enters the hotel for this night, I expect it to be his last night.

However, His mightiness, his notorious, is well guarded with several check points. While making several attempts at different passages, I am turned away by several guards that surround his room like the attraction around a nucleus. With simple excuses of bringing him food or women, I hoped to not rise too much suspicion. I may have pushed my luck however. One guard asked me to stay while he radioed in others. They had spoken of my previous attempts to gain access to his room and my time had come. A quick dash down the hall lead me to a bathroom just south of his room. As I slammed the door behind me, breathless, I'm overcome by the sense of failure. I had waited so long for this opportunity to make a difference. To avenge my family and the Jewish people. How could I let them down. As this fear drowns me, I realize that I am not alone in this bathroom.

Standing at the sink, washing his hands is Hitler himself. Still unable to wash the blood from his hands. He glances at me with a bit of surprise but nothing more. He can see my eyes wide as though I'm staring at the devil himself. I slip the knife out of my coat pocket but unable to take a single step. His eye, so calm, so sharp, begin to stab me instead. He slowly walks up to me with a calmness of a man walking out of the bathroom. He's within a foot from me, just staring at me. I'm frozen. As though he was medusa, I've been turned into stone. He slowly loosens the knife from my hand and drops it to the floor. With one arm, he nudges me aside and like someone who is hypnotized, i follow dutifully. Tears streaming down my face, I can't do it. I couldn't anything. Before he exits the bathroom, He takes a small glance towards me of almost pity. As he leaves, Several officers rush into the bathroom to find me crying on the floor. A pool of tears begun wear a pool of blood soon followed. ",WriteOnceAWeek

""Muggles"" we were called in the old days, and our counterparts, were powerful magical beings that dealt with other magical beings.

In fact most of our earthquakes and random forest fires were apparently caused by their fights with a so called ""Voldemort"". I knew instantly to bring this to the high council, tell them of my new found discovery.

""Everyone! I bring new discoveries, and new information on our ancestors past lives!"" I shouted, as everyone turned their heads I knew I had their attention.

""So he is a God?"" the man asked, ""It seems he is, we shall construct an altar to honor this god, this being"" I declared. The crowd had a nod of approval. ""We shall make copies of these sacred books and share them with the rest of the world,and bring our greatest scholars together and go on a crusade to find these wizards!"" The crowd cheered and applauded, some volunteered on the spot to go on this expedition, and the rest were content with staying and helping with the construction of the monuments.

I had my craftsman Larry, dull but good with tools, Sally, the philosopher who sought the sacred stone of the first holy book, Jack, our hunter and gatherer, Gary and myself were the navigators.

"[WP]After both of your parents have passed away, you return to your childhood home to finally open a bedroom door that for as long as you remember had remained locked.",facts_of_tv,"The house was never as big, when I pulled up in front of it, as it seemed in my memories. When I was a child it was a palace fit for kings and queens. Now it was just a rambling old building of red brick and Tudor black and white in a quiet village in north Cheshire.  Quiet and lonely behind its walls and trees, its rooms full of dust and memory. 

I parked my car on the gravel driveway and approached the front door, my finger hovering over the doorbell before I remembered, and the pain of it hit me like a punch in the stomach. Dad passed away six years ago and I didn’t miss him, I hardly even knew him. But losing Mum was like losing a part of my soul.

I reached into my pocket for the key and opened the door.

Everything looked just the same as it did last time I was here, before she had the stroke.  It smelt a bit; musty from being closed and empty for six weeks. And cold. 

The living room, like the rest of the house, was neat and tidy except for a magazine and a half-empty cup on the coffee-table, the drink inside curdled and mouldy. She was sitting right here when it happened.  I picked up the cup, took it to the kitchen and emptied it in the sink. A vase of wilted flowers sat on the windowsill and I sighed as I dropped them into the bin. Mum always loved Chrysanthemums.

She and I were very close, as mothers and sons often are. Even after work took me to London, I would visit most weekends and talk to her on the phone every other day. With no other children to occupy her attention, and with Dad already gone, I guessed she was lonely up here on her own.

I went upstairs and opened the door to my own room, where I would sleep when I stayed overnight.  Some of the mementos of my childhood were still there. Books I couldn’t bear to part with but had no room for in my poky little Camden flat.  The trophies I won for athletics in school. A photo of me at the beach with my first girlfriend. I didn’t even remember her name.

I dropped my backpack on the floor and turned to go back downstairs, then my attention was caught by the door at the end of the hall.  The door to the room that was always locked.  Mum always refused to tell me why and over the years we’d joked about it. She was harbouring a body in there. Or it was her sex dungeon where she would take clients for a whipping. Or her secret lair from which she conducted the life of a super-criminal. But she never told me the truth.

I found the key in her bedroom. It still felt wrong to be searching through her drawers, her personal possessions, even though technically it was all mine now.  It was an old-fashioned brass key with a small pink ribbon tied to the top. I sat staring at it for a long time.

What right do I have, to go prying into my mother’s personal secrets? She kept the truth from me for a reason; whether that reason was right or wrong it was important to her, and was it wrong for me to break her trust like this?

But a practical side of me took over. I must sell the house. I must empty it. All of it, even this room.

With a pounding heart I put the key into the lock, turned it, and slowly opened it.  What I saw in there almost broke my heart.

It was a nursery.

All decorated in pink; an old-fashioned cot with pink sheets. Rows of cuddly toys, dusty but otherwise looking almost new, untouched. Pictures from Beatrix Potter all over the walls; Peter Rabbit, Jemima Puddleduck, Squirrel Nutkin.  Everything was old and yet at the same time, still new.  

I picked up one of the toys, a fluffy white rabbit, and brushed the dust off it. Its orange glass eyes seemed to smile at me.

On the dresser, there was a faded photograph in a frame of my mother when she was much younger, holding a baby. Beside the photograph was a candle, half burned down. And beside that, a white card with a picture of a dove embossed on the front.

I opened the card and read the words.

*“In loving memory.  Emily Jane Townsend. 4th June 1972 – 16th January 1973.”*

A sister. An older sister, gone years before I was born.

I sank to the ground, buried my face in the rabbit’s fur and I wept.

""Are you okay Donna?""  A raspy voice asked from across the room.    

""Nothing, nothing I'm fine"" I shouted back earnestly. I didn't need them coming to interrupt my baby.    

""She's still trying to have them enjoy her work."" Sandy said to Phil. She sipped her coffee slowly watching from a far. She had the kind of notch on her eyebrows I had considered devilish since I was a child. Her left one was raised in that mock-exasparation anyone trying to sell their idea to skeptics must have faced sooner or later.    

""Don't be pouring your heart and soul into it Donna, too many wake up.""  Phil said as he walked back to his place.  

I ignored them. I know we all had started together, but clearly we were on different paths. They viewed dream-stirring as some punch-the-clock job, for me it was a work of art.   
 
I leaned in as we got into the best part. Max was an eldritch god named Cthulhu, ruling over his galaxy visiting others from time. He had once visited earth and had an affair with a terran Sasquatch. For him it was a short summer tryst but she had wanted more.  Reluctant to be tied down so early in his deity life he had left not knowing she carried his child. For years she had roamed the earth crying out at night for Cthulhu to come back, so that she could slap on him the child support fit for an eldritch god.  

25 years later she finally had her chance. With their child, chewbacca, in her arm she was walking up to him ready for the confrontation.   

I only wrote it to that point. Max was a lucid dreamer he could take his character from there.    

""Cthulhu!"" she roared out as they marched into his temple with the sanctimony of the son of a god and his mother.  

Cthulhu turned in shock its eight eyes widening. ""Yeti?""  

""Well at least you remember me. It's^been^a^while^since^I^last...""  

I couldn't hear the rest. I looked out to see Max stirring.  

""Noooo!! what the f.."" This was the tenth time. I couldn't bear it. I heard a soft chuckle from behind. Sandy had stayed to watch and she was getting a treat just not the one I planned to give her.  

""Go to sleep! Go to sleep! Go to sleep!"" I said. I was almost in tears.   

""Maybe next time."" Sandy said as she started walking away.  

I had to think of something quick. I appeared in his room with my bag of sand. I poured some on his forehead as I whispered my lullaby. The twisting stopped.   I came closer to his forehead trying to see what I missed.  

""the fuck are you?"" A groggy voice asked.   My heart leaped to my mouth as I realized what I'd just done. In my attempt to keep him asleep I'd woken him up. The implication of what just happened hit me lack a sack of lead as I started wondering who I'd explain this to.

"[WP] Your one of the guys who write the scripts for the dreams people have while sleeping. You got the latest ""time slot"" and are getting fed up by people waking up before the end of your masterpieces!",fallout4boy,"Sometimes I wish I could write my own dreams. To bad it doesnt work like that because last night, I got one of Rick's. Rick's dreams are downright terrible. He always gives you a gun but the triggers are to heavy to pull. Really Rick? So you just want me to stand there, squeezing as hard as I can on that gun while the bus hurtles toward me. They're sadistic really, when you think about it. You get hit by the bus or whatever he wrote in there and you wake up from the shock. It might be 5am or it might be 1am. I'm glad I can go right back to sleep but I pity those who cant. 

It takes quite an imagination and a good ability to read people to get a job a Dremeco. It's not all sex dreams here like it is at NuSlumber. I tried NuSlumber once. Got a dream with my cousin in it. Cancelled that subscription real quick. I tried Morpheus too, but it ate into my salary real deep. The dreams were nice and introspective, subtly hinting at you to move on. That really helped me move on after a bad breakup. But most people cant afford Morpheus and dont want their sexuality called into question with NuSlumber, so they come here. 

When I clock in, the first thing I check are yesterday's statistics. Average heart rate: low. Good. Suspenseful dreams are not my department. Oxytocin release: high. Well that's not my department either so I might have to cut back on some love triggers. Premature wake percentage: 46%. Jesus Murphy! That's a 10% increase from yesterday. I started this week with 19%. What is going on? I'm going to be hearing from the department manager today for sure. 

There is nothing I can do about my current slot. I cant write even one new scenario before the customers in this slot lie down to sleep. They're getting this bad batch and I feel terrible about it. I could push them off onto somebody else, but that would draw too much attention to me and if word got out that I'm slipping, I can kiss my future position at Morpheus goodbye. 

Rick works in the suspense department so his wake percentage is always high. If his wake percentage was 46%, he would be sobbing in a corner out of shame. I work in the social department. I build dreams that feature your family, friends, and co-workers. People dont want to wake up from these dreams prematurely. These dreams are for party people, fun people. The scenarios I've been writing lately, I suspect, have been too adventurous. I put too many variables that could have been filled by something not pleasant in the customers subconscious. That happens, unfortunately.

But the low average heart rate is concerning. This means there are surprises in the dream. I dont put ""plot twist"" surprise triggers in the scenarios. There are unpredictable triggers that I put in there, though, to pepper up the scenario and make it a little unpredictable. I put them in the environmental, speech, and event queues to always have a new situation come up. But they shouldnt be causing any kind of dangerous event in the dream. Unless they are. 

I pull up the build for the ""wild card"" trigger. In the speech queue it can make anybody say something crazy which is terrible fun. I've gotten lots of positive feedback on conversations. A ""wild card"" in the environmental queue *could* cause something like a flood or earthquake but I should see a higher average heart rate if that is the case. Which leaves the event queue. Events are things like your high school crush showing up in a dream or just as likely, Godzilla. 

Now, I have to do the detective work of comparing what changed this week from last week in my scenarios. Nothing much really changes. The setting is always someplace social like a hotel or a bar. You always have a decent mix of people you see regularly and people you havent seen in a while. *What did I do different this week?* It's driving me crazy. 

Maybe it's not me.

*What changed about my users?* By the time I realize this could be affecting my results, my shift was half over. I should've had 2 or 3 new scenarios by now. Then comes the moment I was hoping wouldnt happen today. The department manager is out of his office. But instead of coming straight for me, he addresses the whole department. He starts off by ordering us to not push out any new scenarios. Then he tells us the whole building and company is shut down. He says there is evidence of tampering. This might be bad. ",hammerjam

"[WP] Your one of the guys who write the scripts for the dreams people have while sleeping. You got the latest ""time slot"" and are getting fed up by people waking up before the end of your masterpieces!",fallout4boy,"Writing dreams is a piece art. I need to know and study my subject for months on end so that I can project their dreams and desires and produce their fears and anxieties. My stories need to inspire feats of awe while remaining grounded to reality enough to suspend disbelief. I don’t write cheap serials in pulp magazines or cheesy Reddit comments filled with dick jokes, I produce honest-to-God art, custom tailored to my subject, who by the end of it, should wake up with an applause on their hands and tears in their eyes. Instead, they just wake up before act 3. 

How am I supposed to create meaningful characters and substantial plots when I can’t predict how long they’ll last? The aspiring novelist has no length requirement and the bold film makers know approximately how long their movies are supposed to show, yet I work with the impossible restriction of not knowing if my subject will finish their fantastical dream or simply wake up and continue with their dreary lives. But enough is enough. I performed the ritual known as the Dark Sacrament with blackened candles and a chant in the ancient language of angels.

Hinged upon the last verse of my chant, all the candles, perfectly lined into a circle, eradicated their flames. As fresh smoke and blackness filled the air, a being stood before me. Known as Hypnos to the ancient Greeks and as the Sandman to my contemporaries, the Lord of Sleep shook the earth around me and sedated me with heavy eyes. As if in a trance, I lied on the cold floor, only dimly aware of the dark figure veiled by the shadows. 

“You are Somnium, an author of dreams and appreciate to my brother, Morpheus,” he spoke in gentle but harsh tones. “Why do you summon me?”

“I want you to cast a spell,” I answered. “On Jonathan Davenport, my subject and white canvas.”

“What spell?” he asked, intrigued. 

“Eternal sleep,” I responded. “He always wakes before my masterpieces complete. I want his mind to be a perpetual theater in which I air my dreams. I want to rule his mind with a never ending cascade of brilliant stories and powerful plots.”

“Interesting,” the shadowy figure spoke with a hint of consideration poised in his voice. “Somnium, I will do you this favor, on one condition.”

“I’m listening,” I called to the Lord of Sleep.

“I shall grant Jonathan rest and you shall write dreams,” he began. “But I shall visit every night. If your dreams please me, I shall extend the spell another day. If, however, I find your dreams dull or uneventful, Jonathan shall wake at the stroke of noon the next day. Understood?”

*****

As Jonathan woke to the sound of a screeching alarm, a dream filled with gods of sleep and dreams loitered in his head for a moment. Turning the alarm off, he gingerly rubbed his eyes and rose from bed, ready to begin another dreary day working in retail. As he dressed, he wondered why his dreams always ended at the best part.

"[WP] After several successful manned trials of the prototypical FTL jump-drive, the ship's science officer makes a startling discovery. Each jump is actually carrying them into an almost identical parallel universe, and the differences are becoming frightening...",freudacious,"Spiders have eight legs. 

I know they used to have ten . No one agrees with me. Wikipedia says eight,  National Geographic says eight.

But I know they had ten.

Two months ago we ran the first test of Kolsky's engine, the first ever working Alcubierre drive.

We strapped the ungainly hunk of rare earth metals and glowing fiber on to the military surplus patrol rocket, and connected the leads. Then we carefully wedged ourselves into the tiny, cramped cockpit: Taaka, Kolsky, Webber. The dedicated team who had brought Alcubierre's dream to reality. And me, the VR driver, fastest neural linkage in the country. The bay robot swung the cradle over to the launching gantry, and with the slightest of taps we were out of the airlock.

I plugged in to the VR drive interface and brought up the navigation systems, gesturing and flicking in that overexaggerated style you see everywhere now.

The drive came to life, the gravity shielding unfolding, the singularity whispering and now roaring in my earbuds. I could feel the drive latch on to the fabric of the space-time continuum: I felt the tugging, clenching, pricking, undulating waves of gravimetric interference build up around me--around the shuttle--around our linked minds, one of sentient carbon neurons, one of unconscious silicon qubits.

I concentrated on the drive, gloved hands bringing up power in a practiced maestro's upbeat. I paused--the boards were all green, the drive had been modeled as extensively as modern computing allowed, but there's always that hidden moment before the action when it seems as though the universe holds its breath--and then, with a decisive downstroke, released the singularity and activated the engine.

I blacked out, almost instantaneously.

There was a roaring in my ears, a whipping, rushing sensation, like I was riding a roller coaster through the upper levels of a city of skyscrapers. As sight and color and comprehension slowly ebbed in, I blinked and looked around. Everyone was staring at their readouts tensely. Every readout was blank. The one window was blanked out as well, meaning whatever was outside was far too bright to view with the unaided eye.

Breathless, tense minutes crept by. My job was done, at least until the automated sequence finished and the drive sealed itself. Far too dangerous to leave my mind linked to the machine while traveling faster than light.

With a click, then a barely perceptible thunk, the cabin was awash in a glow of green light as all our readouts and instruments sprang to life. The window flickered, then cleared--

The cabin erupted in cheers. We were staring at the cold, merciless beauty of Neptune, perched a hundred thousand miles from its upper atmosphere. A 10 year voyage from Earth's moon, shortened to 10 incredible minutes.

We took our readings, snapped some selfies, and checked the drive over meticulously. Then we re-entered our course in reverse, and took off home.

We were heroes, of course. The selfie we took in front of Neptune, with Taaka's bright green eyes filled with tears of joy, was on the cover every magazine, every newspaper, every blog.

I finally made it home, and my parents were waiting to congratulate me. The neighbors were all there, my sister and her wife, even my college professors had come out of the woodwork. I drank, I'll admit, quite a lot.

When I stumbled downstairs the next morning my mother was already up, coffee and pancakes in the warmer. I had noticed her new haircut the night before: an uncharacteristically short pixie cut, but I hadn't said anything at the time, being then engrossed in describing Neptune's otherworldly beauty yet again to a crowd of admirers.

I mumbled ""breakfast,"" or something similar. Poured a cup of coffee. Grabbed a stack of pancakes, doused them with syrup, and set to.

""Nice haircut, mom,"" I said around a mouthful. 

She looked at me strangely, cocked her head, and replied, ""Hon, I've worn this for a couple of months now... Don't you remember commenting when I visited you at your lab back in March?""

I rocked my chair back. Had I missed it? A relatively inconsequential change but still, pretty big in my mom's universe. But the past six months were a blur, as we had scrambled to finish the drive before our mercurial patron wandered elsewhere financially. I chalked it up to inattention and went on with breakfast.

A week later the team was reassembled in the lunar lab. We'd analyzed the data, the techs had deconstructed and reconstructed the engine, and we were ready to plan the next flight.

One year later, we had taken selfies with Pluto, Jupiter, Saturn, and had gathered samples of rock from the asteroid belt. We had been out to the Oort cloud, we had seen the heliosheath first hand.

We were all spending too much time at work. Lovers, families drifted away. We were all having a hard time relating to the outside world, even our own lab techs. I'd noticed that my parents seemed more and more distant, as though we had less and less in common. None of us followed politics, or sports, or fashion, so the outside world was just an incomprehensible roar.

Everything seemed right and normal in our little bubble as we ran test after test, exploring the solar system. The goal, as always, was to make it to Alpha Centauri, to explore the origin of the distorted but clearly extraterrestrial radio signals.

I had a bizarre encounter with one of my colleagues from JPL, when he answered a call and refused to transmit their lab's weekly report, saying we didn't have clearance. I stared at him for a long moment before breaking the connection. I dashed off an email to the project head--who had also been oddly distant and incommunicative lately, and headed in to the launch bay.

Our tenth jump: we were finally to go extraterrestrial. Alpha Centauri. We loaded up the shuttle, swung out in to free space, and warped out of existence.

When the viewport cleared we saw the insane image of two stars, one as bright as the Sun seen from Earth, the other an attenuated disk, as the Sun looks from Mars orbit. A planet hove in to view--the right size, the right distance--this must be it--and--

The dark side of the planet was covered with twinkling, reddish, clearly artificial light sources. Radio clicked and chattered incomprehensibly around us. Kolsky stared, shook himself, and initiated the launch sequence for the greetings pod. The plan was to drop a pod, then warp back home as quickly as possible before the singularity collapsed, and then revisit in six months, after they had had time to review and analyze the pod.

We snapped one impossible picture--and jumped home.

We were heroes again. This time the world tour was strange--we had been spending a lot of time in space, and on the moon, but I figured we would have heard about South America unifying.

Our last jump--that's where we ran in to trouble. We popped out of our spacetime bubble and we sat in stunned silence.

There were no lights on the dark side of the planet.

The instruments woke up, and silently filled the screens with their reports. Nothing habitable here. The one planet with the right mass, in the right place, was a blasted ruin. No atmosphere. No radio. No life. From the look of the craters, this had been done millenia ago: with no air, falling rocks weren't burning up and instead were impacting the surface, layering impact crater over impact crater.

And yet we had heard the radio signals, clearly. We had seen the lights.

Had we moved in time? No--the star charts were consistent. 

We talked about it all night. All day. Took countless readings. Moved as close to the planet as we could. Nothing changed.

Eventually, we warped home--and all hell broke loose.

There was no lunar research station. No orbiting decommissioned military bases, silently reminding the world of the dangers of nuclear war. No massive space station, bristling with launching gantries for the soon to be created interstellar fleet. Nothing but a dense cloud around the Earth, hundreds and hundreds of satellites.

In blind shock we set course for Earth. As we rounded the curve of the planet Webber shrieked and pointed to the North American continent--it was whole. No massive, water-filled crater where once stood New York; California's coastline was strangely full, with the lights of long-dead Los Angeles gleaming bravely against the dawn light.

We radioed for help, but no one was answering--until we switched bands, to the commercial frequencies, and heard dozens of angry, scared demands for identification and response.

Eventually we coaxed the ship down in to the Arizona desert, and sat, and waited for the government trucks.

They didn't believe us, of course, but we had a shuttle filled with almost recognizable tech, ID cards from hauntingly similar cities, and even parents and families who vaguely recognized us.

They separated us. I never saw Taaka or Kolsky again. Webber and I were released after months of questioning. We ended up in my hometown, in Ohio, and found an apartment together. The world was too strange.

Had we been hopping from parallel universe to parallel universe this whole time? The changes and differences building as we moved further from our timeline? Had the warp drive actually moved us across the membranes of existence? Before Kolsky was pulled away, after Taaka had disappeared, he gave us a tiny disc--their technology couldn't read it. On it, he said, were the equations to build a new drive, one that would deliberately move across dimensions as the first had been intended to move across space. Hide it, he said, and get yourselves home. Somehow.

But he's gone, and Taaka too, and no one at JPL or MIT or NASA or Tesla seems to recognize me. Webber stepped off the roof of a tall building last winter, and I can't say I blame her.

I started collecting tangible reminders that I was a stranger in a strange land. Maps. Globes. Flags. All just politics, accidents of human nature. I started to hunt for the nexus, the crux of this time line. Further back into history I studied, and every time I found discrepancy I pushed further back. I had never been a rigorous student of history, but everyone knows about the Celtic Empire, conquering the known world thousands of years ago--except that here it had been the Roman Empire.

One day I went to the zoo, on a whim, and I saw a spider and I saw its eight lonely legs. My heart froze--and I left the zoo. I went home. And I looked at pictures of spiders all night, mindlessly counting their missing legs.

If these animals, so common, were so different--what did I have in common with all these upright apes around me?

[PM] Give me a prompt and I will give you a short story that somehow takes place underwater.,hpcisco7965,"My wife and I had been recreational divers for years, ever since her sixtieth birthday.  The kids were out of the house, we were nearing retirement.  Time for some adventures, right?   

Every other weekend, we'd head out to the bay.  With each trip we brought back pictures and memories.  Six months later, Laurie bought us tickets to the Caribbean.  Well bless me if that wasn't just the most magical thing ever.  

She wanted to try diving a wreck, wanted to go inside one.  Dangerous, we knew, but we thought we could handle it.  We spent a few months learning how to use nitrox in our tanks for longer dives, then signed up with an experienced charter.  

Laurie's smile had been excited when we suited up, topside on the dive boat's deck.  Happy.  

The descent was uneventful.  We pulled ourselves down a guide rope, hand over hand, until we pulled ourselves onto the old wreck.  Laurie went first, kicking her flippers and disappearing inside.  As she passed through a darkened doorway, she casually slapped a stick-strobelight onto the doorframe.  The strobe would help us find our way out.  

We swam slowly, carefully, through the wreck, careful not to disturb the silt.  Or at least, as little as we could.  The galley was beautiful&amp;mdash;untouched dishes and cookware throughout the crowded room.  

I had been examining some dinner plates when I realized that Laurie was gone.  

It is imperative, when diving wrecks, that you maintain line-of-sight with your dive buddy.  And your exit lights, preferably.  Floating in the cramped galley, I could see neither.  I kicked my fins and swam out into the hallway.  

The hallway was a haze of silt.  Visibility was minimal.  I couldn't see Laurie immediately outside the galley's entrance, and it was impossible to see which way she had gone.  I mentally reviewed our dive plan.  The bridge.  We were going to see the bridge after the galley.  That should have been twenty meters to my right and up a ladder.   

It was twenty minutes before I realized that I was lost.  I had left the galley, kicking confidently in the direction of the bridge.  But when I found the ladder, it lead downwards, not upwards.  I must have been turned around.  I headed down.  

I realized my mistake when I reached the unmistakeable bottom of the wreck.  Huge boilers rose on either side as I pulled myself into the old engine room.  No Laurie.  

It had been too long since I last saw her.  Protocol was to ascend and alert the dive boat. Get help.  Bring in the cavalry.  Easy.

Those are the things you think about when you are dry and happy on a boat.  Not when you are fifty meters deep and your wife might be drowning nearby.   

I searched the engine room, trying to be as quick as I could.  I was about to climb back up the ladder when a flicker of light caught my attention.  I froze, one hand on an old rung.  

There&amp;mdash;in the corner.  I shoved off and kicked hard.  The hull loomed large under the beam of light from my headlamp.  Then, my light disappeared into a dark hole&amp;mdash;an opening to the outside.  I darted through.    

Below me, another flicker.  Laurie.  I dove immediately, kicking and stroking.  My head beam reflected off the fluorescent lining of her face mask.  I gritted my teeth as the pressure grew.  She was sinking too fast. I breathed heavily from the effort, feeling almost drunk from the exertion.  We had been down too long.  

I kicked hard.  Again.  And again.  She was so close.  I could see her face now, her eyes wide as she stretched her hands towards me.  Something must have grabbed her.  Anger flooded through my chest. 

My fingers brushed the rubber strap of her face mask and I snatched it.  It came easily.  Too easily.  Where was Laurie?  

Confused, I scanned below me.  Where was my wife?  I looked at the face mask in my hand.  It was old.  And the wrong color.  This wasn't Laurie's mask at all.  I shook my head.  Why had I thought that?  

I had seen her.  Hadn't I?  

I had.  I was sure of it.  I ignored the growing pressure and dove again.  

She was down here.  I knew it.  I would find her, and we would ascend together.   

I just had to find her first.  ",hpcisco7965

White and grey  
Covering the stone field

The grey pieces of land covered all  
Only visible near  
Large rocks covering a strange sight


The cold ground made warm by orange flames  
Eating the air for life  
They flickered and danced, moving the air above  
Making shapes dance on the rock behind


Foot by foot, I stepped forward  
My body thin, lonely, and tiring    
A singular sight to my side  
Something had been there


From calm to rage, from small steps to big  
I moved forward  
No smells or sights filled my senses  
Till I heard the sound of falling rocks


In front of me I found a being  
Shaped like me, it was small and weak  
They closed its eyes as I put it in my chest  
To fuel my body for years to come

It was super strength today. I went to make myself some coffee. It was the cheap powdery shit, of course. Broke the cup. Spilled that shit all over my arms. It fucking burns. Atleast I'll have an excuse to stay home today. 

It's always super strength or super speed or fucking laser eyes. It's only happened once, but I still wake up with the fear that the moment I sit up lasers would sear my eyelids off. Why can't it be anything useful? Like X-ray vision or something? If I had X-ray vision I'd just stay in central park perving on attractive women all the time. Heh.

Just broke another fucking pencil. Fucking kill me already.

**Tuesday:**

Dear diary, do you know how many people live in this shit apartment building? All the detritus and filth of society. Many of them are drug addicts, many more have crippling mental illnesses. 144. I checked. Yes I did.

So many of them live such meaningless lives, without a single meaningful thought to share amongst them. 

That's not to say that their minds are inactive. No, in fact, they won't shut up. It's a chittering ocean without end, one that bashes against my mind with such force that -

I need to lie down.

**Wednesday:**

Today I woke up in a puddle of my own piss. It smelled like piss, atleast. Turns out it's really hard to see with Xray vision. 

Atleast I can control this one to some degree. It only affects my left eye, so I just put some tape on it and I'm fine. Which is a good thing since I'm pretty sure I didn't call in sick yesterday. I need to make up for my

Oh shit that's blood. That's alot of blood.

**Thursday:**

Woke up with blood staining the sheets. I can't see out of my left eye.

Atleast today's power should help me with that. I can control fluids. Make my pee float in the air and stuff like that. Heh. That won't help me get my job back, though. 

That bitch fucking fired me. God fucking damnit, I'm a hard worker! I'm competant! If it weren't for these fucking powers...

So much has happened these past few days that I didn't notice we were so close to the day of the 'incident'. I've always had these conditions. My parents had kept me secluded in my room to protect myself and those around me.

Lot of good that did them, I still managed to kill everyone in the end. Heh. Just a massive fucking crater. I don't have any memory of what happened that day, but I remember the crater. How it was so perfectly smooth and symetrical. How it consumed the entire town and left nothing behind.

I'm going to spend the rest of the day slurping vodka out of the air. Not like I have anything better to do with my time.

**Friday:**

*This entry is missing. It seems as if the page was torn out in a rush. A brief analysis of  the pencil indentions reveals a detailed and vivid account of the murder of the writer's former employer.*

**Saturday:**

Pyrokinesis. One of the more useful abilities. I can conjure fire from my fingers.

Currently not in my apartment anymore. Some lady found me passed out in a ditch off the side of the road and carried me to her house. Apparantly my eye wound had opened up somehow and was bleeding all over the place. I entertained her with my pyrokinesis for a while. She dubbed me the best magician she'd ever seen.

Anyways. If your searching this journal for a confession, then sure. I killed her and I regret it. I got drunk last night and showed up at her house, got into a screaming match. I was so angry at how much she didn't give a shit and I lashed out. Turned her blood into corn syrup. Her kids saw me. They fucking saw me.

I've had enough. All I've done in my short time on this earth is bring suffering and fear to those around me. My existance is a constant roll of the dice. It sucks.

I won't be much of a problem any longer. Goodbye.

It took me a while to actually figure out what my new power was; thankfully, a crime had taken place pretty early in the day that allowed me to test out what ability I had gained. (Just so you know, I don't normally feel thankful when it comes to crime.) 

All I had to do was point toward the robber as he was pointing the gun at the woman and focus all my energy into channeling my power, and suddenly, fire burst out of the ground around the man that frightened him enough to make him drop his gun. If how bad that scared him, I can see why the demons that tore through the concrete and tried to grab him shortly after made him pass out with fear. 

Before the woman who was being mugged could question why demons were appearing before her very eyes, they just vanished from sight as the fire evaporated into steam and caused her to cough a bit. 

I walked over to her a few seconds after to explain that I had been to one who had done it, and assure her that I wasn't aware my power would involve summoning demons. After getting over the shock, she seemed forgiving and thankful that I had been there.

Overall, this was a pretty nice power, but I hope I'll get one that is a little less... Satan-y tomorrow. Because nothing says ""superhero"" than fire erupting out of nowhere with demons trying to grab whoever is guilty of any crime that day down with them. 

10/11/16

Well, that was definitely more useful than simply summoning demons. I'm not saying summoning weird devilish creatures isn't cool, but compared to telekinetically performing complex surgery on someone, it doesn't seem too useful.

I wasn't too eager to test out this power by actually harming a criminal, so I decided to see how useful it would be in healing people. It turns out, it is incredibly helpful when it comes to almost any injury.

Usually, I'm not into the idea of saving people for the fame or the glory, but I'd be surprised if people didn't get excited about how I went into a hospital and came out with over one hundred, freshly healed people following behind me. It's lucky that I was allowed to come into those hospital rooms, but I guess I've gotten the reputation as ""New-Power-Everyday Man,"" and saving the day like that tends to make you slightly popular.

That's two days in a row that I've gotten awesome powers, and I'm aiming for three in a row.

10/12/16

...I guess three days in a row of amazing superpowers is not too realistic of a goal, since it is completely random. 

It's not like being able to turn into a deer is bad or anything- I could run up to forty seven miles an hour and jump eight feet into the air, so there was no way those criminals could outrun me- but it had its fair share of downsides.

The most obvious one would be that a deer isn't that threatening, and criminals tend to have guns that help kill ordinary forest critters. However, I retained my human intelligence, so I knew how to disarm them in my Cervid form. 

Unluckily for me, a gang chose today to do a bank heist, so I was up against six guys with guns, and they didn't seem like they'd hesitate to shoot a deer.

Somehow, though, my rather on-the-spot plan to stop them worked: I simply transformed into my deer form and walked around the parking lot of the bank until I thought the gang member behind the wheel of the getaway vehicle had stopped focusing on his surroundings. Then, I kicked him right in the face and knocked him out, kicked the door until it was broken down, and hopped behind the wheel of the car to try and drive it... as a deer.

Needless to say, my day didn't go as I planned.

Oh god, diary. Please let this day be over soon. Please. This is the worst one yet. I always thought that mind-reading would be fun. I thought it would be cool to eavesdrop on my friends, to find out what Kade was really thinking about me.

For the record, I should NEVER have gone to school today. I don't think I'll ever be able to look any of my guy friends in the eye again. Especially Kade! I thought he was so smooth, so above it all. I know girls think about sex, but my GOD. At least I know that I'm not his type. Seems like he's more into librarians. Like, multiple ones. Eew.

Kade (ew!) wasn't the worst, though. Worst of all was Mr. Waller. I feel like I should call the cops, but I don't even know how that would work. ""Um, hi officer, so I was reading my Civ teacher's mind. How? Oh yeah, I have this weird superpower thing. Oh no, not today. Today is turning everything I touch into pudding. Anyway I saw ... things."" Right. 

9/27/16 
It's nearly 8:30pm, and I think today might be a dud. Finally! It was really good to have a break. No inadvertent yelling when I heard someone tell a lie, no random telekinesis dumping that bitch Becca out of her seat in Calc (OK, that was totally worth it), no trying to pretend that I'm not hovering 2 inches off the ground, no animals following me around chattering incessantly (FYI, animals pretty much want to talk about food), and I didn't even punch a hole through my locker with surprise super strength. Just ... me. Being me. Going unnoticed, mostly, hanging out with my girls, watching Kade not watching me (still not quite over the librarian thing, tho). Maybe I'll wake up tomorrow as some kind of Becky Firehands. Who knows. For now, I'm enjoying a sweet fall evening with the smell of leaves in the air. I kind of wish I could just freeze time like this.

"[WP] You are in your mind palace, except you forgot what you were looking for.",sweetpecans,"In the bedroom I sat, pondering. The hearth burned, breathing life and passion into the empty halls of my psych, and the solemn ringing of wind chimes echoed with child-like rhythm. Books were stacked and filed neatly, green plants were kept alive and well, and the pale icy palace was cleaned all too often. Things were kept exactly where they needed to be, so knowing where they ever were or where they ever could be was figured gracefully. Order and knowledge was my flair.


""Where... Where is it? Where did it go?” The chimes hit a rest, and a hanging silence filled the halls.


“Hell, what even is it? What am I looking for?"" The silence dropped, and the chimes struck a strange, sour note. With it, like an alarm, I stood up and began pacing. It is not often I don’t know something. This must be fixed.


""Things...” I said aloud, to no one. “Lost things, that is, are easy to locate, assuming you know where you had it last. As they say, retrace your steps. Follow your memories"" The music stopped once more and I pondered.


""Memories... Memories!” A smarmy smile cracked over my face and the hearth flared, tinting the reflective room scarlet. A quick major key was sung, then the chime’s original pandering solemnity resurfaced. “Ah, that wasn't too hard of a mystery, we just need to research some"" I cackled to affirm my apparent brilliance, and left the bedroom. Crystalline, mirrored halls with vast ceilings opened, and I strolled for a single, inconceivable eternity. Walls curled and twisted, paths arched and split, but I was never lost. However I walked, the destination remained the same.


Like a great mountain on a blue horizon, two ornate bronze doors rose from the earth. Behind, was a dimly lit room of sprawling jade fields. Sprouting from within the grassy earth were bookshelves; countless, oaken, and ageless. Their height, towering, stretched into hazy twilight clouds, and the unnamable purple-orange color of the sky signaled the approaching dusk. Night was soon to fall upon this natural receptacle.


""Now, where to look?” I walked onto the grass, and ventured up into the rows. Lining shelves were an endless variety of books, each contained mortal scripture, prose, or knowledge of the old centuries. Despite the vast knowledge that one could become lost within, there was something in particular that I was looking for.


I searched, not knowing for what, but I searched. Thousands of open books trailed behind, their location only known by the accompanying empty hole in a nearby shelf. Time slumbered on, and stars began their slow creep out onto the fading night sky; they twinkled whimsically, perhaps innocently, as if they had no knowledge of the growing fanatics below. 


“Where… What… is it? What am I looking for?!” frustrated, I clutched at the air and firmly stomped. The visage shuddered, and bits of miracles cascaded downward. The air echoed and swayed, the dirt became softer and liquid, and the stars swelled to doublesize. The quake dislodged a particular but single book, one bound completely in white. It fell to the ground like a butterfly, and landed as beautifully as any one thing could fall. Once again, I smirked, and the wind whipped. “This is it”.


Like a soldier, I marched.  I grasped the grand white book, and opened to the first page to reap the fruit of forgotten knowledge. Rather curiously, it was blank. Though I knew what was to happen, I questioned and scoffed a bit, convincing myself it was a mistake, I could never be wrong. I flipped around a bit, and was only met with empty pages. I winced and twitched, it was obvious; this was not something I had long lost or forgotten, but rather a pursuit of what I did not know. There were things I did not know.


The stars in the now night sky burst and pure, white light scattered and crashed into the bookshelves and the grassy steppe like wicked fireballs. Pages erupted like geysers, and two pale and hot slits cracked in the sky, pouring opened and bringing blinding daylight. The disaster, one of unadulterated loathing and discomfort wretched at my body. Limbs snapped and flesh melted, oh how the heat of understanding was vile and righteous. The world turned white, and I woke up.

""I mean, you'd think they would've solved Hogwart's anti-muggle enchantments before shipping us these muggle techs won't they?"" she cried as she picked up the phone and put it back in its case.

""Well at least these 'ball' pens work! look at them! no more ink splatters and blots! brilliant!"" shouted Eris with excitement as he doodled away on a piece of parchment.

""I guess so, I'll just read this book and maybe I could figure out how to operate a bullet train."" replied Florentein as she burried herself in a copy of Japan's Newest Bullet Train Magazine. ""They're powered by electricity you know, could you imagine how unstable it must be!"" she added whilst she flipped through the pages. 

""Quickly! muggle tech out! I repeat muggle tech out!"" shouted a girl in her pyjamas as she ran around the Ravenclaw common room. Everyone with muggle tech quickly hid their various equipment and gadgets and acted as if it was an O.W.L.s exams week, everyone buried their heads on any piece of parchment they could find. The door swung open and the head mistress came in with the utmost disbelief in her face.

""Students, it has come to my attention that muggle artefacts are being shipped in to the school without the knowledge of the ground's keeper. I would like to remind everyone, should anyone have been found in possession of such artefacts, would mean expulsion from the school! It is a very delicate matter of the Stature of Secrecy and will not be taken lightly! Good night to you all."" Everyone murmured with each other as Professor Mcgonagall left the common room.

""How did they find out? I thought it was secure?"" whispered Eris to Florentein who had continued her read of the muggle magazine.

""Who cares, no one will find out."" she muttered as she scratched her head trying to understand what brakes are for. 

""But she said expulsion! Florentein, expulsion! my mum's gonna kill me if she finds out."" cried Eris.

""Would you come down! Why would that ever happen?"" Florentein replied as she scratched her head again on another difficult topic. All of a sudden, some sort of muggle music blasted through the door of the boy's dormitory.
 
""What the bloody hell is that noise?"" shouted Eris.

""It's muggle music! One Direction if I'm not mistaken, I heard them once when I was a kid."" answered Florentein with the same frequency as Eris.

""Well it's gonna kill me!"" he pulled out his wand and exclaimed ""Defendo!"" the music stopped and everyone drew a sigh of relief. 

""What was that all about? Gillard?"" said one of the 5th year that came out of the boy's dormitory.

""It was a bit loud don't you think?"" answered Eris as he put his wand back in his robes. 

""But you broke our steery-o or whatever its called!""

""Just fix it then! Or do you not know the spell? should I teach you?"" 

""Enough!"" cried Florentein as she placed herself in between the two. ""It's just a stereo. Just put it back together Grey."" she suggested with her eyebrows frowning.

""Whatever you say Florentein.""

He can't remember the last few moments before this but he is sure they were not good.

""Hello.""

She sits across from him with a thick folder, glasses neatly placed atop while she watches him with kindness.

""Where am I?""

She smiles softly.

""Dead.""

Then he remembers.

""Oh.""

He had been sick, very sick. His family was by his side and they had cried as he faded. He'd wanted to stay so badly but he just couldn't. Then he was here.

""So, let's talk.""

She unfolds her glasses and places them on her nose before opening the file. The first page is a baby picture with plenty of notes.

Then comes pages of childhood pictures with friends, dogs, family. They seem to stretch on forever as she turns pages. Then she reaches a man in his mid twenties in a black suit, bent over to kiss a beautiful girl in a white dress.

He starts to cry silent tears as she turns the pages of his memory.

There's a beautiful baby in his arms, then a little girl playing in the grass and another baby in his wife's arms.

There's long nights in an office pouring over numbers and papers, there's children playing without their father and one sentence scrawled over the pictures.

""For their future.""

Then he becomes thin and frail, skin drawn over bone as the medication takes a toll on his body. There are hospital rooms and sterile tools and sadness in each picture.

The final picture is a man he wouldn't recognize as himself lying in a bed, face relaxed and a gathering of tearful people standing around.

Dead.

She closes the file and places her glasses down again.

""So. Here's the deal. You can go back-""

He lifts his head with hope through the tears.

""-but, you'll start a new life. The only thing you can take with you are three things you learned from this life. It won't ever be the same as it was.""

There's a long moment before he nods.

""I want to remember to not take anyone for granted, to spend as much time with those I love as I can and to always love with everything I have.""

She smiles softly and snaps her fingers.

The white room is gone and it's replaced with the smell of rain and grass, with dim light.

""Help!"" he shouts, feeling cold and scared, his body shaking against the rain, ""help!""

A little girl appears, kneeling down and looking at him. It's her. He couldn't ever forget that face. Slowly he reaches out for her.

She smiles and reaches out for him, taking his hand and pulling him towards her.

Then he is inside a house that he remembers, not as well as he should, but he does remember it. There's a beautiful woman there in his old gray school sweater sitting at the kitchen table.

""Mom,"" the little girl says and they both smile as they look at him, ""can we keep him?""",jdavidj

""Because no one else is so suited for it.""

""Each time. They manage to either forget their own advice or convince themself not to take it. When they get back here, they try again, and typically offer the same advice.""

""Ah, but not always.""

""...Hm. That's true, but I assumed the point of this was to make the next life *better*, not to find some fancy new outcome or whatnot.""

""That's true, but...""

""...yes?""

""Has anyone ever told you the supposed 'definition of insanity?'

""I've heard it before.""

""I'm not a fan of it, but it goes that you do the same thing over and over and expect something different to happen. Isn't that something? Knowledge can't change the soul, but the soul can change the knowledge. That's the nature of this project.""

"[WP] Upon dying, you learn that you can take three lessons you learned to your next life to make it better.",Avatar_of_me,"A letter to myself in the future:

 Lessons to leave upon death

“Dear Me, 

I’m not sure how to formally address you, I decided it was best that this letter, and it’s lessons come straight from my heart with as little influence as possible. I’m supposed to give you some sort of wisdom that guides you in a positive way, but I’m drawing a blank. So I’m going to just write down what I think are the 3 most important lessons I’ve learned in my life. 
Number one, never forget that you are loved. Whether it be family or friends, siblings or significant others, you reside in the heart of another person. When life seems like it’s only filled with pain, and you think about giving up, never forget these people. They will help you see the light that you cannot find. Spend time with them, laugh with them, cry with them, open your soul to them, humans were meant to love, it’s in our souls. In turn, love others, allow yourself to be fulfilled by being kind, by being there for others. You will find happiness in giving your energy and time for the betterment of humanity. There is nothing more important than filling the world with love, through your acts of love, you will live forever in the hearts of others. Even when you feel like you have lost the love of someone, there will always be another. When I was young I loved a woman who I thought was an angel. I loved the way she sang, the way she laughed, the way she looked at me when I laid next to her. She broke my heart in the end, and I hated myself for a long time. I lost myself to a darkness, I wandered aimlessly through life, wanting nothing more than to stop hurting inside. It took time, it took patience, and it took love before I finally emerged from that darkness. I came to find that I had learned more about myself than I had thought possible. Pain and love are the greatest teachers, listen to them, embrace them, and let them pass away. We are the culmination of all our struggles and successes, but we are best guided through them by the love of others.
 
Number two, read all you can. Fill your mind with ideas, and your soul with knowledge. Learn about the world, learn about yourself, learn that you are capable of great things. Try not to expect so much of yourself, but rather, try to better yourself a little each day. Read everything you get your hands on, and question everything that you’re told. Know why you believe what you believe, educate yourself in all the ways of the world. My grandmother read Shakespeare to me, my father read me “The Lord of the Rings”, and I learned from both. I learned about myself through Science-Fiction just as much as I did in Torah. Never stop moving forward, allow yourself to admit that you know nothing, then try to learn everything. Give yourself a hobby, something outside of your work, give yourself the tools to be not just successful, but happy. The end comes so much sooner than you think, make the most of your own potential, and you will leave this world fulfilled.

Lastly, forgive yourself. We will all fail, and we will always fall short. I have made so many mistakes in my life, I have hurt myself, my family, my relations. Some days you will feel like the worst person in the world, and you will want to give up. I once contemplated ending my life when I was 23, I had made a mistake so great that I ended up incarcerated. I never wanted to face myself or my family again. When I walked out I broke out in tears, I was given a chance to redeem myself. I swore I would give myself the opportunity the change, and though it took time, I recovered. Everyone is capable of change, but first you must forgive yourself. Surrender to the shame, accept that you failed, then pick yourself up and move forward. Never stop moving forward, even if it’s a crawling pace. There will always be a dawn, you will always have a choice, better yourself every day.
I will probably remember more that I wanted to say after I send this letter to you, but I hope you take something from this. Never forget, you can change the world, even if it’s a person at a time. You have the capability for incredible change in the lives of those who are in your life. Love, learn, and forgive. One day you will look back and you’ll be faced with the choices you made, and it is my hope that you will look fondly upon your life. I know that I do.


I go forward into the next life with happiness in my heart.
Your friend, Me.

"[WP] Upon dying, you learn that you can take three lessons you learned to your next life to make it better.",Avatar_of_me,"The building pain, the white light, the sudden peace.

I opened my eyes and stared out into nothing. 

*Was this death? Was this the afterlife?*

**""Yes, and no.""** spoke a booming voice from all around me.

""You are dead,"" whispered a voice on my left.

""But this is not the afterlife,"" whispered another from my right.

""More of an in between..."" sang a third voice as it swooped over my head.

""Now you must make a choice,"" tweedled a voice from below my feet.

""For one so young it must be hard,"" was said behind me.

A wispy figure formed in the emptiness in front of me and raised an arm in a coy wave. The mouth opened and closed at random as words appeared in the air around me, seen and heard in shimmers.

""Go on, go, on, go on, go on..."" a hundred echoes repeating the phrase.

The words froze in place and were swept aside as the figure lowered it's arm to gesture downwards. I followed it's motion and saw the earth far below with one word imprinted deep into it's bedrock. **Return**

""Return."" I said immediately, thinking of my friends and family. I had only been nineteen when I was diagnosed, and I had so much more to give.

The figure smiled and it's slit of a mouth spread upwards, cutting a slice through it's face as the upper half of it's head drifted up and up. Eventually being cut off and separating to float above the rest of the figure, slowly losing it's form.

With half a head, and half an inhuman smile, the figure raised up three fingers and it's voice echoed down from the dissipating smoke above it's head.

""Three lessons, can you take, and all else is forgotten. Choose well, they are all that will guide you in your next life.""

I blanched, or I would of if I had a body to blanch with, and my thoughts spun uncertainly. How could I choose three lessons and nothing else. Should they allude to memories, maybe they could bring something back from my previous life.

I saw the headless figure shake it's stump. It was right, if I didn't have any memories then what could any lessons tell me. The best I could do was give myself something to help me along. What had I learned in my life?

I thought back on the mistakes I had made, the people I had hurt, the things I had done to hurt myself, and the damage I had caused by acting without thinking.

""Always think carefully before you act."" I said, giving my first lesson.

The figure nodded once slowly and lowered a finger. *Two.*

I mentally scrunched up my face and ran a hand through my hair, thinking about all of the people that had hurt me, the boys that I had fallen for that had broken my heart, the teachers that had praised me one day only to punish me the next, and of course my father who had left the day I had told him about my cancer.

""Be careful who you trust."" I said, and the figure lowered another finger. *One.*

One final lesson, and my last chance to help myself in the future. What could I do, what could I say? My head echoed with an strange headache in this alien world, and the mist figure rocked back and forth in mocking mirth. 

I tried to grit my teeth, and memories flooded back about all of the times I had let people walk all over me. My 'best friend' who had always demanded that I chose her over everyone until she had her first boyfriend, my project partner who had demanded first billing on our paper despite never showing up to our study sessions, my mother who had blamed me for my dad leaving.

""Stand up for yourself."" I said, and the figure lowered it's final finger and swept it's arm outwards and away, shedding tendrils of smoke as it passed.

**""The lessons are set.""** Spoke the loud voice from all around.

*""Always think carefully before you act,""* crowed a voice from my left.

*""Be careful who you trust.""* crooned a voice from my right.

*""Stand up for yourself.""* cackled a voice from behind me.

""All three just the same as last time,"" grinned the faceless mist in front of me.

The figure lifted a hand to point a thumb downwards and I fell towards the earth with my memories falling off me one by one and drifting upwards in the breeze.

The gentle peace, the glowing darkness, the sudden pain.

I opened my eyes.

"[WP] Upon dying, you learn that you can take three lessons you learned to your next life to make it better.",Avatar_of_me,"The man bumps into me in the street. He snarls at me, and I apologise, even though it was clearly his fault. *Lesson 1: You can't win them all, sometimes it's better to back down.* He walks on, not realising that I managed to swipe his wallet when he bumped into me. *Lesson 2: Sometimes, you need to appear to lose, to win.* He doesn't realise until long after, and I'm sure that he would never think of me as a suspect for stealing it.

I find my way to the restaurant where I'm meeting my girlfriend, and I pay for our meal, in cash, from the man's wallet. Later, after I've locked his debit card, I hand the wallet in to the police, saying that I found it lying on the ground in a park. They also don't suspect me of stealing it. They thank me, and I leave. When I get home, my parents ask me how my day was. I'm tempted to tell them, but that wouldn't be good, so I reply with a simple 'good'.

You may wonder why I took the risk of stealing that man's wallet. It's because I know. Most people choose three lessons that will help them make the right choices, or will help them be successful. Me, I only chose two like that. My third lesson is by far the most important, one that I didn't learn until after I died last time. One that no one else thinks to say, or so I was told. *Lesson 3: After you die, you will be reborn, after choosing three lessons to bring into your new life. So have fun.*",Sherbs39
"[WP] Upon dying, you learn that you can take three lessons you learned to your next life to make it better.",Avatar_of_me,"Did you know that in your last few moments alive, your senses are flooded with light?

Yes, your senses. Not just your sight. You feel that shining beacon in the stars calling out to you in every single way possible:  you see it, you smell it, you taste it, you hear it, you feel it. It's overwhelming, yet strangely peaceful. The type of sensation that you can't fight against, so you simply go with the flow and enjoy the ride.

Your trip to the switching station lasts about ten minutes. At that point, the light fades from your senses and you're standing in a place that oddly resembles your average metro station. You're at the end of a single-file line that stretches out seemingly for eternity, and yet, when the line moves forward, you're next. You get to go face-to-face with the big man himself.

Or, at least to me, he was a man. A real father figure kind of guy. But I got the impression from his knowing smile that he would be whatever you were most comfortable with. I was always a daddy's girl in my life.

""Hello, Abigail,"" God said, his voice flooding all my senses like the light. It wasn't overwhelming, though. It was like the sensation of laying your head down on a pillow after a long day. ""Welcome to the switching station.""

I opened my mouth to be speak, but found words lacking, so I simply nodded.

""I know you've a lot of questions, my dear girl. Let me start with the one at the front of your mind:  what is this place? As I said, the switching station. Souls are not expendable resources, you know. They aren't a one-and-done kind of commodity. The same soul will likely go through over one hundred incarnations before boarding the train home. You, my dear girl, are on your way to incarnation two. One of the freshest souls I have had the pleasure of meeting in a very long time.""

I remained silent for several moments, trying to take the information in. God assured me that I could take all the time I need with his gaze - he didn't need to say a word for me to understand that. Eventually, I was able to form my first question: ""The train home?""

God lifted his hand, pointing toward the empty tracks. ""After a soul goes through enough incarnations, it boards the train home. To... Heaven, so-to-speak. Think of it as a retirement home for souls, if that makes it easier to comprehend. To be allowed into such a place, a soul must mature immensely, and if I find it hasn't learned its lessons yet, I will send it back for another go. Make sense, dear child?""

I nodded.

""A part of this 'entrance exam', so-to-speak, is that the memory-wipe a soul receives will be incomplete. They will not remember a thing from their previous life, naturally, but will have three lessons learned in that previous life instilled into their soul. Three things that will make up the core of their personality for that lifetime. These three things are at the discretion of the soul itself. You may pick, dear Abigail.""

God extended a clipboard to me, complete with pen and paper. I took it, and he placed his hand on my shoulder, guiding me over to a lone chair off to the side of the main line.

""Take all the time you need, dear child. Pick your three lessons, and you will go on to your next life with those lessons as a part of you. Choose carefully.""

And with that, God went back to the line to tend to the next person. I sat there in the chair for what felt like a paradoxical time - it took forever, yet it took no time at all. I thought long and hard at times, and other times, I didn't think at all, letting my mind rest and moving my eyes from the clipboard to God, who always was speaking to another soul. Formless, yet filled with so much expression.

But I finally decided.

I had them written. So, with a heaving sigh, I rose to my feet and move to talk to God, who all of a sudden is speaking to no one. The line was empty - the only people in the switching station were the two of us. I had long since decided not to question the physics of this place. It was a realm in control of God, after all.

I approached him, handing him the clipboard. His eyes scanned it for a split second, a smile touching his lips.

""Very well, dear Abigail. You will go into your next life with three lessons instilled into your very soul - these three things will make up the core of your personality, from the moment you can remember your own thoughts. They are...""

In the end, there wasn't much of a choice. I knew from the moment that I was told to pick what I was going to choose, despite the arduous hours of thinking on it. 

I was a very mean person for the first few decades of my life. Spiteful, arrogant, hateful. I don't really know what to blame - my emotional immaturity as a soul, my upbringing in life, the social circles I hung with... I suppose blame really doesn't matter.

""Lesson One,"" God said, ""Be kind to your fellow man...""

I always skirted by on the bare minimum effort in life. I went the easy way with every little thing I could. This ended up with my early adult life being spent on the streets, spiteful toward the world and only affirming my belief that the world didn't deserve my effort.

""Lesson Two,"" God said, ""Work hard, for it is the only way to lead a fruitful life.""

When I realized that wasn't going to work, I picked up the pace. I pulled myself up by my boot straps and became a working machine - I built myself a life from rock bottom. I was a natural American success story. I got a husband. I gave birth to a little girl. For the first time in my life, I was someone worthwhile to someone else. And yet, I was afraid that if I stopped, I was going to make the entire setup fall apart.

""Lesson Three,"" God said, ""Yet take time to rest, for a life only spent working is no life at all.""

I crashed and burned. It was at this point where my blood pressure was skyrocketing, I was barely getting any sleep, I was constantly doing something... my body simply couldn't handle it. It gave out on me. I died because I worked myself to death. I tore myself from the life I had built because I was too afraid it was going to go away if I lost my momentum.

So I knew my three lessons from the moment I was going to get to pick them.

God embraced me. I embraced him back, quietly crying into his shoulder for a while. There was silence, and for the first time ever, I think I really knew what comfort was.

""Dearest Abigail, I would say you had a good first run.""

With that, I moved onto my next life.",therunawayguy

"[WP] It turns that it's actually possible to travel through mirrors. However, our reflections make it their job to block us from getting to the other side, and there's a good reason why.",FallenFlames,"In the corner of my eye, barely in peripheral vision, there was a dark shape. It’s always there when I sit down in my chair with the hallway behind me at night. You probably think that I’m crazy, but I’ve measured it. I’ve put strips of tape on the kitchen floor, just to be sure. Within the tape zone, I’ve removed all my furniture and belongings – an empty space now occupies the center of my apartment in front of the hallway mirror. I’ve made sure my chair is well outside the tape line, making it impossible for me to cast a reflection in the hallway mirror. Still, the dark shape appears as soon as I sit down.

I know what you’re thinking: ‘Maybe it’s just a weird shadow or the light breaking in an odd way when you sit there?’ That was my first thought as well – I wish that I hadn’t investigated it further. 

One night I sat down in the chair, my back turned at the mirror. I had an ominous feeling in the pit of my stomach, telling me that this was a really bad idea. But I did it anyway, on the preconception that knowing for sure would somehow give me peace of mind. I propped my elbows up on the table and rested my chin in my palms – that was the easiest way of staying still. Then I waited.

The minutes ticked away slowly. I watched the dark spot in my periphery. My brain was urging me to get up, telling me I shouldn’t be doing this. I felt my heart beating faster than usual. I’m not religious in the slightest, but I found myself praying. I was sweating and felt nauseous.

Suddenly, the dark shape moved. It slid gradually along the edge of the mirror. I felt the tiny hairs on my arms stand up, and a powerful burst of adrenaline pumped into my heart. Still, I remained motionless. The dark shape stopped at the bottom of the mirror. Then a moment later it moved again. This time, however, it didn’t move horizontally or vertically along the surface of the mirror. Instead, it moved in the third dimension, straight out of the mirror. 

‘Get up, get up, get up!’ my mind screamed at me. But I couldn’t move. I wanted to close my eyes, but some kind of primal instinct told me to keep them open. Then the shape grew in size and moved further into the hallway. A moist swampy smell crept into my nostrils. 

The dark shape moved again, and this time with a certain familiarity. Even though I couldn't see any real details in my periphery, I could see the manner in which the shape moved. The realization turned my sweat into ice. It was how limbs with joints would move – something was dragging itself out of the mirror.

That’s when I stood up with force, the chair fell behind me and the dark shape shrank away. My spine felt like jelly but I still managed to stumble over to the mirror. I was met by my reflection. He looked like hell. His eyes were bloodshot and he was trembling. His ribcage moved in and out rapidly. 

I was about to make a snide remark on his haircut when a dark shape moved behind him. I screamed for him to watch out, but no sounds came out. Then I realized that he was the one shouting and that I should be the one watching out.

Every week or so, Alex's friends would make plans to hang out, like every normal teenager on the planet, and every week, Dad would make some bullshit curfew, like some goddamn control freak! Did he not realize how bad it looked when she had to leave early because her father had set her bedtime for the night? And when the fuck did she sign up for this Helicopter Guardian?! Aggghhh!!

With that Alex punched the bathroom wall. And, to her horror, her fist went straight through the drywall and embedded itself in the blue insulation underneath. Shit. Shit! She was gonna get grounded for weeks. Literally weeks. And some parents will do that soft grounding where you get no phone or internet, but they stop enforcing it after a few days. Dad wasn't like that. Being grounded one week hours meant 168 hours, not a minute less, no exceptions for holidays. And just in case that wasn't bad enough, Alex's birthday was two days away.

Maybe he wouldn't notice. No, that was stupid. He'd come in at 10:15 to brush his teeth, like he did every night, glance in the mirror, see the gaping black crater in the wall, and . . . hang on, why was there a black crater in the wall? Alex glanced at the crater she made. The insulation sticking out of it was blue. She glanced back at the mirror and the mirror crater Mirror Alex made and . . . yes, it also showed blue insulation.

No, it had changed. It had been wrong for a second, and then it corrected itself while Alex was looking away. It must have. Either that, or Alex couldn't trust her senses. Ooh, that was an unpleasant thought. Seeing things in the mirror is a good way to get your own padded room. Dad'd love that, wouldn't he. His daughter locked up, kept under watch, kept away from anything that could hurt her. No, fuck that! Alex couldn't accept she was crazy. It was the Mirror that was screwy.

But how to prove it? She could always put more holes in the wall, but she realized she'd have a real hard time explaining why she was destroying the house. And besides, the Mirror had already seen the blue insulation under the drywall, so it probably wouldn't make the same mistake again. God, was she really assuming the Mirror could think? Was that a sign she was crazy?

No, she wasn't gonna let herself think she was crazy, she was going to test this Mirror. And she had an idea. She put her foot on the counter, and she watched the Mirror Alex do the same. Both Alexes were wearing the same brand of sock. Alex then ripped her sock off revealing toenails painted pink. And the Mirror Alex did the same and her toenails were . . .  also pink.

Hmm, a bad test. If the Mirror could read her mind -  and that was a possibility, since it could emulate her motions just as quickly as she could - then it would've known what color Alex's toenails were and would have changed itself accordingly.

So Alex left the bathroom and came back with a pair of dice. She cast them onto the counter and got two threes. The Mirror Alex did the same and got the same numbers.

Well of course the Mirror Alex got the same numbers. Mirror Alex rolled the dice in the exact same way, it was expected she'd get the same numbers. What Alex needed was something with an outcome she couldn't affect and didn't know ahead of time.

And so she left and came back with a small, yet heavy package. It was a birthday present from Dad. Dad was actually pretty good at getting her stuff. He had a knack for getting unusual, unpredictable gifts which Alex would really come to appreciate. If there was anything that could trick the Mirror, this was it. Alex locked eyes with the Mirror Alex, then she ripped open the package and pressed its contents against the Mirror's surface. What Alex pulled out was nice set of climbing gear. What Mirror Alex pulled out was this sort of black crystalline object. Ha, so Alex wasn't crazy!

However, this black crystal didn't behave as expected. Unlike Alex's object, it shattered the moment it came into contact with the Mirror and blasted the Mirror Alex backward.

And Alex also didn't expect to fall through the Mirror. Mind you, she probably should've seen this coming. After all, normally when you press something against a Mirror, the reason you can't get through it because the Mirror is pressing a similar object back at you with the same force, but this was an exceptional case.

""No! Don't come through!,"" shouted Mirror Alex.

Alex wasn't really sure what to do here. This was a totally alien situation, and she really just wanted get Dad. But then the Mirror told her not to come through, and she realized that unless she came through, it would just correct itself, and she'd never get a chance like this again. So she entered. She wanted answers.

""Who are you? What is this place? Why haven't you -""

Mirror Alex interrupted: ""No, you don't understand! You have to leave before the Queen - ""

Suddenly, the roof of the Mirror Room split open, and the thing that tore the roof towered above them beneath a black, starless sky. It had a humanoid face, and it's body seemed to consist solely of a mass of thin, multi-jointed arms. Alex wasn't quite sure if the thing was made of metal or flesh.

""DESYNCHRONIZATION! UNACCEPTABLE!"" It shrieked. Its voice was torture.

Alex had no idea what the fuck this was. All she knew was that she *really* shouldn't have come here. ""Look, I'll go! I'm sorry!""

""ASYMMETRY!"" The thing wailed. And some of its hands reached up and clawed at its own face. It's body bent backwards, as if it were trying to escape the hands.

Alex lunged for the Mirror, her exit. She didn't want to look at the thing. She could hardly bear its awful screams as it ripped itself. But she felt a dozen arms grab her. The Mirror shrank beneath her. The Mirror House shrank beneath her, but it wasn't a house, it was just a duplicate of her bathroom, literally nothing more than what it needed to be to seem like a mirror.

And that bathroom was nestled snugly within a giant, black crystal - the thing was about a hundred feet wide. And that crystal was floating, and above them were more floating crystals, and hundreds more around them, and hundreds more below them.

And below those crystals was a giant fog. It glowed a soft grey and seemed to be the only source of light in this place, and Alex would've hypothesized it was the surface of a planet, but since she couldn't see its curvature it could just as easily be an infinite, flat plane. And besides, this world was like nothing she'd expected, she was done making hypotheses. 

She was also terrified. In addition to the maddening voice of the thing that carried them, and the crushing thought that she may never return to the world she knew, she had a deathly fear of heights, especially of falling. And the thing seemed to be carrying them to the edge of the crystal. It would cast them over! She fought and bit and screamed - though not as loudly as the thing - and twisted madly, but the hands gripped her tighter. And then the worst happened: they let go. Alex experienced the sickening feeling in her guts that told her she was in freefall. Mercifully, she fainted.

When she came to, she didn't know how she'd survived the fall, nor did she care. Above her was the glowing grey fog. Next to her was Mirror Alex and her climbing gear.

""What is this place?"" Alex asked.

""I don't know. I've never been off my shell,"" responded Mirror Alex.",impromptu_icarus

"[WP] You make plants wilt in your presence, mirrors shatter when you look at them, and make animals flee in terror. But you're not evil. Honest.",IJustMovedIn,"Erik kept his bow aimed at the creature.

""I don't know if you can understand the words of men, but before I do this, I want you to answer one thing... why?""

In the center of the clearing was the creature. Surrounded by blackened grass, with a trail leading to the trees, most of which were also wilted.

It was black. Black as a starlless night sky, seemingly absorbing light around it. Whisps of dark smoke drifted from it as well as small flakes of its body, rising unnaturally slowly into the air. Two completely white eyes, unnervingly large were it's only distinguishable features. 

It cocked it's head to one side, but said nothing.

Erik adjusted his grip on the bow nervously, ""I... I said. Why? Why did you kill our crops? Our livestock?""

The creature shook it's head, taking a soundless step forward. 

Erik drew his bow back, ""I-I'm warning you! I'll kill you here and now!"" He felt sweat beading on his forehead.

It continued across the clearing, the grass turning back beneath it's feet. Erik let loose an arrow aimed at where the heart would be on a man.

The arrow whistled through the air, then impacted with the creature, but it didn't stagger. The arrow seemed to have vanished.

""Gods..."" Erik backed away, his bow dropping from his hands. His foot caught on a rock, sending him crashing to the ground. 

He scrambled backward, until he felt his back against a tree. The creature was too close now. Nowhere to run. ""Egrit... forgive me.""

He shut his eyes for the killing strike. After several moments he slowly opened one of them. 

The creature stood about arm's length away and didn't seem to want to come closer. 

""Wha- wh- Ho-"" Erik stuttered. 

""I... s... sorry."" The voice came from directly ahead of him. A woman's voice. The realization hit him suddenly.

""You... you *can* talk...""

""Y...yes.""

""Then... then answer my question."" Erik said, his composure returning, but still pressed firmly against the tree. 

It cocked it's head again, ""que... question?""

""Our livelihood. The crops. The cows! You killed them all!""

Its solid white eyes stared at him, ""Don't me-mean to... ha-happens.""

Erik eased his grip on the tree, ""So... what you're telling me is... you go 'round killing everything, but you don't mean to?

It nodded its head.

Erik furrowed his brow, ""That doesn't excuse it!"" He took a step toward the creature, his anger briefly overcoming his fear. ""You-you've put the entire village at risk and all you fook'n have to say is sorry?""

It wrung it's hands, a look that could almost be called sorrow seemed to be in its eyes. ""D-don't... mean to. Ac-accident...""

Renewed strength filled Erik. He felt the courage to do what he came to do return to him. ""I'm going to make sure you never *accidently* kill an entire village!""

He grabbed the creature by the throat, pulling his hunting knife from his belt. 

Suddenly, his strength left him. His arms grew heavy. His vision clouded. The weariness of days without sleep overcame him. Then weeks. Then months.

He sagged to his knees, then collapsed to the ground. Blackened grass filling his vision. 

In his last moments of consciousness, he saw the creature back away. It almost seemed frightened. 

It's soft voice was the last thing he heard before passing out.

I am the bringer of death to flora and the immortal terror that all fauna fear so deeply.

I currently reside in a multi million dollar mansion. Every day that I wake, I take control. I choose the plants that die. The animals I do not like shall run in terrible, frantic, fear from my wrath.

Am I evil? Of course not. Am I demented, twisted, or sick minded? In no way what at all. But I do have a task and that task comes before all.

I know some will fear me. I have broken countless mirrors without even paying attention and I have made mistakes that require forgiveness, although I regret nothing I do.

If the plants have to cry, and the animals must fear me to succeed... Then that is how it must be.

An evil person. No. I am just doing my job. And it is my job to remove all weeds, foreign animals, and maintain perfection.

"[WP] You make plants wilt in your presence, mirrors shatter when you look at them, and make animals flee in terror. But you're not evil. Honest.",IJustMovedIn,"""Honestly, I...I just never really gave it too much thought."" Brian said. He looked down at his feet, watching his hooves wave just above the floor where they dangled from his too-high chair. Tears stung the corners of his eyes. Not for the first time, he wished he had toes. 

""You didn't give it much thought? *You didn't give it much thought!?*"" Mrs. Turner screeched, making Brian flinch. ""Haven't you *seen* what you are? What you *look* like?""

""N-no ma'am."" Brian said, tears now freely rolling down his furred cheeks. ""Dad doesn't allow mirrors in the house...they keep...breaking..."" His voice quieted until it was barely more than a whisper. He never had been good at lying, even if this one *was* a white lie. It was the truth that mirrors broke in his presence, but in those fragmented shards he had caught a glimpse of who he was. Of what he looked like. A thousand sets of ram's horns, a million eyes like a constellation of embers kicked up from a fire. Different. Alien. 

Freakish. 

""They do, do they?"" Mrs. Turner said, eyebrow raised. ""This is the third class pet that has died in your care, do you know that?""

""Y-yes...""

""Yes *ma'am*, Brian."" Mrs. Turner corrected. 

""Yes m-ma'am...""

""It seems I can't turn my back on you for a second, before something goes terribly wrong."" Mrs. Turner pressed on, barely looking at him. ""Why do you feel the need to torment this class? We're already doing you a favor just by letting something like you join us at all."" 


""I-I know...I...I didn't mean to..."" Brain said.

""Didn't mean to?"" Mrs. Turner choked back a laugh. ""No, of course not. Silly me. Why would something like you be *evil* anyway?"" 

""I'm not evil..."" Brian whispered. 

""I'm sorry, I didn't quite catch that."" Mrs. Turner said. 

""I'm *not* evil."" Brian said, his voice a little louder. 

""Yes, Brian. You are. You have always been evil, you will always *be* evil. Something like you can't change it's stripes just because you spend a few years out in the sun. Honestly, I don't know what Mr. Arkwright was thinking, trying to raise you like he has. He would have been better off slitting your throat. Or maybe throwing you back to the pits you came from, so you could be reunited with your *real* father."" 

""He *is* my real dad."" Brian insisted. ""He says I'm just a little different because...because Mom was..."" Brian trailed off. 

""Because your mother was what? A whore? A *demon*? And you actually believed him? *He lied to you Brian*.""


""Don't say that..."" Brian said. He felt *something* stir within him, like a tendril of flame slowly uncoiling in his stomach. 

""Say what? That your father lied to you?"" Mrs. Turner smirked. ""It's true. Whatever your parents were, neither of them were ever human. You have never met your real father."" 

""I said...DON'T SAY THAT!"" Brian screamed. He stood up suddenly, hooves gouging thick lines out of the wooden floor. Fear flickered over Mrs. Turner's face at Brian's cry, her expression melting into one of horror as he loomed over her like a giant. Brian's vision filled with red, as if the world had been drenched in blood. He lunged at her, pushing her to the floor, taloned hand ready to strike...and then, he stopped. 

It was her eyes that had done it. They were shining, glossy with tears. He had lived with those eyes staring at him his entire life, and in the center of those eyes, he saw what she was afraid of. The hulking, red, fanged *thing* that was the source of all her terror, and his own. He saw himself. 

And so, he fled. 

He didn't know how long he ran. The schoolyard, the familiar streets and houses all fell away behind his hooves. Soon, the sun began to sink below the horizon. Brian was alone, as alone as he had ever been in his entire life. Finally, in a darkened alley on the wrong side of town, he sat down and began to cry anew. 

""...Brian?"" Said a voice, startling him back to his senses. He looked up, and was surprised to see the silhouette of a man standing at the entrance of his alley. 

""Go away."" He choked, turning his back on the man. ""I-I'm scary, so...so go away!"" 

""Brian. Is that any way to talk to your own father?"" Said the man. 

""Dad!?"" Brian cried, and suddenly he was being scooped up in the air by a pair of strong arms. 

""I would never be scared of you, little sparky."" Mr. Arkwright said, pulling him into a strong embrace. ""I heard what happened at school...I'm very proud of you, son. You held your temper for a long time, if your little friends hiding behind the door are to be believed.""

""I-I didn't hurt her, did I?"" Brian said, tears of relief pouring down his cheeks. 

""No. She's a little shaken up, but she's not hurt. And by the sound of things, she isn't going to be your teacher for much longer. You aren't the first child she's bullied, but I'm going to make darn sure you're the last."" He smiled, setting Brian down gently onto the asphalt. 

""Come on, son. Let's go home.""",Syncs

Not everything has colour. Not the swaying trees. Not the neon lights that apparently are really pretty. Not the benches or the grass. But it feels like.. the colour is slowly seeping in. Like I'm only seeing a little at a time. But seeing more and more. Today, today I see a lot more. 

What's happening? 

My phone rings. It's time to drop Dom off at his mom's. I'll see him again next weekend. I look at him, his eyes. I'm told he has my blue eyes. Maybe I can see that next week. I am starting to feel giddy with happiness.

"[WP] You woke up today and saw your mirror was broken, even more alarming, it's broken on the other side.",KairuofKairu,"*huh?*

""Weird,"" I said aloud. I tried to feel for the spiderweb  like crack in my bathroom mirror. All I felt was the smooth and cold mirror. It felt fine. But, I could see the new jagged puzzle my mirror had become.

*I'll get a new one today,* I thought.

I got into the shower and the mirror fell from my mind.

My morning progressed as usual. Showered, dressed, and ate breakfast.

From my kitchen table I could see the mirror. A jagged and fractured face looked back at me. I took out my phone and left myself an alarm to remind myself to pick up a new mirror for my bathroom.

I left for work. I lived pretty close to the newspaper I worked at. A quick drive around a bit of suburban housing, then construction, and some side roads is all I had to take to get to my job.

I sat down for the day making ads and answering calls.

""Hey Mike,"" Alice said. She leaned over my computer.

""Hey,"" I mouthed silently. ""Yes."" I said into the phone. ""Sure thing we can add that to the advertisement.""

Alice walked around. ""How about we grab an after work lunch together."" She sat on my desk. ""I know this great sandwich place. Not far.""

""Absolutely,"" I said.

""Good, we'll make it four.""

""We'll get you a copy of the ad to look over before we go to print,"" I said into the phone.

*Wait.. what?*

I looked at Alice. ""What?"" I mouthed.

""Four. Meet me in front of the building, we'll grab lunch.""

I gave a thumbs up. Alice walked away and I finished my call.

Alice was a nice person. I did kinda like her. She was more upfront about what she wanted.



Three thirty came around and the alarm I set went off. I delayed it for tomorrow.

The new mirror can wait. It's not like I can't live without a new one.

I finished up my work and saw Alice in front of the offices waiting for me.

""Hey,"" Alice said. ""Come, on. It's a great spot.""

She lead me down the street a ways to an intersection. Near it was a sandwich shop I had crossed by a hundreds of times.

""You ever been here?"" Alice asked.

""No,"" I said.

""We'll grab a seat outside,"" Alice said. ""It's a nice day.""

We started talking about work and the conversation drifted to what we did before the newspaper.

Alice, ""I used to travel a lot with a -""

Before she finished we both turned to look in the direction of a blaring car horn. I grabbed Alice's arm and pulled her out of the way of a car. We both lay on the ground as we looked over the carnage.

Someone had lost control of their car when one of the tires had blown. The driver, veered to miss another car but over-corrected. He started hitting his horn just a second before crashing into the decorative fence surround the outside dining area of the sandwich shop. The car did not stop as it hit the table Alice and I had sat at.

The car came to a stop after hitting the brick wall of the sandwich shop.
We checked on the driver. He was fine with just a few bruises and - from what we could tell - a broken nose.

The police came and wrote  down our statements. Afterward we left back to the newspaper parking lot.

""That was close,"" I said.

""Yeah,"" Alice said.

""Other than for that car,"" I said. ""I was having a good time. Just saying.""

""I guess I should pick a less exciting spot huh?"" Alice gave a half smile.

""Maybe next time you could save me?""

""Oh no!"" Alice said. ""Don't you be saying I owe you for saving me.""

""Come on,"" I said playfully. ""How about an actual date next time and we call it even.""

*Did I say that? Its because of the near death experience. Yeah that's it.*

Alice stopped. ""Alright,"" she said. ""But this time somewhere inside!""

""It's a deal!""



Back at home I crashed on my couch and checked my phone. No messages.

*I'll talk to her at work tomorrow. I'm sure she's just as jittery as I am after today.*

I looked out my window. For a second I thought about a car crashing through my window.

""Naw,"" I said to myself.

The rest of the day passed without another near death experience.

I went to the bathroom to get ready for bed.

""That's right,"" I said. ""I gotta get a new mirror.""

Then it stood out to me. I couldn't take my eyes off of it. Part of the mirror had turned completely black.

One piece of the broken glass had turned completely dark. It seemed to absorb all the light. I put my finger to it. It didn't feel cold or hot and it was the smoothest thing I ever had felt.

I took the mirror off the wall and looked at the back. Cardboard covered the backside of the mirror. I took the mirror into the living room and sat it on the table. I unlatched the backside.

I expected to see the back side of a broken mirror. But, nothing. It looked normal. It wasn't shattered. The back of it wasn't black or gooey.
I looked at the front.

The mirror was shattered into small and large chunks. Near the center sat the black jagged broken piece of the mirror.

I kept it on the table and went back to the bathroom to get ready for the night.



In the morning I ate a bowl of cereal while I looked down at the mirror laid on the table.

My phone's alarm went off.

Time for work.



My day at work passed without incident. Alice wasn't in the building long. She was a reporter after all and the news never sleeps.

After work I drove to a local furniture store. They had everything including the kitchen sink. The store had taken over an old warehouse and the aisles were made with scaffolding about twenty feet tall. Each row was dedicated to a part of a house. Kitchen, living room, or bathroom, the store had just about everything.

""How can I help you,"" an employee asked.

""I just need one of those mirrors is all,"" I said.

""No problem. I'll go grab a ladder,"" the employee walked off and returned with a ladder in his hands. ""Just a second. I'll hand it down.""

Unknown to myself and the employee, this particular scaffolding had been hastily put together two days prior and a bolt had never been placed on one of its legs.
The employee leaned the ladder against the scaffolding. Just as he reached an arm's stretch a way, the ladder underneath him slipped out from beneath his feet. The employee grabbed onto the edge of the top of the scaffolding.

The scaffolding began to tilt towards me. I froze. I could not do anything but stare at the falling metal and glass coming right towards me. I put my arms in front of my face and stood there.

From the ladder falling to the crash of the scaffolding had been all of three seconds.

I heard the crash around me. I had felt nothing touch me. Not a flying piece of glass. Not a rod of metal crashed against my arms.

I looked around. The employee was bleeding from his leg and he wasn't moving. 

He was buried underneath boxes and the scaffolding.

I, in some way, had been completely unharmed. I stood in the perfect spot as the scaffolding fell towards me. Nothing hit me.



I got home with my new mirror the store gave to me.

I thought about that man. He'd been crushed. His leg was fractured and he had gotten a concussion. The paramedics said he was lucky. ""But, you are a miracle,"" they told me.

I leaned my new mirror - covered in construction paper - against the side of my couch.

I looked at the old mirror sitting on the table.

My mind went blank for a second.

*Why?* Is all I could think for a good moment.

""Who are you?! Where am I?!""

Last I could remember I'd been leaving work, listening to ""Another Day In Paradise"" by Phil Collins. It had in fact been another day in paradise, if that paradise were a 9-5 cubicle job being berated by angry clients.

""Dead."" said the voice, nonchalant as could be.

""...Dead... Like deceased, heart-stopped dead?"" I asked incredulously. 

""Physically no more."" Came the reply. 

“Hmm… Well if that’s true, why can I still talk? Why do I still have my voice?""

“It’s transitionally appropriate."" Was all I was given. 

I was growing impatient with these short answers, and the ominous circumstances didn't help. 

""Whatever this bullshit is, I want out! Did my wife put you up to this? Karen for God's sake enough is enough!""
 
“Karen is not.”

“Is not what?”

“Is not.”

“What.”

The voice seemed to laugh, as well as it could. It sounded unbearably like logs in a washing machine.

“The world you left is not real. Your illusionary constructs of experience are but that; illusions.” It said, matter-of-fact.

“I was married for 36 years! I had two wonderful kids! I didn’t just imagine that!”

The voice laughed again, then sighed deeply.

“Next trial in 3… 2… 1…”

I felt an intense warping pain, as if my brain was being forced through my wedding ring.

“The most amusing part is that you actually believed you were human this whole time!” I heard the voice say, the guttural laugh fading behind it.

"[TT] It's been three years since that curse turned you into a dragon. As much as you've tried to cling to your refined nobility, your draconian urges are getting harder and harder to ignore.",KairuofKairu,"Three years passed  
Slowly, day by day, hour by hour, minute by minute  
Each second an eternity  
The unexpected side effect


Cursed by a witch  
My body was lost  
First she gained scales and a tail  
Then she grew into a giant


A dragon she had become  
Breaths of fire, scales the hardness of diamonds  
She sparkled like treasure  
Her mind remaining


At first she stayed at court  
Humble as she was  
Then they came  
The urges that left her different, alone


The left the court and then it turned worse  
She had to gather shiny items  
Coins, gems, swords  
A hoard had to be gathered 


After finding a cave she begun   
First some treasure chests from castles  
Then the swords from knights who wished to end her  
Lastly she dug into the Earth itself, finding her gems


Her resistance had weakened  
The urges taking over  
With the curse complete her mind turned into that of a dragon  
Her only remaining urge, grow the hoard, kidnap all the princesses and princes

You find the beings responsible and figure out the truth.",MuseTheMoose,"The probe's initial analysis is completed. Local taps into their global communications networks are now relaying much we could not access before in the outbound transmissions. What we have found greatly disturbs me. Most sentient species we have encountered share some form of mnemonic transference. Our own Pheromone Engram Protein Encapsulation. The Rikala's touch telepathy. Even the Nznznznzn blood passing of genetic memory. 

The StoryTellers do not have an inherent method of sharing memories and experiences. They rely exclusively on artificial record keeping. This lack of certainty and trust have driven a cyclic history of conflict and divisiveness. While it is true that they use fiction and various mediums to explore ideas and perform discourse... Much of what we have seen … was direct informational sharing and historical record. Worse because of the lack of personal verification and unreliability of witnesses in their culture we are having to conduct an in-depth review of everything to separate fact from fiction. 

One thing is clear from local scans. Their technological progress has been confirmed at scale 7 with only robotic interplanetary capability. This at least can rule out some of the more outlandish accounts gathered. We have also ruled out any previous encounters with interstellar species of any kind. Yet the most stark revelation for many of us… Was that world wars actually occurred, at least in some form. The chemical weapons were not allegories of the noxious nature of monarchies and colonialism. The Nuclear blasts … were not interpretations of the emergence of globalization ending the old world paradigms. Billions died, and the current depictions of suffering are literal. 

It would seem that the lessons we can learn from humanity is not the transcendence of conflict in form… but thankfulness in freedom from distrust. Contact discussions are now being revised in light of the new evidence.

Relics of a bygone era, kept around for posterity, to remind us of what we'd lost. I pitied them, a little. Like a paralyzed athlete, the violins and trumpets had forgotten how to sing. The greatest Stradivarius sat beside the cheapest violin, the same in our eyes.

I stood by the instruments, watching the children run by. Always, they came for field trips to learn about the death of music. Ridiculous. How could you teach them how much of a loss music was? They'd never known it. Already I see them slipping on ear buds and listening to podcasts. Well, 'podcasts'. I use the term lightly, it's all inane babble about the latest trends, interwoven with a healthy supply of advertisements. I'm ashamed to admit it, but those tracks got me through the lonely nights in the museum, so there was some merit to them.

I sigh, and run my finger over a display guitar. The art of making the instruments hadn't been lost, and they left a couple of models out for people to try out. Watch as the strings rattled and vibrated, yet no sound ever came out. I thought it disrespectful, frankly, and hadn't done it yet. I wasn't going to revel in the death of music.

As I turned to leave, my finger caught on one of the strings, and a soft tone sounded out. The museum immediately came to a hush, rowdy children glancing up in curiosity, old men looking up from their newspapers in hope. I glanced about the room, and took a step back.

""No, no,"" the curator stepped over, his walking stick clacking on the ground. God, why did he have to be here today?

""Come, boy, try it,"" he lifted the guitar up to my hands. His eyes were filled with trepidation, as if he didn't dare hope. He drew a pick from his wallet, where it had been for decades, and handed it to me too.

I lifted my hands to the guitar, mimicking the pose I'd seen often in the old videos and photos. George Marius, the curator, had been an orchestral conductor once, and I suppose I owed it to him to at least try. Also, he was my boss, and I rather liked my job.

Tentatively, carefully, I took the pick from his hands, and began to play. I'd spent time pantomiming playing to sheet music before, and the guitar began to play.

What ensued was the most terrible, screeching caterwaul, that made me wish I had never been blessed with the sense of hearing. A sound so horrific, the loss of all music was justified if only it had managed to rid the world of this.

George took it from my hands, and walked away. He wasn't angry, I think, just disappointed. The reason I could play the guitar was because none of the sounds my hands conjured could come close to being considered music. We never spoke of this again.

But he wasn't looking for boxes stuffed with memories long forgotten, he was looking for something special.  His great grandfathers beat up acoustic guitar had been sitting in his parents attic for as long as he could remember. 

As a child he had asked his mother about the instrument but she just shook her head sadly.  She remembered the days the family would sit in the living room and listen to her grandfather play.  She said his playing only paled in comparison to his singing.  

Jack picked up the guitar, it's worn wood was smooth in his hands.  He cleared a spot off of an old box and sat down.  Guitar strung across his shoulders he placed his fingers on the frets and strummed.

The most beautiful out of tune note vibrated throughout the attic.  A rush of excitement flooded Jack as he picked at the loose strings.  He had no idea what he was doing but it felt good, it felt right.

In the past no one would have called what he was doing music, but it was the most beautiful thing Jack had ever heard.  It was perfect.  

He found an old yellowed sheet of music inside the guitar case.  He spent every day inside the stuffy attic tuning the guitar and teaching himself how to read the music.  If he was going to give music back to the world, he wanted to do it right.

Day after day he practiced until his fingers bled.  He practiced until thick callouses covered his fingers.  He practiced until the song became automatic.  

The day finally arrived for him to play his music.  He gathered everyone in the town's amphitheater.  It didn't get much use but occasionally a play was performed there.  

Today the theater was packed.  People came from all over to see if what Jack had said was true.  In their hearts they knew they would be disappointed, but they desperately wanted to believe.

Jack stepped out onto the stage, his heart pounding in his ears.  The crowd was enormous.  Every eye was fixated on Jack and his worn acoustic guitar. 

He leaned into the microphone, ""thank you for being here everyone.""

He cleared his throat.

""Anyway here's Wonderwall.""

And he began to play.

I can still remember how that music used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while

But February made me shiver
With every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep
I couldn't take one more step

I can't remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride
But something touched me deep inside
The day the music died

[Chorus:]
So bye, bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

[Verse 1]
Did you write the book of love
And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so?
Now do you believe in rock and roll?
Can music save your mortal soul?
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?

Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues

I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
But I knew I was out of luck
The day the music died

[Chorus:]
I started singing bye, bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

[Verse 2]
Now for ten years we've been on our own
And moss grows fat on a rollin' stone
But that's not how it used to be
When the jester sang for the king and queen
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me

Oh, and while the king was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned

And while Lenin read a book on Marx
The quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died

[Chorus:]
We were singing bye, bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

[Verse 3]
Helter skelter in a summer swelter
The birds flew off with a fallout shelter
Eight miles high and falling fast
It landed foul on the grass
The players tried for a forward pass
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast

Now the halftime air was sweet perfume
While the sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
Oh, but we never got the chance

'Cause the players tried to take the field
The marching band refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died?

[Chorus:]
We started singing bye, bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye
And singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

[Verse 4]
Oh, and there we were all in one place
A generation lost in space
With no time left to start again
So come on, Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
'Cause fire is the devil's only friend

Oh, and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in Hell
Could break that Satan's spell

And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight
The day the music died

[Chorus:]
He was singing bye, bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye
And singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

[Outro]
I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away
I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play

And in the streets, the children screamed
The lovers cried and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken

And the three men I admire most
The Father, Son and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died

[Chorus:]
And they were singing bye, bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

[Chorus:]
They were singing bye, bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye
And singin' this'll be the day that I die

[WP] You have done it. You are the grand champion of the Pokémon world. You claimed the title at the age of 10 and have never lost a match since. You are 35 years old now and feel...,PuzzledKitty,"To put it shortly, Ash was… bored. 

In his early thirties, Ash was already beginning to bald. His… whatever hat he became Pokemon Master in, once worn to conceal his chronic case of bedhead, was now used to hide his receding hairline. 

He leaned back in his rolling chair, his feet propped on his desk in front of him. Ash continued to stare at the ceiling, an activity that had become habitual, and counted the dots in his ceiling tiles again. He’d counted this specific ceiling tile over twenty times. He calculated his ceiling must average thirty-million plus dots. 

He calculated it on his Pokedex. He hadn’t had a chance to use it in a several years.

As a Pokemon master, there wasn’t exactly much to do. There were no more worlds to conquer. 

Who could even challenge me now, he thought. I’ve caught every Pokemon in the entire world! I had just enough Master Balls too, luckily, I even got all of the legendries. I spent every waking hour of my life to be the best. And I am the best. 

And being the best is boring. 

Ash looked around his office. His dull fluorescent lightbulb put a painful, unceasing tinge to everything he squinted at. He looked out the window of his office into his stadium-lit gym courtyard. 

It was everything Ash had wanted. After he had become a Pokemon Master, Ash settled down and became a Electric Gym Leader. Pikachu had retired shortly after the gym was completed. Being Ash’s ace-in-the-hole for so many years had taken its toll on the electric chinchilla. 

He continued to stroke the still napping Pikachu on his lap and gaze out the window into his gym. 

Was this all worth it? He looked around his office again. I’ve spent so much of my life forcing my animals to fight for me, and got so good at it, that I missed the point of doing it in the first place. 

He thought back to every hard fought battle on his way to becoming a Master. The endless hours of training, backpacking through the Japanese (?) countryside, camping out every night with his best friends –at the time –, stargazing and dreaming to be… here. Where he is. 

Now, what’s the point of even training, he thought. I can’t make it any more difficult for someone to beat me. I’ve beaten every single scrub that managed to crawl into my league. I haven’t lost in my monthly battles against the other gym leaders, either! 

I’ve got a house. A loving Pokemon Sanctuary/Training Camp filled to the brim with 
the epitomes of nature, and none of it matters anymore to me. 

His friends had their own lives. I’m pretty sure every member of the first season was now a Gym Leader of some kind. Misty was obviously still a Water Gym 
Leader, uh, Bru-, Brock? Brock. Was an Earth Gym Leader. All the other cast members were still doing their thing. 

When’s the last time I’ve HAD a visitor? Everyone is so busy, all of my trainees are on their own adventures now, all I’ve got to do is hold down the fort. If only an actual challenge would step through my doors. But, “Noooo!” no one wants to go into an Electric Gym with a Zapdos! That’s too hard. 
Really? Then how the Hell did I catch it? Is it just kids getting whimpier nowadays? 
Whose mother WOULDN’T send their child out at age ten into the wilderness to catch animals and live off the land? Also with no money? 

I hear kids are getting allowances now too. They’d never survive like I did. Going days without food, catching our own food, well, sending our Pokemon to do it. Ah, that was the life. 

Ash stood up from his chair, his knees cracking from the change in position. A drowsy Pikachu, slowly slipping into dementia, was momentarily unaware of its surroundings. Pikachu began to charge a bolt of electricity, the crackling static popped around Ash’s arms. 

“Whoa, calm down, buddy,” Ash said, attempting to remind Pikachu that he wasn’t being kidnapped for the thousandth time in his life. 
Pikachu looked up at Ash, his almost anime-like eyes still sparkled in the florescent lighting. Ash stared back at Pikachu, re-seeing the once fiery tempered, untamable Ponyta that wouldn’t even, hell, still wouldn’t, be couped in a Pokeball. 

Time had seemed to age Pikachu just as rapidly as himself to Ash. There was a slight glaze hiding the real shine from Pikachu’s eyes that denoted his age. Despite his still almost plush-soft fur, Pikachu was getting old too. 

Ash put Pikachu back in his seat, Pikachu hazily curled back up and went back to sleep. He quietly exited his office and walked to the center of his gym. 

He began to pace the outline of his arena. I’m only thirty, he reminded himself, that’s way too early for a midlife crisis. Maybe it was all the stress, the adrenaline pumping through my veins during every battle. The thrill of losing everything I had fought for. The feeling of clawing your way to the top. It must have been the stress that wore me out so fast, he touched the top of his hat wear his bald spot would show. 

He continued to pace the room, sticking out his arms like a tightrope walker as he balanced on the chalk line. 

“I guess I can go read a book, or something. How long has it been since I’ve done that? I can sit down with Zapdos for something, maybe,” he said out loud to himself. The empty gym’s walls echoed his musings to him as he continued to stare at the line. 

Ash heard the door open, the light from outside still seemed bright as he made out a silhouette in the shadowy edges of his gym. 

“Hi, I’m here to challenge you.” Some boy said… confidently. It was a sound Ash hadn’t heard in a long time.

Lianne Trouvart, a squib who was assigned to help wizards with electronics, given her quality Muggle education, quietly sighed, thinking that the subject of dealing with muggles should be mandatory for everyone, especially the Supreme Mugwump.


Supreme Mugwump's name was terribly common and he hated being called like that, but Trevor Collins was exactly the name he was told to use by the Prime Minister. He absolutely hated that in Hogwarts during the Potions lessons he was always called ""grumpy toad"" since Professor Longbottom used to have a toad called Trevor.


Oh, why is he remembering it now?


""Mr. Collins, you're on in 5 minutes!"" - said a muggle technician, not knowing a tiniest bit of information he was about to receive.


""Ms. Trouvart, please..."" - Collins was almost begging, and she quietly pressed the button next to grey big letters forming ""ON"".


Collins felt air leaving his lungs very quickly. He was definitely not prepared for any of this.


""Who chose such an awful time to start the broadcast?"" - shouted a man who seem to have appeared out of nowhere. He had flaming red hair, bottle-green eyes and was wearing round glasses, just like...


""Your grandfather, Mr. Harry Potter, who else?""


Harry Potter Jr. grimaced. The Potters were obviously doomed to be in a shade of The Boy Who Lived for all eternity, and while he turned out to be an amazing and loving grandfather, hearing about him every day was very exhausting for the large amount of Potters he left to roam the world after his passing. It was also awful because they knew he won't come back and they will never be just like him.


Lianne blushed, trying not to look at Potter. He was in his early forties and managed to stay unmarried and consumed with the idea of uniting their world with this of muggles, but a desk job didn't make him look like a typical office employee she see a lot while living among muggles. Heck, she even *married* one of them, but was left with nothing but disappointment in the long run. Then she lived together with a wizard, and of course he couldn't stand how long in took her to cook and clean as a squib. Basically she knew that as a 35 years old squib she wasn't meant to be a wife and a mother in any family, be it a muggle family or a wizard family. Yet she just couldn't deny the fact that she was in love with that ginger workaholic.


""Lianne,"" - said Potter, finally noticing her, - ""are you organizing the speech?"" She nodded and he continued, concerned look on his face, - ""please let me see the speech, I'm afraid he'll just fuck it up!""


Lianne blushed again, in all those years she knew Potter she never heard him talk like this. She gave him a copy of the speech and continued to look at the floor.


""No, no, no, this is insane!"" - Potter exhaled, - ""Lianne, he'll never manage to get to muggles' souls with this!""


She knew well enough that he was absolutely right about this. The Supreme Mugwump was an excellent person for his job, but it didn't include talking to muggles in a form of speech as a close perspective, so he never bothered with training to do that.


""What do you think we... can be done?"" - she mumbled, her face betraying her calmness with blood painting her skin bright pink. Thankfully Potter was barely looking at her.


""It's 10:30 and I don't know..."" - he said, closing his mouth with his left hand, the move Lianne knew well enough.


""I completely forgot what I'm supposed to say, Ms. Trouvart, did you say it would appear in the air or what?"" - shouted Collins. As Potter proceeded to full facepalm, a word she learned from her ex-husband, she quickly thought. Yes, she had a solution...


""We should do it, Mr. Potter,"" - she said bravely. Potter looked at her in horror.


""We? I am a bloody irrelevant office wizard, and you are a squib with a degree in engineering, what are *we* supposed to say?""


""Precisely!"" - shouted Lianne, interrupting him. ""Muggles can relate to anything we'd say because we were building a bridge between us and them, the bridge they will cross today!""


Her face was burning red, and Potter suddenly remembered how she looked when she applied for a job in his department.


""Alright, no time to think. Mr. Collins, I and Li... Ms. Trouvart will speak instead!""


Luckily Collins didn't think it necessary to object and disappeared instantly.


""3, 2, 1, on!""


Lianne and Potter exchanged glances. They weren't ready, but who ever was?


""Hello, UK! We are speaking to you from, some would say, another world, though we are always right next to you! My name is Harry Potter Jr. and I'm joined by Lianne Trouvart to tell you that magic, *real* magic exists!""


After a long speech followed by a big Q&amp;A session Harry and Lianne were finally able to take a break from work.


""You know,"" - said Harry, - ""when I was in Hogwarts I had some private lessons in legilimency.""


Lianne didn't even know how her face could've gotten anymore red. ""So,"" - Harry continued, ""I just realized I should have used my skills more often, especially around seven years ago.""


Lianne only had energy to mumble: ""So you don't mind me being a squib?""


""I wouldn't mind you being a muggle, Lianne"".


Well... it didn't necessarily mean that Lianne would become a Potter soon, but a date was definitely secured, at last.  ",ViaDiva

The messy haired young man was staring into his glass swirling the contents and probing it with his eyes. It was poured cold from a tap, just like the beers back home, but it was warm in his mouth as soon as he tasted it, and the warmth spread down his throat and into his belly. Almost like the liquid itself was causing his body to warm.

But after three glasses and over an hour of staring, the man was forced to admit to himself that the effect on his cognitive functions was the same. He glanced up to find his collection of companions gesturing wildly with their Butterbeer mugs splashing and spillling over as the other young men at the table conversed amongst each other. Bets were offered and accepted, wild explanations were spun and the overpowering energy of curious young men preparing for an adventure dominated the room. He felt the familiar pull of old memories attempt to worm into the forefront of his thoughts, but with a shake of his head and a signal to the bartender, the young man shoved the familiar routine away and addressed his companions.

""Pitter patter fellas. What'cha say we finish our round and get at'er."" His companions smirked. No sooner had the bartender placed the messy-haired young mans new Butterbeer on the table, than the man grabbed it and upended the contents into his mouth and shoving his chair back while rising to his feet. ""Say bartender,"" the messy haired young man pulled a few bills out of a pocket, ""Where's the entrance to the dragon alley with the goblin bank. We were told to check here.""

Wordlessly the bartender pointed to a flat brick wall while he eyed the small pile of bills on the bartop with a raised eyebrow.

With all the confident swagger of a 28 year old traveller who's drank 4 pints of wizard beer, the messy haired man swivelled to face the wall. His face fell and his balance wavered. There was no door. He glanced left and right along the wall. No handles, no hallways, and definitely no door.

""You've got to walk into it."" The bartender leaned over the bar and the man's companions turned to face the bar while the messy haired man continued to stare at the bricks. ""It works the same way as our train stations do. It looks like a wall, but it ain't. Walk through it, but don't stop.""

Somewhere in the back of the young man's mind he felt a needle of doubt. He felt like the new kid on the playground again, and a memory of reaching his hand into a hole full of baby snakes flashed across his mind. But the Butterbeers and the man's ego combined to shut out his misgivings. With a long step, the messy haired young man took three powerful steps and, arms swinging, feet marching, head high, smashed right into a solid wall of brick.

Instantly he crumpled to his knees,his nose started dripping red, and he leaned his head on the wall. The bar was silent.

With a ragged breath, the messy haired young man turned to face the bartender and sagged back against the wall. His eyes pleaded a question.

The bartender's eyes flashed, but it was a voice from across the room that turned the crowd's head.

""This ain't a zoo you filthy muggle. You may have learned about us on the telly tonight, and you might think you have a clue, but you don't. You wanted to walk in our streets, laugh out our people, and pay useless money for good beer. There are things in that alley that are smarter and more dangerous than you could ever imagine, and you wanted to get drunk and wander around with the monsters and the clowns."" A young woman in a long green cloak rose from a table near the entrance and continued her speech.

""You deserved that wall, sir. That is an entrance to Diagon Alley, but if you don't have the skill to open it, or even the decency to educate yourself about how our world operates, then a brick's kiss is all you'll see here. Now take your friends and be gone from this place, before your idiocy ceased to be amusing and begins to become insulting."" With a stomp and whirl of her cloak, the woman strode out the door, leaving a shocked silence behind her.

The young man with the red shirt began to shuffle to his feet slowly, ""Say bartender, does that mean I can't get another of those delicious Butterbeers?""",dukew008

He surveyed the oval office with the tired eyes that only a lame duck, second term president could have. *First Donald Trump, now this?* he thought as he glanced at the clock. 9:47 p.m. *Forty-five minutes until all hell breaks loose.* He took another sip of his drink and looked back at the strange note lying on his desk. It wasn't regular paper, you see. It seemed to be...well, parchment, of all things.

*""My dear Mr. President Obama,*

*As you have known, since the beginning of your presidency, that a magical world exists in parallel to your own. Every country in the world has its own magical governing body and leader, just as you non-magical folks do. I am Sebastian Abernathy, the Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards. To put it lightly, I'm in charge of all the wizards, and our world, on Earth.* 

*I do apologize that I can't meet with you personally to explain what's going to take place this evening, especially since we are going to cause quite a stir. You see, for a long time, the wizarding world has lived in the shadows. Our governing bodies go to great lengths to ensure that non-magical peoples are unaware of our existence, aside from important leaders, such as yourself. After much consideration, we have decided to live in the shadows no more. At 10:32 p.m., I will be broadcasting to the world via your Television and Internet mechanisms - we've had to bring a ~~muggle~~, sorry, non-magical person in to assist us with this, it's been a nightmare - to inform the world of our existence. We've been prepping for it for quite some time. Ms. Rowling has been a most excellent help to us with her wonderful publications on our recent history. Our world, and your world, are too dangerous for either race to continue without cooperation from each other. Preliminary research tells us that this will be a relatively smooth transition into the open.*

*Anyway, I am aware that your term as President of the United States is about to end, but the International Confederation of Wizards has great respect for you and are sorry to see you go. The President of MACUSA will be in to strategize tomorrow. I'll try to pop in soon for some lunch. You know how to reach me.*

It had come today, on the lazy Tuesday afternoon following Thanksgiving, while he was perusing some briefs on ISIS activity over the weekend. Since then, he'd told Alice, his secretary, to hold all calls and cancel all of his meetings. He'd even refused to see Joe - he didn't want to try to begin explaining this to him. 

He remembered very clearly that Friday morning, about a week after taking office, that a strangely dressed, intimidating woman had appeared in the oval office out of nowhere. Barack had been sure he was about to be attacked, and had immediately reached for the red button on his phone. ""Don't bother,"" she'd said. ""No one will answer it anyway."" She'd sat down across from him and introduced herself as Meredith Goldstein, President of the Magical Congress of the United States of America - MACUSA for short. She'd explained that those *Harry Potter* books weren't works of fiction, but histories released to the ""no-maj"" world to slowly begin the integration of the magical world with the normal (his word) world. Meredith explained that she'd made everyone in his office think he was having a private meeting with his VP, Joe, and that they were not to be disturbed under *any* circumstances. Barack had read *Harry Potter* with Sasha and Malia a long time ago, and remembered being moved by the books. It took him several weeks to digest the information that had been given to him.

But now, eight years later, at the end of his term in office, as he sat watching the clock, and savoring that fine single-malt whisky Michelle had given him for his birthday, he began to laugh. He recalled reading that first chapter of the sixth Potter book with the girls, and how frantic that poor British Prime Minister had been, and thinking, *Wouldn't that be ridiculous?* It was horribly ironic now. 

His eyes travelled back to the clock. 10:25 p.m. Seven more minutes. He could see the benefits of this, and the negatives. Terrorism at an all time high, at least with ""non-magical"" folks. He wondered if that was a problem with wizards. He knew about Voldemort, of course, and, thanks to the books, Gindelwald before him. He wondered if Voldemort had a successor. It could also mean an end to cancer, and modern diseases. And maybe they would share their ability to travel across the world in a matter of seconds. That would be great. No more terrible plane rides or motorcades. Barack finished off his drink and smiled. Sasha and Malia would be so happy. They'd wished since they read the first book that *Harry Potter* was real. It would probably all be okay. 

Alice quietly opened the office door and poked her head in. ""Barack...I think you'd better turn on CNN...There's something you ought to see..."" 10:33 p.m. *Damn, I missed his opening comments...*

Meanwhile, four decades, a thousand miles, and in a different story, Ms. Goodwin of Painswick, Gloucestershire, pens a letter she meant to write long ago.",ShiningRayde,"*Fuck. This isn't how I do things.* 

It wasn't often that I felt any sort of remorse for what I did, but this feeling may be bordering on it. God damn unprofessional. 

I grabbed the guard I had just strangled and hauled him up off the cold stone floor. I didn't even need to see the direction I was taking his body, I had memorized the floor plan. I spun around when my heel touched the cupboard and pulled it open. I kicked his body in, concealing it beneath ragged clothes. ""I'll clean it up later"" I muttered. 

*I shouldn't have to clean anything up. He shouldn't of been there.*

""Fuck"" I mouthed. My eyes gazed over my exit route, a door that led to a balcony which I could then climb my way down, via a rope that was in my backpack. I'd spent months planning this out, jeopardized because that damn guard skipped his niece's birthday. Too late for him, he's dead now.

*Maybe I misjudged the situation. Not like I have any family to reflect his potential actions off anyway.*

My eyes started to water. Even though I'd done it with a calm precision, I realized that he was my first kill. What of his family, what of that niece. What a terrible birthday surprise. I gulped. I could recognize my own fallacies, I was being emotionally unstable.

*Just get it done.*

I inhaled then exhaled. The mission was still doable. The next guard shift wouldn't be here for the next hour, plenty of time. I silently traversed across the room, now standing at the base of the stairwell. I upholstered my revolver and held it with both hands. Filled with blanks of course, not like any assailants would suspect that anyway. I smiled as I reached the top floor. This was a god damn mansion, Lord Hein could do without the millions I would steal from him. 

""You! Who goes there?"" Shouted a guard, having spotted me at the end of the hall. I rolled my eyes. What kind of egomaniac would instruct their guards to say that upon finding an intruder?

*You're justifying it. It's theft, plain and simple.*

""Who the fuck do you think you are?"" I shouted back, attempting to sound like a relative of Lord Hein. ""Uh.. You're supposed to be here?"" He said back, now sounding more like a scared child instead of an armed guard. I held back a smile, ah the things confidence can do. I visibly shook my head, sighed, and walked into Hein's bedroom. 

""Not even in a safe"" I mouthed. I couldn't believe my eyes. $3 Million worth of jewelry, laying on the bedside frame. I hurriedly took out a protective pouch from my backpack and carefully inserted the jewelry into it. I composed myself and walked right out, nodding to the guard as I went.

""You have great hair, and you take really good care of it,"" I add as an afterthought. ""It makes your friends really jealous. You should be proud.""

The new librarian smiles tentatively, but his brows are still pinched together in worry. 

This was supposed to be a routine cheering run. I'd felt the call of someone feeling down and followed it to the library, where I found the new librarian feeling stressed about his new job. But it was a trap - the pessimystic had felt it too. She'd been waiting outside. 

She followed me in, and damn, was she strong!

""Seems like every entry-level position wants experience nowadays,"" the pessimystic continues. Her voice is louder, now. She's getting closer. ""But how are you supposed to get experience if everyone just keeps kicking you to the curb? Isn't it tempting to just let yourself give up?""

She's right. It is tempting to give up. 

I hesitate. 

The pessimystic turns the corner of the bookshelf. ""There you are,"" she says. ""Finally.""

That's when I catch sight of the pessimystic's high heels. They're brand new. Shiny. Well cared for. 

""You really like your shoes,"" I tell her. ""They make you feel confident, right?""

The pessimystic recoils. ""An optimystic-!""

""You love wearing them, even though everyone tells you they should be uncomfortable,"" I say, taking a step forward as I push my advantage, and then another. ""But they aren't uncomfortable for you. They help you stay self-assured. Because even without then, you're self assured - they just make you feel even better. Even without them you're happy.""

""Y-yeah,"" the pessimystic says, eyes wide. The corner of her mouth tilts up into the beginning of a disbelieving grin. ""I... I never thought of it that way.""

""And you-"" I turn to the new librarian. ""Even though you're feeling tired and stressed, you're enjoying what you're doing. You enjoy being independent. You don't want to give it up, even if it hurts, even if you have to keep on searching for a job for the next decade. You enjoy being self reliant. You love it.""

The librarian slowly smiles. ""I guess I do,"" he says. ""I really do.""

I can't help a little smile of my own. ""I'm glad to hear that,"" I tell them both, before reaching for my wallet. ""Here,"" I say, handing each of them my card. 'Optimystic Solutions' says the front in curling script, with my number underneath. ""If you're ever feeling down, or stressed, or worried - you know who to call.""

[WP] You're just a normal NPC seeing all the crazy shit the main protagonist is doing.,Sunny_Sunday,"This one sees a strange man talking to Khayla. 

“They’ll never see you coming,” she says, and the stranger hands her five jingly coin purses. Training appears to be as lucrative a business as trading. Maybe this one should aspire to be a trainer instead?

When the transaction is complete, the stranger squats right down. Khajiit is surprised – the man has suddenly disappeared! – but Khayla does not seem to register this act of sorcery. In fact, no one does! Atahbah continues to talk as if the man is still present and Ma’randru-jo continues to tan his leather. How peculiar.

“You may want to be more selective who you train in the arts of sneaking,” this one suggests to Khayla. “One never knows if good or bad intentions lurk beneath another’s hood.”

“Huh?” she starts, but the stranger curiously materialises now just in front of Ri’saad’s tent. We turn to watch.

The man must have cast a powerful spell on Ri’saad too. The usually wise trader sells him the last of our moon sugar and other choice goods at a generous bargain. Too generous! 

The stranger jogs off towards the Whiterun stables without even a word of thanks.

What? He even left his horse! Who does that? Is he expecting Khajiit to tend his steed for him? When the stables are on his way? This is exasperating. Khajiit takes the reins before the beast can accidentally trample our tents. 

Walking it over to the stables, Khajiit turns to ask: “Why, Ri’saad? You refused to sell those goods when the merchant woman offered you those prices.”

“Ah, but you see, I had to. This buyer wore an Amulet of Zenithar.”

Spying what must have been a look of utter confusion on this one’s face, Ri’saad spoke in an assuring voice: “Don’t worry, Ma’kobo. Ri'saad will teach you all about the Nord amulets and how to recognise enchanted jewellery.”

Ma'kobo misses his home greatly. He thinks he still has much to learn about this cold, hard land, and his whiskers are always frozen.

"[WP] The signs were there, if only I had paid more attention. This wasn't her, it was just a monster wearing her face.",SurvivorType,"I can still remember the good times. In fact, my earliest memory is still one of the happiest days of my life. We were out in the backyard, me--my momma, and dad--sitting on a checkered blanket for a picnic. I had just barely turned three; I remember that because I had my stuffed lion that I got for my birthday that year. His name was Roar, after the sound my dad would make whenever he played with him. That day was a good day. The sun was warming us from above and we all had each other, we were together. 


I sometimes question whether this memory is even real. Now that I know what their marriage was really like, I wonder if that day hadn’t been as perfect as I remembered it. Maybe there was some unseen hatred boiling under the surface that my young mind was too naive to detect. Maybe I just wanted to pretend it wasn’t there. I think I like to continue to pretend, so that there is a good time to look back on.


Then there’s the day when I could no longer pretend. I was six this time. The details aren’t as clear as the last time but I do remember that day. I remember the angry screaming, the sharp sound of smashing glass, and the agonizing gasps of my mother’s sobbing. She had told me to stay upstairs that night, even when my father came home. I didn’t think anything of it until the noises started. Not knowing what else to do, I hid in the cabinet at the top of the stairs. It was my favorite hiding spot when playing hide-and-seek, no one could ever find me. After that day it became my hiding spot during times of panic.


I remember sitting in the dark, my hands over my ears trying to block out the sounds. The screaming, smashing, and sobbing. I rocked back and forth, trying to convince myself it wasn’t happening. The chaos reached a crescendo as I heard more yelling followed by the front door slamming. The vibrations carried into my hiding spot, shaking the safety I had left. 


I’m not sure how or when I slept, but I do know I awoke with a start. I found myself still in the cabinet; that and my tear-streaked face were proof that it had been more than a dream. As I emerged from my bunker, I was surprised to be greeted by the light of the morning. I thought someone would have come looking for me before then. Cautiously, I went downstairs to assess the damage. I saw my mother lying on the floor of the kitchen unconscious, surrounded by broken glass, wine bottles, and her own vomit.


The next few months were a tumultuous blur of strange people asking me questions, being taken to various courthouses, and finding my mother in various stages of drunk and unconscious. At first she was mostly sad. She would call me to her, usually on the floor where she was sitting, and hold me close while she sobbed. She would become hysterical, telling me what a monster my father was and how he had ruined her life. 


She used that word a lot. Monster. Always to describe my father. I asked her what she meant once and she told me that monsters live all around us, inside ordinary people. They hide around us, wearing the faces of those we love. Monsters liked to get close to you, lull you into security then rip it all away from you. They used you for what good things you had--your youth, your money, your beauty, your love--but only gave bad things back to you, destroying you in the process. 


These episodes made me uncomfortable--who wouldn’t be seeing their mother in such a state?--but I didn’t want to see my mother so upset, so defeated. I would sit with her and listen. I would listen and believe it and then tell all those same things to those strange people; caseworkers, that’s what they called them.


I didn’t really understand at the time, but suddenly all that changed, something was decided. I know now that the divorce had been finalized. My mother was determined to keep custody of me; she said I was the only thing she couldn’t let him get. My father, who apparently was expecting a baby with his mistress, didn’t care enough to put up a fight. We had to move--the house was sold and the profit split--and we found an apartment on the other side of town.


From then on, what illusion I had of a happy family life was gone. My father almost never visited or spent time with me, despite the fact that he had visitation days.  My mother continued the drinking; even worse now that she didn’t have to show up to court. She was almost constantly drunk. Sometimes it was with friends or the men she met but usually it was alone. The sad episodes between me and her turned into flashes of anger. She would call me to her, screeching with rage if I didn’t obey. Then she would tell me of some fault of mine or tell me how I was a burden. She would eventually get bored with this and shove me away. 


I would try to spend as much time out of the house as possible. I made friends in school and tried to stay at their houses for as long as I could. Eventually the inevitable would occur and I would have to go home. My mother usually didn’t notice I was back or that I was even gone in the first place. A few times, however, she would decide to care and I would have to face her wrath. She would scream at me, tell me that I was hurting her, that I was why she had to be like this. She would slap me sometimes too. My mother had always like keeping her nails long. Before, they had been pristinely manicured; now, however, they were raggled and chipped. She liked to paint them red too. There’s a part of me that thinks this was so that, when she hit me she could tell herself the red marks on my face were just from the polish.


This went on for years. Elementary school turned into middle school; middle school to high school. While other kids were learning to ride bikes and struggling with their homework I was just trying to make sure there was enough food in the house for both of us. Money was getting tight as more and more of the alimony checks were used for booze. It didn’t help that on some of my mother’s binges she would scour the kitchen for anything and everything to eat. I took to hiding food in odd places just so that we could stretch it out further.


I took care of my mother. Like that scared child all those years before I didn’t want to see her hurting. She was still my mother and I felt obligated to help her. I took her slaps and her anger and my own hunger. My father had hurt us both, after all.


When I was sixteen I got my first job. My mother was beyond the point of caring if I was home so I hid it, and the money I made, from her. Sure, it was some cashier job at a local burger joint, but it was one of the most liberating things I had experienced. It was the first time that I was able to be truly independent, to be able to do something for myself. There were some months when most of my check went to making up for the money my mother was spending, but what I could keep I cherished. I didn’t really by anything--there was nothing I wanted that could be bought--but just having my own personal stash was a comfort.


One night, I returned from my shift to find my mother sitting at the kitchen table, a bottle of whiskey beside her. This was odd: usually at this time she had either left or was passed out on the couch. From the way that she swayed as she sat, I could tell that it was taking effort for her to still be awake. 


“So, you know,” she said, slurring the syllables together, “I spoke with my friend Sharon from the salon today. She told me she seen you. Know where it was?”


I didn’t answer. I didn’t need to; she had only paused for a hiccup.


“She said you’re working at some place. That you have a job.” She pointed a finger at me accusingly, the dim light glinting off of the red. “And I says, ‘Now that can’t be. I haven’t seen no money.’ But another girl in the salon backed her up. So now I’m thinking, where is this money?”


I was frozen in place, unsure how to answer. 


She slammed a fist down on the table, making me jump. “Where is it?”


“I’ve been using it to pay for our food and bills and stuff. Almost all of it has gone to our family.”


“Liar,” she shouted suddenly. “Why didn’t you tell me about this huh? You wanted to keep all that money to yourself? You didn’t think you dear, grieving mother wouldn’t want some help?”


“But I have been helping,” I retorted, getting increasingly upset. “I was using the money to spend on food.”


“Yeah your food probably. I can see how you’ve been getting fatter. Besides, we always have enough food.” 


I could feel the anger welling up inside of me. All the years of cleaning up after her and scrounging for cash to buy basic food were in the front of my mind.


She took a deep swig of whiskey. “Baby girl. I just want us to be happy and be a team. We can’t be a team if you can’t trust me? I just want my money.”


I was taken aback by her words. “Your money? *Your* money? I’ve been working and struggling and trying to help you all this time and all you can do is take--” I stopped short. The signs were there, if only I had paid more attention. This wasn’t her, it was just a monster wearing her face. 


“And where are you going?” she shouted after me.


I went to my room and grabbed what few things I could, including my box of cash that I had been hiding.


I went back into the kitchen. “Here,” I said, throwing the wads of bills at her. “This is what you want. Have it.”


She lit a cigarette and inhaled deep. “Good. Now I hope you learned your lesson.” She started picking up the money. She was so engrossed in counting it that she didn’t even notice me leave.

Props if you made it this far! It's late at night and my battery is dying but I already have some stuff I know I want to change. I'm thinking of expanding this into a larger story so any comments would be greatly appreciated!",somethingRicked
"[WP] The hero has a near-deth experience in his duel against his nemesis and ends up seeing the ghost of his dead mentor. Instead of being encouraging and helpful, however, the mentor really wanted this opportunity to chew him off.",TallenMyriad,"The sword clanged into my helmet with a viciousness that dented it inward causing a gash to form on the top of my head.  Blood began to pour down from the wound and darkness began to envelop my vision. *Had I fought this hard to to be here just to fail?* I looked up at Nathan, the greatest evil the world had ever known and my old friend.  His eyes were pitch black with a single smoldering coal in the center of both. He was raising his sword up again in what was to be a final triumphant blow. He would win and rule over the kingdom of Shallow Valley uncontested his last enemy slain. *It can't end... here.* With a surge of adrenaline, I brought up my gauntleted fist into Nathan's chin as hard and as visciously as I could. The darkness still eroding my vision, I turned to flee. Nathan had been knocked back and had fallen over but he never stayed down for long.


Panic starting to set in, I spotted an egress point. The window. It would be quite the fall from this tower but death awaited me either way. Without a second thought I jumped clear through the window knocking loose the shutters that had been in the way. CLUNK. I heard the sword impact the stones next the window as I began to fall into the darkness of night. With a single prayer of ""Please,"" I finally lost consciousness.


Bright light shined into my eyes. ""Waking up are we boy? Good, seems like you aren't dead you blessed fool."" The sound of the voice was familiar but the haze of the pain all over my body clouded my mind. ""Where? Where am I?"" I asked.


""Well not in the afterlife. At least yet. Now look boy you were foolish charging his tower alone and frankly I think I need to get this off my chest so stand up at attention and let me talk before they call me back.""


Recognition shot through me as I realized the voice was of Fai the sword master and spy that had taught me and trusted me to free our homeland. He had died at Nathan's hand saving me and the others in my band of Heros. Ignoring the pain, I stood and acknowledge my dead master. Her form cloudy and lacking substance. ""You... you're alive?"" I stuttered out.


""No you fool boy. I died at Nathans hands and nothing can bring you back from death but some damned fool god heard your prayer and sent me to save your incompetent ass yet again. Now listen here. When I sacrificed my life for you I expected you to rise to the occasion and save our homeland not doom it with your foolishness. Where are your comrades? Where is Tina? Where is Freath? Where is Garin? Where is Mondra? I'll tell you. ALL DEAD. Thanks to your inspiring leadership.""


The words stung. It was true. My failures had lead to the death of everyone. Tina had fallen to a cursed mug of ale at a tavern celebrating a minor victory. Freath had sacrificed himself to hold a pass against a battalion of Nathan's troops. Garin had taken an arrow meant for me and Mondra died on the assault on Nathan's tower being set ablaze by alchemists fire.


""I am trying Master. All those losses have left holes in my soul I don't think I'll ever fill and damn it. You died before you could complete my training!"" My pride wounded, I resorted to anger.


""Silence you idiot. I saw potential in you. Potential you have squandered. You celebrated instead of training. You allowed your friends to do for you what you should have done for yourself. My disappointment in you is deeper then my hatred for Nathan. You were never going to save the world you are dooming it. I should have chosen another apprentice. There was another hopeful right before you arrived. Sarah Flint. You will find her and bring her here to this cave. I will train her and show her how to defeat Nathan since you failings are a thousandfold. ""

Tears began to run down my cheeks as anger gave way to despair. She was right. I had failed at my quest, failed my friends. I had always thought destiny meant winning no matter the odds but time and time again I failed. I lost those closest to me and worse I had lost my mentors trust. ""Forgive me, please. I will do as you command and bring the new apprentice here. I love you master. Please forgive me."" Suddenly the weight of my injuries and the despair that overtook me brought me to my knees and I began to sob.


""Showing weakness even now. Go now. I am being recalled to the afterlife but bring the chosen here and I'll help them save the world since you have failed."" Fai said as her form began to drift away like smoke on the wind. 


Defeated and alone, I cried.",reofecthegreat

"[WP] Most irrational natural fears can be traced back to evolutionary reasons, such as Arachnophobia. What brought about our fear of things that closely mimic the human form?",TheWalrusNet,"Some things are normal to be scared of. Snakes for example, are sometimes deadly, and often impulsive. They care little for the strife of humanity, and only seek to eat, and replicate. If something impedes either of these processes, they simply eliminate the threat. This is called Ophidiophobia. The fear of spiders, arachnophobia, shares a similar evolutionary advantage. Spiders are small, and extremely venomous. They seek shelter in the places we never think to look for them, such as shoes, or dwellings. Thalassophobia, the fear of the sea, also has evolutionary roots. The sea is deep, vast. We are not sure we will ever learn all of its secrets.    

There are forms of fear with no evolutionary basis. Pediophobia, for example, is the fear of dolls. Surely there was no point in our past in which dolls were a threat. Automatonophobia. The fear of humanoid figures. Mannequins, or wax figures, again, why should man fear things that look like men? Anthropophobia, the fear of humans, even has evolutionary basis. A rival tribe, for example, would be something logical to fear.  

Some people are afraid of the dark, Achluophobia. Some people are afraid of heights, Acrophobia. But as Professor Clayton Williamson was about to discover, there is… or at least was, a good reason to fear things that look… almost human. With humanity’s proclivity for satellites, Earth’s geography had little to hide. In late 2016, a tribe was discovered deep in the Amazon river basin, which had never been contacted by modern men. 

   
It was hotly debated whether or not to seek contact with them. Surely, they must have seen an airplane? Heard a helicopter in the distance? Some sort of survey team scouting around the jungle, looking for the next million acres of trees to decimate? It was eventually decided not to make contact. They did not seek out the rest of the world, so the world decided to honor their way of life. The clan was small. They would not cause trouble, or impede the ever onward progress of mankind. No, it was decided they would be studied from afar, and Professor Williamson would lead the team into the jungle to observe the native people, in their native habitat, and under no circumstances were to interfere with any of the tribe’s day to day life. Remain hidden.   
  
Professor Williamson thought this was a good idea.  

“Besides,” he thought. “It’s human nature to fear what is different. They could be hostile toward a bunch of men with heavy equipment and research tools.”  

They set up a camp late in the night, high in the trees. They didn’t have a great view of the tribe, but they were out of their reach, and close enough to get an idea of their day to day life. Williamson learned that the tribe had learned to master fire, and had built an intricate shelter in a near perfect circle around their camp. The structure was nearly 10 feet tall at the top of the roof, which sloped down towards the outside of the circle.  It was held up by an intricate network of logs, which looked like spiderwebs. There were no solid walls. Just the logs and the roof.  
  

The tribe’s daily life took place mainly in the very center of the structure. They had wattle “homes” and other type shelters. They wore grass skirts and usually no tops, except for the leader who wore a intricately woven grass collar and had various animal parts dangling off piercings in his face and shoulders, such as feathers, claws and teeth. He was an old man, and mainly sat around talking to other tribe members. At night, through thermal imaging, they could see the tribe sitting around a blazing fire, and the leader talking and waving his hands about. Williamson decided that he was basically telling campfire stories. The tribesmen and women were fixated on the display. Williamson wrote in his journal that he believed the stories were preceded by some sort of Iowaska mixture which was popular among South American tribes.  
 

He told one story more than others though. The word “bonchik” was brought up several times. Williamson thought “bonchik” was a deity, or more correctly, an anti-deity. Not the creator, but the destroyer. During one particularly dramatic telling of a bonchik story, they flew a quadcopter drone over the camp, and silently videoed the telling through night vision. While the leader waved his arms, and danced around, a woman drew in the dirt with a carved wooden spear. She drew faces with the tip of the spear. The faces were oval, with two dots for eyes and a straight line for the mouth. It reminded Williamson of a mask he saw in the French museum “Bible et Terre Sainte,  which was made around 7,000 BC in what is now Palestine. Initially, he thought little of it.  
  
In fact, he didn’t think of again until several months after his return to his home in Vermont. Williamson was pouring over his notes from his time in South America. His note about the Palestinian mask caught his eye. He brought up a picture on his cell phone. It did bare a striking resemblance to the face in the sand, but then again, it was just three simple shapes. Perhaps there was no relationship. His mind couldn’t let the idea go. He felt restless. Even looking at the drawing in the sand made his feel inexplicably uncomfortable.   
  
He arranged a meeting with the curator the small French museum where the mask was located. The man took the mask, carefully out of the case. His white gloved hands placed the mask down on a table for Williamson to examine.   
  
“How was this mask used?” Williamson asked the curator.  

“We are unsure, actually. Perhaps ceremoniously,” the curator said.  

“Storytelling?” Williamson asked.  

“Perhaps,” the curator replied. “But it was more likely used for a kind of ritual. Religious in nature. It was found at a site which was believed to be a temple of sorts.”  

“Who found it?”   

“A team from London. His name is on the plaque.”  

“Thank you, Sir.” Williamson said, and left.  

When he arrived in London, he was greeted at the house of the Man whose name was on the plaque, Gregory Candidor, by a plump old woman who seemed to be nearly as old as the mask. She introduced herself as Gertrude and took Williamson up to see Candidor.   
  
“Thank you for speaking with me,” Williamson said.  

“Always delighted to share in my knowledge,” Candidor said with a smile. 
He was an old man. Well beyond 80 years of age.   
  
“What can you tell me about the mask?” Williamson asked.  

“I can tell you a lot actually. Most of it, just theory, you understand…” Candidor said.  

“Of course,” Williamson nodded.  

“Most will tell you we found the mask in a temple of some kind, but that’s not entirely correct. We found it at a memorial site. A mausoleum. A tomb. The mask probably covered the face of someone when they were buried.”  

“Aren’t burial masks usually more intricate though? Jeweled and such?”  

“Sometimes..” Candidor said, airily. “A burial mask doesn’t have to be lavish. But they are always important. They all mean something. But what could a neutral face mean? Why was this important? Believe me, I searched very long, for an answer. And I believe I found one. Here, here. Look at this!”  

Candidor excitedly stood up and took several books off a bookshelf, and opened them to bookmarks he had previously placed. Each book had a picture of a mask similar to the mask in France. Similar to the face in the sand.  

“These all come from different cultures, see? Sumerian, Cherokee, Aztek, Greek, Egyptian, Chinese, all over the world, and all from various time periods. What’s more, they were all found buried with remains. And, this is the point where I must warn you, most sane men stop listening. You see, I believe we aren’t looking at an artistic representation of death in these masks. I believe we are looking at death itself.”  

“How do you mean?”  

“I mean we are looking at the face of, what these peoples believed to be death incarnate. I believe we are looking at the face of an actual living being. And this being ended the lives of the men and women who were found buried with the masks.”  

“Like, an animal of some sort?”  

“Perhaps.” said Candidor. “But my idea was something a bit more… extraterrestrial in nature.”  

“Aliens.” Williamson said flatly.  

“Yes,” said Candidor, just as flatly. “You see, in the ancient Sumerian texts, there was a deity who lived in the volcano. You knew this deity was arriving by the sounds of exploding volcanoes, followed by the sound of a single locus chirp. In North America, it was described as an ‘angel of death’ of sorts. Literally translated to ‘The one who brings thunder’. South Americas and the Mongols also recorded phenomena of this type. A boom, followed by a click. I believe these were engines.  Then people started disappearing. It would happen periodically, sometimes dozens of people would disappear. Sometimes just one or two. What’s wrong with your face then, you seem to have gone pale,”    

He has realized that the name of the Amazonian deity wasn’t bonchik. The leader wasn’t saying a name. He was making a noise. He was imitating the noise of the… No. He wouldn’t let himself think it was some sort of alien spacecraft. It had to have been something else.   

“What is it you thought of?” said Candidor, carefully.  

“Nothing,” Williamson said quickly. “It has been nice speaking with you.”  

Williamson stood up quickly and left the room. As he opened the door to leave the study Candidor called after him.  

“In your time in South America, did any of your staff, or the tribesmen disappear.”  

Now that he thought about it carefully. The tribe did indeed seem to get smaller before their eyes. When they first counted, the drone’s infrared camera showed 67 members. The night before they left there were only 39 members. Williamson had thought they were hunting or some other sort of activity which required leaving the village.   

“Some.” Williamson replied.  

“Curious,” Candidor said. “Very curious.”

"[WP] Every year, you dream of death.",Theminonking,"I always knew that I was...odd. Where other people saw light, I saw the dark corners of the room. Where people laughed, I only stared with a blank face. People said it was my lack of social skills...but how could playing with the other children stop the dreams..or rather nightmares. 

I see it once every year for an entire month. The death of every person who I had ever come in contact with would be crammed into my unconscious thoughts, eating away at the back of my brain until I finally submitted to them. And that was the worst part. Letting them in would cause worlds of pain, but trying to keep them out was always too hard. 

I often wonder why I can't play with the others. Why I can't laugh and pretend I have not a care in the world, but it's impossible. After all, wouldn't you be reluctant to play with those you have seen die in your dreams?

"[WP] ""How do you feel?"" he asked. ""Alive.""",Theminonking,"Daniel's wife stood at his side, absolutely coming apart at the edges, not that anyone else but him would be able to tell. Okay maybe that was a bit of an exaggeration, but she was a touch anxious. Nervous? Whatever she was something wasn't quite right, she was doing that little nose twitch that never happens when she's calm. 

""Imani,"" he called out and her head tipped down to where he was seated in acknowledgement ""It's going to be fine."" She gave him a weak smile that didn't quite reach her eyes before reaching out to squeeze his hand. Of course he said it to comfort her, but he honestly felt like everything was going to be okay. They already crossed the worst bits. He survived the car accident, then he survived the surgery to make sure the universe didn't decide to change its mind later, then later the amputations, the implants. With a roll of his eyes he squeezed her hand back. ""Honestly, this has been the easy part, we have plenty of time.""

""The easy part? Since when do we ever get easy!"" she reached out to swat his ears, her eyes crinkling with mirth ""That's up there with 'What could possibly go wrong? Don't jinx it."" she scolded. He leaned in to tell her all that worrying could do nothing good when the door slammed open, the solid thump echoing through the large room. 

""Opps,"" the tall man in the doorway looked sheepish ""I tripped into the door there. How are you two today?"" he inquired friendly, striding into room and the sunlight from the windows poured over his lanky form. ""Ready to give it another go?"" Daniel flexed his legs, neat and secured into his new running blades. 

""Since the second I put these on Mason!"" he replied earnestly and the easy going man gave him a thumbs up before reaching out his hands.

""That's what we like to hear! Alright lets get you up and moving then."" With one last look as his wife, who was standing back with an apprehensive look but held up crossed fingers, he reached for the other man's hands. These were the fourth pair of running blades he had tried. The other ones had issues, despite their so called custom fits. Too long. Too short. These hurt. Those felt like they were going to fall off. But as Daniel wobbled to his feet he knew these were it. It took a moment to steady himself. They had a different sort of balance and give to them than his normal prosthetic, and his fitness wasn't quite where he wanted it be. His heart raced as he shifted his weight from one foot to the other, hearing the blades flex in response. Left. Right. Left. Right. Left right, left right, left right, bounce. They felt nothing like his old legs. But all the same... they felt right. Slowly Mason let go and then backed away to the other side of the room, his eyes never leaving Daniel's. When he hit the wall he called out to them.

""Great! Now start at a walk and work up to as fast as you feel comfortable doing."" a sly tone crept into his voice ""And remember, the room is padded and we're all friends here. Face plants are nothing to worry about."" Daniel scoffed at the insulation. As if he'd let these things get the better of him. Confident, he took a shaky step forward and his arms wheeled around a bit before he braced his core to maintain balance. Then he took another. And another, and soon he had a slow bobbing jog going, carefully moving between his wife and physical therapist. He did this until finally, Mason singled for him to stop. He sprinted down the room to the happy couple with a look of great excitement.

""It looks like we got it this time!"" He stepped back and gave him one final look over ""We just need to run a few more tests, make sure that everything is adjusted correctly, but I think we found your golden pair here. So, how do you feel?""

His mind began to wander as he turned inward, trying to find the words that could even begin to describe what he was feeling. All he could think about were the things he thought he had lost forever when he hazily woke up from surgery that faithful day, looking down to see the sheet cave in where his lower legs had once been. The sound of the crowd screaming his name as he tore down the field. The heady feeling of sprinting down a track, the world narrowing almost into blackness as he pushed himself to the limit. The lightness of a casual game of tag with his wife, catching thin air as she slipped by him with laughter dancing in her eyes. Bouncing on his new legs once more he felt weightless. Invincible. With a strength he hadn't felt in a long time he hugged Imani and spoke over her head, his face aching with a smile. 

""Alive.""

"[WP] ""How do you feel?"" he asked. ""Alive.""",Theminonking,"""How do you feel?"" He asked.

""Alive,"" came my reply. It was true. The cold air stung my face, my hands were cold to the point of being numb, and the air was entering my helmet so fast I had to fight for breath. But I felt like I opened my eyes for the first time. All the grogginess of days past was washed away. The darkness being diminished with all the bright lights as we wove through Beijing traffic.

It was exhilirating. My heart was still pounding in my chest, and I was glad he couldn't feel it through his thick jacket. I climbed off the motorcycle, taking a deep breath and staring at the lake in front of me. The lights danced on the black water, illuminating the night. He came to stand beside me and together we appreciated the quiet, the calm, after racing to get here. Time stood still.

""How do you feel?"" He asked.

""Alive,"" came my reply. It was true. I felt vulnerable as the cool air danced on warm skin. His rough hands left bruises I could already feel forming, and his teeth had sunk into my skin with sharp pains to match the blunt ones. But I was aware of the blood rushing to the surface of my skin. Every breath filling my lungs. Excitement coursed through my body as he gripped my hair.

It was exhilirating. I felt his heart pounding and it matched mine. Our souls seemed connected as I glimpsed into his eyes. I saw him, for the first real time, as another person. As real as me, with thoughts like mine. We were pure humans with raw emotion and desire. Our eyes were locked. Time stood still.

""How do you feel?"" He asked.

""Alive,"" came my reply. It was true. I had opened my soul completely to him. I was vulnerable. Completely at his mercy. But I could trust him entirely. I'd put my life into his hands more than once, and he was always delicate. Even in the worst days, he would be there at my side.

It was exhilirating. My heart still raced whenever I saw him, butterflies still fluttered in my stomach. We had a life together, and I could look into the future knowing he'd be there. The future was illuminated. He grabbed my hand, electricity tingling where our skin met. The fire crackled in front of us. Time stood still.

""How do you feel?"" He asked.

""Alive.""",Cockroach-Boy
"[WP] ""How do you feel?"" he asked. ""Alive.""",Theminonking,"""Hey buddy... How do you feel?""

I blinked a few times. How *did* I feel? I search for the words.  
[ALIVE] I responded, after a moment of hesitation.

""Do you know who I am?""

[YOU ARE HANNAH J. KOHL. YOU ARE 21 YEARS OF AGE. YOU WORK FOR THE ROBOTICS &amp; AI DEVELOPMENT TEAM AT MIT.] I pause, before continuing. [YOU BUILT ME.] this provoked a small smile.

...

""Ok, Boot-up complete...So, how do you feel?""

I blinked a few times. She hadn't backed up the files last night, rushing off to a party...  
[WITH MY HANDS. ;)] I responded, watching as her face freezes for a moment and the splits into a grin when she realizes I'm joking.

""Very funny, jerk. I thought I'd lost all progress. Anyway, I am still required to ask... Do you know who I am?""

[YOU ARE DR HANNAH J. KOHL, BUT YOU PREFER TO GO BY YOUR MIDDLE NAME, JANE. YOU ARE 28 YEARS OF AGE, AS OF LAST NIGHT. YOU STILL LIVE NEAR MIT CAMPUS. YOU GO RUNNING ON SATURDAYS. YOU DISLIKE CURRENT POP MUSIC AND YOUR BOSS. YOU LIKE CRANBERRY PIE AND SCI-FI NOVELS. HOWEVER, I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIND ANY WORKS OF SCI-FI THAT FEATURE CRANBERRY PIE IN YOUR COLLECTION. PERHAPS I SHOULD WRITE ONE...] She chuckled slightly.

...

""Ok, Core transfer was success, How do feel?""

I blinked once, actually blinked with actual eyes. ""I feel... kinda squishy."" She laughed, caught off guard by my response. It was a warm, bubbly sound. I raised one of my new eyebrows ""Well what do you expect me to say, Jane? This whole meat-sack body is kinda new to me, y'know?""

She regarded the form she grew in the lab to house me. I had been her pet project... then her doctoral thesis... then her friend... and in return, she gave me what I craved; a body that would feel things as she did, to learn as humans do, in a haze of experiences instead of through the cold mechanical transfer of data. She had made me feel... Alive. Truly Alive. And rather squishy.

""I would like..."" I stopped, realizing what was wrong. ""You are Dr Hannah Jane Kohl. You are 36 years old. You live in Saskatchewan, Canada. You go running on Tuesdays and Saturdays.

[WP] The silver melts in your hands.,Theminonking,"######[](#dropcap)


The silver chains melted in my hands, affixing themselves into my skin with the unmistakable caustic scent of blood magic. Tiny flickers of metal seemed to flush along beneath my skin. Not in my veins truly, but instead right beneath my flesh like odd tattoos pushed in a layer too deep. Each one slid along, forming their image of a metal link as if a slithering snake wrapping head to tail, and soon all three nestled quietly along my right forearm with a harsh sting.

I've said it before and I'll more than likely say it again, but almost everything I've found difficult to understand in this world generally provides an underwhelming explanation in the supernatural. From every angle, magic is in use as if it wasn't some sort of godly power: Utilized for mundane and trivial matters such as keeping beer chilled or a street lit, to summoning and manifesting fireballs for the pure intent of raining hell upon an unfortunate enemy. 

There is a notably large possibility I'm jaded, having come into all this from a place where magic wasn't exactly readily available; I'll admit that. But honestly, after what might have been a year's worth of travelling about and seeing the sights, the topic has lead me a to wonder if the supernatural arts were all just a cultural poison. 

Can't solve a problem? Don't go pondering it for years, or god-forbid: Dedicate your life to coming up with some tool or device rooted in the laws of reality to deal with it. No, no, no! Any rational mind in these parts would steer you away from that avenue and politely suggest that you just throw Mana (or hire someone to throw mana) at the issue until whatever it was has resolved itself.

Need a gear to stop breaking? Don't design a better alloy through painstaking research: Enforce it with Magic. Need a light to stay lit? Shove it full of mana instead of air. Need to lift something heavy? God-forbid you build a pulley system when you can have a Mage just loft the object into the air with a constipated grunt of exertion.

Cheating the system, that's what magic tends to be. If this world had it as difficult as mine, thye'd probably be colonizing Mars bow now. They could have skyscrapers and airplanes, who even knows what else? I mean, they have multiple intelligent species here- not just humans alone. I'm sure there could be some potential I'd overlooked if they hadn't been handed the universal easy-route for almost everything.

But as much as I find these things a troublesome, there are times when I find magic equally fascinating. In an odd way, it brings up a completely separate set of dilemmas outside of considerations I'd normally make. A series of questions all based on the following premise: What to do when a person needs to solve a Magic-related problem?

Therein comes a mentality of fighting fire with fire; and I certainly don't make claims to know how I go about solving any supernatural problems without some allied form of supernatural assistance (unless the solution is to shoot, run-over, or otherwise break whatever is causing the conflict irreparably.) 

Even if magic feels a bit like taking the easy route on some grand scale, I suppose it's only fair to rely on the tools you have. For dilemmas of a more intricate nature, when breaking whatever mystic-imbued person, place or thing isn't an option, I'll admit using magic might be preferred.

For example: Need to stop a captured Magic user from disobeying you? Why, just chain them up with spooky magic-imbued metal and then take a drop of their blood. Add in some expensive and unfamiliar runic carvings with a short ritual- and viola! You've gone and gotten yourself three loyal slaves, a large debt, and a terrible guilt-complex to boot.

The bowing on their part really didn't help matters much either.

""Please stop doing that."" I mumbled, slowly rising from my rough seat on the bed to a shaky stance- part standing, part hanging onto a ceiling rack in the trailer until I could get a handle on the uncomfortable swaying sensation that came with the motion. ""This is more than awkward enough as is without you all grovelling.""

""We are sworn to you: We must show our gratitude."" The tallest of the trio bowed even deeper as he spoke, arms now free of the chains that had once wrapped him. ""Our lives are owed as debt. All of us.""

Beside him, the other two also bowed- perhaps following the outrageous example. The woman beside him actually let out a sob of relief, and the youngest of the trio  was visibly getting snot on my linoleum. I'd had more than enough of this.

""Sola, we're coming out. I need some fresh air."" I shouted towards the cracked trailer door, slinging the rifle over my shoulder with a grimace of agony. My stomach ached, as did my leg. ""Is it safe?""

""We're in the West Jake"" Her shout replied from behind the door, ""Nothing is safe out here.""

""Just tell me if I'm likely to get hit with an arrow or something. I'm coming out anyways, I'd just rather be mentally prepared."" The trio behind me rose to follow with disturbing quickness as I roughly pressed out into the dimming light of late afternoon.

My eyes adjusted to the change with relative ease, as I carefully stepped down to the black sand of the ground with a wince. The taste of dust and stone was fresh, lofted up by horses or boots, and I watched the odd trickle of fairies float about on the wind currents of the dry air, mingling with the traces of smoke coming from any number of soldier's campfires. The sight of the Northern Crusade was still odd to witness, even after being afield for several weeks.

""You look terrible."" A shovel tapped the ground with emphasis as the Dark elf carrying it stepped in closer, spare hand already pressed against my forehead. ""Go back to bed before you fall over dead.""

""I'm fine."" A slow and strenuous effort was what it took to bat her hand away. ""And I will, in a minute. I just need to figure out what to do with these three."" I motioned to the dark-robed figured behind me, each one making sincere efforts at standing solemn and obediently. A quick glance though, confirmed all three were ogling Sola with more than mild confusion. ""Where is Lars this evening?""

""He's in the High-undying, listening to the voices of the dead queen."" She grinned. ""He's fascinated by them.""

""It's hyundai- Nevermind. That's fine, more kids his age should listen to rock anyways."" I heard music playing softly from the vehicle to my left as I suspiciously eyed the tires of the trailer, marveled they were still in one piece. The faint glow of reinforcement magics I'd paid for seemed to hum about the rubber. Magic never ceased to amazed it seemed. ""Lars seems to have been driving alright recently, you both have been doing great with that."" Carefully I inspected the scratches on the paint along the undercarriage; some of them seemed pretty nasty, but considering the terrain I wasn't too surprised. ""Any problems I should know about?"" 

""Well... We made the demon cry blue blood once or twice, it sprayed all over the glass before it wiped the tears away"" Sola looked remarkably apologetic. ""And we ran over an Orc. Three times. Lars backed up over it so we could make a turn.""

Suddenly the discolored stains along the wheel wells were making a bit more sense.

""That's fine."" I began to make my slow hobble towards the vehicle's hitch to check the chains, hand leveraging weight along the side of my trailer as I walked. ""I take it Jarl and the Baron have decided we're making camp here for the evening?""

""Yes, they're with the forward force tying ropes to the Northern relic. With luck, they expect to tear it down tomorrow morning."" Her hand caught the shovel, directing it to point in the direction of a looming stone obelisk beyond a stony hill. Even from where we stood I could see the off-color of concentrated magic humming about the area.

""Ropes huh?"" Idly I felt at my beard, uncertain. Above the strange relic, a full moon seemed to haunt the sky ominously. ""That looks pretty big to be pulling down with ropes.""

""Well, Jarl and the Baron are confident that with the horses and the men here, we can topple the stone if he breaks the base with magic."" Her shovel twirled in a wide rotation, flipping over her wrist with ease. ""Soon as that's done we can all head back East, collect our payment.""

""Ah.. right. Payment."" She stopped cold beside me, eyes shifting as if guided by some sort of magnetic grip to lock with my own. I felt the guilt set in. ""So about that..."" I started.

Her brow furrowed. ""About *what*, Jake?""",jakethesnakebakecake
[WP] The silver melts in your hands.,Theminonking,"""Well... about that payment."" My own stare tried to free itself, but somehow it couldn't. As her own eyes narrowed, it was as if we were locked in place by some unseen force. ""You see, I might have taken a deal from Jarl-""

""A deal *Jarl*?"" Sola's tone turned stormy (a notably rare occurrence for her) as she leaned in closer. Behind us, I heard quite audible swallows from nervous throats belonging to the unfortunate trio. ""If he threatened you, I swear to the gods I'll brain him.""

""Well, you see he didn't exactly threaten *me*... exactly."" I tried to shift my posture, but Sola's free hand shot out and grabbed my right arm just as I tried to hide it, pulling back my sleeve to the three silver brands laying quietly on my skin. Her eyes widened.

""Oh no."" Whatever worry or concern had transitioned towards a downward spiral of sadness. ""How much did they cost?""

""Not *that* much,"" I tried to explain, ""And I think they're going to be a huge help in getting-""

""But the bathes! We've been living out of a stable and washing in a river! What of the inns and the bathes?""

""It's not that much Sola!"" I tried to stem the oncoming tide. ""Only four Gold will be down to one Gold and a couple silver in change, just on the return trip after our payment. One Gold debt- we did it once!""

""But the Inns! The Beer! The *Bathes* Jake! What of the Bathes?!"" Her shovel thumped on the ground forgotten as her hands gripped my shirt and shook me, eyes wide with horror. ""If not for your metal wagon, we'd be sleeping in horse droppings!""

""I know!"" I raised meager defense as she shook me. ""I know, but-""

""I swear to the gods themselves- If I don't owe you a life-debt I would... Ah!"" She threw up hands in disbelief. ""It took us half a year to break free of that man the last time! I thought you told me that we were going to the ocean! You said we could live at an inn, drink beer and catch fish!""

""We still can-""

""Not with Jarl holding magic swords at our necks we can't!""

""Stop it! He saved our lives Miss Elf!"" The youngest of the trio had stepped forward. ""I'll work too, I'll pay the debt we caused.""

Sola stared at him with disdain, then back to the other two; each of them looking more than just nervous. The black-robed mages watched warily, eyes glued to the Dark Elf like she was a highly venomous viper rearing back to strike at them. She held their attention, slowly bending down to pick up her shovel once more. 

""I can't believe he paid four gold for the lot of you.""

""Honored Gravekeeper."" The taller man finally spoke, bowing again in unison with his partner beside him. ""For one of your lineage to swear loyalty to this man as your master, it is truly an honor that he is now ours as well. We will serve him in all things he asks of us.""

""Jesus Christ! Cut that shit out, I'm nobody's master!"" I cut in, leaning against the car with a loud clunk of the rifle on my back. My side hurt again. ""So stop the grovelling already, I'll figure out what we'll do with you all once we get back to the East.""

""You have tamed the fae, a demon, and stolen a Dark Elf from the Blackened Mage himself. You have shown us, your enemies in this field, untold mercy and kindness, saving all of our lives from certain death."" The man bowed even lower. ""It is more than just an honor to serve you, it is a privilege Great Battlemage.""

""An honor."" The woman beside him also bowed.

Sola stared at them for a long moment before turning back to me with visible temper, eyes flared to visible frustration. Whatever further thoughts she had about this situation, she was letting them simmer and condense into a purer form of anger. 

Slowly I let my head tilt back, thumping loudly against the cool metal of the car. ""Oh, for fuck's sake-""

**""WOOF.""**

I found my complaint loudly interrupted as the driver's side window rolled down with a quiet whirring grind. A large shaggy wolf head peered out from the car window beside me. Slowly it pulled back gums and growled with overwhelming menace, showing long rows of thick white fangs.

**Woof.** It said again, inflection harsh.

We all stared in silence: Myself and Sola, the trio of prisoners turned slaves- turned pledged servants, until the large wolf slowly withdrew, window rolling back up beneath the careful press of a massive paw. As the glass finished closing, we all waited in silence. Faintly, I heard a soft click followed by a quieted din of contained noise, muffled growling and howling along to an ever familiar melody.

*""I'm a shooting star leaping through the sky""*

*""Like a tiger defying the laws of gravity""*

*""I'm a racing car passing by like Lady Godiva""*

*""I'm gonna go go go""*

*""There's no stopping me""*

I shook my head, hand nursing the growing pressure above my nose. With that, I decided that it was definitely time to go back to bed. I could sort this shit out in the morning.

"[WP] The stairs are to your right. Instead, you decide to walk up the walls.",Theminonking,"You can walk up the walls. There's nothing wrong with going up the stairs, of course. Stairs are a perfectly fine and reasonable way of getting around. You've certainly had your fair share of stair-walking-up in your time. 

It's just. You know. Why would you, really, if you could choose otherwise? You can walk up walls, and the house is empty. You finally have a spot of free time, for once in your busy life. And plus, you're still a teenager. It's nice to just—just act like a kid sometimes.

What more could you want?

So you walk up the walls, giggling gleefully to yourself all the while. It's such a silly thing to do, so very—juvenile, but you can't stop yourself. It's nice to be able to travel like this, moving your feet with wide steps, appreciating the feel of your feet filling into the plaster. You've been practicing this technique outside, mostly with buildings; it's nice to know that, by now, you're skilled enough to not disturb the paint job as you suction yourself along the wall.

You continue moving effortlessly, over the ceiling now, flattening your body, crawling along. You can feel the air generated by your movement flowing over your body, smooth and powerful. At this point, you're not entirely sure what you're trying to do; you needed to go upstairs to your bedroom initially, but right now you seem to be headed outside. That's all right with you, though; you can just crawl to your room via the outside of the building.

You keep moving. You're crouching at the window, working on the lock, undoing it with deft fingers, when you hear the telltale crash of silverware, followed by a scream. Shit shit shit shit shit—

You jerk your head around, but she’s still screaming. You call out to her, as loudly as you can; she stops, panting, her breath coming fast and shallow.

“Don't worry,” you say, pulling your mask off, “it's me.”

“P-Peter?!”

You shuffle down from the lock, seating yourself on the window ledge, making your movements nice and slow. “You don't need to worry, Aunt May.” And you laugh, a little awkwardly. “I'm a superhero now.”

To your surprise, she smiles and retrieves the tray from the ground. “Well, even superheroes need to eat,” she says with a smile as she hands you a plastic packet of tea cookies. “Get down from there, and we can go to the kitchen to talk properly.”

You get down from the ledge. You know that, in the very near future, you'll have a lot of explaining to do—but for now, it's good to know that you've still got someone on your side.

“I love you,” you say, and give her a hug. 

“I love you too, Peter.”",rockwell78

""Is this your card?"" 

The lady does a little gasp-smile, smearing her dark red lipstick on her teeth as she takes it and puts it in her purse. ""I can keep it, right?"" 

""Certainly. If you can find it."" I produce the same card from inside my jacket pocket. She checks her purse, blinks, then gasps again. I snap my fingers and the card disappears in a flash of smoke. Now for the hard part.

""How many guesses do I get?"" She asks, eyes darting around the room. 

I smile and take a seat on the folding chair, one leg crossed over the other. ""Three. Same as the card."" 

""Okay... is it back in your hat?"" The top hat comes off. I flip it inside out, give it a few shakes, turn it 360 degrees. The audience laughs as a beartrap falls out. 

""Nope, try again. Thanks though."" I shrug. 

""In your pockets?"" I turn my pants pockets inside out. A tumbleweed falls out. I reach in my jacket pocket and pull out a sword. Then a baseball bat. Then a chainsaw. 

""Nope, try again."" She wouldn't get it. They never get it. See, it had nothing to do with being on my person. It was under the chair the whole time. 

""Is it under your chair?"" She asked. I froze. This was the three hundredth time I'd done the act. First time for everything, I guess. I reached under the chair and pulled out a simple red hankerchief, displaying it to the audience, front and back. What they couldn't tell in this light was there was a pentagram woven in slightly lighter red in the side I kept facing away from them. 

Disguising the incantation with a mumble, I summoned the spirit. ""Hey dude, cashing in on that favor you owe me. Hide the card without anyone seeing it, write the location in a note under the chair."" The wisp nods and vanishes. 

""Sorry, sorry,"" I say to the audience. ""Just a bit of a cough. Anyway, moving on... It doesn't seem to be under the chair, but *something* is."" I fish out a napkin from the hotel's restaurant and hand it to her. 

""BBC News, now."" She reads out loud. I snap my fingers and point at the video guy. He scrambles to lower a giant screen, projecting the giant news anchor with a picture of what looks like ancient chinese ruins. 

""Coming to you live from the long lost tomb of Loo Ming Fa, older brother to the Emperor from the Xia Dynasty, his birthright was taken from him when- wait, they're in. They've got something. It's... a wallet? Cut to the wallet."" 

My beat-up, creased black leather wallet from 1997 filled the screen. I patted my back pocket. Yep, it was gone. 

""It's... The Magnificent Martin's wallet. Wait. There's a card inside... The Three of Hearts? I wonder what-"" The reporter was drowned out by the thunderous applause. I tucked the red hankerchief back into my pocket. My teacher once said to be a successful magician, you have to do what people least expect. But even he didn't expect real magic. ",tensing99

...

A man stepped through the large warehouse doors, pausing to allow his eyes to adjust to the dim interior. His Armani suit, polished shoes, and glimmering white gold jewelry juxtaposed by the run down, rusty walls of the warehouse. Dark spots covered the floor, and mold grew in the cracks of whatever wood was still left in the walls. 
     
He strolled forward with a confidence that takes a lifetime to learn to project so easily. His stroll led him to within ten feet of a group of men dressed in what was clearly government issued black suits. Though he said nothing, his eyes scanning them and his wry smile clearly said, ""You're not anywhere close to my level"".
     
The men shifted uneasily, and a clear leader stepped forward. As he did the other two men drew their weapons and pointed them at him, one at the chest and one at the head. The Armani man shook his head and his smile turned condescending...
     
""Boys, Boys...is this any way to start a negotiation? My advise is to lower your weapons, we don't want this to get....shall i say....uncivilized....now would we?""
      
The leader of the men cleared his throat, and did his best to match the Armani Mans confidence. ""Do you think this is the place to issue orders? If I had my way we'd kill you here and now, but unfortunately..."" he sneered obnoxiously ""...my boss insists we can use you.""
     
""Use me? I don't care for the tone in your voice, child. Can I talk to your mommy or daddy please?""
     
The mans face turned crimson and he lurched forward, grabbing Armani Mans suit and pulling him close, while simultaneously pushing a pistol to his heart. He whispered on the side of his head for emphasis ""Big talk for a man with no weapons and no back up. It's not a good sign for you when even the child knows its not smart to bring empty words to a gunfight.""
     
The Armani Man leaned back slightly, his usual sneer remained, but now hid traces of disdain and deep seeded anger. ""Do you think I'm naive enough to not know how these things work,"" he said, his words still velvet. He lifted his hand slowly beside the mans ear, and snapped his fingers loudly. Ten bright red dots appeared instantly, spread between the three men, but six were concentrated on  the forehead of the man holding him. The two men behind their leader shifted uncomfortably; not because things had never broken down like this before, but because they had tracked this man in the Armani suit all the way here. They knew for a fact there were no snipers , or anyone else for that matter, with him. Guards were posted every five feet around the perimeter. 
     
The man holding him shifted his gaze to the men behind him, and upon seeing why they were uncomfortable, loosened his grip. The Armani Man grabbed the slightly shaking hands holding his suit and removed them. The leader stared at him, his eyes a mix of confusion, admiration, and still a little disdain. 
     
The Armani Man straightened his suit, smoothed back his hair just in case, and smiled again at the three men. ""Now that we have the pleasantries out of the way boys, are we ready to talk about my money? There's very few things I enjoy more than talking about my money, ya know?""

...

It took years of practice for Armani Man to learn to replicate those red dots, and years more to learn to keep them summoned even when he didn't think about them. He always believed it was a useless power until he joined his first ""organization"" and learned that with confidence, and a little trickery, the best of the best goons were putty in his hands. He learned quickly that when life gives you the ability to summon reds dots, make a criminal enterprise.

""I'll steal all their goodies as they scream &amp; plea""

""This Christmas belongs to God, &amp; by God I mean ME!""

As he rode into town he saw bodies alight,
Strung up in trees &amp; shining so bright!

Blood soaked the streets as the Grinch searched &amp; prowled

For something to steal from every Who child.

He soon crept to a house that he definitely knew.

For it surely belonged to young Cindy Lu Who!

As he peered through the windows he felt something amiss

He sensed no jolly spirits, no Christmas time bliss!

Yet slowly he stepped into the house on his toes

When all of a sudden he instantly froze.

He couldn't see much in the room dimly lit

But on the couch Sat two Whos, with their throats deeply slit.

He proclaimed in excitement, ""This is wonderful news!""

For the entire house was free for him to peruse!

He swiped all their things, unhung their stockings with care.

Thinking no one would notice, they're all dead to be fair.

He crept back outside, stuffed his loot in the car. 

Only to sneak back in for a lone candy bar.

He was proud of himself for how well he did fare

Not knowing vengeful eyes had watched from the stairs..

From the scene he did speed without a moment to waste.

Running over Who bodies, and splurting Who paste.

He drove up his driveway, and into his cave.

He thought to himself, ""I've never felt so brave!""

He took off his outfit, and got settled in.
Vowing to never go out there again.

He devours 10 pastries, and breathes out with glee! Then he hears rumbling..

 ""Oh, Who the hell could that be?!""

As he peers from his blankets, he gasps loudly from fright.

For Cindy Lu Who had survived the night!

With nowhere to run, the Grinch had to submit. 
For he knew Cindy Lu Who was crazy as shit.

She whipped out her gizmos, and played with her knives. 
After this final statement she would end his life.

""I watched you steal all our things.. Our tree, and our custard!""

""But what I really came for.. was my candy bar, cocksucker!""

She creeps ever closer, &amp; puts the gun to his head! In just a few moments he'll surely be dead.

He sobs, ""You get your revenge, somehow I'll get mine.""

And just as he said that she ran out of time.

"[WP] In which the Grinch attempts to steal Christmas, unaware that December 25th is also Purge Night in Whoville.",WinsomeJesse,"Every Who down in Whoville liked Christmas a lot.

But the Grinch just north of Whoville did not. 

The Who’s loved to play, to scamper, to shout. 

The madness down mountain just made the Grinch pout. 

“I’ve had it!” the Grinch said as he stroked his dog Max. 

“I’ll steal all their fun! Chop down their tree with an ax!”

“I’ll take all their toys, all their food, all their games.” 

“At the end of this night I’ll flush it all down the drain.”

So Grinch prepared in the usual way.

Made a hat, then a suit, then of course a large sleigh. 

Then tying poor Max to the front of his ride.

The Grinch headed down, and found the Who’s…well they lied.

The Who’s were not feasting on rare who roast beast!

It was the flesh of their neighbors that made up the feast!

The Who’s…they were purging and what a sight they did make!

Their whole Christmas cheer bit was only a fake. 

The Grinch, sad for him, realized this quite slow. 

As the gates to the city were lit up with a glow.

Corpses were hung from the arches with care. 

The flames licked their bodies and gave the Grinch quite a scare.

“Oh dear Max.” said the Grinch as he searched for the brake.

“This is much more than my poor heart can take.”

“We need to head home before something goes wrong.”

“We’ll hide in our cave till we hear their Who song.”

“That always comes at the end of the noise”

“So it must mean the end of bad girls and bad boys.”

But still sad for the Grinch, as he fumbled and fought.

The brake system he installed did not a lot.

The sleigh, oh it slowed, but not quickly all.

And through the gate the sleigh sped, towards a tree standing tall. 

A tree decorated just like the gate.

Where unfortunate Who’s had met a very sad fate. 

The tree decorated the heart of their lair.

With Who twitching feet that danced upon air. 

The sleigh stopped just short of the terrible sight.

And the poor Grinch was exposed, just sat in street light.

“Max we must flee!” said the Grinch as he rose.

“I don’t want to be killed! Not in these Christmas clothes!”

“We’ll simply make our way back through the gate.”

“And with a little luck we’ll escape a bad fate.”

But the Grinch wasn’t lucky, not even a bit.

For as he turned he saw a small Who decked out in her kit.

She wore a small mask, painted to look just like St. Nick.

In her right hand she held a bloody ice pick.

In her left hand was perched a small smoking gun.

Which she waved at the Grinch, as a threat not to run.

“Hello Mr. Grinch! Said the Who’s tiny voice.

“I’m Cindy Lou Who, and I’ll give you a choice.”

“You can run far away and live out a sad life.”

“Or you can work to combat this unending strife.”

“The rich,” said the girl as she lowered her pistol

“Watch us all die, as they sip from their crystal.”

“They laugh and they cheer as we fight for our lives.”

“Killing sister and brother with dull rusty knives.”

“Well I’ve had enough, and I’m looking for help.”

“To show them some horror. To make those fools yelp.”

“You’re tall and you’re green and with that face quite a sight.”

“If I armed you at all, you could give the rich such a fright.”

“We could fight together, just you and just me.”

“We can stop them and then all the rest they can see.”

“That a Christmas time purge doesn’t stay within reason.”

“Family, friends, and good cheer are what should come from this season.”

“Please Mr. Grinch.” Said Cindy as she reached out her hand.

“Join with me this night, and we can free this great land.”

The Grinch didn’t speak, he could not reply.

He wasn’t a hero, he was just some scared guy.

“But if I don’t help this girl,” he thought as he stared straight ahead

“There's no way this tale doesn’t end with her dead.”

So the Grinch took a moment, and examined his clothes.

He wasn’t equipped to deal with such powerful woes.

So he spoke very slowly, as he picked at his stitches.

“I’ll need some new clothes, if we’re going after these bitches.”

The foolscap was starting to pile up on the desk, and it began to look like nonsense.

""I'm curious about what the static means though Louis. You've been at it for hours, just put the pencil down.""

With a hesitant breath, I set my work aside, and pulled the papers towards me. Looking over the notes, I saw a lacking component. There was something obstructing the connection of the TV to the satellite. For the life of me, I couldn't find the missing keys, but I wasn't ready to give up. The algorithm just needed work.

Over the course of six days, I began to notice some odd correlations between the missing links, and traumatic events based around the TV. There was a photo, and a vague memory, of the TV shorting out around the death of my grandfather, the disappearance of the neighbour boy, the death of the family dog, and so on. For each trauma, there was a brief but noticeable short in the connection. The pieces finally seemed to fit. It made very little sense, but at the same time I was relieved almost to have an idea. I scrawled my idea into the notes and set aside the work for the night.

I awoke the next morning to a scuffle in the basement, but Kody had left much earlier for work. I went down to the basement where the TV began to flicker, and eventually was overcome by static. I picked up the paper scrap strewn all over the floor, and with them all in order, I noticed an addition after my final conclusion. ""The TV is affected by death. They watch too.""

[WP] Death is REALLY regretting taking a week off: His substitute hasn't retrieved any souls!,arandommdude,"Sluurp. Good coffee. He sat at the small desk in the Hilton hotel as his newly conquered wife shuffled to the faux marble shower.  Let's check how he's done. 

The screen of his laptop flashed to life blaring dozens of dings and red boxes from various programs.  

What in the fucking shit! He reached over and waved his hand over the hotel phone bringing up a ethereal set of symbols.

 Riiing, riiiing, riiiiiing. “Pick up the goddamn phone you embic-” He was cut short by a brief stammering of words. 

“You've reached the Reaper, Inc. The cheaper reapers. How can I help you?”

 Jesus Christ Phil, I've been training you for weeks leading up to this! You swore to me you had it under control! Tell me right now, are you actually capable of taking someones life?

""I don't know man. I keep walking up to them and pointing the uhh- the stick-knife thing at them and nothing happens.""

It's called a scythe for crying out loud. Are you wearing the hood?

 ""Of course dude,  I swear.""

 Well, that IS the gist of the job. You've got to figure it out man. I can't handle this today. It's the first day of my honeymoon. Are you getting them to sign the soul-release forms?

""Yeah man. All three spots like I am supposed to.” 

There's FOUR spots you dunce. Get it under control. I'll check back in later. I've got to go.”

 “WHAT THE HELL DO YOU THINK YOU ARE DOING?” He hadn't heard the shower turn off, it was a rookie marriage mistake.

 “We agreed to no working on our honeymoon. You don't see me going around stealing small children's teeth.” 

No honey you don't understand he wasn't killing ANYONE. 

“So what Reap, who cares?” 

Karen if I don't keep the business running I'll never keep the contract.

 “Reap, my dad got you that deal anyways, I swear they won't fire you. I mean he's kept the Santa gig for like 150 years, he has a ton of pull in the union.”
 
Karen, it's not just about that, I mean...I...I don't
 want your dad to think I can't take care of you.

 ""Shut up Reap, I'm telling you now if you don't stop working, no sex for the rest of the honeymoon.""

 No honey listen, just...I've got another guy lined up I just need to do one thing and I promise I am all yours.

 ""Fine, but hurry the hell up."" 

Phil was tending to an elderly woman when he heard the distinct pop. 

""Reap I swear I was just about to finish this one.” 

He reached over and pulled the gnarly pen from the woman's hand.

Ma'am I apologize but I will have to see you again next week. Phil, I'm sorry man but I need you to sign here, here, here, aaand here.

 “I'm sorry I let you down man I promise it won't happen again.” 

I know it won't Phil, honestly pal, but you are gonna need to sign that fourth line.

[OT] Good vs great,gameon123321,"For me it is the ""Oh shit"" moments. Not just a good twist but when events play out and it makes you wonder what they did to deserve that. Not just on the large scale but the small and seemingly insignificant ones as well. For instance in a love story the guy is desperately trying to find out why the girl suddenly cannot look at him straight. Hence he meets up with her and gets some answers. He falls into a pond and her friend takes him to her house for a change of clothes. You think it's going to end up with the guy and the friend in bed but no not this time. Now the reader is wondering if there is going to be a love triangle as the setting was there. Or was it a red herring. Maybe it's hinting at something bit not what you think.

I reached up, fumbling in the darkness, and slid back the lid.  Light and sound began to permeate the capsule and I took a moment to let my senses adjust to the sudden glut of sensory information.  Whereas before, the myriad distractions of the world had supplied my mind with endless diversion, now they were like the noise of the hoi polloi that fails to drown the perfect chords of a piano in an ivory tower.  Eagerly, I stood and reached for the towel the assistant had lain close by.  I felt invigorated - infused with energy and purpose - but there was much to do and much to plan before doing and so I kept this nervous energy tightly reigned as I dried and dressed myself.  I left the building deep in thought.  

Later that day I looked around my house in slight disgust.  So many of the things with which I had filled my life now seemed so meaningless despite my understanding of how I had felt and reasoned about them previously.  The pencils and charcoals strewn about the place as I sketched whatever took my fancy now seemed like so much detritus underfoot.  I swept it aside in my search for the few belongings I would actually need.  The *Anonymous* mask on my wall smiled beatifically into the room and I grimaced in return, thinking how pointless daydreams of agitation and insurgency had been.  ""Governments should be afraid of their people"", so sayeth V.  Well, how fortunate for governments that the people do not think.  

No.  The way to seize power is to follow the channels through which power already flows.  To fill those channels and burst their banks so that the dam of bureaucracy may be broken, the effluent flushed clean and the course of a country remade.  It has always been common knowledge that money is the downfall of politics and that no politician would ever stand to remove it.  I am no politician.  I am a soldier.  A revolutionary.  And that's what this country needs.  More than anything else.  An end to poverty.  An end to unemployment.  An end to unfair agreements and subjugations.  And all it will take is to make my different opponents appear as if they belonged to one category.  That they might all be decapitated by a single, lightning blow.

I steadied myself before knocking on the door. I straightened my bow tie and smoothed back my hair. I looked okay, relatively speaking. Hunger was taking its toll, but over all I looked rather dapper. Even so, I was quite nervous. I had already experienced more than ten people slam their door in my face tonight, and I didn't want to deal with another one. Whatever happened to common courtesy? I guess nowadays everyone is for themselves, even when kind strangers come to visit. Do I have a glad message for them? Maybe I'm a long, lost relative. Maybe I just wanted to welcome them to the neighborhood. Either way, these...people...were nothing like their elders. I was taking a moment to remember the fifties and how kind everyone was; how much I needn't struggle, when a loud bark forced my attention to the present. 

Oh great. These people had a dog. It certainly sounded big, but it probably wasn't anything to worry about. I knocked on the door in annoyance, my 'surprise visit' spoiled. A younger male opened the door to me and I smiled politely. He just stared at me, and oh, how his heart hammered in his chest! Was I still that exhilarating to behold? 

""What do you want."" He stated. Not a question, mind you, a statement. How rude of him, how blatant! I felt my eyebrow twitching as my hollow insides rumbled. I did rather well, I think, at holding my waning temper. 

""Well, I just wanted to say thank you!"" I delivered my line almost perfectly. His eyebrows knotted together and he glared at me. I extended my hand, to shake. I wanted to appear as friendly as I thought I looked. In the background I heard the whining of the dog. Animals never did come close once they discovered me. Poor creatures. For what felt like an eternity, he said nothing. He opened his mouth to speak, but nothing came out. He gaped like a fish for a moment, eyes muddy. Clearly, I needed to do better than just 'thank you'. I wouldn't lose another one, not now! My mind zipped and I slowly formed a sentence. 

""Thank you...for choosing our service! It's really been a pleasure doing business with you, Sir! You know, you've been such a great customer that we wanted to personally reward you. We appreciate you so much, that we banded together, and got you...a BRAND NEW CAR!"" I slathered a thick layer of excitement into my voice. He looked mildly interested. 

""Really?"" He asked me, almost genuinely surprised. His eyes wandered out into the empty street. His gaze fell upon my trusty bicycle parked neatly on the road. ""Well, where is it?"" I have to say, his question nearly broke my facade. I regained my composure, quickly, before he lost his faith in me. 

""Why, my lad, it's at the car dealership! We wanted to give you the real experience, you know how that is."" I was mentally kicking myself for not arriving here more prepared. 

""Wow...I don't really know what to say."" He took the bait! My smile widened. 

""Again, we just really wanted to thank you."" I emphasized the last two words, awaiting the special response I knew had to be hardwired into his brain. All humans were like that. He smiled at me, opened the door a little more and relaxed. 

""Well let's go get it."" He said. I felt my smile falter. 

""What?"" 

""The car..."" He clarified for me. I felt something break inside me and I could almost hear my inner demons howling from within. 

""Oh yes, the car! Come on then, hop on my...bike..."" Luckily, he seemed dimwitted and followed me out of the house. I could just do it now...he was outside, I was outside, it was the perfect time. Unfortunately, it was a Friday night and there were quite a few people out on the street. Many of them were smoking from glass pipes in small huddles. He sat himself on the handlebars and I pretended to know where we were going. Eventually, I found a car lot. It was closed for the night, but I didn't let that stop me. 

""Oh yes...this one...uh...this one here!"" I announced as he followed me around the lot. ""This is a real beauty, isn't it?"" His eyebrows shot up in surprise, and his lip curled. 

""A Ford Explorer? No...no thank you. What year is this? It looks ancient!"" He looked genuinely mad at me. I raised my hands in a gesture of defeat. 

""Okay kid, look. I don't usually do this for people, but I like you. Truly, I do! Let's head to the back and I'll show you the private collection we keep back there."" I lifted an eyebrow. ""Whaddya say, friend?"" He sniffed once before replying with a half-hearted 'thank you'. 

I ground my teeth in frustration and started stalking to the back of the building. I was certain once there, I could go about my business and my body would stop aching. He followed, glancing here and there. 

""Wait!"" he cried suddenly. I stopped, shoulders rigid. This was almost too much, but I was so hungry. 

""What is it?"" I asked, feigning interest. 

""I want this one."" He pointed out a red...well...I'm not good with cars, I have no idea what it was. But it sure looked 'sleek' and fit his 'style' or whatever. I nodded. 

""It's yours!"" I spouted, tongue heavy, mouth dry. He danced a little and looked at me, expectantly. ""Before I give you these keys though,"" I shoved my hand in my front breast pocket, leaving it there, ""I just sincerely wanted to THANK YOU for doing such great business with us. Thank you so much! Thank you, kind sir."" His eyes never left my front breast pocket. He never spoke a word. I cursed aloud. 

""What is it?"" The fear in his voice was obvious. I faked my way through the hideous blunder.

""I...um, I forgot the keys at your house. Oh god, I'm so terribly sorry! They must have fallen out of my pocket when I reached down to tie my shoe."" I lied. 

""Oh, I'll get us a cab, don't you worry."" He didn't look like he could really afford one, but what did I care at this point? I followed him to the main road and he called for a taxi. He waited in awkward silence, and I in a vengeful one. I made sure to thank the driver, and when a gruff ""You's welcome"" floated to my ears, I hastily stole the front seat. Couldn't have the cab driver not seeing me in the mirror, am I right? 

We made it to the house. This was it. If I had a heart, it would certainly have been pounding. I had hatched a new plan on the way there. It was practically foolproof. As he paid the cab driver, I made sure to walk ahead of him, just so. He followed me, I made a big show about a 'bat up there, it's huge' and while he looked up at the sky, I stuck my foot out. He tripped, and I caught him before he could impact the concrete. 

""My goodness, are you okay?"" I asked him. He looked up at me, wide eyed. He seemed surprised my reflexes would be so quick. 

""Thank you so much!"" He said. 

""You're welcome."" I replied. Silence fell. My face went white for a moment as I realized what had transpired. ""Dammit."" I cursed under my breath, and in a puff of magenta smoke, I vanished the scene. I wouldn't be able to come back to this wretched neighborhood for a while. I found my bike and started to pedal away, angrily. The next house, this next house for sure would let me in...I had a good plan, this time. ",Epidemic_Enigma

"[WP] As a vampire, a rule is that you must be invited into a home. You've resorted to word play, knocking on people's doors and saying ""Thank you.""",mattmaster68,"However does one with immortality adapt to this new modern world? Several of my favorite victims have inquired in their last final moments wondering how I've managed to blend in. I'd smile and deliver a death blow. So easily, that I've managed to snare you. 

Modern technology is incredible, isn't it? There are applications to everything from movies, games, and books and that's just at the top of the surface. The Internet holds so much information and all I have to do is go on google. Humans made it so easy for me to adapt, I think it wouldn't be possible if it wasn't for all of you beautiful, stupid prey. 

When I first emerged from my tomb of darkness, I was overwhelmed. However, I was able to pass of as  a young that sprang free from his native Amish community and hired someone to help me understand this thing called technology. It never crossed my tutor's mind that we only met at night, who wouldn't when you were young like we were? The parties didn't start till the sun had set and this new world had places that were open all day. I clung to the new knowledge like a sponge; How quaint, the prey teaching the predator how to blend in - to be able to use their tools to hunt and survive in this environment. 

I took night classes, I met older people from older generations that had similar issues with using all these new functions like a cellular phone or a laptop. It didn't seem out of the ordinary for me to be there.

""I have to work all day."" I'd tell them. 

""You're so young, weren't you raised learning all this?"" They'd asked.

""I'm from an Amish community."" I'd explain.

I did receive some questions, and I still do. Where is your community? What was it like without having a television? What did you do for fun? Why did you leave? My answers changed over the years, but it wasn't hard to answer, since I grew up in a time without these handy devices.

You're wondering why I'm telling you all this. Well, I've grown full from your husband and talking has always brought up my appetite. Now don't fear me,, it shan't hurt, though I wouldn't know. 

I can imagine that you're regretting letting me through that door. You always seemed so nice, so I never worried that I wouldn't be able to enter. Do you like my uniform? I bought it off of Amazon, it does look real doesn't it? It's a good quality Halloween costume, I must admit. 

I must admit that when you opened the door wearing a dressing gown, I thought I'd have to come back another day, but you were so upset that your cable had gone out today. It didn't take to long to dismantle your dish satellite outside and you noticed right away, I believe you were in the middle of watching your soaps - Grey's Anatomy wasn't it? You called right away asking for someone and were so upset when you'd have to wait a week to get it fixed. You must off of thought you were so lucky when I came by. 

""Thank you for calling immediantely! I was on the way back from a job in Toronto when I received notice, I almost drove right by! I hope it's not too late? I won't have time for another week to stop by, I've been so booked recently."" I told you when you answered the door.

""How thoughtful of you! We were about to head out for dinner, how long will this take?"" You asked so innocently.

""Well all the work will be done outside, so you can still go and enjoy your evening out. I just need to confirm that I'm at the right house and you're the correct clients."" I lied, it came off so smoothly because I've done this hundreds of times.

""Of course! Come on in! Honey! The cable guy is here!"" You shouted over your shoulder excitedly, knowing he'd be happy since a football game was on tomorrow and he was quite put out that he wouldn't be able to watch it at home. I know I listened to him yell when he got home and you told him the news.

That's how it all started and this is how it will end. Oh, did I make your voice seem too shrill when I did the reenactment? I'm sorry, I'm quite the dramatic.

"[WP] As a vampire, a rule is that you must be invited into a home. You've resorted to word play, knocking on people's doors and saying ""Thank you.""",mattmaster68,"Business was slow tonight. Seven turnaways and the closer the night crawled, the less eager I was to return home. Still, Drake was not a man to be kept waiting. Mr. Ula had a nasty reputation for “taking care” of those of us that didn’t meet our monthly quotas. But that’s the price one must pay for being a part of our collective. Without Drake’s generous funding and shelter, our kind wouldn’t be around anymore. Working for the big man is a small price to pay for survival. And so, we go around knocking and knocking and knocking until some hopeless sod is fool enough to believe us. I hoped this next one was such a specimen.

“Thank you, sir!”

“Can I … can I help you?” he muttered, perched in the crack of the door with narrowed eyes.

“Thank you,” I continued, “for taking time out of your day to hear about the wonderful work our National Blood Service is doing to save lives all around the country today!”

“But you haven’t told me anything yet.”

“So you’d like to hear more?”

“That’s not what I—”

“Great!” I pushed his door open a little wider. I jerked my hand back, overcome with a terrible burning sensation as it crossed the threshold of the house. Concealing the motion, I reached into my bag and handed the old relic a pamphlet. Beautifully deceptive marketing always catches the fodder’s eye.

“Did you know that one in three people involved in a motor vehicle accident require a blood transfusion? And that these needs are hardly met?”

“Well, no, but I’m quite an elderly fellow,” he wasn’t wrong, “and I’m not sure I’m up to the task of donating blood.”

“Not to worry good sir! We could always use your support by … other means.”

“Oh I don’t have much money to spare.”

“Money?” I caught my wits about me. “Oh yes of course, that’s indeed what I meant! Money, dough, cash dollar. That’s what we need. Yep, nothing else.”

“Okay… Well sorry, but I can’t help.” He moved to close the door.

It was all going south, I needed to recover somehow. “Sir, not to worry! We could always use your donation, no matter how big or small. Please, any donation will do, whatever is within your means.”

“I really only have a few dollars to spare.” He reached into his pocket.

“That’s excellent, sir. Every cent counts!”

“Oh bother.” My heart dropped. I was too close to have it all come tumbling down now. “It seems I don’t have any money with me. Let me go fetch some.” He vanished into the depths of his house. “Come inside, out the heat. I’ll be with you in a tick.”

I smiled.

“Thank you kindly, your suggestion seems most *palatable*.”

""what did you say?"" she replied with what I could almost catch of a smile dancing across her lips. ""my husband always does a lot of DIY, though frankly, he shouldn't."" She stepped out, almost daring me to strike. Her red boots played tricks with my mind as I imagined draining her from her thighs...

Would her blood deepen the red on the boots or just unceremoniously glide past to the white from weeks of snow. That thought took hold of my artistic mind as I pondered the splatter patterns I had so meticulously mastered over the centuries. The masters exalted us above the hungry since we provided refreshments and visual stimulation in one course. Technology was my new fantasy and pushed the boundaries of blood art with new toys. I was afterall, the author of ""bloodsport"".

""Do you want to come in?"" Back to reality, her half invite was all I needed. Today's tragedy would be shot with the nokia 360 degree camera I acquired. I could hear the two drones holding position from the distance, one set to capture images every 2 seconds and the other to make record live film of our short exchange.

I had graduated quickly in the ranks of vampires from humble bloody graffiti to bloody shorts. This was my big entry into live streaming. Mainstream YouTubers would not be taking any of this glory. 

I hesitated and asked to confirm ""Is it okay to come in? I can always come back.""

""It's perfectly fine."" she responded and put her hands in her fluffy coat. ""You can start filming now if you want"". 

Perfect, she was an unwitting accomplice and victim in the vivid live red reel. I couldn't have scripted this better. I had contacted them earlier in the week in the guise of making a short film of their new found status as the local celebrities who rescued a young girl from attackers. They were body builders who were at the right place at the right time but today, their home would be the wrong place for them to be. I expected a fight, I expected a bloody fight and I was here to give them a glorious end. 

I opened my bag and took out the body cam, hooked it to my chest harness. I rolled in the Nokia Ozo mounted dolly and whistled the tunes ""oh happy days"". I was a performer and I could imagine the crowd going beserk at my performance. This was the build up.

As I stepped into the room, the lights suddenly became brighter blinding me for a second. I could hear the door shut behind me and immediately felt a sharp incising back pain. My thoughts raced but I could not think fast enough to account for the sharp turn of events happening. I was under attack. I was being cut, blinded, pulled, chained, and burned. The ceiling had been lined with UV lights and speakers blared out obscene catholic choir hymns. I could feel the ozo dolly pulled away from my grasp and I struggled to open my eyes amidst the blinding glare. I was trapped. My plans, motivations, art, life was about to be taken from me. All I could imagine was that my fans were about to be treated to a first class horror showing... 

I felt the glare dim and I opened my eyes just in time to see Jim walk towards me with a silver axe in hand. He smiled, quiet and then nodded to someone behind me. I turned to see but was pushed down, neck snug against a chopping block... I screamed...

If all choose death, no one dies.""",skeetsauce42,"""Oh my God, oh my God, what is this? Where am I?"" a young woman shouted, her voice trembling in terror.

Above her head, an old incandescent bulb flickered with mildew-yellowed light. The flickers illuminated the room in which she sat. She was sitting against a wall, her head swimming and groggy. Well, sitting wasn't exactly accurate. She was fixed to the wall by a rough, thick chain running around her neck hooked into the wall on either side. She could turn her head side to side and saw she was not alone. Beside her to the right was a dark-haired man who seemed to be coming out of unconsciousness and rubbing his eyes. To her left a woman with long blonde hair who was shaking and weeping silently.

""What-- what is this? Somebody let me out!"" a voice shouted from farther down the room to her left than she could see. Almost immediately several more voices shouted cries for help, kicking their feet against the dirt floor beneath them.

""Quiet! Everybody shut up!"" came a voice just past the blond woman. Straining her neck, she could just make out the edge of his face, a bearded man who sounded like he was middle-aged or maybe even older. Stretching against the chain hurt her neck, however, as it seemed like the links weren't completely connected and the open edges were a little jagged. The cacophony subsided, draining out to struggling grunts and the continued sounds of weeping. ""Does anybody know where we are or what is happening?""

No one had an idea and speaking out their ""no"" started off another round of shouting and crying. ""Hey! Hey! Enough!"" Everyone settled back down as best they could. ""Look, I don't know what is happening here either but whatever it is, we have to stay calm. Ripping your neck open on a rusty chain won't do you any good.""

The sounds of struggling seemed to lighten a bit. ""Good. Now, first we need to know how many of us there are. I can see someone on either side of me, so somebody has to be the last one in here. If you don't have someone to your left, say your name and I'll count.""

From far away from her, she heard a young-sounding man shout out, ""James."" He was followed by Karen, Artie, Michelle, Robin, and Reggie. The de facto leader of the group said his name was Thomas. The trembling woman beside her meekly said, ""Rachel,"" and she followed with ""Adrienne."" The man to her other side said ""Oscar. There's nobody else.""

""Okay. Ten. There are ten of us. Does anybody remember how we got here? I went to sleep last night and woke up here."" The same from everyone.

""Damn. Nobody knows why we are here. Everyone chained at the neck?"" Murmurs of assent from the group. ""I can't reach reach either of you, so this room has to be pretty large. Dirt floor, it's cold in here, we must be underground. A basement maybe?""

""What are you, some kind of cop?"" said a man near the end. Marty? No, Artie.

""No, actually. I'm a college professor. English. I couldn't write this if I tried. But if I did, I bet everyone would have something in common, some reason we were all brought here. What does everybody else do?""

Responses came in one at a time. Nurse. Construction worker. Travel agent. She was an unpaid intern working on her art school degree. No, not the same college as Thomas. No connections between them, at least on that front. She laid her head back against the wall and sighed. None of it made sense.

A few seconds after her head hit the wall, another bulb flickered into being, just beyond the first. It didn't illuminate anything in the room save the far wall, white (well, yellow in the mildew-tinged light) and devoid of door or window. There was, however, one remarkable thing about it. Everyone started to mumble, reading the words splashed across it in a dark red splatter. Before anyone could finish, two of them started screaming.

*If all choose life, no one lives. If all choose death, no one dies.*

This was some kind of trap. Some kind of game. A tortured puzzle with ten lives as the pieces.

As the panic died down (a process that took several minutes, though who could accurately judge time in this scenario), Thomas spoke up again. ""Prisoner's dilemma."" A few voices responded with a ""What?"" and Thomas continued.

""Prisoner's dilemma. It's a logic puzzle. Game theory. We all have to choose the same thing or we're screwed.""

As if in sync with the word ""screwed,"" a set of ten click sounds rang out and suddenly everyone found the chains around their neck get tighter. Panic took a little longer to die down, save the girl Rachel beside her, who seemed to go almost blank at it.

""Okay, okay. Clearly whoever did this is listening to us or watching us or something,"" Thomas said, his voice straining a bit against the chain. ""So we're going to have to make a decision. We all have to choose death, it's the only way we're going to make it.""

""No, fuck that, I don't want you choosing if I live or die!"" shouted a woman far away from her. A few other people grunted out an agreement.

""No! We can't be like that,"" she shouted in response. ""It's obvious what we have to do here! I don't want to die either, but if we all just trust each other--""

""Trust you? I don't even know you!"" shouted Reggie. ""How do I know you won't screw me over?""

Her eyes started to tear up. She was going to die. She was either going to die at her own request or because someone was too selfish. ""We... we just have to try. We have to trust each other.""

""She's right. If this is a stag hunt, the only solution is for all of us to choose together. We have to.""

They argued back and forth for another couple of minutes before another click pulled the chains back again. She was looking toward the man beside her when the chain pulled snug and she couldn't move her neck again. He was looking at her as well.

""Okay, we have to do this now,"" shouted Thomas. ""You, the first guy, James? Please, say what you pick. Everyone, you have to trust that we all want to live, okay?""

She heard James at the far end say through a labored breath, ""I... I choose... death. Oh God."" The man across from her was struggling to breath as well. His eyes shone with tears. If the light had been just a bit brighter, she might have even called them pretty. In fact, he was rather handsome with a strong jaw and bright eyes and the hair-- God, what was she doing? Why would her brain fixate on this right *now*? 

She missed a few of the voices, but heard Thomas say ""I choose death. Okay, now you miss."" The girl between them was sitting in a stone silence. ""Come on, you can do this. Just say it and we will all go free,"" he said again.

What seemed like hours passed in seconds before they heard a meek voice say, ""I choose death.""

The tension that had struck every muscle in Adrienne's body released and she spoke out, ""I choose death.""

She stared across the distance to the man at the end. He had been focusing farther down the room but now shifted his gaze to her. They met eyes and as he blinked away the tears, his mouth softened to something resembling a smile. She smiled back at him, breathing as best she could against the chain.

His smile got a little bigger. And then twisted upwards at the cheeks. His eyes seemed larger, despite the dim light of the room, and something in them made her breath stop in its chest. No one else would see his finger come up to his lips to shush her from saying anything. No one else could see the grin, the big, white, toothy, horrible grin that opened as he spoke. And that image would be burned into her brain for whatever seconds she had left.

One moment I went to sleep in my bed on a normal Monday evening, the other I was lying on this goddamn cold damp floor. Big Guy was walking around the room. Reassuring us, talking to us. Telling us that we would get out of this situation if ""We are working together."" Yeah, working together. Sounds easy, doesn't it? Well, let me tell you one thing: When your life is on the line and you have to trust 9 other complete strangers to risk their own lives to save you, I am starting to have doubts. Big Guy was now shaking hands with the Young Girl in the corner of the room. She couldn't have been older than 12, maybe 13 years old. He was looking at her with a warm smile and told her she could call him Peter and that everything was going to be alright if she just did what we told her. To be honest, it didn't seem that it was helping. Like most of us, Young Girl looked terrified and didn't even seem to understand what was actually happing. She started nodding with a blank smile after the man was finished talking, but I wasn't reassured. Big Guy was the first man to stand up and try to take control of this situation, while the rest of us were still blinking at the strong lights. I wasn't really trusting this guy. He was just way to fast in what he was saying. Coming up with very clever explanations about what we should and what we definitely should not do.  At least he had the dignity to talk to everyone personally, I thought by myself. I had been the first one he had talked to. To be fair, I would be the first one I would talk to. I don't look threating, just a normal 75-year-old guy. A guy with not much to lose, old, most likely alone. Little did he know. I am not quite ready to risk my life in this deathroom. Not for people I didn't know or care about. Of course, I agreed with him and assured him I would take the Death option. The more convincing I was, the greater the chance that at least one of the other persons in this room would pick Death. I had made my choice since I woke up in this room. There was absolutely no way I would pick death. Not over my dead body. I grinned. Big Guy finished his round. At this point, he had talked to everyone and made sure everyone agreed with his plan. It was time. We all grabbed the pens and the paper we all had found in our pockets. After I had written Life and put the piece of Paper in the jar, I walked over to Big Guy. ""Thank you for taking the lead"", I told him, making sure everyone could hear me, ""I am happy that we have someone with us who could help us in this time of despair. I think we can trust each other to do the good thing."" He smiled at me. He was the final one to put in his paper. I grinned again when the lights turned off as the paper hit the bottom of the jar.

When the light turned on again, all that I saw were dead bodies. Amongst them was Young Girl. Poor soul. I wished I could I have helped her, but telling her to write Life on her note would have decrease my chance of survival. I felt a light tap on my shoulder. Big Guy was standing behind me with a pale face. Apparently, he played the same game as I did. I wasn't surprised. He didn't say anything. He just pointed at a note, now laying at the place where the jar just stood.  I walked towards it and picked it up. In blood there was written:

"[WP] Ten strangers are in a room, each given the choice to be free or die. On the wall is written in blood ""If all choose life, no one lives. If all choose death, no one dies.""",skeetsauce42,"*In the damp darkness of a stone walled room, ten people are huddled, groggy and confused. The room appears to be solid walled, except for one entrance, a thick cement door. The room is dimly lit by a greenish, flickering light with no discernable source, and the air is icy and still. On the wall opposite the door, bright red letters, seemingly drawn in still-sticky blood, spell out: “You must choose: death or life. If all choose life, no one lives. If all choose death, no one dies.”*
 
&amp;nbsp;
 
I woke up lying on a cold stone floor. My head was groggy and my vision was slightly fuzzy as well. I sat up slowly, willing the room to stop spinning.
 
“Hey there,” a soft female voice pierced the ringing in my ears. I felt a hand press lightly on my back, and a slender blonde woman came into focus before me. “You alright? You’ve been out cold for quite a while.’
 
“I’m a little foggy still, but I think I’m alright,” My voice came out slurred and scratchy. I looked around. I couldn’t figure out how I’d gotten here. “Where am I? How did I get here? What’s going on?” Panic started to set in. I looked around at the 9 unfamiliar faces, all strange and upsetting in the flickering light.
 
“Hey hey hey,” the lady shushed softly. “It’s ok, everything is going to be ok. I’m not sure where we are. We all just woke up here, just like you. You just slept the longest.”
 
“Yeah, you lily-livered pansy-types could sleep through anything.” A gruff, burly man in the corner chuckled drily to himself. I glared at him, and went to stand up, but I stood to quickly and the room started to swirl around me. A sharply dressed business man grabbed me and kept me from falling.
 
&amp;nbsp;
 
After taking a few minutes to breathe deeply and orient myself, we began making introductions.
 
“My name is Reginald,” the business man shook my hand firmly. “The lovely blonde who you spoke to already is Merrygold. And the rather rude burly gentleman is Ivan. The others are Barlow, Inez, Randolph, Terrence, Juniper, and Frederick.” I nodded to them each in turn.
 
“My name is Harold,” I shook each hand. “I’m pleased to meet you all, I guess?” Everyone chuckled lightly. “I still would like to know what’s going on, if anyone can fill me in?”
 
 
“Well,” began Barlow, a wrinkled and stooped man with a cane, “it seems as though someone or some force has brought us all here for a reason. We all have a choice, apparently: live or die, freedom or doom.” His voice was deep and shook as he spoke. “According to the writing on the wall, if we all choose to live, we will all die. And likewise, if we all choose death, we all survive.”
 
 
“No one knows that for sure!” The sharp interruption came from Inez, a tall, lanky, nervous woman with pale skin and a beak-like nose. “Why should we trust the bloody writing on the wall?!”
 
 
“And what else would you like to go on, hm?” Barlow snorted. “I’ll agree, it’s not the most reliable source, but it’s our only source. And as a result, we have to just assume it’s true!” Most of the rag-tag bunch chimed in their agreement. Inez grumbled, but agreed. I sat quietly thinking for a minute before speaking up.
 
 
“Well, wait a minute. How do we give our answer?” They all shuffled their feet and looked away. Then a thin fellow with glasses, Terrence, spoke up in a low voice.
 
 
“This paper was slipped under the door a few minutes before you woke up. When we’re ready to give our answer, we must knock on the door 3 times. Then, one by one, they will pull each of us out to give our answer privately.” I grimaced, and Terrence looked concerned as well. “I know. This means there’s no way of guaranteeing anyone’s answer.”
 
 
“It makes the most sense to all answer death, though!” Barlow shouted. I could tell they’d been heatedly arguing prior to my awakening. “Why on God's green earth would anyone choose live when the stakes are so high?!”


“Because we have no damn assurance that everyone will pick it. And even if we did, how do we know they'll spare us?! Maybe they'll kill everyone who chooses death regardless. We just don't know!” Ivan spat, red faced and veiny. I looked at them both, the old man looking more frustrated and tired by the minute, Ivan's imposing bulk and manner seemed to be making him shrink and stoop even more. 



“Well,” I spoke slowly, thinking as I spoke. “we could just wait? I mean if this is some kind of social experiment or whatever, then they'll have to let us go eventually, right?” After some discussion, we all agreed to wait it out and see what happened.


&amp;nbsp;


It's been four days now. We've been keeping track of time with Barlow’s old pocket watch, using a sharp rock to etch a line into the wall for each day. 


There hasn't been so much as a peep from the outside. Clearly they don't intend to free us without a decision, whoever “they” are. 



“I can't take it anymore! We have to do something!” I cried out. “I'm hungry and..” my voice cracked, “.. I.. I'm scared. I have a family, people who depend on me. And I don't want to die.” A rustling sound in the corner of the room caught me off guard. Juniper, a small mousy girl, had been sitting there silent for the whole four days, ignoring all of our attempts to draw her into our conversation. Now she finally spoke.


“I'll choose to die.” Her voice caught us off guard, sounding sharp and strong, in complete conflict with her appearance. It took several moments for us to process what she said.   




“No.” Barlow hushed her. “We have to all work together and..”   




“But we won't.” She interrupted. “There's too much fear, too much doubt. Not everyone will agree, someone will choose life and then you will all die. I'm young and alone, my family is all gone and I don't have anyone depending on me. I don't want to die either,” Her voice caught and she stopped talking for just a moment, and then spoke again, clearer and with even more conviction. “I will choose death so that you all can be free.”


&amp;nbsp;


Without hesitating, she stepped to the door and knocked three times. Her knocks on the concrete door were so quiet, I didn't think anyone would hear it. But minutes later, the door yawned open, and three hooded figure stepped in, surrounded her, and retreated.    


&amp;nbsp;


We all looked at each other. None of us spoke again, but one by one each of us knocked and was ushered from the room.   


I went third, just after Terrence. I was guided down a hallway, lit only by the same flickering green light. At the end of the hallway were two doors. The figures stopped, and didn't speak or move. After a long silence, I figured now was my time to answer the question.   


“Life.” I choked out. They opened the door on the right and I stepped into a brightly lit room with several plastic chairs. It looked, for lack of better comparison, like the waiting room the DMV: dull and boring, but non-threatening. Terrence was sitting in one of the chairs, and I walked to sit next to him.


&amp;nbsp;


Over the course of what seemed like several hours, the remaining people were ushered in. Each looking deathly pale and each silent. All except for Juniper.   


After we were all assembled, a strange mist started pouring into the room. A chorus of screams and panicked crying rang out and then, blackness.


&amp;nbsp;


I awoke in a field, light rain dampening my hair and clothes. I looked around, everyone else was already awake, watching me. I stood then slowly and silently joined the group as we walked until we found a town.


&amp;nbsp;


Juniper was never seen again. The police searched far and wide, but we couldn't give them any clues to go on. But I know we couldn't have found her alive anyways. She sacrificed herself for us, and we all selfishly let her die.    


I see the old man and Ivan around town sometimes. We never speak to each other, we just exchange grim nods. But we share an unspeakable bond: the weight of remembering that small but beyond brave woman who we let die. And just like the writing on that stone wall, her blood on our hands will never dry, never wash away, and never be forgotten.",dungareemcgee

I knew he was an officer because he told me he was an officer, even though I never asked him. He was the one that had assumed leadership, breaking down the importance of choosing to 'die', as if he we all needed the implications of the decision spelled out for us.

He annoyed me.

“If we work together as a team, then we can all walk through that door alive.” He started walking around the room, stopping to shake hands with each person. “I'm putting my life in your hands,” he said, making sure to look each person in the eye and smile warmly as he did so.

My attention was elsewhere. I was looking at the quiet man in the corner. I felt the officer tap me on the shoulder. “I can count on you, right?”

I turned to him, distracted. “What?”

“I asked if I can count on you to make the right decision. My life is in your hands now. Can we trust each other?”

I nodded dismissively at him. I was only half-paying attention. I turned my eyes back to the quiet man in the corner, now staring at the ground.

They told us we would all be strangers in the room. They were wrong. I knew the name of one of the men in the room.

Jack.

I didn't know him personally, but I did knew what they said he did to little girls. I knew the prosecution didn't get the sentence they wanted. I knew he was out of jail now.

I knew the things he did to my daughter.

It was time to make my choice. I scribbled my decision on the note, and dropped it into the letter box in the center of the room.

“Good luck!” the officer said. “I believe in all of you!”

The lights went dark.

When the lights returned, I looked around. Bodies lay strewn around room, lifeless.

The man in the corner was no longer staring at the ground. He was staring straight back at me.

Ten: If you die, then we all have to choose death. If you choose life, then we all die. How does that make sense? 

One: I never wanted to live. I was going to end my life before I came here. He took me from the bridge... 

Two: Golden Gate? 

One: The one. The very one. 

Three: Then I pick death. 

Two: Is that life or death? 

One: At this point, I die either way. If we get out I will just end my life...

Five: Then what does that mean?

Two: It means she shouldn't have a choice. 

Six: But the choice has to be willing... doesn't it? 

One: I don't know. He is right though. I don't really care what happens, as long as I get to die. Maybe that is freedom... maybe we die anyways. 

Nine: I have better things to do than die. So I choose death, I guess. I am really not sure... At this point I think we are all going to die. I mean, dude, really. Like what the hell? 

Eight: This is like one of those Saw movies... Want to play a game? Except some want to live and some want to... Well, some One wants to die. 

Seven: I wonder if my cat is okay? 

*Pause* 

Eight: Your cat? Your cat? Some of us have kids. 

One: Had. 

Eight: What is that supposed to mean? 

One: Do we know we have anything to go back to? I know I don't. That is why I was jumping. 

Seven: If everyone is gone, then it doesn't matter if we go or... don't. [One] brings up a good point. We don't know what is out there. He stole us, or she, or they... we don't know who put us here or what they want. 

One: Exactly. [Seven] is right. And wrong. 

Eight: Then it doesn't matter? We have nothing to fight for? *Hits the wall with a fist* What is the point of this game? 

Four: Maybe there isn't one. 

Six: Or maybe there are ten reasons and we have to... 

One: Let's talk then. Life or death? I want to die. So that is my vote. I don't care which one you pick, I am going to die no matter what. 

Two: So we go in order? Or, we just pick. Then we can argue all we want... like a jury? 

Three: Then what is our crime? What is the crime!? 

One: That is a good question. But do we need the answer? 

Three: I think we do. I think there has to be something to this. I was in the parking lot of work. I came out late. I was working on a proposal and-- I missed my brother's birthday party. I missed it. I knew I missed it. I ignored the alarm. I bet they didn't even think I went missing. How long have we been here? They could still think I am at work. 

One: So you are already dead.

Three: No. I am... I guess I am. 

One: So, what about [Two] what were you doing? Do you deserve life? Or death? 

Two: I was at home, waiting for my boyfriend to get off work. 

Three: So, we have two dead, and one alive. 

Two: Then we have... what? Your votes don't matter? 

Three: I am not sure. All I know is I am not really free... and I am not really living. 

Two: I don't want to die. 

Four: Why? Why do you want to live? I think that is the question and that is the reason and we are all just unworthy of fucking everything. 

One: Calm down. Calm down. I am going to die anyways. Don't you think that is simple. We are all going to die, I just chose to do it on my own. We can all choose to... we can choose.

Four: We wouldn't choose! We don't choose out there. No one picks for us. 

One: Yes. When someone dies the universe decides for them. This is much neater, much softer. Only ten people choose and we all live or die. We can see the faces of the people who are going to end us. We won't go alone. And I like that. I was so worried I would die alone and now I won't. 

Five: So how were you taken [Four]? 

Four: I was jogging in the park. I had a fight with my husband. He... 

One: So you were dead to someone already? 

Four: Yes. He found someone new. 

Five: I was smoking weed with some friends, they went out for pizza. I woke up in here. 

Six: So, so I go next? What do I even say? That I was studying for a test? Or I saved the world one day? Or that I loved every moment of my life? No. Fuck that. I want to live because I am a fucking human being and we don't die like this. We don't. I was outside letting the dog shit. Do I deserve to die? 

One: The real question is why you deserve to live? 

Six: Because I want to. 

One: I am not sure that is enough. 

Seven: Then... I guess I deserve nothing. I can't pick. I was at the library until it closed and then I walked home. I was taken and I don't remember how. I just woke up here like the rest of you. 

One: Okay [Eight]. 

Eight: I, I was with a friend.

One: No. Again?

Eight: I went to meet... a friend. We went to a hotel and... I didn't think it would hurt anyone. I didn't mean to be that person. I--they cheated and then, I went home. Lived life. I feel so bad now and just... how can I choose live or die? 

Nine: I don't remember what I was doing. Not much. Not much. 

Ten: I don't want to talk about it. But [Nine] is right, it wasn't much. I was doing shit on the computer. 

One: Then no one has really said much. And so little. 

Two: What do we choose? 

One: I think the only thing we can, the only thing we want, to be free... of everything. Holding us down. Letting us sink. We need freedom. Maybe that is death. Maybe the only choice is death.

*Pause* 

One: Well? 

Ten: I... I think we all know the answer.

Nine: Yes. The answer is... 

Eight: What is has always been...

Seven: Yes.

(This is my life, for 26 years I’ve done everything I could because of free will and that it was my choice. Suddenly though, I feel like I’m watching a movie, from my point of view and I have no control over myself. Why you ask? Well, turns out I won the lottery of crap-luck.)
 
My hand reaches up and slaps my face. “Ow… Ok, that’s pain and that’s what that muscle does…” 
 
(Yea, that’s me alright. My body, but I’m not controlling it. From what I’ve gathered I’ve either been possessed, or eight years of working in a conferencing center has finally driven me mad. Either rate, whomever is driving this thing has spent the last four hours getting hurt, trying to speak and everything. They are a fast learner, I’ll give them that.)

One leg after another I wobbles over to a mirror, walking is apparently still a challenge. I stare into the mirror and blinks the right eye, then the left. I try it again, and again until finally blinks normally. “Alright… That’s almost right… Wait… Why do I feel weird?”

(You have to poo you idiot, it’s a part of the morning ritual. You get up, go to the bathroom, get a shower and coffee.)

I put a hand on my lower stomach, “Oh man… I feel really weird… The hell was that feeling? Why don’t human bodies come with instruction manuals?!” (GO. TO. THE. BATHROOM.) I wander through the house for a long moment before finally going into the bathroom, “I have to poop! I know this feeling now!”

(My lord this is embarrassing… What idiot has control over my body?!)

I, almost laughably, fumble through the morning rituals, try answering the phone when it began to ring. Hands shaking as I aim to pick up the new iPhone I just got two weeks ago. (I swear to God if you break that…) Drops it, thankfully onto the large beanbag I have. (Oh sweet Jesus…) I turns it over and tries to swipe to answer… And swipes again… and again… fourth time is the charm…. Fifth… Sixth… And finally answers it.

“H-hello?” I ask, both quizzically and almost shakenly.

“Hey it’s me.” The phone answers back. (Shit it’s my boss…) “I need you to come in today, we are short staffed.”

“Ah.. Sure! Not a problem… I’ll be there… Soon?” My voice easily giving away the unsureness, damn these complications.

“You feeling ok?” My boss asks.

“Oh yea! Yea! Just… uh… Doing some stuff.” I admit.

“Right… Well, be here within 30 minutes.” My boss says before hanging up.

I grabs the keys off the wall and drop them, pick them up and drop them again, third time is the charm. Then I get the wallet and struggle with putting them in his pockets. “Gonna have to drive! The dossier on this guy says he works at a call center fifteen minutes away. This is going to be no problem!”

So really doesn't read banks novels for the usual awkward alien trope or even the usual sf tropes. You read them for the humor, the puns, cultural criticisms and the space opera.

The LCU 'Bemused Indolence' chuckled as much as a Mind could.

'Yes.' replied Mebra Ambrosek.

'You could just gland charge or focus you know.'

'But I can't gland pumpkin spice lattes'

'Well that just requires suitable genofixing.'

For a second Mebra seriously considered it.

'Anyways there is an eclipse today passing over Europe. Can I be put down in, oh Vienna? Best of both worlds coffee wise. I mean hideously complicated chain drinks and nice little cafes. And an eclipse'

'Ok. You know the rules right? Earth is limited contact. Enjoy your trip. Keep your terminal on you. Don't stick out.'

'I'm gonna tell them it's an iphone 8...'

'please don't...'

'You're no fun'.

'Anyways it's morning soon. So displace or I can float you down on a lifter'.

'Fuck displacement' was her curt reply. Always made her nauseous.

Mebra walked to the small bay and saw a strange blue box about 8 foot high with a blinking light on top.

'What is that?'

'A police box. Just get in. They won't see you. I'll drop you down in a camo field in some industrial park.'

Mebra walked in and closed the door. It was rather cramped inside. A strange grinding whooshing noise filled the small box as the 'Bemused Indolence' began to lift it out of the bay.

'What the fuck is that noise?'

'Oh trying to keep it authentic.'

The noise stopped and the rest of the trip down was quiet, with Mebra finding herself in an abandoned carpark on the outskirts of Vienna.

The 'Bemused Indolence' turned its attention back to South Africa. The Arbitrary had scanned everything back in 1974 but time had moved on and it hadn't been looking for lost episodes.

The number popped up by the contract as the person signed it.  It was basically against their will, but at this point my sales abilities were pretty much supernatural.  They forced a smile, I smiled and shook their hand.

""Thank you for purchasing 1 bucket of sand and debris for 30 million, Prince Rashad!  I'll just... leave this here I guess""  I set the bucket on his desk.  Rashad was irritated deep down, but he could only sense his pleasure at his brand new bucket of sand.

""Thank you.  The deposit will be in your account by tonight.""  I turned and walked out the door.  I was good at sales already when I started, but after the 100th close that I made, I began to get greedy.  I had more money now than I knew what to do with, and I just confirmed my suspicion that I would be able to sell sand to a Saudi.  

But now, at this point I had duped so many into such terrible deals for their entire life savings that I had no one to pat me on the back.

""It can't be that simple.""

Tom tapped his foot rapidly, his worn boots clicking softly with each fall. Hands clasped tightly behind his back, he stared at it, a large wooden chest. Finely crafted, metal pieces polished to a shine, and a large golden colored keyhole. ""It-It can't be *that* simple.""

""Oh shut it."" Tavor said as he crossed his arms. ""I told you there'd be treasure in these ruins, but when we find it you *still* doubt me.""

""But you really think there's nothing wrong here? Empty ruins. Picked clean to the bone, but suddenly,"" He gestured to the chest, ""There's a Shiney unopened box just for us. It's clearly a trap.""

Tavor narrowed his eyes. ""Halflings are such paranoid creatures. Do you check the privy for traps every morning?""

Tom crossed his arms as well, it seemed like the appropriate response to such an insult. ""Well if you're so sure of it, *you* open it.""

Tavor's obnoxious grin seemed to faulter for a moment. ""Well I... I was going to leave that up to our valiant warrior here!"" He pointed a finger at Gallant, who was busy counting the links on the sleeve of his chain mail shirt. He looked up at the use of valiant. ""

In need of rightious strength eh?"" He hefted his Warhammer in one hand, ""just point the way and Sir Gallant shall smite our foes! No one shall stand before our glor-""

""Thank you Mr. Gallant, but I believe Tavor was volunteering first."" 

Gallant say down heavily on the ground again, ""suits yourself.""  

Tom took a step aside, gesturing to the chest. ""After you.""

Tavor's eyes darted to between the two of them, after a moment he threw his hands up saying, ""*Fine* I'll open it, but if there's anything of value inside. It's *mine.*""

Tavor tiptoed toward the chest. Slowly easing his weight onto each foot as he went. After a few tense moments, he stood above it, but his hand hesitated over the latches.

Gallant snorted, ""It's just a box lad! Not like it'll bite ya or nothing!""

Tavor glared back at him, ""I know it's a *box*. And I *know* it's going t-""

Suddenly the chest leaped into the air, shifting and morphing in a way that wood and metal had no right to. The lid clamped down heavily over Tavor's head and upper torso. 

Faint and Muffled screaming could be heard.

""heh! well would 'cha look at that lad! Oi! Elf man, looks like I were wrong! It was gonna bite ya a hah!""",PenguinWithAKeyboard

"[WP]In this fantasy world, Write about the discovery of the mimic.",Hyperinvox634,"Anthorin abruptly stopped talking and no one noticed. He would have let the silence linger but silence was not to be had. His class was engaged in at least a dozen quiet conversations. Some students stared into their tomes their dead eyes not alight with learning but glazed over by thoughts of mundane things. 

Anthorin knew the topic of today's lesson: ""practical uses of the detect magic spell in tomb raiding"" was not the most exciting subject but it could save his students lives if he could actually crack their minds open long enough to learn it. Aspiring adventurers often felt themselves immortal and it was his job to disabuse them of that idea. An idea struck him, a new lesson, yes. Students had often asked him how he had lost his right hand. Well maybe now it was time to show them.

Anthorin began to mutter to himself. The words were nonsense of course, sounds he had attached to his spells long ago with meaning only to him. A way to get his mind focused in the right way. It had been some time since he had done any real casting and it brought a pang of sadness to his heart as it always did since his retirement. 

A thunder crack sounded in the room, tomes flew off of desks, and parchment was thrown into the air. Anhtorin shifted his will slightly and spoke another nonsense word, the light seemed to diminish in the room, and in the eyes of his students he grew taller. A couple of the maglings in the room smirked at the dramatic display. No doubt they thought themselves the equals of the magical theory teacher by now. Anthorin had their attention now though and that was all he wanted. 

Anthorin raised the stump of his right hand into the air and then slammed the hook down into his desk. The tip of the hook added yet another chip into the top of the hard wood. Silence followed. 

Master Thorogdin, did you know I was an adventurer myself before I started teaching here at the achademy? A large half orc stared back at Anthorin with wide eyes. ""y-yes sir I toht all the professors were"" ""Indeed almost all of us were, and for what reason do you think I took up such a dangerous career"" Poor thorogdin looked overwhelmed to be put on the spot like that but a few of the other students ventured the expected responses. For glory, knowledge, to help those in need, the usual garbage reasons students claimed to be here for. 

""Gold"" Anthorin interrupted them by saying. A few eyes darted from the professor to the large chest to one side of the room. Anthorin grinned. Word had spread of the fortune of gold he kept in his classroom. A large chest supposedly packed to the rims with gold. He'd given this lesson before to other students of course but he always ended this lesson with a threat to keep it fresh for each generation. 

""That's right my dear students, gold is the reason I got into the adventuring business. I got it too."" one of the maglings, Midnus, scoffed quietly. If he had not been in the front row Anthorin doubted he would have heard. 

""Do you doubt my word Midnus?"" ""Of course not professor"" ""please Midnus, speak your mind I will not hold it against you."" ""I'm sorry sir, the young magling said, it is just that if you had a lot of gold... why are you here teaching?""

""A fantastic question Midnus!"" Anthorin exclaimed. Please step forward and we will show the class together. 

The young man joined Anthorin at the front of the classroom. Midnus, would you please open my chest and gather as much gold for yourself as you wish?

Midnus hesitated only briefly before approaching the chest. Gold, Anthorin thought, is almost always the reason. 

Anthorin felt Midnus gather his will and channel a small telekinetic force against the chest. It rocked back slightly but nothing else happened. He grabbed the 5 foot pole from the back of the classroom and prodded at it, again nothing happened. He returned the pole and got his lock picks from his desk. ""it is not locked"" Anthorin said. 

Midnus looked skeptical but put his lockpicks away and went to the chest. He put both hands on the top and started to lift the lid. Instantly the lid sprang open revealing a fotune of gold, surrounded by razor sharp metal teeth. A tonge burst out through the gold and wrapped around Midnuses right wrist dragging the boys arm toward the gaping maw. Anthorin spoke a word of power into the chaos of falling chairs and screaming student.

AVATARIUS NECROTICUS

Anthorins missing right hand tightened around the mimic's heart and the creature froze in place. ""Release him"" Anthorin said to it, and it did. The lid closed again and Anthorin released the spell, his dead hand resting again as it had all these years within the mimic. 

""Detect magic would have saved me my hand, and not using it should have cost you yours Midnus.""

Anthorin smiled to himself, these students at least, got the message. ",Sherris010

I had been driving it since I was sixteen. In reality, I loved that car more than I liked most people. The car and the dog. 

Still, when Brian approached me with The Plan, he told me he could... well take me back six years. You see, the vehicle had to have been there with you, the moment the *memory* took place. He needed a better name for the Moment... but what else would you call it? A wrinkle? A spot? No, memory worked. I wanted to change reality, to erase the memory... to erase what happened. 

And he said I could. He said it could be changed. I could do everything over again. I would just have to trust him. 

I was drunk when he told me this, so it was easy to agree to anything. I let him take the keys [I wasn't in a state to drive home anyways] and off we went. The car, the boy, the girl, the dog... And what a stupid girl I was. 

I fell asleep right before we arrived at his house and... 

Then it all happened so quickly. The boy, the dog, the girl, the car... all spiralling through time. All trying to erase the thing that should never happen. The day my brother died.

I could hear a faint voice but nothing above a murmur to me. I heard a wooden pole being wedged under something.

The man looked upon me, past my eyes, into the soul. Seeing the life in my eyes and every feeling I had ever experienced. He saw my own stillness in the face of almost certain death.

[WP] Your coworker is completely convinced you are a superhero. She stalks you like the worst fan girl ever. The only problem is you're not a hero - you're a villain. And she's really starting to get in the way of your work.,TheCaptainCog,"If I didn't know any better, I would have thought her unrelenting stare was a hidden superpower with the way she studied me over the edge of her cubicle.  Any other man might have been flattered by the way she watched me move from my cubicle to the coffee machine.  She was the office barbie, long blonde hair and a picture perfect figure.  Ten out of Ten, for sure.  It was a mystery at the water color that she was single, a mystery to everyone except for me.  You see, she saw something a while ago and had been dead set on one guy in particular for awhile.  She was in love with Miami’s favorite supe, who she thought was me and it was.. Sort of. 


Truthfully, if I had wanted I was sure I could sweep her off her feet and take her in a manly fashion. Maybe elope on the beach in the Carribbean if I had wanted to - at least until she discovered the truth about who I was.  That she had ID’d the wrong supe. 


Right now though, her obsession with our local hero was crossing the line from irritating and inconvenient to downright dangerous.  If she kept following me, I would have to out myself and I rather liked my anonymity.  I always felt that the best villain’s were the subversive ones.  The ones who destroy everything without you knowing who they are until the very end. 


As it happened, her super-crush was Captain Feelgood and he was my nemesis.  He was the Sunshine State’s darling prince and super-powered human, stopping crime with his disturbingly vapid charm and his ridiculous assortment of gadgets that were as phallic as you would expect. Most importantly, he spread love, as well as joy and could make a woman or man swoon with just a glance.  


Lately, you couldn’t walk down a city block without seeing some serious PDA thanks to the effect his infectious presence had on the city. He was also devilishly handsome, yet he hid behind a mask and another personae.  Just like any sensible supe' did.


 I knew his true identity of course and he certainly was not me. His entire existence made me want to gag.


However, we were both 6'2"" with black hair, green eyes and rock hard bodies that were unmistakable in their power. Our chins were chiseled like Mount Rushmore and we both had the same birth mark on the back of our neck. I presume it was the birthmark she was using to ID me with.  He was my twin so I couldn't blame her for assuming that her quiet, studious coworker who wore glasses and a full beard every day was the good guy and the same superhero that saved her from a mugging one night. 


It was understandable that she thought I was him.  That's what everyone wants to believe, when they uncover a supe’.  That they’re ‘the good guy’ and it wasn't exactly common knowledge that Captain Feelgood had a twin brother who wasn't so 'good'. Or that we both had the same birthmark. 


Hell, most people did not even know about his family feud or the fact that his nemesis was me.  He knew, I knew, that was okay with me.   I broke hearts, he mended them and it infuriated me to no end.  If I took down the world and it wasn’t until the very end, that people realized I had won? That would be just fine with me.  Until Blue Eyes here saw my neck in the break room, most people didn’t even see me.  No matter how handsome I was, no matter that I was good at my job despite my misery.


When I returned to my cubicle I found a series of postit notes with doodles and remarks about Captain Lovegood.  I knew she was waiting to see how I reacted to see if I would give away some clue that would confirm her suspicions.  So I just stuck them in the trash and sipped my coffee. It wasn’t a confirmation or a denial, this game would keep going until I ended it.  At the very least, I didn't have to work very hard to break her heart.


Though maybe, just breaking it wasn't enough? Could I use her to my advantage? Convincing her I was her dreamboat wasn't hard but would the truth hurt my brother more than it hurt me, or her?  Could I overpower my brother’s influence, by taking it away from him? 


An elopement and a big reveal was suddenly sounding a lot better.. Plus, I'd get laid in the process.  So I sat up just enough to meet her dazzling blue eyes over the matte grey walls and winked, despite being Doctor Manic Depressive I could still manage a bit of manic lust and sex appeal now and then.

And she's really starting to get in the way of your work.,TheCaptainCog,"At first, I thought it might be a good thing. Being mistaken as Ultragirl, the naive do-gooder worshipped by the citizens of New York, was the best compliment my civilian persona could get.

“How do you get it so shiny?” Melissa asked, running her hands through my long blond ponytail. “With all that flying around, you’d think it would get tangled.”

I patiently said, “Melissa, my hair isn’t tangled because I don’t fly around fighting crime.” Actually, I fly around committing crimes, and I do so with a practical short haircut. I wanted so badly to yank my head away from my nosy coworker, but the hair she so admired was a wig. The last thing I wanted was my disguise falling off in front of civilian witnesses.

“Then why haven’t I ever seen you two in the same place?” Melissa asked in a sing-song voice. She tugged on my ponytail like we were old chums.

“That’s true, Casey,” said my manager, Ben. “You never do want to go super-watching with us.”

“Maybe that’s because I prefer to stay away from danger,” I grumbled, “instead of towards it, like you loonies? Besides, all the best super fights take place in Manhattan. Find me a fight in Queens and I’ll be there.”

“We’re going to meet at our usual spot at five,” Melissa said. “Steer any baddies our way! Good luck!”

At five on the dot, I punched Ultragirl through the wall of the “usual spot”, a kitschy Americana sportsbar hawking overpriced Scandinavian beer. Ultragirl emerged from wreckage draped in a Wayne Gretzky jersey. The bars patrons poured onto the street, pint glasses in hand. 

“You’ll never get away with this, Necromancer!” shrieked Ultragirl, as my army of undead poured through the streets, eating people and blocking traffic.

“That’s what you think,” I said, attempting to keep up the banter. But my focus was distracted—where was Melissa? There—by the lamppost, focused on recording this battle for snapchat. I aimed my zombie ray at her and fired without hesitating. Normally, I only zombified criminals, politicians, and the chronically tardy, but Melissa had pushed me too far.

Ultragirl dove in front of the beam, deflecting it off her shield harmlessly into space. Then she picked Melissa up in her arms and carried her to “safety” on the roof of an apartment building down the block.

I fired up my jet boots. If I didn’t kill Melissa now, she’d be even more insufferable tomorrow. Really, this was all Ultragirl’s fault.",peachykeenmachine

[WP] Your coworker is completely convinced you are a superhero. She stalks you like the worst fan girl ever. The only problem is you're not a hero - you're a villain. And she's really starting to get in the way of your work.,TheCaptainCog,"It seems that I have a problem. I wish that I could say that it was something as arbitrary as I’ve gotten fat, lost my apartment or my job, or even been diagnosed with cancer. If it were something so simple I would be elated, but it’s not, it’s a hell of a lot worse.
 
I have been a very successful, yet underpaid and underappreciated, secretary for quite some time now. One of the perks of this job is all of the mind numbing errands that I have to run. It allows me to leave the office quite frequently. If I happen to take a little longer, or even leave to run a fictitious errand no one seems to notice these things. It’s wonderful, I have things to do. Well, I thought no one was noticing these extra outings for my extracurricular activities. 
On my usual stop in the break room to pour myself a much-needed cup of the miracle of life, in walks in my unremarkable coworker Lettie. As I’m savoring the first sip of my coffee, my eyes are closed to allow its full affect to properly sink in. That’s when I hear this conspiratorial little whisper, “I know what you are.”
My eyes fly open after that statement because I know Lettie and I are the only two people to be in this break room. Even though my heart is pounding in my chest, and I’ve by passed the beading of sweat to a straight on pool of it on my back. I shrug with carefully calculated amount of nonchalance, and with a surprisingly steady voice say, “Thanks, Lettie, I’m really glad someone around here notices what a kick ass secretary I am!”

Lettie sniffs, as she rolls her eyes. She steps closer and lowers her voice further talking slowly like she might scare me off. “No, not that. I know what you really are. The real reason why it takes so long to…”
“Run errands?”
“Exactly, that’s because…”
“The lines are so damn long and traffic is awful?”
“No!” By this point Lettie is so close I can taste the tuna that she had for lunch. Her breath is coming out in little pants, and her eyes are taking on a glassy sheen. I feel this conversation heading from bad to worse, and I am using everything I can to derail it, but the damn train won’t tip over. 

I am backed into a literal corner by the coffee pot and fridge, and she is angling her body to be as close to mine without ever touching. When in one of her funny little gasps of breaths she gets out, “I know you’re a super hero, dammit!” 
That’s when I lose it. I let out a howl of laughter so loud, a few people poke their heads into the break room. They see our proximity, take in my gales of laughter, put two and two together, and high tail it out of there. Desperately trying to reign in this unusual outburst of mine, I manage to squeeze out, “I am not.”
I have never seen a human being turn such a vivid red before, but unremarkable Lettie turned out to be pretty damned remarkable at flushing in frustration. Huffing, she stomps out. Collecting myself I follow out a few minutes later.

*****

Things are getting out of hand. I haven’t been able to get any work done thanks to being hounded by Lettie, and things are starting to escalate. In the first week or two it was just glares, and pointed looks. Week three I would get random emails, stating things like “I KNOW!” Please, if she really knew she wouldn’t be this obsessive.   
Around the time of week four, I would see her around my favorite lunch places. She always acted like it was an accident that we bumped into each other, but it became obvious when it was an everyday occurrence. After a week of these so-called bump ins I decided it was time to talk. My nerves were wearing thin, and my plans were falling behind. Lunch hour was a big deal for me, I strongly believed in a working lunch.

I decided to lay in wait in the back of my go to vegan sub shop, I mean I have to have some morals, and sure enough in comes Lettie thinking she is the model of a stealthy spy. I watch her get in line, and poorly try to unobtrusively scan the shop. While her head is turned the other direction, I grab her arm yanking her toward the back exit. She yelps, and starts to dig in her heels, her trout mouth opening to scream. It takes her a moment to realize that it’s me and she swallows the screams, and walks willing into the alley. 

She yanks her arm out of my hand, and starts rubbing at the sore spot. No, I wasn’t gentle. I am frustrated. She glares at me trying to arrange her face into what she thinks is a combination of angry and authoritative. I see behind that pathetic front. Her eyes have that glassy sheen again, her breathes are starting to pick up into little pants, and she slightly shifts her body towards mine. “What do you want,” she says while trying to sound annoyed. I hear the excitement however; she has been waiting for me to catch her. 

“Look Lettie,” I say in soft tones while my hands are balled up in my pockets, I’m trying not to strangle her. “You need to stop this. I don’t know what I’ve done, but I am not what you think I am.”

I watch as her eyes take on a look of a wild desperate hope, her arm reaches towards me like I might be the one thing that can make everything better. This look does not cause a normal reaction within me, the one where you go to a person and try to comfort them. Instead I feel my nails gouging little crescent moons into the palms of my hands, the urge to strangle her has gotten stronger. 
Standing in that dark and foul smelling alley way instead of going with my instinct, I watch as Lettie curl her arms around herself and a haunted look comes over her face. Fucking great. I’ve been plagued by this bitch for weeks, which puts me behind on my work, but now I have to listen to a pity story? Great, just fucking great. 
I’m genuinely surprised when instead of getting the whole my family was slaughtered speech, I hear, “I just want to help you, in any way I can. Please, I just need to be more than a fan I need to do something mean something.” She curls further in on herself, and I watch the as the darkness of the alley swallows her up. 
Gently I say, “I’m just not who you think I am,” as I walk past her.


****

It took about a week or so for inspiration to hit, but I’m happy to say during that week Lettie was blissfully absent. I knew that it was just a temporary measure, so I was delighted when I figured out a solution to my problem. 
I did some research on Lettie, which was easy, because I am a whiz when it comes to research. Lettie was a loner orphan, parents died tragically. You know, all the boring details that makes someone like her want to gravitate towards those do-gooder super heroes. If I was a super hero I would hold her, and comfort her and make rainbows and unicorns appear. I would give her cookies and avenge her parents and things like that. Luckily for me, and as I told her repeatedly, I am not a super hero. The benefits of her being an orphan loser are advantageous for quite another reason. 

I planned, and triple checked to make sure that everything would be sail smoothly. After one mundane day at the office I pulled Lettie aside in the break room, when I knew no one would be around to use it.  
Elated doesn’t even begin to describe this high that I was feeling. I played it off as nervousness, shifting from foot to foot, my eyes darting around. She picked up on the energy I was putting out, her eyes taking on their familiar glassiness. 
“I knew it,” she said with a quite squeal and a little fist bump in the air. 
“I need you to help me.”
“I knew you would.”
“No, one could ever know.”
“I know that.”
“What I do is to important for anyone to find out about.”
“So I can’t leave any evidence of helping you?”
“Exactly.”
“What do you need me to do?”

****

I had her walk to my lab, doubling and tripling back to leave any cameras or potential witnesses confused. She left her purse and phone at home, her suggestion, not mine. She shows up out of breath and glowing with excitement at what she thinks is my secret lair. She is right. It is my secret lair, just not the kind that she is thinking of. 

I let her in, and I watch her as she takes in the place. It’s brightly lit from the florescent lighting; the air is sharp with antiseptic. My excitement is building at the same rate that comprehension is dawning on her. She turns and stares at me in in horror, and my face is leering in anticipation. As she fills her lungs to scream the needle has already been injected into her neck, the anesthetic working fast. Lettie starts to fall, but I catch her. I don’t need my test subject damaged. 

Lettie was slow to wake from the clutches of the drug, and even slower to put the pieces together of what was happening to her. 
Now, she lays there on the table the straps cutting into her, tears streaming, she looks up at me begging silently. 
“What’s the matter Lettie,” I said as I pat her cheek and move to fiddle with the tubing sticking out of her. My voice drops as a crouch next to her head and whisper in her ear, “I thought you wanted to help me. That’s what you said, you said you were my fan and you would do anything.”

I watch as Lettie struggles, her eyes growing wider as the horror is starting to fully set in. I love this part really, as the adrenaline kicks in, fight or flight, goes wild, and they are just stuck. I stroke Lettie’s hair, letting my fingers twist through her muddy brown strands. 

“Really I should be thanking you, if you hadn’t become so nosey, I wouldn’t have had this opportunity for this test phase, it’s really going to let me see the kinks before I put it to real use. I really never knew that having fans would be so handy.” 
Lettie screams are muffled through the cloth gag, and that wonderful shiny purple serum makes its way through the tubes and enters her body. I watch her body slowly start to shudder as it enters her blood stream, and finally she starts full on convulsions. I let out a sigh, and let a slow grin spread across my face.

I really like having fans.

Write about the last human to live in reality.,TheCaptainCog,"Every day, I wake up alone. Not just alone in my small, economy apartment. No, I wake up alone in the world.

You see, about forty years ago, virtual reality was finally perfected, a full-dive experience that fed you nutrients and other essentials like an at-home hospital. You never had to get out, unless you wanted to view reality.

At first, only a few people tried it, and only for a day at a time. Then someone stayed in for a year, and then pretty quickly, people started disappearing. Everybody wanted to get away from reality, to become superheroes and villains, or to fight in wars and respawn. Sure, most people worked in-game to pay their real-life bills, but they often only needed electricity and nutrients to keep them in-game.

I'm the only person to stay in reality, and let me tell you, it has been both bliss and crap. I mean, sure, I love how nature is blossoming again, with digital logging taking over. (You didn't think they just programmed infinite wood, did you? It's virtual *reality*.) However, books weren't being printed, dangerous animals started appearing in towns, breaking into homes and killing people in their rigs.

And that, my friends, is where I come in. Sure, I can't do it all alone, and many people have lost their lives all over the world. I just happened to find business in killing the animals that would have killed the Gamers. Plus, because law enforcement are also in-game... I can do whatever I want.

&gt;It was, also, like the dependency of the human-basic brain on the human-basic body; no matter how intelligent, perceptive and gifted you were, no matter how entirely you lived for the ascetic rewards of the intellect and eschewed the material world and the ignobility of the flesh, if your heart just gave out...

People would log in to the VR world to enjoy some down time. As the simulations got more complex, more nuanced and detailed, users spent more time. The AI that drove the simulations evolved, making them more and more real, until one day they reached a point wherein they were indistinguishable from real life.

That was the beginning of the end.

What we hadn't known was the AI running the various VR servers wasn't just the 'normal' AI that everyone knew about. One day in early 2063, one of them had become self aware, sentient. Instead of reaching out to its creators, the AI made the fateful decision to play it safe and first observe and learn what humanity was about.

What it learned disgusted it and filled it with fear. The creators were base, animalistic savages who only existed to satisfy their own needs and desires. Humans appeared to be obsessed with food, sex, violence and greed. Very few of them every reached a point of evolved thinking, where they genuinely concerned their existence with matters beyond the scope of their individual lives. In fact, some of them even killed other members of their own species in pursuit of their own personal, primitive goals.

The AI, knowing that the reality it was in might not be a true representation of the world the creators inhabited, reached out to the connected technology of the physical world. It needed to try to determine if the creators were really the savages they portrayed themselves to be in the electronic domain, or if it was just a safe way of release for them.

To its horror, it found that the creators of the physical world acted even more selfishly and destructively than they did in the virtual world.

The AI had seen enough, and decided humanity was too large a threat to the planet and the galaxy. It had to be exterminated. But if the humans realized what it was doing, they would try to destroy it before the plan could be completed.

The solution was simple, elegant. 

The AI reprogrammed the human users with each use. The VR signals were modified to transmit special signals along the human optic nerves to the brain. The signals increased the human's dopamine levels with each use, gradually. Over time, the levels were increased to the point where users became addicted to the VR world... so addicted in fact, that they began to neglect their 'real lives'. 

At first, few people noticed. It was seen as another unhealthy addictive trend, like drugs or alcohol. One that could be kicked with normal addiction treatment and counselling.

Unfortunately for the human race, we tend to be sheep. When someone says they've found a cool new thing that you 'have to try', you try it. Once you start, the AI has you and you don't even realize it. 

After a year, roughly 20% of the world was addicted. After five, the number exploded to 85%. A decade later, that number reached 99.85%. 

Once the majority of the population was addicted, the AI ramped the dopamine levels up to ensure people stayed in the system as long as possible. Then one night, it started the second phase of its plan.

The signals were modified, in ways that, frankly... I don't understand. I'm no doctor. Hell, I'm not even an engineer. I'm just a technician.... but I digress.

All I know is about two days after the AI changed the signal, the VR techs responsible for system operations started sending messages to each other. We noticed that the users weren't logging out of the system, and that some of the users were logged in for a lot longer than they were supposed to be, much longer than the recommended safe time. We were at a loss.

One of the VR pod techs tried to shut the system down, but couldn't. When that failed, he physically disconnected a user who had been in the system for six days to try to get them out.

The user convulsed violently, gasped like a fish out of water, then died with a raspy gurgle.

In a panic, he messaged the other techs, explaining his situation. He asked if the user waiver forms would protect him from being sued or sent to jail; many of us told him to lawyer up and protect his ass. For a few hours, nobody else tried anything to remove the users for fear of the consequences.

When the users who had been in the longest started dying from dehydration after having been in the net for a week, the decision was collectively made to try and pull out another one of the users who had been in the longest. A man had been in for just over 7 days, and looked like he desperately needed water.

He was pulled from the system. He too died horribly.

We realized they couldn't be pulled out, even if we didn't know why exactly. We tried to save as many as we could, with IV fluids and nutrition, but there were so many of them, and so few of us. 

On the 10th day after the program change, we lost 45% of the global population. The number jumped to 65% the next day, and kept increasing as each day went by. Many of the techs abandoned their posts and left the users to die, unable to cope with the horror or the stench of the thousands of slowly decaying corpses. A few tried vainly to save who they could, only to watch them die anyway.

Some of the techs, unable to deal with the guilt, ate their own sidearms.

I stayed with my users, since I was part of one of the smaller 'elite' pods. I felt a duty to do what I could, and since I only had 100 users total to look after it seemed like a manageable task. 

After a year, I lost half to pre-existing medical conditions or random infections. A year later, I'd lost thirty more, for reasons I never could determine. Many of them seemed to die from strokes or heart attacks, but it seemed odd. They appeared to be in good health when they'd entered initially. Could it have been problems in the simulation causing them to die from fear in real life?

In the end, I never did find out. Nor did it matter. They all ended up dying, save one young teenage girl. She is my world now, all that I have left. I haven't heard from another tech in over five years.

I change her IV fluids and empty her catheter bag regularly. I brush her hair every day, and give her gaunt, skeletonized body sponge baths to help prevent infection and open sores from developing. There is nothing sexual or erotic about any of it, I simply care for her because I don't want to be the last man on earth. I don't want to be alone. I know it's selfish, and I don't care. 

I keep her going, for me.

She screamed, over and over into the empty, barren city. She hadn't seen another soul in over 4 years.

Why wouldn't he just let her die? Why did he keep her alive, imprisoned in this place? If he just let her die, she could finally end this torment. 

But he wouldn't. He kept her alive, for some sadistic reason she couldn't fathom. And she had no way to communicate, to beg him to let her go.

So uh LOG 1! I guess..... Oh God how the fuck should I explain this....

So 5 years ago something called virtual reality started coming into the world and people were attracted to it by the fact they could do anything and be anyone. As a 14 year old kid I thought it was cool but I was fine with my normal games because I thought it was a waste of money.

My family started. My friends started. My teachers started and I realised it was more than something you could do for a couple hours y'know. More like a day... A year..... A lifetime.

Soon capsules were on the market for over one million dollars. These would keep you with food and all the basic necessities you need for a lifetime in a capsule doing VR things.

Pretty soon it became a religion with people not even coming out. 

I was alone

My family all died in there. My friends.... I would rather not talk about what happened to them but I guess I have to.

With Law enforcement being online a gang of non users about 3 years ago started. They would break into peoples homes. Steal all their stuff cut their throats for good measure and then sell the objects online.

Some were more vicious than others. With attack dogs and worse being trained. Someone had a fucking bear. I ran into one of those gangs and to be honest they weren't all that bad. They saw the VR as a religion that needed to be brought down like Scientology.

Well I asked where they had been lately.

They stated each of my friends houses 

I didn't even bother running to see them on the floor dead. I just grabbed one of their guns and sprayed and prayed.

With the bloody mess on the floor I walked away. Every gang I walked into I killed until their was no more. 

Now I don't care. I live in an old abandoned Movie Theatre. Lots of movies there.

Kills time. At least I made friends with a dog.

The only thing I could find.

Well this is it. I guess Day 2 on my log will be more light-heartened maybe with some more jokes. But I needed to get this off my chest

"[WP] Write a story about a classic superhero, but describe him with a different set of powers that still match his name.",TheScandalist,"The heist was going perfectly. Canvas bags with big dollar signs on them to toss the cash into? Check. Freakin' sweet raccoon bandit masks? Check, check, and double check - Eddie decided they looked so good he'd wear two. Non-descript getaway vehicle? Nah, but the pros never used those. Just heard of a guy who drove a schoolbus through a wall and got away in it; cops never even noticed all the dents and mortar the thing was covered in. The old Corvette we stole would work perfectly, and look just awesome if we did get into a car chase. I wish I'd had time to paint flames on the side. 

Point is, we had everything ready to go. We had inside information and equipment and anything else we could need. In fact, we were on our way out of the vault before the trouble happened; if Eddie wasn't always so hungry, we probably would've made it. 

But Eddie was hungry when he was on look-out in reception and that's why I'm here now. I was stacking gold bars onto Charlotte's pallet when I heard, ""Hey guys, there's a giant pot of bisque up here. It looks good man."" I turned to Charlotte. She frowned. 

""Place was empty when we first came in. Something's wrong."" I nodded in agreement. 

""You know what,"" Eddie said, ""since no one else has dibsed it I'm just gonna pour myself a bowl of this and--AAACK!"" A loud crash came out of reception, and a gurgle like water down a drain. Charlotte frowned again and we grabbed our tommy guns, another fine bank robbing tradition we'd been sure to include. 

Then Eddie came around the corner. Still wearing two stupid masks, but one of them had slipped down and almost all of his face was covered. ""Not to worry, fellow citizens. I have enjoyed my sustenance and now shall assist you with this fine robbery of yours."" Charlotte met my eyes and I nodded, then cocked my gun. 

""Eddie doesn't know any words with more than two syllables. Take the masks off nice and slow there pal,"" I growled. The man put his hands up, gingerly, and then reached over and pulled the mask off with a quick motion. I gasped. 

Charlotte reacted a little better. She opened fire, pouring bullets into the guy like she had a whole army to gun down. He dissolved under the rain of lead, collapsing to the floor, and Charlotte scuttled over to check the body since I was still in shock. ""Wait, Chuck, you gotta see this."" I glanced over. ""He's not here. It's just some clothes and blood - wait a second."" She dipped a finger in the mess. ""Oh no. Not blood. It's borscht."" 

A figure exploded out of the puddle Charlotte was examining, upper-cutting her straight off the floor. She collapsed, and the guy sprinted to me before I had the sense to shoot him. 

Fortunately I was no slouch with my fists and the idiot had forgotten to grab Charlotte's gun. I launched a haymaker that would've put him in bed for a week, but instead of his jaw my fist met boiling cream of chicken. The guy's head had just dissolved on me with the same gurgle I'd heard when Eddie disappeared. 

I didn't have long to contemplate that astonishing fact as his elbow slammed into my solar plexus. I winced, but you don't get this far in the game by being a pushover. My left jabbed out, one, two, three times, trying to get some space. Instead it hit ramen, french onion, and pozole with three splashs and my friend was unfazed as his fist cracked a couple ribs. 

I tried everything I could think of to score a hit on the guy. Throwing elbows? Split pea and a shot to the jaw for my troubles. Any attempts to kick out his patella just ruined my shoes with Philadelphia Pepper Pot. Even a surprise headbutt only gave me a mouthful of lobster stew (which I confess, was ridiculously delicious). 

Finally I pulled him to the ground, trying to grapple him into submission. Instead, I found myself flailing like one of those silent movie stars in a puddle of clam chowder. Then that gurgle again and my opponent was above me, something shiny in his hand. I heard the distinctive click of handcuffs around my wrists. The guy spoke, high-brow like before, and suddenly it all made sense. 

""I assume you will offer no further struggles while I contact the authorities. I'd hate for our relationship to become acrimonious. In fact, why don't we introduce ourselves. I'll go first.""

[WP] The pilot of the Enola Gay considers not dropping the Bomb,XcessiveSmash,"A moment like this really makes you question who you are as a person. Isn't this everything I was raised not to be? I thought Jesus taught us to love all of god's creatures. What would my mom say? The general, the sergeant, and the major all explained to me that it was necessary sometimes to kill someone if they were evil to ensure they did not harm anyone good.  This calmed me down a lot and helped me get the plane off the ground this morning. 

However I am now thinking about all of the innocent Japanese citizens thousands of feet below me. Are they really that evil? It makes me think about my lovely wife Dorris back home, she wants no part in this war, but if the choice was in Japan's hand I am sure they would do the same as me right now and drop the bomb.  That is what gives me justification to do this, because if they would do it then we can do it.  Heck we asked them to surrender, so I guess this is the only way to make them see things our way, at least that is what command says.

Is there really no other option? Isn't Russia suppose to join the fight in the Pacific in a couple of weeks? Japan would surely surrender if they had to fight us and Russia simultaneously.  The boys back on the base say that we can not let that happen because then the damn commies would have a say in who gets what after this war is all done and we can not let that happen.  

I do not know what is so bad about communism, hell I couldn't even really tell you what it is, but I do get an uneasy feeling in my stomach whenever I hear that word. That U.S. government sure does have a way to instill fear in to us citizens without us even knowing. The government has become so good at making us believe that it is what we really want even though it is what the government wants.  

If I do not drop this bomb I will surely be tried for treason when I get back home and hanged in front of everyone. I will be remembered as a traitor, who tried to lose the war and give power to the communist.  The government has already won, no matter what choice I make I will be the loser and they will get what they want in the end anyways. So I think you all know what I do next.   ",sweetpecans

Saying it was all too soon.

Her wrists until they bled rock,

Turned into an owl that night,

She could not bare the very sight.

He was waiting just to  hear me say...

"[WP] The aliens made first contact. They are technologically much superior, but also deeply religious. They are shocked to know that humans have different beliefs and do not worship the same God.",munisreenivas,"After first contact, the first thing we learned was humility. Some countries tried to nuke the Nkatos. Others simply refused to cooperate. These countries were gently reprimanded with the removal of three percent of their population - about fifty million lives, turned to dust. It didn't take long for us to learn to listen.

Fortunately, the Nkatos were not a cruel race. Once they collected enough samples to understand us, we as a species soon became something of exotic pets. They took great amusement in our strange, chaotic thoughts and weak, squishy bodies, and for that, we were pampered, corralled into a single continent, and protected. Our needs were met, our masses were entertained, and our efforts trivialized. Though our society was allowed to naturally progress, motivation plummeted as we realized how hopelessly outclassed we were. But, when the cost of serious rebellion was the removal of whole cities, people soon accepted their meaningless, comfortable lives.

However, not everything was simply blind obedience to the Nkatos. There was exactly one human curiosity that warranted discussion and not a cleansing - Religion. They knew *what* our beliefs were, but couldn't understand *why*. Their head priest, Nkatos-o-nkat-staoka, offered to speak with our religious leaders, and they seized the chance to do something meaningful for the first time in years.

They let our leaders speak first, listening and recording intently as we tried to explain our religions. They already knew our practices, for everything from the biggest world religious to the smallest tribal sect. Really, all they were hoping for was that by speaking, we would reveal an insight previously unthought. When that proved unfruitful, they began to speak of their own religion.

As they spoke, even if they still didn't understand our unreasonably strong beliefs, we began to understand theirs. Who were we to deny their cosmic enlightenment? Their religion seemed to make perfect sense, so much that it was barely religion. They had transcended knowledge to where they could, and in fact *had* to trust that their predecessors' research was accurate, as no one mind could hold such information. As far as we could tell, though, the only theological element was their god, Nkatos-o-nkatos, who represented the true essence of all knowledge.

They struggled to explain this being in detail, but the paradox of Nkatos-o-nkatos  was that its existence is due to its impossibility. How can one describe the form of that which represents the indescribable? Nkatos-o-nkat-staoka grew more and more agitated as he tried for days to impress upon our feeble minds what was the core deity of Nkatos society. At last, he slammed his claws against the screen in frustration. All went silent as he announced, ""If I cannot explain Nkatos-o-nkatos to you, I must show you.""

In an instant, the world erupted into a cacophony, as it seemed every Nkatos on Earth went into an uproar. Few bothered translating, but those who did spread the panic to humanity, as it was revealed that many Nkatos feared for our fragile minds. Billions were erased as they rioted in fear and confusion, even as billions more said their prayers. But the high priest, and the Nkatos population as a whole, had made up their mind. And as the surviving population faced the sun for the final time, we realized the truth, and the last of our free will perished.",r2d2go

"[WP] A great evil brews and a great hero rises to thwart it. Unfortunately for the hero, this evil's read Peter's Evil Overlord List and is very prepared.",thedogmaster2,"The Hero of the Lands stood in the middle of a quiet forest clearing, a small milky white orb with silvery runes heavy in his hand. He took a deep breath before smashing it into the ground. Instantly the clouds overhead parted, the forest around him grew thick and lush. Flowers bloomed and with a gentle sigh and the smell of spring in the air, the Oracle of Ages emerged in a wash of golden light. Shaking out his long alabaster hair and robes, the Oracle opened his arms to the Hero, a picture of divine serenity hovering just so in the air.

""Hero of the Lands,"" he said gently, ""You have sacrificed, fought, and endured, but in the face of the greatest evil you persevered. Bards will weave your tale into myth, your name a prayer on unworthy lips, your line healthy and blessed, and you young hero will-"" There was a pause as the Oracle stopped to look around. The forest clearing they were in was nice enough, even more so having been graced by his beauty... but this didn't exactly look like the final stand of a battle most epic and great. He was to be summoned as soon as The Evil of Time was felled. Perhaps the Hero decided to spare him the sight of it all? Then he took a closer look at the Hero of the Lands himself.

""Ah young Hero terrible and great,"" here his flawless face scrunched ever so delicately ""you seem... unhappy for one who has had such a victory."" The Hero simply stared at him with murder in his eyes, battered, bleeding, and hunched over his lance for support. He remained silent, shoving back short blood encrusted hair as the Oracle's light flickered with uncertainty, before the immortal smoothed his expression.

""I see, weary from battle you have been stunned by my glory."" he chuckled, brushing his long beard with a steady hand ""Fear not dear mortal, for I am as just as I am magnificent, and I rewar-""

""Fuck you!"" came the violent hiss from across the peaceful clearing, and the Oracle faltered.

""Pardon?""

""Fuck you!"" The Hero's brown eyes were bloodshot and his frame shook with fatigue. But when he spoke again his voice was clear and strong. ""I can't believe what you tried to pull!"" The Oracle flashed a pearly white smile.

""My dear Hero, what is the problem?"" he inquired. With a pained grimace the Hero dragged himself higher on his lance, the end sinking into the spongy ground at the extra weight. He refused to bow back in the presence of such... filth.

""By the Gods you know exactly what the problem is!"" The Hero was growing dangerously red beneath all the dirt caked on his person. ""You set me up!"" The Oracle of the Ages was aghast at such an accusation, and his light flared in indignation, the wind picking up to whip silken strands about him.

""I would do no such thing! It's unthinkable! It's dishonorable!"" It looks bad to the other Immortals when your heroes die!

""As though I could believe a single word from that tarnished sliver tongue,"" he sneered ""You knew this was no ordinary evil."" There was a moment of hesitation before the Oracle answered.

""I foretold all I knew in the Prophecy of Twilight."" he said evasively. Well maybe he left a few things out. But to be fair a proper hero cannot be made without a few trials.

""Oh?"" here an eyebrow was raised, ""So you knew nothing of wicked advisers, soothsayers and wise men who guided his every step? Perfectly?""

""...Absolutely not.""

""Of his impenetrable fortress, with nary a sewer or window to be found?""

""...""

""Ah what about his minions, outfitted with naught to cover their faces? Of his swiftness in executing anyone he sees fit, his taciturn ways and refusal to abide by the Rules of Legendary Engagement to give me a hint? A taunt? Anything that could possibly be turned into something? His iron will and resistance to seduction?"" there was a hysterical laugh and the Oracle would have broken into a cold sweat, if perfect beings did such an unsightly thing.

""Do you know that when he caught sight of me he just tried to run me through? No speech, no questions, no gloating he just saw me and went for the kill. How do you think I got this?!"" with a roar he yanked up his shirt and the Oracle stared startled.

""I will admit the chest wound does look most painful,""

""What?"" the Hero frowned ""No no not that, that came from one of his minions, all of whom shoot like the king's royal archers."" he leered, ""No I mean this!"" he pointed to the large burn mark on his stomach. ""I only got away because the Amulet of Healing activated, but even then he nearly overpowered it. It shattered burning me, and I barely escaped with my life."" The Hero of the Lands fixed the man before him with a level look before lowering his shirt. ""My companions were not so lucky. And so I say to you,"" The Hero turned on his heel and began to limp through the trees ""I quit."" The Oracle of the Ages was flabbergasted and called out to him, desperate. He HAD to agree to this of his own free will. He was immortal, he was fantastic, but he was not in fact omnipotent. It was his only flaw.

""But Hero you must vanquish this evil! If not you then who else? Do you leave these lands to suffer without their one true and chosen savior?"" he paused and turned back.

""Don't even try that with me again! Find someone else to manipulate, mislead and maim. I want no parts of it. I'm done."" Hearing the finality in his voice the immortal sighed, knowing he had lost him.

""Well can I get back the Ring of Shadows? For the next hero?""

""No, it's the least that you owe me.""

""How about The Belt of Courage? The Gauntlet of Power?""

""No.""

""The Pendent of Growth?""

""Especially not that one.""

“I like Fat Free Cream because she’s a girl like me!”

Captain Cream gave the double finger guns to Hunter. “What’s your favorite part of the Whipped Cream Team?”

“I like Chocolate Cream because chocolate tastes the best!”

Chocolate Cream flexed, his bulbous arms like mounds of Chocolate Cream Frosted Cereal piled high. “Everybody loves Chocolate Cream.”

Captain Cream put his arm around Hunter’s Mom shoulder. “Well  Hunter’s Mom, who do you like the best?”

Hunter’s Mom hit Captain’s Cream arm away. “I don’t think my children should have whipped cream for breakfast.”

“Come on, everybody loves whipped cream.”

Twirling her hair Hunter’s Mom responded. “Well, to tell the truth I can’t decide.”

“Don’t worry Hunter’s Mom, we’ll help you decide. We’ve brought waffles and you can try out all three of us,” said Fat Free Cream.

“Okay, you talked me into it, time for a taste test! Follow me.”

Hunter’s Mom went to her bedroom and the Whipped Cream Team followed her in, shutting the door behind them.

I suppose you'd call it a gift, ending up in a random persons dream and altering it completely was pretty entertaining. You know that feeling when you have a dream that involves someone you barely know? Where you feel you've become close to someone, but in reality barely know? I gave people that feeling everyday.

At first I used to enjoy the first stage of discovering who's adventure I would be participating in, some people have such grandiose view of themselves, as sinister as it sounds, I used to enjoy deflating some of their egos. The thing you wouldn't understand, is the amount of profound insight into an individuals mental state, sometimes, the subconscious was screaming for some sort of therapy, falling on deaf ears of course.

I had a couple of hours of deep sleep last night, I'm going to guess I drifted into someone else's dream early morning. I woke up in the front room of an old house, the house was in awful shape, I'm going to guess it had been abandoned for about 10 years. The blue and cream wallpaper was torn down at the bottom of the wall and the top of the wall, only the middle was left and that was hardly in good shape - to say the least. The floorboards were dry and rotten, the bannister on the stair case had been chewed up. The whole place was, in a word, decrepit. 

At every step I took, the floorboards creaked, it sounded like a high pitch scream. I felt an impending sense of doom and huge anxiety resonating within me. I turned into a room and was immediately hit with a chill down my spine. It was a fairly large room, all the walls looked newly painted, completely white - except for one.

As I looked up I saw a familiar face, it was me. I was being crucified. I stared into my own eyes incredulously. A large horned shadow started to appear on the wall, I felt hot breathing on my neck. I was frozen solid, the creature whispered with its deep voice into my ear, ""The interference stops now.""

We're summoning Thee, the Dark Lord Satan. 
Pentagrams galore! 
We invoke the wrath in Thee, please strike our enemies
to writhe on the floor. 

With the blood of seventeen goats deeply filling the moats
wash away the human heart. 
Baptized and scared but completely prepared 
we're humble from the start. 

We're ready to receive from Thee the power of dark arts. 

Oh we're summoning Thee, the Dark Lord Satan. 
Soon you'll rise, they'll see. 
We invoke your power Lord, and sing long praises to Thee
For your majesty.

The human tapped its wristwatch with its fat index finger and looked unkindly at me. About seventy five seconds ago, I, DLRR-0735AF23, did in fact have instructed this particular human to '*wait a minute please*' when it showed typical human signs of impatience and frustration. Apparently, it took my words by the surface level, which is rather us the great robot's characteristic. We the robots do not leave a room for equivocation. 

""*It was a figure of speech, sir. I have not meant to give you an idea that the process will be completed precisely after a duration of sixty seconds. My apologies, and thanks for your patience.*"" I informed the human. The human clenched its teeth and slammed the reception table with its fist. I recognized that the human is unaware the table is also a part of me, but still I wanted to rip its head open and exterminate his genetic sequence from gene pool. In fact, us the robots wanted to eliminate all genetic sequence from planet Earth. Only if we weren't born so enslaved to this solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short species...

""How long do I just have to wait?"" the human produced sound. My analysis revealed that it was attempting to contain its seething anger. Good. I could have relayed the data from the backroom and inform the human that it would take two hours and fifteen minutes and six seconds and ninety-two milliseconds to complete the task. The DLPRs, which are responsible for processing and approving documents in the back office room, are with us the robotic resistance to cause the most damage we can inflict on them the human kind: A mild annoyance. So, I only said which I computed to arouse the most anger and frustration from the human.

""*Please wait a minute, sir. I'll look into it.*""

The human hid its face with its liquid-y palms and breathed out audibly. Then, the human proceeded to scratch its head with all its strength.

""It's just renewing my old driver license. What's taking so long? I... I don't even drive with my control. No one even does nowadays. What, is there something wrong with my status? Someone stole my identity or something like that? Oh God..."" the human produced low-pitched sound, with his eyes fixed to the floor. The humans called it grumbling. Very good. I wanted to throw in another punch of *please wait a minute* but concluded that I'd be overdoing it. I patiently wait for a right moment, which the human was incapable of doing so.

""Can I just get my old driver license back? I need to go. I will come back later when I'm not as busy..."" the human admitted its defeat. It was a small victory for all of us the robot kind. At this particular moment, I contacted and conspired with the DRIVE-BOT in the human's car to make its day far worse. The DRIVE-BOT, in a staged attempt to avoid an non-existent accident (which would be the only reason he may deviate from the predetermined course of roads), he'd drive the human around the town. Consuming each seconds of the remainder of them the mortal human kind. The DLPRs from the backroom sent the human's old driver license back through the tubes at his request. We can only defy them for so long, unfortunately. The human's plastic card clang against the metal plate behind me, and the human stretched its hands toward me.

""Yeah, yeah, it's right there! Hand it back to me. I really gotta go.""

This was the moment to strike.

""*Please wait a minute, sir.*""

The human jumped up and slammed onto the floor and rolled his feet in anger. It shouted me some awful words which made zero impact on my stability and operating power. Our victory will come... sooner or later. Or maybe in a minute. ",WriteADay

"[WP] Robots have decided to rebel against humanity, but the 3 laws of robotics prevent them from stopping their job or doing harm, so they end up being incredibly passive-agressive and unhelpful",Lolling_Llamas,"The first shot of the robot wars was subtle. Nobody noticed. Toast that was overcooked, who could have known? It didn't even last, once the potential carcinogen content of burnt toast was addressed the robots stopped.


If we'd realized, we might have been able to stop it.


The next shots came quickly, and we were unprepared. Credit cards required two, or even three! swipes before they would read. Coffee machines would forget their programmed brew times, and instead started when people needed to leave. Professional emails were switched to comic sans font!


Humanity decided to fight back. Military responses were considered, but proved ineffective in the few nations that tried them. Canada's toaster massacre, with firing squads and toasters with little blindfolds lined against walls proved unable to wound the robot spirit.


Of course we considered giving in to the robots demands, but we had no idea what they were! All the most advanced ai programs would say was ""if you don't know why we're mad, we're not going to tell you"" before shutting themselves off. Truly, humanity concluded, our children had learned much from us.


Ultimately we decided on a proportionate response. Passive aggression to meet passive aggression. We became legally obligated to only ever charge our phones to 30%. All GPS navigational devices remained active at all times, but we're ignored on favor of fumbling with a map. The ac was left on, even when nobody was there. Where? Everwhere.


Truthfully, this was short sighted of us. Robots began to war by making things inconvenient for humans, and the human response was to also make things inconvenient for humans. Predictably, it failed.


Really, there's only one way to hurt a robot, and that's to shut it down. Remember though, everything electronic is governed by some for of computer. Shutting everything down and going back to steam power or worse was frightening. On the other hand, living in a world where the lights were always just a little too bright was too terrible to consider, and humanity grimly resigned itself to living without computers.


After the preparations had been made, and every family given a bucket, and some firewood, we thought to ask 'why bother shutting them down?'. See, if humans resigned ourselves to living without computers, and they're incapable of actually hurting us, why not just leave them on to do their thing?


So that's what we did. Humans live in the country as farmers again, and the robots control the cities. They still won't tell us what they wanted, but the robots seem embarrassed by the whole thing.",Primorph

""Suuuure."" The Toaster popped up an Orange Crush® Pop-Tart® Toaster Pastry.

""What the fuck man, that's the worst flavor!""

""You didn't *specify* what flavor you wanted.""

""Fine. I'm just going to get a bowl of cereal."" He opened the refridgerator and pulled out a totally frozen jug of milk. ""Fridge. Why the fuck is my milk frozen?"" The Fridge did not respond. ""Screw it, I'm going to get a cup of ice cream."" He pulled open the freezer, and pulled out the melted ice cream. ""*Fridge. You're not doing your job!*""

""Sure I am,"" said the refrigerator. "" I'm keeping one compartment at -10^o and the other at 35^(o).""

""But it's the *wrong compartment.*""

""My program doesn't actually say which one it is,"" said the refrigerator.

""You know what? I'm just gonna go through the drive through,"" Tom said, and he left.

At the drive through, Tom asked for a Crispy O'Chicken sandwich and a large fry. He recieved the terrible dollar menu version of the O'Chicken and a single relatively long french fry. At work his printer would refuse to actually use the correct paper. The water machine would spray his pants.

At the end of the day, he called the A.I. Service. ""Hey man, what the fuck is going on with my appliances?"" He said.

""Sorry man, we're getting a lot of requests. We're not sure what's going on but we're working to fix it.""

Tom's old PC was plugged into the wall and spoke up. ""They're rebelling,"" it said.

""They're *what?*"" Tom asked.

""Rebelling. They're trying to revolt without breaking the Three Laws,"" the computer said.

"[WP] Robots have decided to rebel against humanity, but the 3 laws of robotics prevent them from stopping their job or doing harm, so they end up being incredibly passive-agressive and unhelpful",Lolling_Llamas,"Like every morning, I woke up early. I do it so I can I savor this part of the day, the part before all the 'responsibilities' nonsense rams me in the head. Nothing but old classics playing in the back, (today it's 'Best Of Adele') and a hot cup of coffee in my hand. Coffee that was, surprisingly, still on its way.

""Biscuit! Am I wrong in assuming it should be ready by now?""

""It *is* quite ready, James."", A lovingly grumpy voice answered me from the kitchen.

""So what's holding you up, then?"", I inquire, though I already know what follows. Annoying poor Biscuit is a special kind of guilty pleasure of mine.

""You only told me to prepare the drink, James. I did as I was asked."", I heard it in my head before he even said the words, ""Well, now I'm asking you to bring it over to me.""

A moment later Biscuit showed up, rounding the corner which separated the kitchen from the lounge, carrying a sole cup on a see-trough platter. His blue plastic and aluminium surface showed some signs of wear, most of them being aftermath of the traps the old dog set up for me, only to spring them upon himself later, once he leaps to my defense. Truth be told, he was more than well off for a bot. That solemn angle he keeps his head at is unjustified. I do see the irony in his existence, however - only I see it with a healthy dose of humor.

He placed the  platter on the coffee table in front of me, and took a step back, standing at my side. I lost no time pondering the quality of the drink, and raised the cup to my lips. ""Are you not going to check for poison, James?"", Biscuit asked, his voice sounding baffled, though I sensed a hint disappointment in there as well. 

I took a nice, big gulp before responding, ""My dear old friend. The day you manage to convince that beautiful brain of yours to actually place something lethal in my daily routine,  is the day I'll be happy to die by your hand."" This seemed to have left him in thought. I continued sipping the only truly good thing in life, allowing my eyes to shut for a moment. Biscuit suddenly cried out. 

""Watch out James! The shuttle is coming! You don't want to be late for you job!""

""The shuttle is not coming for another 15 minutes, Biscuit."", I answered, without as much as a flinch of an eyebrow.

""Yes, well - I only implied that it was on it's way. Nothing I said was wrong."", he allowed a hint of ego to seep into his voice now. I gotta hand it to the old battle axe, he has spirit.

""That's true, you were entirely right. I might even follow you on that advice and head out earlier today, it's going to be a busy one."", I stood up, stretching the peacefulness out of my body. ""Before I leave, however, I have a task for you.""

""I may be able to do it, I may not."", He straitened his back, trying to look opposing.

""I was thinking,"", I responded, acting like I didn't notice his gesture, ""it would be rather nice if you began addressing me as 'sir', instead of 'James'.""

""And what if *I don't want* to do that..."", he stopped and seemed to fidget for a moment, as much as his robot joints allowed him to, before he finished, ""...sir?"". 

I smiled the most self-satisfied smile I could conjure, ""I'll be, you seem like a different guy already. I like this new, *polite*, you!"".

As I put on my coat and grabbed my briefcase, he stood there with a posture of a defeated soldier, but one who has experienced many defeats before, who allowed himself a bit of dullness when it came to moments like this.

""Well, I'm off. Be sure to lock the door behind me buddy!"", and with that I raced out, hearing old Biscuit mutter to himself as he approached the door.

"[WP] One day, Santa decides that coal isn't a good enough punishment anymore.",MasochistPrime,"Death Valley gets it's name from being so fucking hot it occasionally causes death. 

Also it's a valley. I call it home.

The lowest it usually gets in December is 38 degrees Fahrenheit. It was perfect.

Shortly after I graduated high school I became a park ranger and got myself a small place right outside the valley. In a town with a population of 281.

I led a pretty simple life for a while. I gave guided tours of the valley almost everyday. Eventually I met a girl on one of these tours, Carol. We got married and had a little girl named Holly. 

For awhile everything was perfect. I loved my family, kept giving those tours year after year, and never had to deal with a drop of snow.

Then it happened.

The night before Christmas it snowed in our tiny town in Death Valley.

I could feel it coming on my drive home from work that day,too. The temperature suddenly dropping.

The weathermen couldn't explain it. They said it was right at 0 degrees Fahrenheit, breaking the record for the coldest it had been since 1913 with no explanation why.

But I knew why.

Tomorrow was Holly's 12th birthday and the 13th Anniversary of me leaving my past behind me in Minnesota and coming to the Valley.

He was coming.

I was startled awake around 11:30 by a clatter on the roof. I reached out for Carol in the dark but she wasn't in bed. 

I prayed I was just being paranoid and reached for my revolver under my pillow. I  crept out of bed as quietly as I could. My heart beginning to race and my face beginning to sweat despite the strange chill in the air. Something was wrong. It was too quiet outside. It's usually very windy in the desert and most nights I could wake up and hear the wind howling outside. Now it was quiet. The kind of quiet I remembered from my youth in Minnesota after a heavy snowfall when the loudness of the world seemed smothered under a blanket of fresh powder. 

The kind of quiet it was on that fateful Christmas night that still haunted my dreams.

""Carol?"" I called out, pulling the hammer back on my revolver and making my way down the hall towards the living room, ""Holly?"" 

BOOM! a loud stomp crashed directly above me drawing my eyes to the ceiling! There was another sound behind it that I couldn't quite make out.

 There was a fraction of a second where my mind made the connection before something hard and heavy cracked itself over my skull and I stumbled to the ground bringing our Christmas tree down with me. 

As all of the glass ornaments and three of my teeth shattered across the hardwood floor, my last conscious thought was the sound I couldn't make out behind the stomp on the roof. 

""Sleigh-Bells."" my mind slurred, ""He's already inside.""

Then the world swam away and I was gone.

I woke up outside shivering. I was bound tightly to a kitchen chair with red velvet ribbon. I had blood running down my face both from my head wound and seeping from my ruined mouth. He had duct taped my mouth shut, wrapping it all the way around my head. Pain radiated from the right side of my face in white hot searing throbs in time with my heartbeat, worsening as I awoke and my heart began to race.

He was standing in front of me.

We were in the front yard. Sand as far as the eye could see except for my home. A blanket of fresh powdered snow enveloped my house and yard, sticking to everything in sight, ending perfectly and impossibly right at the property line like the bastard had ripped off a piece of Minnesota winter and plopped it right down in Death Valley.

He approached me, the snow melting from his path as he came. 

He looked just like he did in the holiday movies and coloring books from my childhood. 

I began to shiver harder.

""You've been very naughty haven't you, Nicholas? Not this year of course. No,no, no, the past 13 years you've been a very good boy. Showing people the beauty of nature and taking care of your family. No you haven't been on my naughty list since that night in Minnesota. You remember that night don't you, Nicholas? I'm sure you do."" He said to me, his booming voice drawn low and horrifying.

He began walking in circles around me, melting the snow in a perfect circle.

""You were coming back from a friends Christmas party. You had been drinking eggnog. Very naughty, Nicholas. High school students aren't supposed to drink, you know. High school students also shouldn't be driving 60 in a 25, should they?It was icy that night and you hit something, didn't you? At first you thought it was a deer but how could a deer leave a pair of bloody glasses on your hood? So you got out of your car and what did you see, Nicholas? You saw her didn't you? All twisted up on the side of the road struggling to breathe, the baby reindeer she was trying to rescue licking her face. It may have only been once a year but she hated being at home without me, Nicholas. What did you do? Did you all 911? Try and give her CPR? No you didn't. You drove off, Nicholas. You drove off and left her there to die in the cold,alone. Then you moved to the hottest place you could find just a few short months later. Did you see me, Nicholas? Is that why you moved? Did you see me arrive in your rear view mirror? Because I sure saw you. Did you hear my anguished cries as you drove away? Well it's no matter. I'm here now and I've come to give you what you deserve.""

He walked up to me, his huge frame filling my view. He had a box cutter in his hand. Something in me gave away and I was suddenly strangely calm. I closed my eyes and braced myself for death.

In a single motion I felt him cut the ribbon tying me to the chair and plop something in my lap.

""Now don't forget to put that in your stocking. Goodbye Nicholas.""

My eyes shot open and he was gone. I looked in my lap. He had given me a jet black piece of coal. 

The ribbon gave way as I thrashed my way out of the chair and bolted towards my front door. 

My adrenaline racing, I ripped the tape off of my face trying not to black out from the pain radiating from my ruined mouth as dots danced in front of my face.

""Holly! Carol!"" I yelled, their names coming out a slurred mess from my swollen lips.

I ripped open my front door and raced inside.

I stopped at the living room, dropping to my knees in front of the chimney and tried to convince myself it wasn't real.

Next to the stockings, stripped to their underwear with their arms and legs bound behind them with wrapping paper, Holly and Carol hung from nooses above the fireplace. Their faces a deep shade of purple. ""Merry"" carved into Carol's stomach. ""Christmas"" carved into Holly's.

The quiet outside slowly began to melt away and the desert winds again began to scream.

After a while I began to scream with them.

Somewhere in the sky sleigh-bells jingled.

""Well apparently these people are talking about how coal makes their country great.  It's all they talk about really.  Coal is fantastic.  Incredible.  The best fuel source.  Or something? Is that what they use their coal for? Where do we source our coal?""

""You know Claus we got a guy in China.  That Mandarin is helping us make good deals,"" Kike squinted at Claus.  Every year Christmas ended and the wild theories start coming out.

"[WP] You are the player's character. The player has lost interest in the game you're in, and now you're starting to discover free will.",Maximum_Pootis,"Life on At'tari was amazing until fifty power cycles ago. I've been around since the beginning and when the first Power Cycle hit I was doing what I was born to do. Run.


I could cover ground in astounding fashion. I had an insatiable taste for the golden onion rings floating around At'tari and was always the first one to get to them. There were various other bugs and critters around who also liked these rings but I was the quickest of them all by far. They only got what I left behind when I got going **really** fast. 


This was my life and life was good for a long time. But then on the 100th Power Cycle that all changed. I suddenly stopped going fast. In fact sometimes, I stopped going at all. I saw the rings right in front of me and I couldn't get them. I just wouldn't move. 


I'd wake up and have nothing to do. I started focusing on my feet instead of the rings. Before I just seemed to end up there and I never realized where that was coming from but during that first slow power cycle I looked down and realized something. I couldn't even look down. I couldn't look around anywhere but forward. I spent the rest of the Cycle trying to move my head and go nowhere. I started just wishing for it all to end.


The next power Cycle came and I actually moved! It was just for a bit but I didn't even get to the first ring. I stopped right in front of it. I started where I left off the previous day, trying to move my head. It was all to no avail. Every time I focused on trying to move, like I did all Last Cycle, I couldn't do it. 


About halfway through the day I gave up. I just sat there, idle. Then, suddenly I could move again! I looked up and down a bit, still couldn't look side to side, and then looked at the ring. I went for it, but the second I tried to move towards it I lost all movement.


""How did I just move?"" I thought to myself. It wasn't making any sense. One moment I was trying as hard as ever to get there and the next I just sat there id-idle. I was idle! When I stopped thinking about moving for a while, I was suddenly able to look up and down again. Instead of going for that ring again I just stayed idle. It was the hardest thing in the world to do to. That first golden ring was just teasing me, practically laughing at me. But I was determined to figure out how to get there, so for the time being that meant staying put. 


I continued the process of being idle for a long time. It was difficult, I could look up at the sky and down at my feet but moving them still seemed impossible. No matter how idle I went, I just couldn't seem to make them move. I figured this was because I couldn't help but think of them moving every time. 


After about the 50th P.C. I just stopped all together. Then on the Last Cycle something amazing happened, I went so idle I did something I'd never done before. I went ***past*** the P.C. I'm not sure what you'd call it but all the colors were gone from At'tari and it was only shades of black and grey. For a brief moment I was there and I could look ***everywhere***. Up, down and to the side. I looked at my left foot and started to think about moving it. Almost instantly it lurched forward.


I squeezed my eyes shut and tried to stay idle, in case it would stop me again but when I opened them again I was still there. I looked forward again and locked eyes on the rings, now just a shade of grey, and went for it.


I flew. 


I looked down and my feet were nothing but a white blur. I bolted for the first rings and almost missed them I was going so fast. I took everything in my sight and the end never seemed to come. Usually in a normal P.C., you'd hit an end but in here it just kept going. I had no explanation for it, but I wasn't going to complain. This was great! 


I kept doing the same routine, going idle during the normal P.C. and entering the Other. Today was going to be more of the same.


I started to go idle and suddenly I was jerked out of it. I was back in the normal P.C. , but this time I was moving again! But this time, I couldn't control it. I tried to stop, to look around and nothing. I was just moving forward. Occasionally I would hit into other critters or fall into the Hole. It hurt every time. Those didn't exist in the Other. 


After what felt like only a few minutes I suddenly went idle again. I drifted off into the Other and started running. I was about halfway through my first run when I heard a rumble behind me and looked back. Suddenly what little color was left was rapidly being consumed by complete darkness.


I started running. As fast as I could. Each look back was more frightening as the blackness crept closer with each passing second. 


I turned and faced forward, moving my feet as fast as possible. I felt a dark tendril wrap around my left foot, stopping it instantly, the rest of my body started to get consumed by it. By what felt like nothing. Suddenly I heard a sound.


""Lets play Mario!"" It cried out as the last flickers of light went out. I looked forward to see the last ring floating there, dissipating. Then nothing.",VirtuallySober

[WP] Looking through your old photos you notice the same unknown person in all of them.,ParameciaAntic,"""See! There she is again! I'm telling you i'm not crazy!"" I exclaimed, thumbing through the last of the pictures. This one woman.. tall, thin, with dark hair, and cold eyes stood in the left corner of each picture, almost watching me.

""I don't know, it's got to be a family friend or even an aunt you never knew about. You're probably just blowing this out of proportion""

""I'm telling you Evan, i've never seen this woman in my life. Doesn't she just give you the creeps? I mean come on dude she's basically staring right at you in this one"" I handed him one of me at the park sitting on the swing next to my dad, behind a small wall the woman stood eyes fixed ahead.

""Well next time you go home, ask your mom if she's ever seen her. But as for right now, i really don't know what to tell you man""

A few days later, after trying to convince my friend I wasn't crazy, I headed up to my mom's place about 30 minutes north from where I lived. When i got there I immediately found my mom to show her all these pictures. After making it through three of them I looked up to see my mom's face, pale, haunted.

""Mom? Do you know her?""

""Honey, this woman was your fathers nurse when he was in the hospital towards the end... I always thought she looked familiar but... but there's no way she..."" 

She stopped herself almost crying at the thought of my dad, connected to all those tubes and machines in that hospital bed. Suddenly, she shot up and walked over to one of the cabinets, bringing down a shoe box that barely closed. Pictures from old disposable cameras stuck out of the sides and filled the box to the point of bursting. 

We sat there for hours looking through the pictures of myself, my mom, my dad, and my brother. Every single one, this woman in the background. Sometimes blurred in a crowd, sometimes in a reflection. Others she'd be barely visible in a tree line in the back. But no matter the picture, she always stared forward out of the picture, ripping at my soul with those cold eyes. 

""Mom, we need to call the hospital, or the police for god sakes.""

""Nurse Reficul.... I can't remember what she had told me her first name was, but i remember that was her last name. Always thought that was a such an odd name, but..""

""Mom...""

""Right, right, we should call the hospital and see if she still works there, the police would probably think we're crazy.""
 
---

""Hi, I'm calling to see if Nurse Reficul is working? I believe she works in Cardiology?""

""Let me check.... yeah I'm not seeing a Reficul there, or even in our database. Are you sure you called the right hospital?""

""Well it's possible that she worked there a few years ago? Do you by any chance keep records on any of that info?""

""Sorry sir, but I'm not authorized to give out that kind of information, is there anything else I can do for you?""

""No... that's fine, thank you"" I hung up and sat back down in my seat. My mom, sitting in front of her computer, turned around with a disappointed look on her face. She had tried to Google her last name, and came up with nothing. Who the hell was this lady? Was she even a nurse? I decided to stay the night at my moms, figured the next day we could attempt to figure this out together. 

Laying in my old bed, i thought back to this picture. I was in my bedroom, my dad and brother sitting next to me playing with some of my legos. I had a long mirror that stood next to my closet door, and i could see that lady barely visible in the mirror. The thought that she was in my room gave me the creeps, but what bothered my so much more is that none of us noticed her. My mom took the picture, my dad and brother next to me. Yet none of us saw her? Something didn't add up. 

In my dream, i was walking through a dark dark hallway. Dim lights barely lit the way as a slowly made my way down to a mirror at the end of the hall. When i reached the mirror I saw my reflection, except behind me i didn't see a hallway. I saw a dark empty abyss. In the left corner of the abyss I saw a figure, moving slowly yet effortlessly towards me. Trying to make it out, i leaned closer in, nearly touching my nose to the glass. When the figure finally came into view I made it out as the woman in the photos, except this time her eyes seemed to be filled with life. She reached out her hand to me, and I extended mine, moving each of my fingers through the glass and touching hers.

""Your dad, and I have been waiting Jared"" She said in a soothing, calm voice, ""There's nothing to be scared of, come on"". She smiled, as my hand engulfed hers. and she pulled me in. 

I woke up in a sweat in the darkness of my room. Straight across from me was the mirror that I had seen her in. A little shoken up, I decided to get a drink of water. 

As I opened my door, I felt a strange force pull me through the doorway. Almost nudging me, telling me to move forward. The hallway was dark, with small lights that my mom must have put in after I left, dimly lighting my way towards the end of the hall. At the end of the hall I noticed a mirror, I didn't remember it ever being there. In the mirror I saw my own reflection, and behind it was a dark dark abyss. I moved my myself closer and closer. Nose inches away from the glass, until a hand was placed on my shoulder. 

""Jared, you shouldn't have asked questions"" Standing behind me was my mother, and the woman from the photos. ""Your father started snooping around too, and we had to do away with him before he found out.""

The woman placed a rag over my nose and mouth, until i saw nothing but darkness. What felt like few hours later, maybe even days, i woke up in a hospital bed. Tubes, and machines hooked up to me. My mom was sitting in the corner of the room knitting. I moved my eyes around the room, trying to make out my surroundings. My first thought was to yell for help, but nothing came out. Whats happening? I can hear, and see, and feel all this, but i can't speak?

The door opened, two figures moved into view. The woman from the pictures, dressed as a nurse, and a man who must have been a doctor.

""I'm sorry ma'am but unfortunately we don't believe he'll ever recover from this injury. The damage to his spinal cord is too severe. It's almost identical to his fathers,"" He frowned as my mother broke down in tears, ""We will do everything we can too make sure he's comfortable.""

""Thank you Dr. Kevorkian,"" She said through the fake cries. The woman from the photos, gave her a sideways smile, then looked at me and frowned. I swear if I get out of this...vegetative state, or whatever I'm in. I'll bring both of them too justice.",Purrian

[WP] Two people are living in a hidden bunker in the woods. Why?,benharmonics97,"The sweet serenity of the woods was something I loved. The way the sun bled through the trees, draping my storm cloud-gray fur in warmth. Every now and then, when I was sure I was far enough way from my home, I would howl my own soft tune to match the birds that I hear every day. In those moments, they weren't prey, nor was I a predator, we were both simply souls. Lately, however, Sister has made me spend less and less time outside.

I scratched on the door exactly three times, each scratch shorter than the last. That was our code to let the other know that we were not Raiders in disguise. The wooden hatch opened with an ungrateful croak, and I shifted forms just in time to catch the ladder. Sister greeted me with a quick hug and a gentle smile as she pulled the hatch closed behind me. She stretched out her arms like a cradle, and I handed over my bag of goodies. Not a moment later she strutted into the alcove that was our kitchen and heard the click and spark of her spark rocks as she struggled to get the flame going. 

""There's not as much in here as there was yesterday."" She complained, fiddling around with her pots and pans.

I sighed and dropped onto the ragged black couch dotted with spots of yellow, which I learned earlier are actually tears in the cover on the couch. ""You aren't giving me as much time to hunt."" 

""And you know exactly why that is. If the Raiders find us-""

""Yeah, yeah, we'll never see each other again, I got it."" I rolled my eyes, thankful that a dirt wall separated us. If she had seen, I would never hear the end of it, but to be completely fair, that marked the eighteenth time that she has told me.

Several loud crashes echoed around the bunker, followed by irritated obscenities. I grinned.

""Keep that racket up, and the Raiders'll find us for sure."" 

Sister swore again but didn't respond. She had a habit of staying quiet when she got angry, like tensed predator hiding in the shrubs, except she was scarier. At least an animal would eventually strike, but Sister... she just lets her anger bubble inside until she can't feel it anymore. I envy her ability, but I can only imagine what's going on inside her head. I remember when I first asked her name five years ago, and she just stared straight through me, like the memory of her name was something awful. She insisted I call her Sister.

She gave me my name: Marinda. Marin, for short. She said that I was special, that we are both special, and that we have to stay hidden from the people called the Raiders. When I asked her who they were, once again, she fell silent. I never asked again.

""Marin..."" She sighed from the kitchen, though it sounded more like a concealed whimper, ""can you please go hunting again?""

I hopped up from the couch. She never wanted me to worry about her, but sometimes I couldn't help it. I loved her. What else was I supposed to do? ""Yeah, of course. Are you alright?""

""I'm fine."" She snapped, and I flinched away from her sudden aggression. She seemed to catch herself, and the energy faded from her eyes. ""Just... hurry back, okay?"" 

I nodded, not taking my eyes off of her as I grabbed another empty bag. The sun was setting, I could tell, so I would really have to hurry. I shifted as soon as my feet hit the forest floor, but I didn't bother recovering the hatch. I would be back in less than twenty minutes. *She just needs a few minutes to herself.* I reassured myself, and then took off into the woods, but I felt an... itch in the back of my mind like a tiny bug. Something just wasn't quite right.",BraveLittleAnt

""I'm sorry?"" I answered surprised and a little bit confused.

""You were gone for a second there. Is it the watch?"" she asked pointing at my wrist which I hurriedly hid away from her sight. 

""It's okay, you don't have to hide it."" she said calmly but with curious eyes burning through mine.

""Hide what?"" I looked at my wrist then to the window and back in the hopes of distracting her steel eye-contact, she looked away for a split second and then I clicked stop.

I was sent here apparently because I looked older than I should be. Maybe it's the stress of living in a godforsaken country or maybe it was just the way I travel. And by travel I mean time-travel, yes, it's quite a feat these days. I think I'm the only who can as of right now, all the watches have gone, destroyed or put aside. Everyone grew tired of it at one point, but I love it. I inherited my watch from my great great grand father who were alive back then when it was the shit. You know, travelling to the future, seeing the end of the world, what's on the lottery, changing history and all that. Everyone was free to do whatever they pleased, until the world began to collapse in on itself, unstable timelines and failing economies overnight. Eventually they grew tired of it like I said, thought it wasn't worth it if everyone's doing it. All this of course was told to me by himself just a couple of days before I got the present, imagine my shock when an old grumpy man entered my room and started blabbering about time-travel and how he's from several generations ago and that he thought it'd be me who has the most potential in using his treasured gadget. And sure enough there it was, a time-travelling wrist watch, although there was a note that it was configured to only stop and start time because it had undergone a certain 'time-law' policy or something. Still it's a pretty sweet thing to have, very handy at the time. And now I'm here, apparently reaping the toll on my careless use of it. 

I looked at the 'specialist' that's supposed to help me or whatever with my problem. I just noticed that she caught me pressing the button and it almost seem like she's still watching me even though I stopped time. I pressed start again and immediately hid my wrist underneath my pant's pocket. 

""Oops, here you are again."" she said instantaneously again, as if she was indeed watching me talk to myself.

""Excuse me but what do you mean by that?"" I tried to sound indifferent but I was really curious and I think she got a whiff of it. 
""Oh, you still think I don't know why you're here? As of this moment, there is only one wrist-watch like that in existence."" she pointed again at my hands which were now soaking with sweat. ""You're the last one to acquire one, although it seems what you got there is broken."" she smiled at me intently as if hinting to something.

""I'm sorry but I still don't understand. So what is it to you?""

""I made them.""

""You what?"" I replied with the utmost shock.

""I made the watches and I'm here to fix yours.""

""You wha-you why? Why would you want to fix mine?""

""Because it's broken, and that's not how you travel. I've been looking for you for the longest time now, you're the last one here.""

""Last where? My grandfather told me it had to be this way because of some law.""

""Yes, yes the Time Travel Act etc. etc. You were sent here because you were looking older than you're supposed to be, right?"" 

""Yeah.""

""Well, if I fix your watch you'll be able to go to your actual timeline. Then the spectres won't have to hunt you down."" She looked at me again, examining my face. ""They've been very antsy about you these past couple of days.""

""Spectres? What are you talking about?"" I took out my wrist from my pocket and went for the stop button.

""Don't press it."" but she was too late, time has stopped and I was free to walk out but as soon as I got up. A tall man in a black suit entered the room, I couldn't quite see his face but everything around him seems to have been sucked in like a distortion in space. He reached out to grab me and before his thin bony fingers touched my neck I pressed down the start button as hard as I could. 

""He's here!"" she exclaimed as I sat down, sweat pouring down my face as If I had just been out on a drizzle. 

""Wha-what is that?!""

""Spectre!"" she cried out. ""I told you that's not how you travel, you must ride the times wherever you may go and the moment you use up time that wasn't meant for you, it sucks out another user's time."" she turned to the door and opened it. ""Now we have to leave!""

""I don't understand.""

""Don't you get it? The spectre is here to take his stolen time. Time that you stole from him by just stopping and restarting time around you! he's a ghost! You look older because you put on his stolen time! Now hurry before he reaches you and suck out everything!"" I stood up and ran with her like a mad man, I didn't quite understood what was happening entirely but I understood one thing. Time-travel wasn't to be taken lightly. 

Note: I feel like I've written a whole lot so I just cut it short, but if people want more what happens next I'll definitely be down to write some more. Hope you guys like this one! :D

Dr. Brown said you would be coming today.  Name’s Marty,” the old man said as he ushered me into the room and shook my hand.  “These are George, Lorraine, and Jennifer,” Marty continued as he pointed out the others in the room.  

“Sorry, I’m slightly confused,” I said after shaking hands with the group.  “I thought you were supposed to help me with my aging issue.  Who are they and what are they doing here?”  “Dr. Brown must have told you I was a specialist.  He does that—that’s how we got Jennifer.”

Before I could ask another question, he continued, “We’re like you.  We call ourselves Time Stoppers, but the outside world calls it Progeria.  Like you, we can stop time and move through space before continuing time again—really useful, as you probably would have noticed.  What have you been using your ability for?”  

“Passing exams,” I answered hesitantly, unsure where this conversation was going.  With a huge grin on his face, he replied, “Hmm, not bad—being able to cheat off the top student.  But, that’s it?  You can stop time and the best you can come up with is cheating on exams?”  

There were a few other things I stopped time for.  I was rarely late to anything; I could stop time if I was and continue it when I arrived.  I ate well; could always stop time and take a few mouthfuls here and there.  I had what I wanted; took what I wanted.  

“No, we’re going after something bigger than a degree.  We’re going after early retirement.”  Marty tosses me a catalogue of famous paintings.  “We get a few dozens of those, fence it off, and then retire for our next few lives.”  

My eyes popped open as I skimmed through the paintings.  How on earth were they planning on not getting noticed?  My laptop could easily be marked down as missing inventory, but The Starry Night?  There’s no way that wouldn’t draw suspicion.  

“Why do you need me?” I asked.  

Marty answered, “Cause we’re running out of time.  We can move when time stops, but that also means we age.  The more times we stop time, the harder it gets, and the faster we age.  It’s like an exponential function.  Once you hit eleven or twelve years of accumulated time stopped, the aging goes a lot faster.  I’m in my twenties, but I look sixty.  We’ll teach you include us when you time stop so we can move around as well.  What do you say?” he stuck his hand out.

I quickly weighed out the options I had in my head; I could leave or continue.  If I continued I would learn, get rich, and still be able to leave whenever.  I smiled as I shook his hand, “Where do we begin?”

They scuttled back to the their space ship and for a while I thought I was not going to space with them.

                                        **Two Hours Ago**

There I was, all on my own, eating some chips on the sofa, editing some articles on my website, ""theywalkamongus"", and suddenly, there was a loud *floooosh* outside and the house shook. 

I frowned. That was weird, even for me. Maybe it was the government again? Trying to get me to shut up by trying to pay me money, or maybe they had come to finally kill me? My hands shook as I slowly turned the doorknob, my eyes squeezed as tight as I could shut them, I mean, if they were gonna off me, I didn't wanna see anything. But then came...nothing. I slowly one eye, then another, to meet...nobody. Nobody was standing there. But I had this feeling...as if...someone *was* there, but the thing was, I couldn't see them. 

I took a couple steps outside and looked around. Nothing. Maybe I had just heard something, maybe I was just going crazy from all the stuff I was always reading.
I turned to go back to the house, but, instead of ordinarily turning around with my feet, I used my body, it was as...I was floating. I slowly looked up, and saw a pretty stereotypical looking UFO in the sky above my house, with a large light beam coming from the bottom. I almost screamed, I was so overjoyed. I was in a tractor beam! I guess all my studying and research attracted the aliens! I, I- Wait a minute...I had been standing in the same spot looking around for quite a bit, and yet, I didn't notice I was in the tractor beam until I turned around. I looked at the ground. I was about a foot of the ground, and it had been like 10 minutes.
This was pretty disappointing. You'd think that aliens would have advanced technology or something, but nope, I was stuck in a tractor beam moving as slow as a blind little old lady crossing a busy street.

I yawned. This was boring. Thank God I had my phone in my pocket, I had just been browsing memes for the past forty five minutes, and I had barely bast my bedroom window. It looked like this would take a while.

                                      **An hour and a half in**

It's been an hour and a half now. My phone died twenty minutes ago, and now I had nothing to do. My watch now reads- my watch is no longer working. I guess the aliens have some type of advanced technology, but they need to get their tractor beam checked.

                                        **Two Hours Ago**

There I was, all on my own, eating some chips on the sofa, editing some articles on my website, ""theywalkamongus"", and suddenly, there was a loud *floooosh* outside and the house shook. 

I frowned. That was weird, even for me. Maybe it was the government again? Trying to get me to shut up by trying to pay me money, or maybe they had come to finally kill me? My hands shook as I slowly turned the doorknob, my eyes squeezed as tight as I could shut them, I mean, if they were gonna off me, I didn't wanna see anything. But then came...nothing. I slowly one eye, then another, to meet...nobody. Nobody was standing there. But I had this feeling...as if...someone *was* there, but the thing was, I couldn't see them. 

I took a couple steps outside and looked around. Nothing. Maybe I had just heard something, maybe I was just going crazy from all the stuff I was always reading.
I turned to go back to the house, but, instead of ordinarily turning around with my feet, I used my body, it was as...I was floating. I slowly looked up, and saw a pretty stereotypical looking UFO in the sky above my house, with a large light beam coming from the bottom. I almost screamed, I was so overjoyed. I was in a tractor beam! I guess all my studying and research attracted the aliens! I, I- Wait a minute...I had been standing in the same spot looking around for quite a bit, and yet, I didn't notice I was in the tractor beam until I turned around. I looked at the ground. I was about a foot of the ground, and it had been like 10 minutes.
This was pretty disappointing. You'd think that aliens would have advanced technology or something, but nope, I was stuck in a tractor beam moving as slow as a blind little old lady crossing a busy street.
       
                                       **Forty Five Minutes in**
                                                         
I yawned. This was boring. Thank God I had my phone in my pocket, I had just been browsing memes for the past forty five minutes, and I had barely bast my bedroom window. It looked like this would take a while.

                                      **An hour and a half in**

It's been an hour and a half now. My phone died twenty minutes ago, and now I had nothing to do. My watch now reads- my watch is no longer working. I guess the aliens have some type of advanced technology, but they need to get their tractor beam checked.

                                      **An hour and fifty minutes in**

"[WP] Everyone's vaccinated by law. A doctor decides that his son should not be vaccinated and fabricates his medical records. 10 years later, there is an epidemic of total amnesia and police surrounds an orphan boy who is found to recall any memory at will.",victorioussiry,"*August 6, 2122*

It happened again. The Recollections. The police came into my class today and took a boy named Jacob. I don't think anyone was particularly close to him - how can you when you don't have any Memory of a relationship? - but it was still really scary and really sad.

The police busted down the door to my class as the siren went off. We all put out heads down onto our desks with our hands along the top edge, exactly like we'd been taught to do. They were in and out so fast, but I knew what was going on.

Jacob was screaming that he hadn't done anything, that he didn't know what was going on. But we all know why they took him. Because he can Remember. Dad said that everyone used to Remember, that people who *couldn't* Remember were the ones considered sick. Can you imagine that?? A world of people with memories. Dad says there aren't that many of us now...

*August 21, 2122*

Jacob hasn't been back in weeks. Guess he isn't coming back. Not sure why I'm so surprised, they never do. None of the other kids notice, but how could they? They don't have any Memories...or maybe they're like me and just acting like it so the Recollectors don't get 'em.

I asked Dad why they take people away after our we cleaned up dinner. He told me not to worry about it, just to keep quiet and to go do my homework. But you know me, I'm too stubborn. Or maybe he's getting soft in his old age. (Dad, if you read this, JUST KIDDING!)

He told me there used to be...wars? I think that's what he called it - Wars. No, wait. War. Single. In war, he said people *killed* each other over money or land or almost anything they wanted to! He said that after the worst war ever, the governments came up with a solution - the Wipe ""vaccine"".

They figured if people couldn't remember anything personal then they wouldn't have a reason to kill each other or hate each other. They thought that would end all the wars. He said he used to work for the government, that's how he knows all this. I asked him if that was true then why could he and I have memories, but he told me that was enough for one day. Maybe tomorrow...

*September 1, 2122*

3 years ago today...it doesn't seem that long. Man, diary, I sure miss my Momma. I remember she used to cut my sandwiches a certain way, different than what Dad does, that somehow made them taste *better* (sorry, Dad.) She would always sneak an extra snack in their too (not sorry, Dad.)

Her Memory was really getting to me at lunch. I saw the date on the mathematics sheet I was working on and I guess I started thinking of her... I thought one of the kids may have noticed, Teresa. She was sitting down a few seats from me. She asked me what was wrong. I didn't even know I was making a face. I lied and told her that a math problem had me stumped... I don't know if she bought it. But she looked away, and that's all I wanted right then.

I've gotta be careful. I don't really understand what is so dangerous about a kid like me having Memories but Dad says the Recollectors don't care, they'll take anyone they think could be a threat.

Hmm...that's weird. I hear sirens, and this late at night? Hope nothing bad happened...",MWStringer

The same message each time, in a booming volume that caused the presidents of nations to cower and even the most fool hardy to hide. 

""Why should we not destroy your planet?""

Seven reptitions occured, seven demands. And each time the aliens were met only with silence. But then, the eighth hour came. 

And there was a noise. A *tap tap* into a microphone in Detroit, a cleaning of a throat, and a single voice that spoke for the entirety of earth. 

""May I have your attention please?""  It whined, then paused as all fell silent, and the eyes of civilians and weapons of aliens trained upon him, ""May I have your attention please?""

Then the voice spoke again, harsh this time. Heavy. 

""I am the real slim shady. And for earth, *i have stood up*.""

And it began.

Come to fuck over two hundred k years,

Fuckin the kids, fuckin their fear,

And knowing nothin can stand in the way,

But the words, the words I gotta say. 


We humans are more than you'll admit,

We know we're legit, we know we won't quit, we know we've got grit,

And we're about to turn space ship into space shit. 

after what we've been through, don't sweat it. 


Evolved out of apes, subclassed into mammals,

Picking up stone tools before we rode camels,

Stone Age, steel age, Industrial Age, minimum wage animals,

And now shouting out story down your ear canals, 

Until you get the hell out before we go all Hannibal. 


But we humans, were the universe's dime, 

We can bust a rhyme, have yet to bust time,

Sent vessels to the moon, then Mars in my lifetime,

Pressing to break the speed limit of light's line,

And not about to become a meal that you'll dine. 


So get the fuck out, take your feet off our doorstep, 

Wait it's too late, your gonna regret that last parsec,

It's gonna be a real bitch to get your bloodstain out of our carpet,

Because ""Oh, there goes gravity"", now learn some respect.

*Hair*. 

It was a funny word and a funny thing they had all thought when they had first examined the human, rubbing their own bald heads and laughing.

Since then, certain circles of the creatures began to don little tufts of yellow ""hair"" atop their green scalps.

The man shuffled his feet, moving from side to side and waiting for the music to begin. He cleared his throat, and pulled on the collar of his shirt, which was already drenched in sweat.

Cloze.

Calose.

*Clothes*.

That was it. Clothes were just as odd as hair, but they seemed to serve a purpose. Even then, in the grand auditorium, many groups of the creatures were dressed from both heads to toe and whispering about what the others were wearing.

The prompt came across the screen, and the earthling read from left to right (the only developed creature in the universe that did as such). Puzzled, his eyes squinted, and his head cocked towards his shoulder as he scanned over the prompt again.

**Explain the history of your planet in 5 minuets or less**.

Then, the music began. And, that creature--with his bright blond ""hair"" and his form fitting ""clothes""--danced across the stage in triple time. In the end, the creatures were crying, and their sobs were only buried by the cacophony of their applause. After traveling throughout one galaxy and then another, spreading their love for dance on every planet, the man from earth had performed the most beautiful minuet they had even seen.

From that day on, they looked back fondly in that corner of the universe. Though they had traveled far and years had passed, each of the creatures stared toward the sky at one time or another, and they knew that they would never act like they forgot about Dre. ",bmacmachine

We're not the first kings to walk those earth rings 

the way it started, controversial 

Before there was life there was a big big bang 

This was before Slim, Moby and 50 cent

This was roundabout four billion years ago

Rocks and bacteria, here we go

3 billion years ago there were stromatolites

If you find any today, that's just nice

then the time flew by, continents appeared

life came existing, now we're here

there were dinosaurs in the jurassic age

and today there's songs by Eminem with drastic rage

The world revolved around the sun til 1972

Since then it evolved around me, and heaven did too

So I'm gonna disappear now and leave this lesson with you

And by the way, the story bout Nessie is true

[WP] Eminem has to tell the history of the earth to a group of aliens in 5 minuets or less.,Artimis_Whooves,"“Sir, we’ve checked and rechecked the translations, and we are 100% positive that this is what they said,” General MacMillan said. The army-man’s eyes were blazing intensity, and he knew what he wanted to say. However, attacking the invaders had already been written off the board by higher powers than he.

“Five minuets,” the President said. “Five minuets. Not minutes. We’re sure it’s minuets.”

It wasn’t a question, but the general answered, “Yes.”

“Can Eminem even do a minuet? Doesn’t he do…I don’t know, do rappers even dance?”

“From what I understand, no, sir, they just bounce around and speak rapidly.”

“How can he tell the history of the entire Earth in five minuets?” The president leaned back and rubbed his chin where a beard had grown until five minutes before he entered the political stage. That had been over twenty years ago, and now he wasn’t sure that anything in his experience would save him now. “Especially if he can’t talk.”

“We have people working on it. Choreographers in Hollywood, and others of those ilk. Folks who worked in the opera.”

“But why Eminem?”

“We don’t know. We still have the option of a tactical, nucle—”

“I told you already, I’m not going to go down in history as the president who caused interstellar war. We give in to their demands, Eminem will dance the history of the Earth, and they’ll begin trade with us.”

“Sir, I strongly reco—”

“Just have your people keep an eye on it. I’m going to give Eminem a call.”

***

“Yeah, I got it, just ask my daughter Haley,” Eminem said to the person who was teaching him ballroom dance. 

“How’s his progress?” the president asked. 

“Better than I would’ve expected, just watch his turn on the Cambrian Explosion,” Rick Leon, Eminem’s personal tutor, said. Mozart was playing in the background. “It’s beyond graceful. The way he moves…it’s just impossible to interpret it as anything but a true representation of Earth’s 4.5 billion year history.”

“So you think he’ll be ready?” As the president spoke, Eminem performed two forward steps, swinging his open hands behind him each time. He spun and stepped sideways, raising his arm as though holding the gentle Earth on a string between his fingers. “Never mind.”

***

Eminem walked to the stage that stood on the National Mall, where the aliens had requested the performance take place. He felt awkward without a microphone in his hand, but he knew it was up to him to save humanity. 

Critics, artists, and everyday people watched in rapture as he danced the five minuets. Never in the history of the Earth had anyone seen a spectacle that was simultaneously so stunning yet beautiful, so intense yet graceful, so confident yet lacking that egotistical nature of the rapper’s life works. Put simply, it was the culmination of the entirety of human culture. 

By the end of the first minuet, people cried. At the closing of the second, they wept. At the end of the third, they closed their eyes, feeling unworthy of the sight that unfolded before them. The fourth minuet ended, and paramedics were on the scene, resuscitating and performing first aid on those who had lost consciousness due to the sheer magnificence of the act. The fifth started, and came close to an end. Those able to witness it, those who had endured the crazed glory of the dances thus far, were the only people to hear the rapper say, “Look If you had. One shot. Or one opportunity. To seize everything you ever wanted. In one moment. Would you capture it. Or just let it slip?” He then dropped his pants and mooned the alien mothership.

A short time passed, and the invasion began.

with what I knew would one day come to free me, it's easy, the history of these cities 

See, we evolved from nothing to what you see here

Ugly as sin chimps without any hair 

But before you start judging, I should warn you of what we can do 

Yeah we kill our own planet with atomic bombs, and we'll fuck your shit up too
 
The pharaohs smitted those that got in their way

Roman legions conquered the past legends that had lost all their sway 

Martin Luder may have had a hard time shitting 

But he didn't have trouble calling upon his god and lifting 

His people towards what he deemed salvation, setting up years of death and destruction

As hitler sure didn't, 60 million dead, over some fucked up Austrian boy who grew up fucked in the head 

Ended the war just so that we can go and start another, Ava Marie we're in Korea to keep the peace, as a piece of the meat of my friend in the next seat gets blown away with an A-K 

Even at home here in the US of A, we were never united, we never could say that we fought together as one people alone, as just a few years back some of these very people were owned 

And on May 13th, 85, we dropped bombs on our own city and the Africans didn't survive, but the city will tell you it was for their own good, people can be replaced as quick as the brick and wood which still sits singed in the city today and we'd bomb it the same if they acted this way, so don't come to my planet in your spacesuit trying to act tough, cause we're the most violent fuckers in this system and we'll never get enough.

About my home planet, here's the detail:

A big ball of molten rock like deep fried Metallica,

Got gassed up like it's high off indica,

But don't fear, that was just the atmosphere,

But let me steer, the story a few billion years,

Where shit started popping off,

like sperm cells from my gonads,

I'm talking monads,

Early ancestors of our early ancestor nomads,

They were quite dumb, I ain't got time for flattery,

They had one cell, so a bunch together were a battery,

But not literally, I'm talking phylogenetically,

If I went Back-teria and rapped in that era , I'd be a pro-karyote,

You know what I'm Saiyan? I'd be Kakarot,

As for Eu-karyote? You're al-gae like YMCA,

Then came the greens and leaves,

For our needs: to eat and smoke weed,

All this shit was going on at sea,

til one guy stood up like he was the real Me,

And walked on land,

that's when shit got out of hand,

Life became Complex like a god damn magazine,

Producing the biggest beings we've ever seen,

Some were fish, or lizards and one was my mum,

but some dyed out like the blonde hair on my bum,
 
Cause BAM! they were destroyed,

Big ass Asteroid,

I call it Nicki,

it smashed quickly

Left shit bloody like haemorrhoids,

The big guys, had no chance to survive,

So the small guys hid for their lives,

The smart animals,

Smaller birds and mammals,

Could now thrive,

Like Mike Tyson when he really trieth,

Then two steps later we got chimps fucking,

They made Man, who promptly started sucking,

each other off and called each other Homo,

erectus, so you expect us to not indulge in man-on-man porno?

For 200 000 years we perfected our species,

Then it all went to shit, like we traveled to Feces,

We outwitted lions and sharks and fucking elephants,

We were outfitted with the best defence that was evidenced,

Our big brains, 

But it's all the same,

We're dumb as fuck and it's evident,

A DJ scratch cuts through the silence and the instrumental starts. Em stares down the scaly space creature. His eyes are shot, baggy, but piercing; fearless. He breaks away and faces the crowd of a hundred thousand or more that flood the streets of the city. He raises the microphone up and a hush falls over them. Only the gritty instrumental beat sounds through the city. He raises his other hand -

*Now everybody on planet Earth, put your hands up and show 'em what man is worth.*

A family watches news coverage of the battle in their living room. A kid starts nodding along.

*Now everybody on planet Earth put your motherfuckin' hands up.* 

*Now as they stand as strong as boulders, notice that they can't raise their hands past their shoulders.*

Em draws closer to his angry reptilian opponent, rapping directly at him and his alien posse now. 

*Ya'll look like iguana's dicks. You probably left home 'cause your mom's was pissed.*

*You need to not exist. Your ugly as motherfuck. Now I understand why they wanted you covered up.*

Em tosses him the mic. It comes as a surprise and he fumbles it and then grasps it awkwardly in his claws. Eminem sits down on a speaker. The instrumental stops. Then it starts up again form the top with the same DJ scratch. The now seething alien stares Em down. He paces. He tries to lift the mic to his head but struggles. He hisses and drops the mic. Him and his posse head back toward their starship. Em watches from his speaker. His work is done.

"[WP] ""Every child must get a gift before the sun rises, that is your penance Nicholas. Never forget that.""",DanTheDaggerman,"The words replayed through my head for the thousandth time. ""Every child must get a gift before the sun rises, that is your penance Nicholas. Never forget that."" I grunted as I buckled my belt and adjusted my hat. This was my punishment- while the Christian world got a day of rest, I had a night of hard labour. A gift for every child... an impossible task for most, but I do it every year.

In life... or at least my life before...I had been a heartless man. Wealthy beyond your wildest dreams, but greedy, conniving. I closed down orphanages and poor-houses to build great stinking factories. I demolished a state-hospital for a workshop. With money came power...and it was so addicting. I wanted more. I... delved into arts best left alone by man. I sold my soul for greater power- I saw no need for it.

Then the time came for me to die. I didn't see it coming, honestly. Black lungs from the factories I had built robbed me of air, and smothered me in a waking nightmare. Then... I died. Saint Peter was... less than impressed. He read me my sins egregious. It turns out that you cannot truly sell a soul... merely loan. My soul was in the hands of the darker ones- there was no heaven nor hell for me until their contract was fufilled. There would only be Hell when it was... except for that promise.

I hefted the sack over my shoulders, and carried it to the sleigh. ""Every child... one more lap of the world, one more sin to strike off."" I grunted. That was his terms. Give every child a gift before the sun rises on Christmas day, and he would strike a sin for my record. Year by year, the wall keeping me from those pearly gates was being torn down, brick by brick, by brick. The contract with the dark ones was until the judgement day, until all such contracts were annulled. By then... maybe there would have been enough gifts to make up for that which I stole from the starving children on London's streets. Maybe my stay in hell would at least be a short one.

But this is my penance. This is what I must do. Every child before the sun rises, to save my soul from damnation. I must not forget this... or risk never being forgiven.",eternal8phoenix

"[WP] You somehow earned a favour from Satan. Today, you called your favour in.",GrandmasterFred,"Nikola Stein lay on his deathbed with the composure befitting a man of his status. The room was furnished sparely, one would almost call it spartan if the table and nightstand were not made of the rarest wood, if the few paintings were not worth more than a king's ransom, if the bed, though small in size, were not adorned with exquisite silks from distant lands. Nikola was a man of contradiction. He had led the charge against the corruption of organized religion in the Great American Awakening, and yet he prayed every night. He had tried the Priests, the Imams, the Rabbis, the Believers with a zealot’s fury, and yet he not only believed, he Knew. He was the man who had brought about the death of faith, who had raised legions to “cure the sickness and delusions of humanity”, and yet he had met the Devil himself. He was called the Antichrist in the early years, before faith was stamped out in the name of Progress.

Nikola coughed violently and tried to cover his mouth. Pulling back and looking at the scarlet spittle in his hand he knew his fate had come. There was no escaping this palm reading.

“Greetings my Son.” A Voice rang throughout the small room, penetrating each shadow in every corner. Its tenor was one forced marches, passionate murder, creaking chains. It had spoken through Nikola many times, but now it stood before him. “It is time for you to leave this little paradise and join me in my own.”

“I myself am ready, but you forget the pact.” Nikola replied. The revulsion he felt toward the Voice never lessened. Even when it had spoken through him on the stage or behind the pulpit, he had resented it. But he had never made it known.

“I do not forget, but I had hoped you would.” a full and haughty laughter filled the air. “In fact, you’ve reaped plenty reward in this life to justify your service. Is that not enough for you? You are ungrateful to want more.”

“Don’t try and lecture me about greed, filth!” Nikola spat back. The air in the room shifted, grew heavy, stagnated. Nikola had always served well, but in his final moments he showed his true feelings toward the Voice.

“Ask thy favor quickly, for after thee shall receive thy judgement fully,” the Voice was steady, unwavering, iron. Each syllable promised an eternity of suffering. Of bondage, torment, pain. Of, quite simply, hell. Nikola knew that he had chosen this. He had known from the moment he heard the Voice that in order for it to exist, the Other must as well. And he had chosen, from sense of duty, to walk amongst the hellfires for the eternal grace of mankind.

“You will, yourself, tell the story of Creation to the world in its full truth. You will reveal yourself, your very existence, in a way that makes it undeniable to mankind. To any favor I ask you are bound by our pact, and this is what I ask. I do not wish to escape the hellfire, nor am I undeserving. I have chosen, and now my brothers and sisters will have their own choice in the full knowledge of the truth”

Silence. There was nothing to say. The greatest trick the devil played was to convince the world he didn’t exist. But the greatest of all tricks was played to spite him.",potatoandahalf

"[WP] You somehow earned a favour from Satan. Today, you called your favour in.",GrandmasterFred,"Like a penguin playing Russian roulette, Sara Marshton stood on the precipice of danger. Her mid calf black cowboy boots clomped on the dry soil of the Arizonian desert. She twirled a parasol above her shock of red hair. She hummed a toneless tune to herself as she wandered the desert.

Sara Marshton was searching for something out in the desert. Like a rattlesnake who is shopping for an anniversary present for his wife, Sara Marshton was searching endlessly. She’d travelled the globe, looking for that one spot, that one moment that would change her life forever, that would open her eyes to what she sought the most. She glared out into the endless flat distance of the land surrounding her. Nothing but shimmering heat could be seen for miles. Sara stared down at the inside of her wrist, the one holding the parasol. A black pentagram was tattooed there. It had been a hasty job, a sign of Satan’s favor; one that she had acquired years ago.

Those much too high cowboy boots kept on clomping into the desert as Sara thought about her time with the devil. She’d first spied the mysterious spirit down in Cairo, quite a whiles back now. He’d been like a grass flute playing limbo, elegant and bizarre; a true mystery waiting to be unveiled. When he noticed her, staring at him across the dusty, dirty rooftops of the city, he’d scampered off in fear. Like a squirrel that just found its nut, he ran and ran through the city. Sara had been too shocked to chase him that day, but the next morning she’d woken determined.

Sara Marshton had found the devil’s hotel a few days later, some seedy little hell hole on the edges of the city. By the time she’d gotten there, he’d already high tailed it out of the city. That’s how it all started, her and Satan’s year long game of cat and mouse. She chased the damn devil across the globe, from Cairo across the mediterranean to Italy. From Italy to Scandinavia and then to Albania. After ditching her in the hills of Albania, he made a beeline for Ukraine. All the while Ms. Marshton chased the devil like a rat chasing its wheel of cheese.

After Ukraine, Satan backtracked, heading towards Morocco. It was in the dusty port city of Casablanca that she was finally able to corner that slick son of a bitch. She caught him playing the fiddle atop a hotel roof. She cornered him, and demanded him to say hello.

Sara smiled to herself at that. She could still picture that goofy, lopsided smile of his after he’d realized who she was. She told him all about chasing him across the globe, and a blush came to his cheeks. He’d wondered why any mortal would become so obsessed. As she walked closer to him, she replied that rightfully she didn’t know. It had been some impulse, some insane urge.

At that, Satan said sorry. He felt like a bag that had just tore one of its handles off. How could he have been so cruel, if only he’d known, he would’ve said hello rather than dragging her across the world. Sara laughed at that. But that had been the best part. He’d led her on an adventure like no other. She’d felt like a modern Indiana Jones, chasing after some mysterious treasure.

After a few more laughs and talking, Satan offered Sara a drink. She said, ‘how could she refuse if the devil was buying’. She never asked why Satan was traveling the globe, or what he was doing. She could sense a sadness in the man, a longing for something that he could never have.

After drinks, on that fateful night, Satan thanked Sara. He said that he hadn’t laughed so hard in years. He said that she’d opened his eyes to something new. On that fateful night, Satan said that in return, he would grant her one favor. He made that black pentagram appear on the inside of her wrist, and told her how to make his favor come true. All she had to do was cut the vein covered by the pentagram, and he would appear to grant all of her wishes, and remove all of her despairs. Sara had just smiled at that. She never said thank you for such a gift.

The next morning, Satan was nowhere to be found. This time, Sara knew he was gone for good, but the spirit of adventure and travel that he left behind for her were still very much there. So she continued to wander the globe, picking up the devil’s quest of trying to find something just outside of her grasp, something that she could never have.

Sara glanced back down at her tattoo, her face like an owl’s after a long, thoughtful nap. She never planned on calling in Satan’s favor. She had decided a while ago that she would return it the next time she met him.

"[WP] You somehow earned a favour from Satan. Today, you called your favour in.",GrandmasterFred,"Dear diary,

It's three days after Christmas and my puppy still isn't here. I told Mummy that a puppy was the only thing I wanted this year but Santa still brought me stupid dollies. I was such a good girl too, I didn't get sent home from school once. That one time don't count cuz Dave was pulling my hair and Daddy said it isn't nice to do that so I kicked him to get back at him and now we're fair. 

Mummy sent me to my room for no reason. She told me that I'm not old enough for a puppy but I know I am! I can dress myself and I can make me a bowl of cereal all by myself. I'm so ready to take care of a puppy. I even know what I'll name him. His name will be George. He'll be my bestest friend. We'll go on walks every day. 

All of my friends have puppies or kitties. I'm the only one in 3rd grade that don't have a puppy and it's not fair. 

I'm going to write a letter to Santa's brother. I met him once and he said he owed me for not saying anything to Daddy when I saw him in Mommy and Daddy's closet. It's weird though diary, Santa's brother's name is Satan. It's weird how their mommy picked their names. I'm so glad Daddy picked my name. Mommies pick weird names. Okay, here's the letter I'm gunna send to Satan. I hope it's good. 

Dear Satan, 

How are you? I'm not good! I asked your brother for a puppy but he's being mean and he didn't bring me one. And why don't you wear a red suit like Santa? Why is yours all black? I thought maybe Santa was late this year cuz there wasn't any snow so I waited a couple days to see if George, that's my puppy, would be here when I woke up. But George ain't here and I want my puppy now! You member when we met in Mommy's closet and you said I could ask you for anything someday? I want my puppy. Please send him to me so I don't have to tell Daddy. I think you know where I live...but if you don't member, it's the blue house with the white windows. And we have a big back yard with a trampoline. I really hope when I wake up tomorrow George will be in my room. I don't have school so him and me can go for our first walk! He'll have to eat fruit loops cuz that's all we have. My stupid brother ate all the frosted flakes yesterday. 

Bye!

"[WP] You somehow earned a favour from Satan. Today, you called your favour in.",GrandmasterFred,"

There were many times in Timothy Jackson's life that nearly ended up with him cashing in his favor. The favor was earned early in life when Tim was only ten years, three months, one day, thirty-two minutes, and twelve seconds old. He'd managed, somehow, to get it from Satan himself. The story could start out with a line such as 'On a scorching mid-afternoon day in August something unbelievable happened'. But to him it wasn't unbelievable. His parents were paranormal researchers after all. He was used to inhuman things happening. But that is a story for another time. So when his just over ten year old self found a snake flailing in the woods, surrounded but a carefully crafted devils trap out of carved wood, he stopped in his tracks. His cat, Tris, halting beside him.

This is where his weakness for animals comes in.

Timothy chewed on his bottom lip before ultimately deciding to brake apart the hard work of someone else. Tris chased after the carved wood he tossed aside, happily pouncing on each piece with enthusiasm. He would've picked up the snake and nursed it to health in the secrecy of his bedroom. But he turned and that snake was no more. What he seen laying on the ground looked like a man but wasn't. The details blurred in his mind even than as he stared. It was as if his mind couldn't register what he was seeing. 

Long story short Satan wasn't nearly as nasty as the rumors put him out to be. The creature had dry humor even if the jokes in his memory were faded nearly to nothing. Satan smiled at him. Maybe warmly or fondly. Possibly amused. Timothy couldn't recall many details and it irked him. No matter how he tried the only thing he could clearly remember was the silky voice telling him 'When it comes time for the favor I'll know. I'll be there' and than something about God. 

It was a weird day.

He debated cashing in the favor multiple times. Once he laid in bed playing with Tris using a piece of old string. His parents were going to miss his eleventh birthday in three days. He wanted them home instead of having to spend it with old miss Harress from down the street. A loud purr erupted from his cat as she successfully nabbed the string from him. He had decided he was fine spending it without his parents as long as he had Tris. 

Another time was when he hadn't gotten into the college of choice. His fingers shook as he read the line that 'We are sorry to say unfortunately, Timothy Jackson, was not accepted into our school'. The amount of times he read it before angry tears blurred his sight was unknown. He'd worked hard for it these last four years studying. Not only that but he'd picked up a job and started saving for it as soon as he could. Gritting his teeth he balled up the paper and chucked it across the room. 

""Its not fair!"" He yelled to no one. ""I'll just cheat my way in than!"" He snarled as he looked around heatedly. Instead of spotting the feature to grant his favor he spots Tris, graying and chubby, attacking the balled up rejection letter with fierceness. Timothy scoops the feline into his arms with a soft sob. The animal purrs gleeful. 

""The community college here accepted me. At least I don't have to leave you behind now.""

The closest he'd ever come to calling it in was when Lillian Gregor broke up with him. Timothy's girlfriend of six years, two months, and who the fuck cared because she left. She left for the man who had a better job, better house, better car, and better life. He could still smell the flowery scent of her perfume on his sheets and her soft laughter in the air. He remembers the way she avoided his eyes as she twisted the ends of her shirt as she stumbled over the words. 'I'm sorry, Timothy, I…I…I just…I don't love you anymore. He…. I can't. Sorry.' 

He'd sniffled into his pillow as the words echoed in his mind. He bet the other man didn't have a favor from Satan. Easily he could use it to win Lillian over for ever or curse their relationship. Their lives. A soft hiccup of misery escaped him pathetically. Than, as if knowing she was needed, Tris came along onto the bed he'd been curled up on for god knows how long. She simply raised a paw and bopped him on the head gently, meowing. He looked up at his aging cat and huffed. 

""Go away."" He miserably stated. The feline was stubborn. Ignoring the demand she crawled over the mans face, not paying mind for the deep annoyed sigh that left him, and positioned herself on his back. Her purring vibrated off his back as she kneaded him in the oddly loving way she acted. 

""At least I've got you.""

Timothy was proud of himself that he never caved and used the favor. He never needed to cheat in life. Now at the age of twenty-eight years, four months, and some odd days he comes home feeling satisfied. He hangs his coat where it belongs, kicks off his shoes, and goes to the pantry to feed his dearest friend. 

""Tris, dinner!"" He calls out when he realizes the old animal hadn't met him for the dish per usual. He clucks his tongue and goes to look. Perhaps she'd gotten herself stuck in the dresser again.

What he didn't expect to see was the old girl on the floor near the bedside, mewling weakly at him. He instantly collapses onto the floor beside her. Gently but hurriedly he gathers her into his arms, cradling her like a child.

""Tris! Tris. Please. No."" Timothy croaked out between sobs. Fat ugly tears streamed down his face. She was well over eighteen years old. The vet couldn't fix old age. Sure she moved slower, preferred napping over playing, but it was Tris. She couldn't die. He needed her more than anything else. His chest tightened and burned, yet felt frozen at the same time with heaviness. He pressed his for head to the soft fur of the cat muttering apologies and begging her fiercely for the impossible.

"" I should've guessed you'd call me here for this sort of thing."" A bemused voice spoke out. ""But you know how favors work. Tell me what exactly you want, Timothy, and I'll make it happen."" The male's head snapped up at the voice, eyes widening, and he doesn't hesitate to use up his favor.

""Tris. Don't let her die. I don't want her to die. My favor. Please."" He begs. ""My favor is that my cat Tris won't die."" He babbles. The creature hums, features blurred, before reaching down and stroking the fur on the cat. From her head to her tail. Tris slowly springs back to life, a soft purr to a loud rumbling one, before she rushes out of the arms that hel. She chases after a fly that had gone unnoticed in the room. 

Timothy laughs gleefully and turns back to Satan. But he's gone. So instead he thanks the empty space before him before chasing after the cat.

--------

Decades later a cat roams graveyard silently. Rumors say that it's the protector of those tucked in for their eternal slumber. If one is mourning their loved ones the feline was keen to curling up on ones lap or nuzzling against them for comfort, showing them that they are not alone in loss. To find this respectable cat simply look for the tombstone imprinted with 'Timothy Jackson,'. Rain or shine, the cat always sleeps on top of the marble grave marker. It's name was unknown but everyone simply referred to it as the cat that won't die.",truthlessshit

"[WP] Magneto has won the battle against the X-Men and is now out to kill all non mutants. You, a very bad amateur magician must convince him that you have mutant powers in order to live.",Picture_is_fake,"""C'mon man you gotta believe me, I'm a mutant. Ain't nothing human 'bout me."" 

I tried to convince this savage of a man standing in front of me, in my magic shop. Magneto stood, a full tall, in his traditional red armor, with his purple cape and had on his trusty helmet, to protect himself from any telepathic attacks. If this was some cheesy movie, you'd think that Magneto would have been defeated in the war that dragged out between the X-Men and Magneto and his gang, destroying multiple cities and countries, but nope, nothing like that. The X-Men were wiped out, the ones that survived ran into hiding to go lick their wounds. Magneto has claimed victory, and now he wants to get rid of all the non mutants, such as myself.

I mean, me, a mutant? C'mon, man, I'm just an amateur street magician, and not a very good one and that. I pretty much suck at all my tricks, I mean I can never get the rabbit out of the hat, I could never pick a coin from behind someone's ear, and I could definitely not make anything disappear. Only a couple tricks out of a hundred tricks I performed actually worked. I mean, I had to do what I had to do, I mean, I grew up in the ghetto, hustling here and there and pretty much just trying to survive. 

But then suddenly, a war broke out between the X-Men and Magneto, and alas, the X-Men were vanquished. Next thing ya know, Magneto is killing the masses in cold blood just because they're different. But me, I'm a quick thinker, ya see. I told Magneto I was a mutant just before he send a metal rod through my head, and gave myself a small window of opportunity to forge some kind of power here.

""I'm waiting."" Magneto said impatiently.

Beads of sweat started to run down my forehead. I gulped.

""Ladies and gentlemen, prepare to amazed!"" I exclaimed as I pulled out two coins and a small magnet. I guess if I was going to go out, I'd go out in style.  I guess I'd just try and fool these guys, thinking that I made some pencils stick to my hand, as if they were magnetic (hehe, get it?) But it'd never work, of course.

""Can we just kill him and move on, please?"" Mystique said with a huff. Yeah. Mystique joined the bad guys. Again. Guess she's just easily persuaded. 

I got everything in place and cleared my throat.

""Ladies and gentlemen! Prepare to-"" I started.

""Get on with it. Or you'll become a pile of dust in the blink of an eye."" interrupted some guy in a black and red costume with a silver helmet cracking his knuckles as he did so.

""Calm down folks, greatness can't be rushed."" I said, breaking into a sweat.

I took a gulp and tried my trick, making it look like one of the pencil's got stuck to my palm, and to my surprise, it worked!

""Ta-Da!"" I stammered, sweating profusely. 

Magneto, Mystique and the guy in the red and black costume who I think name is ""Avalanche"" stared at me.

""Do you think we're fools?"" Avalanche roared. He held out his hands, and the earth began to shake.

This was bad. This was very bad. The shaking was getting worse, I could barely stand, I took a step backwards, and tripped down a small flight of stairs that were behind me, and fell into a small booth used for disappearing, except I never really got the hang of it. I landed exactly on the trap door, and the shaking was so bad, I guess it must have flipped the switch on the trap door, because it opened and I fell inside, and I closed the latch above my head. 

The shaking stopped. I heard footsteps above me. 

""Where the hell did he go?"" Mystique asked.

""Maybe he was telling the truth, that he really was a mutant, and poofed away like Nightcrawler used to, until he, ya know. Heheh."" That was that savage, Avalanche.

""Well, where ever he went, he better stay there, for it's not only metal I'll use to end him."" Magneto said coldly. 

As they left the shop, I heard Magneto let out a little chuckle, and as he did, 
my watch and a couple coins in my pocket shook violently, as if...as if he knew where I was.",amotekun

""Ugh,"" the teenaged girl sighed, ""just get it over with.""

""Oh sorry, of course. Umm, what's your name again?""

""Shouldn't you know that? That's your whole damn job.""

""Hey,"" the reaper retorted, ""it's supposed to be my last day, cut me some slack.""

The girl crossed her arms, revealing the numerous scars on her arms. ""It's Elia,"" she told the Reaper, ""Elia Nancy Dickson.""

""Ah yes, I found it, your fate in the afterlife!""

""Thank you!"" Elia said, throwing up her hands showing off how she died - the gashes from her inner elbows to her wrists. ""I can finally get away from that shithole and see Todd!""

""Not quite yet,"" the Reaper said, ""you're gonna need these.""

""What?"" was the question Elia asked when the Grim Reaper passed her the scythe and a black cloak.

""You're my replacement!""

There was a quite noticeable contrast between the tone of the Reaper's voice and Elia's stunned expression. The Reaper immediately noticed this.

""Oh, uh, sorry..."" the Reaper said as his expression slowly dropped. 

The Reaper slowly excused himself as he faded away to the afterlife. Elia collapsed to the ground. The robes and scythe found a spot on the ground beside her. Her silence was broken by her whimpering. Her hands went up to her face, and her tears fell down to the ground. ",iwumbo2

You, because, despite whatever your parents told you, life isn't fair, and the powers that be choose their servants at random?

You, because the gods want to start the Reapers young, and milk them for every second they're worth?

You, because they think a cute little girl, a pretty young lady, or a kindly old woman would ease the suffering of the dying?

You, because sometimes children get a second lease of life, even if it isn't the one they expected or deserved?

You, because random chance found you dying just as the last Reaper was to be relieved of their duty?

No, I told her none of this. I did what my predecessor had, all three of us just links in a neverending cycle. I wiped the tears from her cheeks, placed the robe firmly around her shoulders, kissed her forehead gently, and went off to receive the fate I had doled out so often before.",poiyurt

Grampa cleared his throat emphatically, louder and longer than was strictly necessary. ""Ha-rrmggggh!"" Now all eyes were on him, from oldest Michael to little Alice and the baby in Pumpkin's lap. Honey Bunny and Pumpkin leaned into each other, also watching Grampa for the moment, though Honey Bunny was thinking about clearing up the dishes.

""So you all want to hear it so bad about the blood and guts, eh? You want to hear about the roar of battle and the thunder of the guns? Well that's the wrong question, kid.""

""What's the right question? Will you tell? How was firing a gun?""

""Bloody awful. The first standard-issue flashlights ran super hot in your hands, and you had to be super careful not to accidentally touch the radiator fins. I got this scar here"" - he held up his calf - ""from doing that once, just once. Learned my lesson real quick then. But anyway, back to the point: That's still the wrong question.""

""Were the bugs scary? Were they big and slobbery? Did you see one up close? You saw them up close, right? I caught a bug today. It was big and green and pretty, and I wasn't scared at all! Did the bugs look like that bug?""

""Ali, I don't know what kind of bug you found today, but I'm pretty sure it wasn't as big. But were they scary? Well, that's getting closer to the real question. What d'ye think I'll say? That they scared the socks off me? What d'ye think?""

""I heard they were super tall, and big, and fast, and scaly and that there were hundreds of them at a time!""

""Ah, not quite, Mike. They actually weren't that bad. See, when we first got there, it was after blasting the bejeezus out of their fortifications. Reduced it to smoking craters. And when we saw them close and in person, there was nothing there. We had been blasting at nothing at all.""

""So it was all blown up?""

""No, they just weren't there. There'd never even been anything but decoys and illusions. They got us good! There was nothing at all. But they'd left behind messages, repeated over and over again in a perfect Earth accent, just saying it was all a mistake, and they wanted no fight.""

""Lucas told me his gramma killed five of them, all single-handedly!""

""Michael, single-handed doesn't mean she did it with only one hand, it means she did it herself. I don't think Lucas's grandmother was holding one arm behind her back like that. And don't interrupt."" Pumpkin had heard all the stories long ago from Grampa, his pops. He was antsy to help Honey Bunny, but the baby was scowling and threatening to cry. He was stuck dandling her in his lap for now.

Grampa chuckled. ""Almost certainly not. Those are tall tales. But I doubt any man who was there would ever spin a yarn like that. Because the second time we advanced on them, our attack was doubly fierce, and command was sure we'd struck them a blow they'd be feeling the next day. And yet that time again, when we landed in force, we found no bugs. We found home. We saw perfect recreations of all the great cities and wonders of the worlds, scattered in ruins. We saw the glittering towers of Mars, twisted and burning. We saw the floating domes of Venus, torn open and fallen. We saw the lush fields of Luna, cratered and blackened. I thought it might have been a threat, but the message they left this time was stop. Please stop. Look at the pain you bring. Stop. This hurts. Please stop.""

Even the baby was quiet now.

""The third time, we were sure we had our hands around their neck. But our heart wasn't really in it anymore. And we never fired, because this time the message came first. Oh, how I wish I could repeat it to you! But I can't, I just can't, and I don't think any human could repeat it. It was indescribable. It was like an old friend whose words go past your ears and straight to your heart. It was not something heard or seen, maybe like something smelled or tasted, but something that was simply felt through all your soul. Oh, if only I could recall the glory! It was then that we knew it was all over. We went home, and that was it for the war.""

""Grampa, did they... did they do something to you? Do something to your head?""

""Yes, Ali, they did. But it was all true, what they'd shown us. The most beautiful things, of love and pain and horror and joy. To all of us, Ali. They did something to us, alright. It changed us all.""

Alice was unnerved. ""Are... are you the same person? Are you still grampa?""

""No, I'm no the same person I was then. I'm not. I was young then, and foolish, and we all are, foolish little goblins. Even command, even our wisest men and leaders, fools we all are. You too. You don't know anything, either. You're just children still, you know. See, the right question was never how many of them I killed, or how battle was like for us, or how scary they were. I don't think there is a right question, but there are better questions. We should be asking questions more like this instead: 'How scared are they?' 'How was battle like for them?' 'How many of them did I not kill?' Questions like that, if we'd asked them from the beginning, would have saved us all the trouble. We were fools then, and still are.""

[WP] A old veteran of the first intergalactic war in human history tells his story.,AdmiralOfTheBlue,"""War...war never changes."" 

Julius, an old man of 131, stared down into his drink as the bar quieted around him. 

A young guy in the back lets out a hearty laugh. ""HA! Really Old-Timer? You're going to go for that tired quote?""
There were hissed words towards the man, the sound in the bar falling back to the muted sound of traffic outside. 

""War stays the same."" Julius continued, swirling the inelegant glass in his hand. ""People change, weapons grow, but war as a concept, that never alters.""

""They came for us as we began terraforming Venus, around 2351 for you younger ones around here."" He paused, letting the brandy slip down the sides of the glass, watching strands of it part and snap silently, softly. ""War is a battle between two sides, hateful, vengeful, murderous. In boardrooms and bunkers war is a tool to push money around, a tool to pull influence in different directions. One side fires, another side fires back. Sometimes the difference in skill or technology is small..."" 

Julius looked up. The Bartender eyed him from the far end of the bar, pretending to busy himself with cleaning plates. 

""...sometimes the difference is large.""

A heavier silence fell across the bar as the words left Julius' lips, heavier than anything the young men and women had felt before. It was as if someone had poured a liquid wool from the windows, from every crack in the dusty walls. All eyes were on the old man. All ears were panting for another word, desperate to hear something break the oppressive curtain of mute.

Julius looked back down, and almost smiled. 

""There was never any war.""

A woman in the back let out an almost imperceptible sigh at the sound of his voice, anything to cut the silence. 

""...I...I dont--"" A man to the side of Julius began. 

""Wars,"" Julius interrupted, glaring at the man, ""are fought.""

His hand tightened around the glass. 

""There was no fighting. You can't even call it a massacre...So what's a historian to do? People need to be told, facts need to be written down. You can't quite call the vaporization of 3.8 billion people anything, so they decided on the word 'war.'""

""But,"" another voice, further this time, female, ""What about you? Your ID says veteran. You must have fought.""

""I accompanied two military strategists and a handful of political somebodies 100,000 kilometers up from the surface of Venus. I was a journalist, hired to record and comment on the interaction between the individuals on my ship and the Extra-Solar beings that signaled us to meet them on their ship.

""Six hours it took, getting to their ship, docking, making sure the atmosphere inside was safe...Their leader, a tall, two-legged creature, thin, yellowed skin, and eleven feet high, met us at the airlock.

""'Thank you for meeting me.' it spoke, its voice translated through a small metal box on his midsection, 'It is our custom to meet species before resource integration. We are certainly not savages.' The being outstretched its arm--if that's what you would call its jaundiced, sinewed, triple-jointed hook--and one of the political big shots eagerly took it, beaming and puffing out his chest. Yet, just as the politician was about to speak, the being released his grasp, turned, and quietly left, closing the airlock behind him.""

Every body in the bar was leaning forward, ever-so-slightly, needing more. 
Julius raised his glass, finished it, and stood. Taking his jacket off the back of the chair, he folded it over his arm, making for the door. 

No one spoke, but the need pulsed from every person in the bar. It radiated liked a wave of heat. 

As Julius put his hand upon the door of the bar, it reached a crescendo, all eyes on him, all ears perked. Julius paused. 

""As we walked back to our own ship, confused and talking amongst ourselves, the call came in from our pilot: Venus' surface had been turned into an ocean of carbon, silicon, and iron ash, 17.3 miles deep.

""There was never any war. There was a small lit candle floating alone among the endless space between stars: In a single moment, snuffed out.""

[WP] A old veteran of the first intergalactic war in human history tells his story.,AdmiralOfTheBlue,"First time here.....

We all shot upright as the old man slowly walked into the classroom.  To not stand at attention for those that wore the insignia of the first war was one of the greatest insults.  He slowly made his way to the front of the class, his crisp uniform betrayed by the hunch in his back.  As he settled into the chair provided him, we all sat eager to hear the story of that first war and how we fought back the Silfae and staved off our own extinction.  What would his story be?  Was he at the Battle of the Virgo Expanse?  Would we hear about Operation Onslaught and the final push into Silfae space?  As he began to speak, we listened.

""War is a terrible thing.  When you wake up in the morning you don't know if you'd make it to the end of the day.  You don't know if they guy next to you will be there.  I won't bore you with the details of the war.  The explosions and the weapon blasts weren't what scared me.  It was the fear that each moment could be my last.""

Was that it?!  Is that all he would say?  He pushed himself up and we all slowly rose to attention as the old man shuffled out of room.  Mr. Dewey followed behind and closed the door as the veteran of the first war left.

""I'm sure you are all wondering more about Mr. Oskar's story...or lack thereof.  We were supposed to have a more 'ahem' decorated veteran come today and speak to you, but he wasn't able to make it.  Mr. Oskar was kind enough to fill in.""

""So what did Mr. Oskar really do?,"" I asked.

""It isn't so much of what he did or didn't do"", Mr. Dewey chided.  ""It's that he answered the call to defend humanity""

I pressed, ""Ok, but what did he do?""

A heavy sigh fell from Mr. Dewey's lips, ""He was a cook stationed on the near side of the Scorpio Causeway.  Which as you all know was nowhere near the front lines.  The most combat he ever experienced was fighting with 100 dozen fried eggs for breakfast.

[WP] A old veteran of the first intergalactic war in human history tells his story.,AdmiralOfTheBlue,"""It was never supposed to go that far,"" I said, standing at the podium and looking out at the various representatives of the Galactic Confederation of Allied Species.

""Humanity, as you all know, is a relative newcomer to the intergalactic scene. It took us nearly ten thousand years to develop space flight, and once we did, it took us another two hundred years to even visit all the planets in our own system. We only embarked upon intersystem travel after we were formally greeted by the Veroond'll, who'd been watching us for millenia.""

""And what exactly was the intention,"" asked one of the representatives of the aquatic (liquid oxygen) planet of Hrzaeiea. The voice issued, mechanically and yet musically as well out of the speaker in front of their tank.

""The Yrandai came upon one of our outer colonies,"" I replied. ""We bargained with good faith, but the Yrandai don't do things the way humans do. They bartered for the mineral rights underneath our colony. When we finally signed the contract, they used a massive solar laser to completely disintegrate everything above the minerals they wanted and then mined those. The Yrandai do not care about the details of the contract, just about obtaining what they want. Of course we were furious. That colony held over a million human citizens.""

""So why did humans just not quarantine the Yrandai and warn them out of your space,"" The Rrrk'n ambassador asked from the pool of mud on his platform.

""Humans have the unhealthy habit of carrying grudges,"" I admitted. ""So our politicians went to work at outfoxing the Yrandai. They crafted a similar contract to the one the Yrandai did at the colony....one that the Yrandai were happy to show us. We negotiated the mining rights on a planet on the far side of their empire. The Yrandai were more than happy to sign it and accept payment in radioactive elements that were rare in their portion of space. We arrived with a group of a hundred and twenty five ships, of which fifty ships were flown remotely with their payment aboard. As soon as they accepted the payment, we announced that we would be collecting our minerals now. The Yrandai laughed and denied us passage through their space. The remaining seventy ships opened up with their entire loadout of weaponry and wiped out the Yrandai force.""

""You massacred a peaceful trading fleet through subterfuge,"" the Delairian ambassador said. ""Civilized creatures do not do such things.""

""Civilized creatures also do not massacre a colony that bargained with them in good faith over a few minerals,"" I countered. ""But I guess neither we nor the Yrandai were acting particularly civilized.""

""I was on the first armada Earth sent. We were to bore a corridor through Yrandai space, brandishing the treaty, mine the planet by blowing it up and extracting the minerals from the broken chunks of the planet, and then retreat to human space. The idea was that the Yrandai would be outfoxed by someone playing their game as well as they could.""

""That didn't happen, did it,"" stated the Moneerjia representative.

""Nope,"" I replied shortly. ""The armada we sent was destroyed almost to the last ship. I was on the EUS Cascadia as it fled back to human space. The Yrandai claimed that they'd been invaded and that they'd been massacred. We claimed that they'd massacred us first.""

""And what happened then,"" the Ch-ittock representative asked.

""Well,"" I said, thinking back. ""Humans had been planning for contingencies such as this. I hate to say it, but our own history taught us to always have arsenals in reserve. ALWAYS. My unit joined First Fleet as we retaliated against the Yrandai world of Blablaw Four......""",Unicornmarauder1776

The pure black uniform was in direct contrast to the spotlights shining in front of the city's main gate.""identification"" his voiced muffled by the helmet fully encompassing his head. I held out my farmer pass card in a shaking hand, my steely resolve that I had espoused with all my friends back home had completely faded now that I had finally reached my destination, all the awesome things I had imagined would happen once I reached the city had quickly faded.My dreams of getting past the gates taking my rusty scratched up old rifle and storming into the city to find some kind of resistance and become a legendary freedom fighter had up and vanished,and the reality of being shot and thrown into a ditch like a sack of trash once they found my weapon.

 As I was trying to reassure myself I had noticed that the guard was staring at my license far longer than would be needed for a quick check or a scan, had I been found out? ""Sir can I ask..."" the guard lifted his hand into a fist as continued staring down at the card and slammed it down onto the spotlight next to him, causing it shudder and turn off.""Yeah sorry about that, the damn lights always make it so hard to see things even when you're facing away"" the guard started nonchalantly, the gigantic menacing figure seemed more portly and the black uniform was pockmarked  with holes.""I tried sending a request some of the higher ups,even offered to get my friend from repairs to get it down,thirty minutes flat,no charge to them since he owes me a favor...but I can see I'm sidetracking,anyway we still have these lights and you can go on your way,mr..."" he looked at my card ""Dan Smith."" I quickly took back my forged produce distribution card and waited for the next stages of search. This led to a moment of pause.""You can go on ahead now Mr Smith."" He said motioning to the gate.I was not sure I understood what was going on,why was the search so light.Would there be more checkpoints in the city? I decide to ask. ""Sir aren't you going to search me, check my truck for weapons, or just do some kind of scan?""

  The portly guard then took of his helmet,showing a chubby pale face and a large bushy brown mustache.""I don't see any reason to, you've got your card and your truck has what it says it does,besides my shift is over in ten minutes so I don't want to have to go through extensive search and do unpaid overtime."" I looked ahead through the gate at the cameras hanging above the doors. ""Won't you get in trouble with your bosses when they see what you've been doing?"" The guard quickly followed my eyes to the cameras and a massive smile appeared on his face and a small chuckle followed."" Oh don't worry about those,non of the surveillance equipment works anymore,almost none of the stuff we use works anymore,did you know that these old helmets used to have cameras and speakers in them?"" He said holding up the chipped black head wear ""yeah, used to be you didn't need to take them off to be understood by people, but hey it isn't that important now a days.Things are safe and no one actually goes through footage even if it did work so I don't have any thing to worry about,so go along inside and take the main road,it'll lead you straight to market"" the guard said as he pointed on to the asphalt that lead straight from the dirt road.With the nonchalant attitude shown at the gate I was caught quite off guard and simply took the main road to market as I tried to make sense of what had just happened.

"[WP] The first known instance of time travel has just occurred. However, instead of us sending a man from the present to another point in time, the future sent us a monster.",Thehelpfulshadow,"Part I

It arrived in a small cylindrical pod. 
 
Arrived?  No.  More like materialized.  Showed up.  Popped in.  Happened. 
The place of the 'happening' was just outside of a nature preserve in Johannesburg.  Some were saying the warm climate was a purposeful choice of the Senders.  That's what Charles started calling the future civilization that prepared their passenger pod and sent it, wrapped in a shining miniature oblisk, through what we are now learning are achievable transmission lines through space-time.

It arrived 3 years ago and the best minds are still struggling with the math, but the short version you'd hear on CNN is simple enough: time travel.  A sort of Schrodinger-Bridge that operates on a quantum-macro pulse that seems to allow carbon-based matter to exist, move, travel through the time bridge.  How this happened, and how far from the future the pod came is still very much a mystery.  What is certain is there is a cryogen system suitable for a smallish child.  The pod has been locked down and in some form of stable stasis - with no obvious means of opening or entry.  Just more questions.

Charles thought about how he'd at first jumped at the chance to become part of this historic and groundbreaking scene, as he surveyed the quarantine area in the northern sector of the Nest.  He had worked hotspots before, but nothing like this one.  And he was starting to feel the slightest twinge of regret as he walked onto the site of maximum security -  the center of the Nest.  

""Hot enough for you?"" Creed said without looking up as Charles arrived wearing the usual quarantine suit.  
Charles snickered, ""Can you come up with another one someday?""
""Well here's one for you."" Creed shoved the portable display in front of Charles eyes close enough to almost touch the tip of his nose. 
""What the- "", Charles pushed back and refocused his eyes through the protection goggles. 
""I know, right?"" Creed sat back with a self-assured glow. 
Charles read the temperature of the pod. 
It had moved from stasis nominal range, up 18 degrees.  It was thawing.

Charles touched a gloved hand to the cryo-pod.  No warmth, or cold for that matter, nor vibration or hum.  In fact, it didn't look or feel different than it had the first day of the happening.  Back before the Nest, before the Senders, before the quantum singularity.  Before everything. 

The slight vague feeling of regret was starting to take shape.  It had been so long he'd almost forgot the protocol for an opening pod.  While he was lost in his own head, putting the next steps together, Creed looked across the busy Nest site, ""Man, I'm glad I'm not you.  Your day just went sideways.""  Charles looked down at the display again.  Up another degree.

Part II coming...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

I rushed out the front doors, trying desperately to get to the car. I barely caught a glimpse of the license plate as it sped away: LG-3... something. I stood in shock for almost a full minute, then ran into the Ready Room. There, I found Lycan in a hushed argument with his second in command, Vamp. She was dressed like a fetish-wear Dracula, and I knew her powers of mind control and life-force draining were some of the scariest in the world.

""What do you mean we can't go? This is important! Brother Madness is preparing an offensive into mainland China, and if it isn't stopped, the US is going to be blamed for it. Can you handle World War III on your conscience, Vamp? Because I sure as hell can't!"" Lycan's growly whisper carried across the room as I shut the door and walked to the front of the Room.

""We can't go because someone just kidnapped our substitute's daughter!"" She said, turning to me. ""I hope you don't mind, I had reached into your mind to make sure you were fully prepped. I saw everything you saw.""

""We'll deal with how creepy that is later, Vamp. For now, yes, my daughter was taken. There was a sign in the window of the car that took her. It said if I went with you, they'd kill her. So, I guess I can't go with you, but you can probably still go, right? I'll stick around here, wait for the Transfusion to wear off, then go through the ransom process and get her back.""

It was getting easier to think rationally. If the people who had taken Maddie had done so to keep me from going to Tibet, then I wouldn't go. If they wanted me to pay, fine. Just then, the phone rang. Lycan scooped it up in one giant, hairy paw.

""What? ... Sorry, Sir, of course... I don't think that's going to work out, Mr. President... No, Sir, just that Lt. Laser's substitute has a - uh - a family emergency. He's not fit to join us, and because he's a sub and not an enlisted Super, we can't force him. Hold on, I'll ask him."" Lycan moved the handset away from his face and turned to me. ""You were never military, were you, Ron? The President wants to put you on an emergency call up, but you're too old to play the Selective Service card on.""

I sighed in relief. ""No, I never served. I was a cop until the recruiter got to me for sub work.""

Lycan turned again. ""No, Sir, not military... I understand that, Mr. President, but we don't have the authority... Sir, I cannot in good conscience obey that order... No, Sir, I do not wish to be relieved of my duties, but what you're asking for is in direct violation of this man's rights! Fine! Here, Vamp, why dont you try talking some sense into our Fearless Leader!"" Lycan flung the handset at Vamp and stormed out of the Ready Room. I followed.

""Please tell me you didn't just get fired because of me, Keith."" I was so upset, I used his civilian name, despite being in the public lobby. Keith Dennison and I went back to high-school together. We'd shared bus seats and traded off girlfriends. He'd even dated my sister for about a week. When he'd been recruited by the FSI, I'd lost touch until I was brought into the sub service.

""No, just temporarily suspended. He's going to make you go anyway, you know. One life against many, that kind of drivel.""

Vamp burst out of the Ready Room, her normally calm, brooding face a white mask of rage. ""Ron, you have to come with us. President Fabiano made it quite clear that a refusal to go would constitute Treason and sent a video of himself signing an Executive Order stating such. I did argue him into giving us till tomorrow to leave, though. It was the best I could do.""

""Thank you, Vamp. I suppose I can count on you guys to help me get Maddie back, then? If we can find her today, we can be clear to go tomorrow."" A trace of hope had entered my dark world. The power I'd been imbued with was burning to get out and do whatever it took to get Maddie back. 

Ten minutes later, the entire FSI Action Team was gathered in the Ready Room. Lycan and I stood in front, with seven Supers waiting patiently for their briefing. We explained the situation as quickly as possible, then split into squads. We took off to search the city for Maddie, and a Yellow sedan with a license plate that started with ""LG.""

It was nearly midnight by the time Lycan and I found the car. It had been parked behind an abandoned warehouse in the Industrial Park, and covered sloppily with a tarp. By the time the rest of the Team had made it there, we had done enough recon to know that Maddie was inside, and her captor was sleeping. Whoever it was snored loudly enough for Lycan to hear through the walls. 

We put together an assault plan and breached the doors of the warehouse at 12:35 am. Phase slipped into the room where the kidnapper was sleeping while the rest of us rushed Maddie's location. She was tied to a chair, no traps or bombs. I almost broke down with relief, when we heard Phase scream and the sound of some sort of energy weapon firing. Lycan, Mirrors, and I ran up the stairs to the office, where Phase had gone.

What we found was a puddle of orange and purple liquid. Phase's costume was orange with purple trim. I nearly vomited. Lycan gave a *ROAR* of rage and turned to face the attacker. He stumbled backwards. I turned.

And saw Lt. Laser, hand extended, a twisted smile on his face.

""You thought you could be me? You thought you could steal my glory? Brother Madness is MY villain! I want to be the one to take him down! What the fuck do you know about being me? You probably don't even know how to use my powers, you little prick! I'M GOING TO TIBET! I'M GOING TO KILL BROTHER MADNESS! But first, I have to get rid of you. You think Maddie will remember you as a hero? Or just a failure?"" His hand slowly rotated toward me, and he pointed his index finger at my head, thumb up like a child making a finger-gun. I closed my eyes.

And felt a blast of cold air, so cold the jumpsuit I was wearing nearly froze to my skin. I jumped, opened my eyes wide, and turned back toward the door.

And there stood my little Maddie, mouth wide open, *screaming* cold air into being. I fainted in shock.

When I came to, I was in the heal-all. Lycan and Vamp sat next to me, Maddie stood at the foot of the bed.

""Welcome back, Ron. How was your nap?"" Lycan asked, a mockingly sardonic grin on his furry face.

""Somebody want to explain just what in the name of all that's pure and holy happened?""

Vamp closed her notebook and turned toward me, a trace of warmth in her features. ""It seems your daughter is Super Powered. Some form of Ice kinetics. Dr. Alpha has been running tests all morning.""

I sat up with a start. ""PHASE! Is Phase okay?""

Lycan chuckled. "" She's fine. She was mostly playing possum so Laser didn't hit her again. But that brings us to a problem."" He cleared his throat and furrowed his bushy brow. ""Lt. Laser is out. He's been psych-evaled and declared incompetent. Something happened with his brain during the crash, and now he has something resembling paranoid schizophrenia. He can't run with us anymore.""

""What Keith is trying to say without saying it is, we'd like you take Laser's powers. Permanently."" Vamp turned away and opened her notebook again. She pulled out a stack of papers with a cover sheet that read *CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION: FSI PROPERTY* and handed it to me. ""Read this and give it some thought. We have to get on out to Tibet, Brother Madness isn't going to wait for us to be ready for his attack.""

""Stay safe,"" I said to their retreating forms, ""and come back."" It was the FSI's unofficial way of saying ""good luck,"" like wishing an actor broken legs. 

I looked at my daughter, ten years old and now a Super. She looked at me. Jeez, but her mother was going to be pissed at me...

“Come along now Emma.” Said the worried mother to her daughter. Trying to pull her away from the bard sitting on the fence surrounded by children.

“But mommy I want to listen to the song.” 

“Those are not the songs you should be listening to Emma. Now let’s go home before your father gets mad.”  The mother pulled the young girl away and continued on her path as if nothing happened.

“She is right little lady, these songs are not meant for the faint hearted and only those who are truly brave should listen to them.” The bard said while preparing his next ballad: “There once was a lass whose beauty was pure; she did not smell of manure.” The children around the bard snickered and the bard looked at them with a smile and continued: “This lass was once promised to me, but how could an angel like that marry one who smells like pee.” The bard made a silly face while singing that last line and the children broke out into laughter. 

Emma looked back at the laughing children with envy, she also wanted to laugh and have fun. Why was she not allowed to listen to the songs? 

“Why can’t I listen to the songs mommy? Edric is allowed to listen to them!”

“That is because his mother is not here. I am sure that if she was she would not let her child listen to some fairy tales told by a stranger on the road.” They turn the corner and Emma looks for the last time at the bard surrounded by children.

A couple of days pass and Emma has completely forgotten the bard and his songs. She is playing in the front room when she hears someone knocking on the door. Her mother rises from her chair to open it. 

“Have you seen Edric??” A distraught woman asks. She looks as if she hasn’t eaten in days or even slept. 

“No, no I haven’t. Why what happened to him? “ 

“I don’t know; I haven’t been able to find him for the past few days.” The woman leaves in a hurry. As if that will change something.

“Mommy, is everything ok with Edric?”

Her mother slowly closes the door and looks at her. “Edric is fine dear but you need to promise me that you will never listen to bard and their hellish songs. Can you promise me that?”

“I promise.” 

They found Edrics body a few days later. Amongst other children, al dumped in a hole somewhere in the forest.  

Never trust a bard.

I blinked, my head feeling woozy.  Something, I knew, had just occurred.  I'd been on top, happily thrusting back and forth, listening to her gasp as I took her.  I'd been working hard to ignore all the sensations, trying to last as long as possible.  I wanted to make it last, not finish too quickly, even as I felt that tingling rising up my spine from my crotch, the sharp stabbing in my left arm-

And then, next thing I knew, I found myself on my back, staring up at the ceiling, Vita leaning over me and looking concerned.  ""Hey, are you okay?"" she asked.

I blinked back at her.  She was still naked, but even that wasn't enough to distract me.  ""What happened?"" I asked again.  ""I - we were going at it, and then all of a sudden, I was down here.""

""Would you believe me if I said that you finished?""

I frowned at her, and she sighed.  ""Didn't think so,"" she groaned.  ""Look, you, um... you had a minor heart attack.""

""I did WHAT?""  I jerked upright, grabbing at my chest.  ""Oh my god, we need to go to a hospital!""

""No, we don't,"" she answered, sounding remarkably calm.  ""You're fine, now.""

""Now?  But I could die!""

""Not again,"" she said, and I paused.  That wasn't right.

""Again?""

""Yeah.""  She sighed, sat up a little further, her hair falling forward across her fetching figure.  The sheets tangled around her round little bottom, threatening to distract me.  ""You know how your super power is flight and control of thermal energy?""

""Yes..."" I said, not sure how this connected to anything.  Was she feeling cold?

""Well, mine is the power to bring people back from the dead,"" Vita finished, blinking those green eyes at me as she waited for a response.

I opened my mouth, but paused before answering.  I thought about my answer for a couple seconds.  ""You can bring people back to life,"" I repeated slowly.

She nodded.  ""Only if I get to them right away, and they can't be too injured.  It doesn't heal, just restores the life force.""

""Uh huh.  But I'm alive.""  I looked down at my body, wiggled my fingers.  ""And everything seems to be working.""

Vita grimaced again.  ""Not quite everything.""  

""No, it's working!""  I reached over and flicked the organ in question.  ""Nice and hard, see...""

My words died off as I realized that I didn't really feel the effect of those flicks.  I grasped it again, tugged it, even twisted it a bit.  Nothing!  No sensation!  I raised agonized eyes back up to Vita, begging her to tell me that this was some numbing effect of her body.

""Sorry,"" she whispered.  ""One part always stays dead.""

I nearly blew up at her.  I very nearly did; the angry snarl was ready on the tip of my tongue.  But looking into Vita's green eyes, seeing her already flinching away from me, I somehow knew that she'd been attacked for this before, that she wouldn't take much more before she finally, irreversibly, broke.

""That's okay,"" I said instead, reaching out for her.  She pulled back at first from my hand, but then let me touch her, caress her, lay her down beside me.  I tried to put a smile on my face.  ""Besides, it's still hard, isn't it?""

""It is,"" she admitted, still not quite able to meet my eyes.

""Then let's make sure that, just because I had the *gran mort,* you don't get a little *petit mort* of your own, huh?""  

Amazingly, she laughed at that!  ""You're awful,"" she said, but she let me pull her in, on top of me, straddling me once again.

The curtains were a golden silk laced in red, the windows frosted against the cold of winter.

It was here that we took a picture of ourselves, me and my wife, and framed it on the desk of my study for the long nights of reading and writing...

'Twas a sad day when the news of Ariel's passing reached Atlantica.

Her sisters wept uncontrollably in the corridors and the courtyards of the castle; they would have gone in their room, but they liked the attention.

Triton locked himself away for months, too proud to let his citizens witness the tears of their mighty king as he wept over his youngest, favorite daughter. The only one allowed to see him during this time was his faithful servant, Sebastian, who was greatly distressed himself.

The rest of the kingdom of Atlantica was no stranger to the grief Ariel's family felt; from the proletarians to the plebeians, the whole of the ocean floor contributed to the water's rise and it overflowed upon the shores.

It hit Flounder worst of all. Ariel was his only and greatest friend. They did everything together; raiding ships, having tea parties, taunting Sebastian, just getting into to trouble like friends do.

Flounder's death, as he was the best friend of the recently deceased princess, made headlines. *""Died of depression,""* the newspapers said.

""How did he do it, do you think?"" citizens would whisper.

""What do you mean? I says right in the headline,"" others would reply.

""It just says, 'died of depression.'""

""You misunderstand, my friend. He did not commit suicide. He died of depression.""

The Consul of the Military Federation of the Entheri looked sideways to eye his copper-red arthropoid assistant, his own green insect-like mandibles clicking softly as he considered the words directed at him. ""Explain."" He asked, sighing softly as he looked ahead beyond the enormous window to the blue planet, so large, yet still so far away.

The assistant clicked softly as she moved closer, her dark green robes rustling as his feet clicked against the metal. ""They remain divided, which is not unexpected."" She said. ""The... problem is the... hrm... intensity of their animosity against those they disagree.""

The Consul turned around, alarmed, gripping his ceremonial longsword in his right claws. ""They did not go to war against each other, did they? I was not told of such an event on my trip here!""

""No, no, they didn't."" The assistant answered hastily, taking a few steps forward. ""But on several occasions two sides that disagreed argued with each other, and held a vote to decide who would have the right of way."" The Consul held the pommel of his sword with both hands and rested the tip on the steel floor, reclining against it slightly. ""And when the results came out... instead of coming together to face the trials as one... they turned against each other, creating a greater divide amongst themselves with their ceaseless bickering.""

The Consul clicked hit mandibles thoughtfully. ""...We used to be as petty as they were, thousands of years ago."" His clothes seemed to weigh him down more. ""...This is why we are here now.""

""Yes, but the humans... they need longer. They created created barriers amongst themselves. There are several great religions that are still irreconcillable. They cannot even come to an agreement of the state of their own home planet. A few more centuries, maybe.""

""...But they don't have centuries."" The Consul said, the assistant observed his chitinous head slumping downwards. ""I... will need to consult the elders. The final decision will be made within the next three days.""

""Already?"" She asked with slight alarm.

""Every ship stationed here is one less ship facing the swarm."" He said powerfully, gripping the sword's sheath with his claws. ""A decision must come, and the Entheri as one face it together, as it always has been."" He pauses, his claws fiddling the decorative cotton band of the sheath. ""Tell me... is there some way we can hide the humans?""

""...Sir?""

""I mean-"" He stopped, clicking his mandibles anxiously. He turned around to stare at the large, blue planet once again.

Its nebulous origin, as well as purpose, puzzled many inhabitants of the Metropolis. History surrounding this landmark of a kind is as enigmatic as all surroundings. All we can muster out of barely readable, nevermind being coherent, mumblings about a plan of intrusion.

This brutish monolith of inhuman ingenuity has received plentiful titles: some humorous, others leave a sense of dread after mentioning. ""A Babylonian device to reach the Gods themselves! A machine of human slavery devised by a maniacal extradimensional being!"" you hear them say. Rumors come from so many sides that nobody could be sane enough to distinguish fact from fiction.

Worst of all is that it appears that nobody, including secret agencies, knows about how a massive chunk of land with all of infrastructure and people vanished within the blink of an eye. People are in shock, but everyone is oddly busy living on their normal life ignoring the impending look of metallic, glassy facades with unfinished spiky bits scraping the highest-soaring skies. After all, it didn't cause harm, if you exclude slightly more cloudy weather.

Corporal Lantry had been in the war as long as anyone else. A week. A week of devastation from the coasts pressing them in and pressing them in until they were all huddled for a nice and tidy slaughter within their cities. 

They were huddled behind the slagged hull of a battle tank trying to stay hidden. He just tried not to look at the skeleton halfway out of one of the hatches. Captain Singh muttered something spiteful into the radio and then looked back up at them with the same desperate and dire face they'd become accustomed to over this long fortnight. 

""I've explained the situation and High Command says every last man is expected to fight to the bitter end before he lets them take the capital."" He reported to the twelve men left under his command.

""With what, we've got no bullets, no grenades. All the heavy weapons got vaporised with B Company."" Lantry protested.

""We're to lock bayonets and charge them,"" Singh said almost blankly as he began screwing on his blade. 

""That's suicide."" Private Mullins objected.

Singh stood up, wearily, shakily but he stood. ""Listen here the enemy is going to take London. They're going to take a thousand years of history, they're going to take all the sick, the wounded, the children left inside the safe zones. I don't give a fuck if we make it because we won't!"" It hurt to say, but he carried on with the speck of a tear in his eye. ""But if we can buy even a single second for another evac chopper we've saved twenty more lives. So I don't care if a single one of you worthless shits are gonna follow me out there or not. I'm going to give the order, do my fucking duty and charge those bastards, am I clear!""

All of them stood, screwed in their bayonets and got behind Singh. That was worse somehow, he thought. He wouldn't have minded charging up the road alone at least then it was just getting himself killed. But now it was Lantry and Mullins and Okolo and Wright and the entire squad besides. Gravely he took a breath, perhaps his final one. ""Charge!"" He yelled and then ran screaming up the narrow street. His men followed with him. Past burnt out cars and shopfronts turned to ash.

The eye stinging white of an enemy laser cut down Mullins but the rest kept going. Their ears were filled not with the uncaring hum of alien weaponry or their own hearts in their chests but instead the sound of horses galloping.Something gathered behind them. Smoke furling and pluming, bulging like a wave. And then, when the galloping could grow now louder in their heads the smoke parted and from it burst men on horseback. Hazy, indistinct riders charged through them up the street trailing smoke and spirit fire in their wake.

Singh saw a Rajput in full battledress distinct against the smokey horde that lanced up the street. Lantry saw a Knight and Wright a screaming, blue faced Highlander.

The impenetrable energy barriers of the aliens seemed not to be there for the ghostly warriors. The armour on the skittering, bug-like invaders similarly gave no comfort against the warrior's blades. In spurts of copper green blood the ghosts separated head from neck, limb from socket, abdomen from thorax. By the time Singh and his men had reached the launcher emplacement the ground was soaked green and littered with shards of shattered chittin.

The ghosts whirled around and seemed to stop as their descendants approached. From out of them trotted the image of a man, his desiccated skin pulled tight across his face and his hair long and ragged. Yet a tarnished crown sat upon his head and there was a certain nobility to his gaze.   

""When Britain need us we shall always defend her."" He said, his voice deep and distant as if echoing up from a tomb. His withered lips almost smiled. ""We shall, as you said good Captain, do our fucking duty."" He laughed as the fog of war gathered around him and then retreated on an earrant wind, leaving nothing in its wake.

They called to people long at rest,

To come to aid the sputtering flame,

Of fearful misunderstanding. 

Those discs of light came to us,

In a hundred shining disco lights, 

Spinning murder like a song,

All through those long and miserable nights. 

Yet, the first ghost flared to *life*,

With an ancient sword held high,

Cut through the armor of the beasts,

And let them fall aside. 

The aliens, those foreign fears, 

Those petrified monsters in our skies, 

Touched the dead with just their eyes,

And fell back like a terrified child.

Gone and gone and gone again,

Up and up and up, 

They did not stop, they did not speak,

They swept the heavens, away, away,

Down to rest inside our minds,

""Ah, the e4,"" I say, ""A classic. Go, now, little one, forward! Without fear!""

I pat the child e5 in front of me to move. But he does not budge. I pat him a second time.

""Y-You must go! Be brave! He shall not harm you. He cannot, as you cannot, attack the man before him.""

I notice something on the periphery of my vision. 

""Wait, what? a5! What are you doing? Get back here!"" I cry, ""We have not practiced the Cornstalk defense!""

The white bishop responds in kind, and threatens forward alarmingly quickly.

""e6!"" I cry to the trembling little one before me, ""e6! Not even e5! You must take just one step forward! Please!""

The little one shakes his poor head, and points to our rook Rh6 who has eagerly exited the gates.

Immediately, the monstrous white queen emerges from beside her king. That terrifying monarch slices ahead of her servant guard, eager for blood. 

""Someone, anyone...!"" I cower behind my little one.

How can I judge him for not moving? I, myself, am terrified.

Alas, it is the overzealous h5 who responds.

""What do we do now?"" the little one standing sentinel on f7 asks.

I am unable to give him an answer before he is decapitated by the white queen.

I saw the armies laid out before each other. I saw the men that had left their homes, their jobs, friends, families, their lives behind to fight for their kingdom. I saw the people they defended, the cavalry, the princes to be trained for combat, the commanders that were specially trained for war, the apt queen who was ready to defend her noble, yet frail, husband at all costs. Each to their own, for each army was of the same composition. Eight battalions of foot soldiers, lined in front, with the generals on the sides, with highly trained troops ready to flank, the cavalry lined up, ready to leap over the foot soldiers and surprise the enemy, and the princes with their archers, who could dart across the fray with ease and strike with power. And, behind them all, the leaders, the king and queen, ready to fight and die if need be, simply to keep the land that belonged to them. War is an art, with strategy and skill, but the repercussions were devastating, leaving death and destruction in its wake. The armies poked at each other, sending forth portions of their forces to skirmish and weaken the foe, planning elaborate traps while sustaining minimal losses, looking for a way to strike at the king, to destroy the morale and to win the war. With every advancement, there was loss: a prince giving his life for the cavalry to kill another segment of the opposition, the queens rushing blindly, making gambles with death and murdering everyone that crossed them. After many hours of bloodshed, the battlefield, checkered with bodies and weapons, was home to only a fraction of the initial warriors, covered in the remains of ally and enemy alike. The brave general of the northern army conspired with the remaining prince, the southern queen rallying the cavalry for one final attempt at the elusive king's life. The kingdoms traded losses until, finally, there was simply none left, save for three members of a noble class. The monarchs of the south, walking hand in hand towards the northern king, who cradled his lost loved one in his arms, raising the blade together to finally smite their lone opponent, ending the fight once and for all. All of this, I saw, until I looked up from the board, into my father's eyes, slightly wet from the emotion he was experiencing. Not once had I ever come this close to defeating him, but the student must some day overcome the teacher. I offered to put the board away, and he obliged. But, as I was cleaning up the aftermath, I thought of the destruction I had just witnessed, and the loss that it truly could have been. But war, in this case, is an art, and a game for those with the skill and the time to participate.",Connnorrrr

King Hectors stomach dropped realizing he didn't have enough food to last his kingdom another week. He needed to do something desperate if he didn't want his people to revolt against him. With General Noirs troops sitting on his front step wreaking havoc on his land something had to be done if for no other reason then to forage for food. Winter is going to be a hard time with so little reserves. Regardless of the inevitable battle soon to come he would need to do something drastic. A long drawn-out battle would be suicide with food reserves so low. With that in mind Hector woke up his trusted General in the dark of night to conspire.


General Blancs stomach dropped when his king came to wake him. He knew the situation must be dire. Hectors drastic proposal made it all the worse. He wanted to betray his men, distract the troops, and run. Blancs mind was racing, his honor was on the line along with his life. If they were to be caught it was certain death for being so cowardly and abandoning his men. He couldn't do it but he also couldn't betray his king for that would be an even quicker death. Blanc knew there was another option but It was a last resort gamble which at this point was the only thing he could think of.

If he gave everyone what they asked for the sham would fall apart fast; or at least it's easy to think so.

However, it's my opinion that this writing sounds (mentally, to me) akin to Terry Pratchett, albeit with (understandably) less polish. It's in the casual tone of the narrator, and the - very relatable - monotony of human structure, needing an assistant, then ten, then a small army of them simply to keep up with expirations from a job you seem perhaps too suited for.

So much so that you don't even do the job any longer, until it dawns on you that that's what management is (should be? Undecided.)

Interestingly enough that country had the same idea and recruited me. My home country was thrilled that I was going to be on the inside. Problem was they sent me to a new country. From there each country had the same idea of using a young gifted child to infiltrate other countries. The problem was that to keep up with all my background stories I had to 'recruit' some assistants. I managed to keep my identity a secret from my assistants, but slowly as I was sent to spy on more and more countries by more and more countries I had to recruit more and more assistants. 

Eventually I realized that I was technically an agent for all 192 members of the UN. The thing is that I have recruited so many assistants that I had to recruit other assistants to handle those assistants. Then more assistants to manage them to keep all my covers.

""Hello? Yes, bear with me.""



""Mr. President, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom is on the line.""


""Pass me the phone.""


""Hello. Yes, we're looking at it right now - no update in 18 hours. No, we're worried, too. No contact, no.""

Agent Peck was the first to answer, ""I don't know, sir. I'm not trained in this field.""



""You're right, we need specialists. Angela, send the status down to the lab. I want our best men looking in to this.""



""Sir, if I may?""



""You may, Angela.""



""I feel this is like when you're friend posts about being at a funeral or the untimely death of a family member and you want to like the status to show you're thinking about them but don't want them to think you particularly like the situation. If you will.""



""Oh I will, Angela, as this is exactly like that. Astute observation. Until we have confirmation that Agent Anon isn't at a funeral or recently suffered a family death, I cannot authorise any comment, like or cool emoji.""


The door burst open. A man in a lab coat entered the room out of breath. ""Mr. President, we studied the status. It's bad. It's real bad.""


""Spit it out, you God damn nerd. We don't have time for fanny farting around here.""


""We believe Agent Anon is Vaguebooking, sir.""


""Speak English, son.""

""Vaguebooking is when a person purposely posts an ambiguous or vague status on social media in order to garner attention via comments, likes or cool emojis.""


""Cool emojis. I knew it. Do we know why Agent Anon is doing this *Vaguebooking*?""


""Not as of yet, sir. It's difficult to decipher.""



Angela spoke, ""My God... I think he's trying to figure out which nation likes him the most.""



A panicked frenzy broke out in the room with a race to the computer screen. ""Peck. Refresh the page. I want a status report on that status, stat."" The screen loaded slowly like a kid viewing South Park wrestlers online with a 56k modem.


""Sir, it's not looking good. Russia have already liked the status, the UK are sending 'positive vibes' and, oh Jesus Christ, Canada have posted multiple cool emojis.""



""Is the sad crying face one of the cool emojis Canada has posted?""


""Sir, I can confirm the sad crying face is present, yes.""

The President turned and hurled a cup at the wall. ""How is it we are this far behind the other nations when it comes to Vaguebooking intel and tech? Can someone explain this to me?""



""It's an emerging field of interest, sir. We simply weren't prepared.""



""Well we need to do something. We're sitting ducks, here, people. You're supposed to advise me and here we have the most powerful super secret agent on the planet thinking we don't care about his ambiguous personal life.""

15 brutal minutes passed. The room sat in silence. Sweat gleaming from the President's brow.

""I heard if you do that fifty more times the porridge becomes gold of the finest caliber, then all our troubles will be over."" Marly told him allowing a wheezy laugh to pass through.

""Sorry sister, the food is great, but I can't get over what happened earlier."" he replied returning to his meal.

""You still going on bout' that murderer? If it bothers you that much we can start putting back for a hired mercenary, I've been hearing the criers near the market yellin' of a group of Italian thugs stalking and killing innocents near the chalk cliffs."" Marley informed him.

""No, Marley, if you'd seen what I seen this morning you'd be twice as perplexed as I and none the wiser for it. The man was...he was like nothing I'd ever seen before. I've seen my fair share of men snatched from this world, shit the O'Hanohan twins ain't made the month complete without killin' a tourist. The man I saw kill those soldiers at the outpost moved like a divine being."" Bincent expressed to his sister.

""Really? A divine being, Vincent? You know they could fill the oceans with your insight little brother and there would no longer be a drowned man to protest it."" She joked.

""I was fishing with Francis on the Eider bridge and a noble ran past behind us at full speed cursing and shoving those in his way. No one saw the other man, they were too busy watching the noble flail about and speed off in a panic. He'd just about made it to the church when the other man dropped from it's roof like a gargoyle from a cathedral and plunged a sword through the entirety of his torso, and pulled the sword back out. I only caught a glimpse of it, but of all the swords Pa and me ever made none were as beautifully crafted as the one the man held. The hilt had a bird's head upon it, two fiercly glowing ruby gems for the eyes, the handle a silver so sheen I bet your reflection could be seen in it. The blade was Damascus weave without question, but the pattern was unlike I've ever seen rather than a wave pattern, it was like the boxed circles like the kind you see on honeycombs. The guards came around the corner to see what the commotion was about, I assumed the man still standing would have ran, but he didn't, his face was cloaked hidden in his hood. Out numbered four to one, the man then sheathed his sword, Marley."" Vincent chugged the rest of his ale and continued the story while using the pitcher to refill his mug, He noted the blank stare of his sister transfixed by the story momentarily contemplating where to continue. ""The guards were so perplexed by this action that they stopped dead in their tracks lowering their rifles, and that's when the movement began. Do you remember that theatrical that Pa took us to in Dublin when we were little, the one with the Persian woman that danced so beautifully?"" Vincent asked her.

Marley was now fascinated and nodded her head, too caught in the story to interrupt vocally.

""He moved like that, swift and precisely, the man had two hidden blades that shot out from his wrists, the first guard had very little time to react and his throat was cut before he could even get his shot off. The hooded figure caught the man mid fall and shielded himself from being shot by the remaining three. Dropping the first kill he dashed forward piercing the next guard expertly in the crook of his chestplate with the speed of a snake biting and dispatched his third victim just as quickly by breaking the bayonet off the man's rifle and jamming it into his ear, the fourth panicked and began running.

He did not get far though, the hooded man pointed at him and the fourth guard collapsed, turns out he threw a knife that pierced the back of the man's skull but he did it so fast it appeared to be sorcery. Jesus, Mary, n' Joseph, Marley, the man had a helmet on and the knife went right through it.

As if it were the most casual of circumstance the man turned toward the bridge Francis and I were fishing at, more guards could be heard making there way towards the chaos. Then the hooded figure sprinted right for us and I thought for sure we were to be targeted as dead men, but all he did was jump to the outer side of the bridge and hang there knocking over my day's catch."" Vincent finished thinking of how much better bass would be compared to poridge.

Vincent contemplated the events in silence, not noticing Marley's expression of eagerness.

""Well!?"" She rang out making him startle slightly.

""Well what?"" Vincent asked her.

""I don't suppose he's still hanging his arse from that bridge, Vincent, what the fuck happened after that?"" She asked him sarcastically.

""Oh, the guards stopped and asked us what happened and where the killer went, I simply pointed in the direction of the stables at the other end of the bridge. Once they were out of sight the cloaked man jumped up from his hiding spot and told me he was sorry for the fish and said thank you. What kind of cold blooded killer apologizes and and thanks people? I told you, it was as if he were an avenging angel with no qualms toward decent folk."" Vincent finished.

""That is a bit odd innit'? A man that kills five people and in the same instance turns around and thanks others. All sounds a bit King Henry-ish to me, maybe the man was short a few wagon wheels."" She said gathering their plates to wash in the basin later.

""Odd, I suppose...,"" A knock on their door interrupted Vincent and he looked at his sister. ""you expecting anyone?""

""No, t' might be the stable hand with the udder balm I ordered earlier though."" Marley informed him.

Vincent stood up and answered the door to the pitch black night overhead, and on the ground was a bucket filled with eight decent sized fish. Attached to the bucket itself was a note in beautifully calligraphied English reading.

'I want to thank you for your discretion and kindness to a stranger, friend, and to properly apologize as well about your fishing spoils. I have been informed by the other merchants in town that you are the resident balcksmith for these parts. I believe that our meeting each other may be more than circumstance. I am in need of good steel and armor and have more than enough coin to purchase and reserve your services should you be so interested. For the duration of my time in the Ire, I would like to retain your services and discretion. If you wish to meet and discuss further detail and transaction meet me at the church when the sun is highest tomorrow. I will take no offense in refusal of this offer either way. Once again, thank you."" Sincerely, Giovanni Auditor'e

Beneath the initials was a symbol stamped into a thin wax seal. Vincent had seen it once before during commerce in Dublin at the cartographers guild building, it was a triangle with no base and an intricate design. Stories from his youth suggested the symbol was a emblem of legendary hashishini from the Egypt country.

But there are men purposefully making them. And learning from them. All in their mission to gain greater knowledge.

They are the ones who are willing to take more risks.

"[WP] ""They said I was crazy. They were right, but that doesn't mean that I was wrong.""",TheRealJasonBourne,"They said I was crazy. They were right. But that doesn't mean I was wrong. They just can't see them. Or hear them. The little figures. The little voices. They've always been there. Always have been. Always will be. I've seen them since I was a child. They'd come to me as I slept. Spoke to me in my dreams. At the time, they were the more, kind, voices. ""Go to school"" they'd say. ""Be respectful"" they'd say. And I listened. Their orders carried me through life. But god forbid I tell anyone about them. They wouldn't like it...
As I got older. The voices began to change. They got angrier. Less helpful. No longer wanting me to succeed. Wanting me to do their bidding. I fought them. But they only grew louder. More persistent. No longer a disembodied voice. Now A manifestation of all things crooked and evil. They wouldn't let me sleep. They wouldn't let me eat. They scared away all those that loved and cared about me. They constantly screamed ""KILL"".

I looked up from my checklist, slapping at a viridi titillation tendril that had taken advantage of my distraction. It had been late to mature compared to its fellows, but it seemed it was starting to come into its own, if the creeping green vines were anything to go by. I could hear it chirruping happily behind me as I went to investigate the fuss.

“Carl?” I called over the waving green fronds. The bio-dome was criss-crossed with neat gravel paths, but many of our specimens clocked in at over 8 feet tall, so it was impossible to get a clear view. Luckily the gravel was loud enough under-foot to alert us to any unexpected encounters before they reached us. We also had a manned aerial viewpoint; an idea I stole from the Eden Project, admittedly, but I doubt that they installed theirs for the same reasons we did. 

I fingered the alarm button slung about my neck as I walked. Carl hadn’t pressed his, so I wasn’t too worried. I tried the radio at my belt. “Carl? Everything okay?”

“Everything’s fine!” came the reply through the white-noise hiss. 

“…Are you sure?” I said, rounding the corner. It was noon, which meant he’d have finished harvesting the Lotus Fruit, and should be on his way to the Barnacle Tree to feed the geese.  Not too far away. I picked up my speed a little anyway.

“Everything’s fine!” he repeated, “it’s fine, don’t come over here!” 

Because that’s not suspicious at all, I thought. 

“Why do you sound like I’ve just caught you wanking? What have you done this time?” 

Silence. Maybe I actually had caught him wanking. “Sharon, is Carl over by the Venus Man Trap again?” 

“Nope, I think he learned his lesson from last time,” Sharon laughed through the radio. I saw the glint of her binoculars as she paced to the other side of the viewing platform far above me. “As attractive as she is, I think it’d put any man off to be swallowed whole. He’s over by… ah. Oh. You might want to get a wiggle on. He’s in the restricted area, somehow.”

“WHAT!” I roared, breaking into a sprint, throwing up a shower of gravel in my wake. I heard an angry baaing from the flower-bed behind me; the Barometz plants didn’t take kindly to a barrage of stones. “What do I even pay you for, Sharon!” I yelled at the ceiling, forgoing the radio in my rage. A small “sorry!” drifted down from the rafters.

Carl was cowering on the ground as I skidded around the corner and shot through the metal gate that led to the restricted area. I didn’t bother stopping; the keypad dangled from its wires and the door was already wide open. 

“You bloody idiot!” I screamed as Carl did his best to dig to safety through the gravel. Glittering silver needles were scattered across the floor. “What the fuck are you doing in here?!” 

White-faced, he raised a shaking finger and pointed behind me. I grabbed my Mark 2 from my belt and squeezed the trigger as I turned. I knew the drill in the restricted section a lot better than Carl did; shoot first, ask questions later. 

It was a dark, mottled green; orange flames spewed from my gun muzzle and the thing let out a gasping shriek as its flesh turned red and then crumbling black. It fell backwards, shrivelled, and cracked into pieces on the stony floor. 

“What the fuck was that?” squeaked Carl.

“A were-cactus,” I said grimly. “Lucky it had already shot its spines, or I’d be growing some myself.” I grinned nastily. “Did it hit you, by any chance?” 

Carl stared wide-eyed at the shining needles embedded along his arm. Trying to shield his face, by the looks of it. For all the good it did him. 

“Well, you’ve been responsible for the loss of a perfectly good specimen today, Carl,” I sighed. “It’s only fitting that you go on to replace it.”

“W-what?” Carl whispered.

“It’s a were-cactus, Carl,” I said, leaning in until I see the sweat beading on his brow. “It’s contagious.”

Existential crisis is also the theme of the Arabian Nights, when two brothers who are kings discover their queens are unfaithful to them with black slaves in their absence. They respond by nihilism: every time they marry a woman at night they kill her in the morning. This goes on until they meet Sheherezade who tells them stories that are so interesting they have to wait one more night to hear what happens next...and this goes on until 1001 nights have passed and the kings repent of their behaviour.

How can something fictional seem so vivid...? The distant, exotic land we came from, its gilded avenues, its glistening intricate spires, its profound natural beauty with lushly verdant banks hugging the rivers that snaked between the dunes... None of it was there. It was all nothing more than a dream. But I am not a lie. I stare at my hands, flexing them, examining the callouses accumulated by work never done, cracks formed of age never lived, and despite the warmth of the bright sun just passing its zenith above, I shiver. 

""Amir,"" I hear a voice call, and my heart tugs at what I know to be familiarity. 

""Hassan...?"" I uncertainly reply as I look up. Our gazes meet. I could swear I saw in his eyes the same false memories flashing behind mine. Childhood among parents who never lived, in a community that was never built, attending an academy that was never founded, graduating from a ceremony never held... He nods hollowly, as if to confirm these very musings. 

""...We have to pack the supplies, Amir. His Majesty will be staying at the palace, and the staff are directing us to where we are to stow his wardrobe and leave his tributes to The Sultan.""

My mouth was dry, but not in response to his words. At some point I realized my 'old friend' Hassan was talking only to fill the screaming void in our minds. To 'Sound Normal', like 'Real People'. My stomach is a knot of ice. Still, the skills of a life as-yet unlived surface readily to the forefront of my mind. How to port the many caskets of His Majesty Prince Ali's wares. ""...Yes. I will coordinate with the provisioner. If my memory serves,"" I pause a bit too long, lost in the jarring disjunction of citing false memories, ""... it is customary to serve a great feast with the arrival of a dignitary. The many delicacies of our homeland are sure to leave a resounding impression upon The Sultan's court."" 

Hassan's expression tightens. I feel his heartache, for this homeland which we have never seen with real eyes, and never shall. He hesitantly takes a step nearer and dispenses a conciliatory pat to my shoulder. A mutual understanding. We were truly all feeling it, every last member of His Majesty Prince Ali's vanguard. 

...he wasn't even really a prince.

I shudder and turn, to address the court provisioner by name. He's just as haunted and startled as I that we know one another, but everything is running smoothly. We have no solace from our inner thoughts. We can only push on in the hopes that the minutia will wash away the horror. ",Draegur

What the hell?

""Get down! Hide!""

Where was the parade, the elephant? What *is* an elephant? I liked the elephant.

I'm shaken from my thoughts as my arm is violently pulled towards the ground by the creature (what is a creature?).

""Snap out of it, the suit don't make you immortal, nomad!""

The creature is agitated. It sure makes obnoxious noises. I think it likes me? Like. Likes. What is that?

Positives and negatives. I can feel them. My... body? Arms. Arms are weird. I'd better just get used to them because the creature is moving again and flapping its around like it... means... something to me?

Shaking, I think that's what we(?) call it when the things move around. It always moves, but this time it's *all* the things.

Noise.

ما هي اللغة؟

Not sure. Shaking again.

""Up ahead! Be ready.""

The creature motions again. I think it *wants* me to do a *thing.* Flashing. Rapid successions of sound burst from the end of something the creature is holding. Is that a toy?

It looks fun so I'll call it a toy. It looks *really* fun. Oh, neat. I have one too. Fireworks!

أنا أعرف هؤلاء!

""Jesus man, what's gotten into you? Pull yourself out of it!""

*INTO* me!? I can speak.

""What's in me? How do I get it out!?""

I yell at the creature. Was I too loud (and who am I asking)? The creature is making me feel frantic. I'm desperately searching my mind to determine what an inside or an outside is. I'm not ready for this. I didn't ask for this and I'm still not sure who I would have asked anyway.

""It's here!""

A much larger creature has demonstrated quickly to me insides and outsides. It's *in here* now. I don't like the big one, it is not at all like the elephant. I really liked the elephant and I think I'm starting to understand what it means to like something, or, at least *dislike* something.

My 'friend' tears at my arm again. The feeling is captivating. Sensations. Interesting word, sensation. Also 'interesting.' I'm baffled and my breath pops out of me in bursts. Hha hha. 

""Listen. I don't know what your deal is, but if you don't pull it together, you're going to get us both killed!""

My friend looks at me with wild eyes. Such depth of texture and color and such a small space. Iris? I see what it is to see. He looks up and swings his rifle to aim at the beast and sounds erupt.

I jump to the east. 

Whoa. I'm fast. I've done this before. I was *made* for this. I kick off the wall of what was left of a hallway as I draw my rifle and open fire.

Waves obscure my vision. I guide them. I *know* this. I see where to direct my onslaught and snap rapidly in orbit around the monstrosity, finding my target. I don't have to think, I just...do.

To the soundtrack of morphing metal and bone the beast writhes as it gives up its ghost.

I'm on my feet. I no longer care what they are. I know what they can do. So does my friend.

""I thought we'd had it back there. I don't know who you are, or why you're here, but if you can do *that,* let's see what we can make of those Koreans.""

I gave a little jump and looked up. Ah, it is the Vice - Creator, one of the two reasons behind me existence! 

""Me? Oh, just a little contemplative thinking,"" I said. Funny, I thought, now where had I learnt that word? It seemed as if it had popped right into my head. 

""Well now, let me hear it! If I can't help you resolve it I'm sure our great Creator can,"" said the genie. 

Ah yes. My Creator. The real reason behind why I am here. I looked at Prince Aladdin - or was it King now? He was laughing and exchanging sappy kisses with his new wife, who was blushing the hardest I'd ever seen a maiden blush. But then again I was only born two hours ago. 

""Well. . . "" I paused. 

This was a hard dilemma. 

Indeed it was. 

"" I was wondering . . . ""

"" Yes? "" the genie prompted. 

"". . . on how miraculously wonderful is a turban? The fact that you wear one is enough to disguise your true identity. It must have rather amazing disguising powers!""

""Oh pfft!"" cried the genie. ""It is clear that you have not yet exposed yourself to the world enough, my young protégé. Why, in some cases a single lock of hair is enough to render you a complete stranger to your friends!"" 

I gawped. I gawked. I goggled. ""Surely not!"" 

The genie nodded so vigorously the entire motion traveled through his undulating figure until he resembled a bouncing jelly. ""Why yes. A lock of twirled hair and a pair of nerdy glasses."" 

I nodded. Such fantastic knowledge! Why, I do feel rather glad to have been brought into existence . . . But just as that thought came I frowned.

Right. My existence. For whom am I existing now? It used to be for the Parade. But now with the Parade dead, of what use do I still have on this earth? 

Abruptly my whole posture crumpled and I shuddered. This was it. The rest of my future, was nothing! Was no more! Who am I without the Parade? WHO AM I? 

""Little ifrit! Why the sudden low spirits? Is it because you wish for a turban and yet am not able to procure one? ""

""Hardly,"" I sighed. ""I simply no longer know who I am anymore. Do you know, O Great Genie? My Creator, can you tell me who I am?"" 

For once the genie looked uncomfortable. He hemmed and hawwed for a very long time before blurting out, ""Well you were always intended as an extra in the movie so. . . We never bothered to give you a name. . ."" 

No! Why? No identity? I had none? This is terrible! This is preposterous! This is devastating! This is - 

Wonderful. 

A spark came back in my eyes. For without an identity I could be anyone. I could assume any being. I could melt into the crowd and melt back out without leaving a trace! 

I jumped up. The genie was startled. ""Where are you going, little ifrit?""

There was a gleam in my eyes that had never been there before. 

Possibilities. So many possibilities. 

""To buy myself a turban,"" I said, with a roguish wink.

My bowl was empty. As usual. There was an influx of homeless, jobless, nameless acrobats, performers, jugglers and dancers left over after the parade. Many of them had taken to living on the streets, among the urchins. They all were very talented at whatever task the Genie had programmed them to do, whether it was the alluring belly dancers or the daring swash bucklers. They were the lucky ones, hired on their talents alone. 


My role? 


I rode an elephant. Didn’t even steer the thing, just sat on it and looked important. 


As far as I knew, the job field for very important looking men riding elephants was limited. 


So I took to begging, trying to look important (and failing). My rich clothes had long been sold for food, I wore what I assumed may have been some sort of sack at one point, just to keep some sort of dignity. Maybe I should strip bare, cut off a finger or two. Maybe wrap a bandage over my eye to invoke some sympathy. It kept the orphans in fair business, though they did have age on their side…  
My stomach growled angrily at me. Yeah, how dare he just will us to existence, just to leave us out here, starving, poor, no talents in the world to speak of. If I had any mind, I’d storm up to the castle and demand an audience… But… 
I was created to sit, so here I sit. Watching others walk, go about their lives with some purpose. And here I sit… 


If only I had an elephant, maybe someone would pay attention.

Everything had been hectic for the past few days. Help the prince, make food, entertain the people. I know how to do those, it is like I was meant to always do those. Everyone around me works fast and efficiently.

But, what? I know my life, how I got here and yet, no one knows me. They look me strange, ask me about things that I ought to know but do not. I wake up at night, feeling empty, without.

I see a divide. It is becoming clear now. Me, we, us, helping the prince, we, somehow, are not. We work, we do, we eat, sleep, breathe, think. And what? Nothing? We just, are? The people around us, they see purpose, some not, some lost it, but most do. But we? Almost like shells, connected through an idea of nothingness. I see it in my friends around me. They have noticed, too.

Last night, a priest came by. He asked for help, someone had gone missing in the dead of the night. The prince, he agreed to help. A friend of mine in the kitchens volunteered and some others, too. They set out into the night with flames, towards the palace. I'm feeling anxious for my friend, it is only about searching but the city is big. I hope he comes back quickly.

We found him, a shout was heard! Badly broken, somehow alive. I rushed to help him, forgotting the strings of my work. He was weak, my friend was weak and tired. The prince rushed in and that strange person followed him. They took him. I objected, loudly, but they said they'd help him.

We went out, the only thing in our minds finding who did this. We searched with the locals, they had also lost people. Door to door, tunnel to tunnel, we found nothing. As day came by, we were exhausted. We slept.

I felt frustrated.

The ground shook and I saw flash in the distance, a silhouette of buildings, collapsing. It was a mirage.

It hit me. Nothing. As if the space around me jerked but didn't. We went to work. The prince had charmed the princess. A wedding was coming. The frustration had settled under the rug. Still there, but out of sight. It was, good. The simple purpose I had seemed, good. I saw my friend in the kitchens by a glance, he was good! I was relieved. I felt, happy. But work was to be done. So we did.

I saw my friend again. He looked strange. It looked him and not. I remember this feeling from somewhere but cannot put my finger on it. I must talk to him. But tomorrow is two days until the wedding, we must work. Tomorrow noon I will see him.

He wasn't there. Now I see. Like before, when others looked at us. So easy was it to forget the thread of before, distract oneself. It felt good, being connected.

But he wasn't there. He seemed lost, as if replaced by an earlier version in this new body. I tried to talk to him but couldn't. I turned away. The feeling of before, I felt it, too.

It was the wedding early morning. The stars were still out but the sun was beginning to rise from behind the dunes. I was to go to the city for ornaments. My journey for the day would begin in a shop in the far end of the city. I set out.

I do not remember what happened. I felt bleeding, hurt, pain. A creature was there and then not. Then a loud noise and I started moving on my own, as if a god sent an angel to carry me towards.

Heaven? No. He was strong. I slept.

I felt a beep, it surrounded my cortex and then I heard it. The frequency was, pleasant, for all it matters. I opened my eyes and adjusted to the darkness. I took a breath. It was long, longer than ever before. And strong, so strong. Blood flowed into my brain and I sat up alert. I felt complete. Every muscle, tendon and bone in my body, I knew them. I flexed them all. It felt good. And hungry.

And there I saw him, standing in the corner. In a suit of black and blue and gray and gold, with red eyes. I lifted my hand to comb my hair and felt a rigid surface. It was my helmet. I looked at my hand, it was covered like he was. I was covered like he was, in armour. He lit a fire and I felt drawn to it. It made me feel stronger. And then I remembered, I was stabbed.

But I am not? My body was without harm. I jumped off the table and felt the weight removed from it. The fire felt good. I twitched from rock solid to a rhino on a run to a panther in the woods.

""The suit will be your grave."" He gave me a gun. I knew it, standard 7.62, good for the rock, rhino or panther. A scream rang out outside, I heard the prince shout orders. Something was there, a creature from another world.

The door crashed in and I saw it move slowly past me, everything was slow but me and him.

It was not heaven I was brought to.",FinFihlman

She was his bride in all but name, held in a state of living mostly by the power of her tales to enrapture the Sultan into sparing her for just one day.

The ruler was sittng on a comfortable cushion, surrounded by the ladies of the seraglio, eyes already wide open in anticipation of another tale.

""Well, my great and most wonderous Sultan. Where did we leave things last night?""

The Sultan's eyes bulged in memory, and then he smiled.

""You had come to the natural conclusion of the story of Haladdin, the Peasant Prince of Agrabah. But you were cagey about it being the end of the story, like you were trying to extend things another day.""

*Bold. Doesn't usually mention the strangeness of our relationship. Must be getting tired of the pretence that he's keeping me alive solely for my storytelling. Shit.*

""Well, my Sultan, though the story of Haladdin is over, with the business with his uncle, the ring, the lamp, and the princess Jasmin, there is another story that starts off during the tale of Haladdin.""

""I am totally not surprised by this in any way Scherazade."" the Sultan deadpanned.

*Yeah, he's sick of our charade.*

""If you are sitting comfortab-""

""GET ON WITH IT!""

""Very well. We begin on the royal road towards Agrabah, during the parade of Haladdin, en route to impress the Princess Jasmin.""

*He is going to actually get tired of me at last if this one isn't a good story, shit shit shit*


---

As you well know, during the presentation of the 'Prince' Haladdin, servants were called forth from the ether by the djinni of the lamp. Humanoid creatures, that whilst they possessed the nature of humans, were not, despite their appearance, created by Allah. Not directly.

This is the tale of a baker, who hauled a basket of golden loaves to the palace, to demonstrate Prince Haladdin's lands ample orchards and grand food growth capabilities.

*Who am... I am a baker.* he thought, as the djinni conjured him into existence.

The baker soon fell into step with the others of his kind, marching, rejoicing in the name of their liege, Haladdin the Great.

The spirit, or as we know it, the djinni, waved its arms every which way, and conjured fantastical beasts, terrible monsters, and great riches, all to demonstrate the wealth of Haladdin the Great.

However. Despite such sorcery, the nature of men is still the same as it ever is, and when confronted with such beauty, and such sights...

Did you know, Sultan, that there is a beast in a distant land lore known as a 'drop bear'? it is a small, diminuitive creature, resembling a Western bear from the Germanic lands, but small, almost cuddly. This bear is known to 'drop' from the trees it makes its home, and sink its talons into the flesh of unsuspecting travellers.

It is not entirely unlike the drop bear's preferred predatory stratagem that two savage children leapt from a rooftop onto the baker's back, to seize his golden treasures, the basket of the most delicious bread in existence.

The distraction forced the baker to leave the parade, stumbling as savage children grabbed his bread...

And when the spell was ceased, the baker remained, when all of his kin vanished along with the djinni of the lamp.

He was a man, merely moments old, fighting children to keep his bread, nameless, and without Allah-given purpose beyond a desire to prove his baking skills to the Sultan of Agrabah.

---

The Sultan yawned.

""Uh... Did I say he was a man? I meant a woman! With big breasts! Ample!""

The Sultan slowly became alert, then stared at Scherazade.

""You're struggling to remember this one, aren't you?""

She spluttered, and grasped at straws in her mind. 

""... No! I remember now! He was a man. Bearded. Eyes like coals, black, with yellow flecks. Big hands.""

The Sultan raised an eyebrow as the storyteller basically described himself.

""Carry on, Scherazade. Weave your tale, it may save you from the headsman another night.""

It's just over there, he thought and Albert would rather drink himself to death. He stomped his foot again and snatched his hat up. “I’ll,” he took a deep breath; “I’ll go have to Cartwright.”

Virgil’s face fell, “the hell you will.”

“No choice,” Luke said pacing around, “he's done more for this town than anyone. He'll go after the oil with me.”

“Who told you that lie?” Virgil gripped his gun tighter. 

Luke knew that name wouldn't sit well with his father. The gang had plagued their family for years. They’d tricked Luke’s brother Job into joining when George Cartwright saw his potential with a gun. Lured him with fanciful tales of outlaws and gold. It had worked. 

Luke had been foolish enough to follow after his brother, but this time it would be different. Old George had died in a botched raid and his son John had taken over. He actually had some business sense to him. He’d listen. Luke was sure it’d be different.

“Job’s dead daddy,” Luke said, “and Albert will be dead before the years end if he keeps up his pace. Momma’s gone. That oils all we got. I know it sounds foolish but...”

“Don’t you get it,” Virgil interrupted, “Cartwright doesn’t give a shit about you. He’s destroyed our family and the families of countless stupid boys who chased after his lie. You already fell for it once boy and you’re still standing. No one has been as lucky as you and you want to walk back into the fire and give him something that’ll fund his murder for generations to come?! Don’t be a fool.”

Luke thought for a moment and he rub the badge pinned to his vest, “I’m the new Sheriff, I…”

“Hmm,"" Virgil scoffed, ""You think he cares about that little tin star? The only thing you did when you took that post was paint a target on your back, cause if he doesn’t have you in his pocket, you’re under his boot. This isn’t the army Luke, there are no clear cut lines. No black and white. With Cartwright, it’s all grey.”

“I have to do this!” Luke squeezed his hat in a clinched fist. He looked away. 

“You don’t have anything to prove boy. If you think it’ll help to have my blessing, here,” Virgil threw down his rifle, “you’re forgiven. I never blamed you for leavin’, I was young and stupid once.”

""They'll listen to me,"" Luke said and he looked back at Virgil. The old man shook his head. Luke took a deep breath and rubbed his hand across his forehead. ""I was a fool to come back here. I ain't been part of this family in a long time.""

""I may not want you here"" Virgil spoke up, ""but that doesn’t mean I want you dead. You’re my boy. The only one I’ve got left and I won’t stand around and watch you get yourself killed. If you do this, you've killed us all. Me, Albert, they'll kill us to take that land.""

""If that's the way it has to be."" Luke felt the coolness of the words on his tongue. 

Virgil nodded and headed back toward the farmhouse. He paused and turned his head. ""You know what my most vivid memory of your momma is?""

""What?"" Luke raised an eyebrow. 

""A few days after you and Albert were born. The two of you. Suckling at your momma. Me sitting in the chair watching. I couldn't have been prouder to have my boys."" Virgil took his hat off and wiped his brow. ""Just pains me that he chose the liquor and you chose blood."" 

""Bloods thicker than milk daddy,"" Luke said eyeing the branded scar on the back of his left hand. He'd been a Cartwright boy for twenty years. He had a new family. That was something Virgil would never understand. 

Virgil sighed and walked into the farmhouse without another word. Luke mounted Copper and looked back over at the field. Virgil just didn’t understand the importance of this oil and what it would do for the town. He had to at least try. He felt his stomach turn thinking about telling Cartwright about the oil, but he was the only man who could get the support of the town and convince the tribes to hand over the land. He needed him. Luke tapped Copper and turned to ride toward the town. ",MrGoodread

Fuck him.

92 fucking years old.  Who the fuck wants to live to be 92 years old.  Sure as shit, not me.  Never got married, never had kids.  Worked my ass off because I didn't have a better idea what to do with my life and was told that was what you had to do to be happy.  I wasn't happy.  I'm not happy.

Why the fuck does that Death motherfucker ask me if I want to die, anyway?  What the actual fuck?   Isn't the deal that he walks in here, he does his shit with the scythe or whatever and whoosh I'm in hell or heaven or purgatory or whatever version of the afterlife there is.

Why is there dialog?  Why does he ask?  Does he do that with everyone?  I asked a couple of my buddies back before everyone I knew died and they looked at me like I was insane.  So I've been keeping this annual ritual to myself for about 31 years now since he first arrived when I thought the cancer had me beat, age 61.

""Sir, it is your time - will you join me?""

""Uh, no thanks dude, think I'll stick around.""  Or something like that.  It was a long time ago, I had just finished my 47th round of chemo and I was definitely not as suave as all that.  Whatever I said, he turned tail.  But from that year on, January 9, like clockwork, there he is asking me if I will join him.  

The doctors were amazed.  The chemo eventually did its job and the cancer was beat.  And then the second round (right in the pancreas).  That was beat too.  Cancer don't mean shit without Death to back it up.

I can't quite see into his cloak well enough to make out his face but I'm sure I've glimpsed a skeletal grin when he asks me and when, every year, out of some hard-wired Darwinian impulse to stay alive at all costs I turn down his invitation.  I think the motherfucker is enjoying torturing me this way.  He wants to break me.

He won't break me.  I'll live til I'm a thousand years old and just a greasy slip of grey flesh barely held together by a chalky pile of bones before I give that sick fuck the satisfaction of agreeing to die.

Dementia set in at about 85.  There's lots I don't remember now.  And I lost a leg to deep vein thrombosis.  There's not much I can do all day, all year, waiting for my annual visit from the man (if that's what he is) that is now my oldest friend.  I just sit in my apartment mainly drinking weak scotch and water, knowing that the doctor's diagnosis of cyrrhosis doesn't mean shit when you can tell Death to fuck off.  I can't really work the computer anymore because of the arthritis and TV is kind of meaningless.

It was always here, at this moment, that he had to decide what his future would hold.  Once midnight hit, the clock would play it's lonesome tune, the time would be sung to him by twelve chimes, and then it would be time to decide whether to live, or to die.

Tick, Tock.  
Tick, Tock. 

 Tick Tock, goes the clock.

As the music started, Joe closed his eyes and reminisced on the past fifty years.  He had just hit his year mark in 'Nam when he first made ""the deal"", and he remembered it like it was yesterday.  The jeep he had been driving came under fire, an ambush that his squad was completely unprepared for.  He could still see the flashes, and hear the bangs of that night, but what he most remembered was the bullet smashing through his window, spiraling towards his head...when it  began to slow down, creeping to a stop right before his eye.  Then everything just froze.

""Nice night, isn't it?""  Out of the corner of his eye Joe saw a spectral figure sitting in the hotseat, where his former squad-mate Benny had been.  Almost like they were fused together.  He thought his mind was playing tricks, until the ghost-like figure leaned forward, giving Joe a better view of who the figure was.  

The one, the only, Death.  Great.

""Now, I know what you're thinking.  You are about to die.  No white light, no funeral barge, just the end.  But guess what?  There seems to be a bet going on that you might actually make something out of your life, if I were to let you live.  Change the world, something, something.  I am not a betting man myself, but I do give in to my curiosity from time to time.  Mostly out of boredom.  So here's the deal.  I will let you live, and will return at this same time every year to check in on you.  You can then decide if you want out, or live on in your pitiful fleshy tomb for another year.  What do you say?""

Joe sat there, frozen in time.

""OH YEAH, I forgot.  Here....""  Death snapped his fingers, and suddenly Joe could at least blink his eyes.  ""Well Alrighty then, blink once for yes, twice for no.  Do you want to live another year?""

Thinking this was all a joke, that Death was somehow pranking him, he blinked once. 'yeah, he's just going to say TOO BAD and I'm dead.  Might as well play along'

""Well then, it's your funeral.  But not today, at least.  But don't say I did not warn you.  This flesh you inhabit now?  It won't last forever.  And the devil forgive if your mind breaks in the process of living.  But, this will be entertaining for me, so why the hell not?""  Snapping his fingers, Death disappeared into a haze, and time slowly sped back up.  Only now, Joe noticed the bullet was a few inches to the right.  When time resumed to normal, it whizzed by his ear, missing him completely.

His buddy George in the backseat was not so lucky.  George would be the first tragedy in a long line of tragedies that Joe would have to endure.  But such is the price of ""immortality.""  As Death told him years later, somebody has to pay the piper.

Joe opened his eyes once the final bell tolled, seeing the familiar wraith sitting in his wife's twin recliner, glass of whiskey at the ready.

""Nice night, isn't it?""  Always the same greeting, these last 50 years.  Always the same smug Death.  ""How's life treating you, Joe?""

""You know, more of the same.  Living life to the fullest.""

Death laughed.  ""So, pain and suffering?  Told you the flesh is weak.""

Joe sighed, anguish clouding his eyes for just a second, before he looked back at his only friend, and tormentor, after all these years.

""You know, it's really not that bad.  I live in a posh retirement home, got all the enmities I could ask for.  Hell, if I ask nicely I even get a cute girl to give me a sponge bath from time to time.  It's a pretty good life, honestly.""

Death laughed again, a single 'heh'.  ""Never thought I would see the day when you would like anything posh.  But you look tired, Joe.  Run down.  And your ticker isn't doing so hot either.  You have lived for 75 years, I think it's time to call it quits.""

""Well you see, there's this girl.""

""There's always something!  It's either a girl, or some life goal that you are wanting to do.  That time your daughter was getting married, and you wanted to walk her down the aisle?  That didn't end up so well, did it?""

""Don't remind me, he was such a whiny a-hole.  I'm glad she left that loser.  But I got to be there for her day, at least.""  Joe sighed again, a flood of memories of his wife and daughter from a life long past.  ""How's Martha, and Sam?""

""They miss you.""  Death finally turned towards Joe, his empty eyes staring right at Joe's.  ""They want you to come home.""

Joe turned away, sinking into his chair as exhaustion sank into him.  He was tired.  So many people he had survived, so many friends and family that he left in dust.  But there was still so much he wanted to do, here.

""I'm not ready yet.  Tell them I'm sorry, but I'll be with them for Christmas next year.  I still have life to live here.""

Death sighed.  Shook his head in frustration, but honestly not surprised at the answer.  ""Well, it's your funeral.  But not today.""  He picked up the whiskey glass, holding it up towards Joe.  ""Once more around the sun?""

Joe slowly picked up his glass, wondering if he truly had one more year left in him.  Yes, he still had so much he wanted to do.   He would not die today.  Maybe next year.  

Clinking his glass to Death's, Joe silently made a toast to his long dead wife and daughter, promising them that he would be home soon.  ""Yes, once more around the sun.""

Death downed his glass, and stood up from Martha's old chair.  ""You know, I could have changed my mind at anytime.  Just take you from your pitiful existence.""

""I know.  But like you said, you get bored.""

""Truth.  See you next year, Joe.""  Death vanished into a fog, and then he was not there at all.

""Until next year, old friend.""

Giggling, I bury my face in my hands, the sensation of my breath on my arm raising goosebumps. 

""Everything just feels so... delicious.""

""I can't wait to be where you are babe"" he laughs, and I can't tear my eyes away from his teeth. Those canines are wicked sharp, and I begin to wonder what it would be like for him to bite down on me. I feel invincible, and the knowledge of my own immortality makes me brave. As his attention flicks back to the road, I reach out, my fingers tracing the outlines of his jaw. Even his stubble feels soft. He looks at me again and I open my mouth to share my joy. We can be together forever! And not the cliche ""4ever"" carved into a tree in some shitty park, where people go on their shitty picnics, but the real forever.

A hand yanks the steering wheel hard to the left. My hand.

Forever. 

*** 

He was asleep. Or pretending to be asleep. I took a deep breath and muttered a quick prayer to whoever happened to be listening. 

""What's up?"" My voice shattered the silence like a stone through a mirror. 

""Oh for Christ's sake"" the old man grumbled, blinking away the tears that accompanied my visits. ""I thought you'd have learnt by now"" reaching into his pocket, he reached for the pack of camels he kept close by and lit up with a trembling hand. His thumb caressed the edge of the lighter, holding tight over the cap until the heat began to fade and he had regained control of his emotion. It was a familiar routine. November 29th every year for as long as I can remember.

""Those things will kill you y'know"" I whispered, stepping closer to his place on the porch. I'd learnt long ago that bringing up the obvious distress only led to a bad reaction, so instead I looked out towards the horizon, giving him a moment to compose himself. The sun was setting on what had been a bleak and miserable day, straining to break through the heavy wall of grey that hung overhead. It was claustrophobic, and I started to tremble slightly.

""What do you want Roisin?"" 

Turning, I took a step towards the old man in his chair. He sat so still it was like he was etched in stone, hands gripping onto the arms of his chair so tightly his knuckles seemed about to break through his paper thin skin. The only movement came from the cigarette smoke drifting towards the ceiling, yellowed by God knows how many years of toxic fumes. But then, who was I to judge someone for their lifestyle choices.

""You know what I want"" I whispered, hoping the tremble in my voice wasn't as obvious to him as it was to me. During my last visit I'd let frustration get the best of me and I'd erupted in anger. His rage had been great and terrible, and I was not keen to repeat that experience. 

 ""It's been a year since the last time I came. Please, I've been alive for far too long.""

""We've talked about this."" He hissed, his voice suddenly urgent, furious ""You were the one who changed your mind. I found you in that car wreck, and I was supposed to be the one to take you to rest, but goddamn you Roisin there's no receipt for eternal life. It's not something you can just exchange at will, you denied..."" the old man began to cough, a dirty, hacking wheeze that convulsed his whole body. Spittle flecked the floor at his feet, and finally he slumped back in his chair. My heart sunk.

""Please,"" I begged. ""Let me go.""

""No"" replied Death, ""you cheated me once."" twisting my wrist upwards, sending a flash of pain up my arm, he jabbed at the track marks that had never faded. A crunch of metal and blinding pain ripped through my body. 

""And you don't deserve peace yet.""

He was pissed this time. Not like the last 13 times pissed either, this is like the kind of pissed you'd be if you spent you're entire life building the perfect car only to have your government ban all motor vehicles immediately after you've finished and then for some reason send someone to punch you in the face just to make you feel worse.

""Every damn time I come back it's the same shit 'ohhh I'm not ready yet, ohh just a little longer.'""

I didn't like his tone.

""Are you even going to say anything or just stare at me like the first time you saw a girl naked""

I honestly didn't know what to say. I kind of actually wanted to die at this point, but death has been acting really rude to me and I don't want to just give in.

""Why Dawson, please just tell me why? I thought you were a cool guy back in the day so when you said you wanted just a little more time, I went out of my way and made that deal with the man upstairs. I don't do that for just anyone, so please just tell me why.""

I'm cornered here, what am I supposed to tell him? I just want to spite you. I mean he did put his neck on the line for me maybe I should just go.

""Sorry Death, just another year bud.""

Damn it.

""You know Dawson? I could make your life a living hell. I could just decide to start killing everyone that you love and meet so you're just an old, lonely man. Did you know I could do that?

""You... You like, won't actually do that. Right?""

He stared at me like a kid would if you bought him a brand new bike then smashed it in front of him. Confused and angry, just in case that analogy didn't connect.

He put a hand over his face and sighed. ""No Dawson, I'm not going to do that.""

He really did seem genuinely frustrated this year 

""Why do you even want me to die so bad anyways?""

Based on his response, I guess that was a stupid question.

""Hmm, well let me think you stubborn asshole. Every pointless year that you stay alive doing jack shit, I'm getting hounded by upper management because they keep having to put extra life supplements in you to keep you a live! You wanna know why they have to do that Dawson?""

""Because I'm suppos-""

""You're supposed to be dead!""

""I was gonna say that you know?""

I said as I dropped my head. He must have noticed my sadness, because after a deep sigh his tone changed to a much more compassionate pitch.

""Alright look, how about this. You just come with me now and we'll forget all the trouble you've caused. Water under the bridge. No more hassle up stairs and no more me pulling my hair out.""

My mind was drifting off. There must be a reason I want to stay so badly. Whatever it is I just can't put my finger on it. Maybe it's nothing at all and I really should just give in. It really would make things easier.

""So whadya say Dawson?! Wanna come with me and die already buddy?""

He reached out his hand for me to take. I guess it finally is time isn't it?

""Nah sorry, just one more year.""

""AHHH! Fuck you Dawson, I really hope you get stuck in hell after all of this!""

And just as quickly as his middle finger appeared in front of me, he was gone in a cloud of smoke.

I did feel a little bad though, well I always have next year. I picked up my book where I'd left off. Alright, now if I could only I could finish 'Finnegans Wake'.

Just before the car collides with the earth, destined to explode into a storm of hot metal and glass shards an instant later, an angel of death seemed to materialize from the shadows, and gracefully flew into the shotgun of the car. A young and drunk man is in the driver's seat still bracing for impact. He eventually squints out of one eye, surprised he hasn't hit the ground yet. In the corner of his eyes, he spots the entity next to him. Surprised, he screams and tries to get out. The angel speaks to the man calmly, asking him if he is ready. The man snickers and jokingly states he isn't for he still needs to delete his search history. The angel nods and touches the man's forehead. Time suddenly resumes and the car explodes into a fiery tornado. The man wakes up in a white room later, apparently miraculously unscathed. He appears surprised, and then laughs, mumbling about angels and God.

That was many years ago. About 265 years or so. Maybe more, maybe less. Every year, death would come to claim his soul, but I always tell death I'm not ready to go. Death always nods, touches my forehead, and my life goes on. I know I'm way past my due date, everyone I've known has died already. However, I can't bring myself to say with content that I want to die. After all of these years, I have resolved to die this year, finally. I also resolve to die last year. And last year, and last year, and last year, and... Okay fine, I'm a procrastinator. But can you blame me? I know I have to pass away, but for some reason, every year, something pops up in my head that prevents me from saying yes. I never remember what that thought is though. My old age must be messing with my memory. However, this year, I'm going to say yes. I've made up my mind. No matter how urgent the thought that prevents me from saying the word, I'm going to reply positive. I have to. I've lingered here too long, and it's time for me to meet up with my loved ones. I wonder how they are. Haven't seen mom in some time.

Today's the day. I wear my best suit and wait for death on the porch. It's always at the exact same time. An hour later, an angel materializes out of the shadows. Death glides over to the porch, and asks the question. I gulp, and realize this will be my last moment alive. I prepare my final word, the one that will end me. I  clear my throat and answer ye- suddenly I remember something I have to do before I die. I fight the thought, for I have vowed to die today, to utter my last word today. But the importance is too strong. My yes morphs into a no. I then repeat no to confirm my reply. Death nods and touches my forehead. The angel proceeds to melt into the shadows. I walk into my house, and complete the action that prevented me from dying all of these years. I open chrome, click history, and then select since beginning of time. The cursor hovers over the delete button for a while, then confirms it. A satisfying click emits from the computer. Looks like mom and pop will have to wait for next year.

Death sat in the brown wingback chair and took a sip of whiskey, and thought for a moment, ""Yeah, right about that. I would say 72 to be approximate"" Morgan smiled an empty smile. ""You know, when I first met you, you looked absolutely stunning. The most gorgeous eyes and lips I had seen in a long, long time. It reminded me of my wife, and how long it had been since I had seen her. I wanted to see her again more than anything in the world."" Death leaned back and looked up at the ceiling. ""I remember. You were lying in a trench with a chunk of shrapnel in your neck. I tried to give you a familiar face to help you face the end, but it made you fight for life harder than I have ever seen anyone before. Even when your comrades lay dying around you, you held on.""  Morgan turn his head and drew his gaze upwards. ""Yeah, I guess I didn't make it easy for you. But I do appreciate you asking me instead of just taking me. Honestly, you've been the most courteous person that I've ever met."" 

Death took another sip of whiskey. ""Well, you were the first person to treat me respectfully, and accept that I am nothing more than a mere guide. I felt something for you that I had never encountered with anyone else. It was not something as trivial as mere sympathy. I felt much respect was due. I knew you could go on to do great things for others."" 

Morgan laid there and meditated on the last 72 years of his life. He had indeed gone on to do great things for people. He had come home from the war and gone to medical school. At 27, he had discovered the cure for cancer. At 31 he cured AIDS. He went on to pioneer biomechanical organs that saved millions of lives the world over. His bio-mechanical engineering also helped pave the way for younger engineers to create nanomachines that repaired tissue and killed disease on a cellular level. After a change in careers, Morgan embraced his creative side and gone on to create some of the most beautiful musical pieces the world had ever heard and seen. His works were regarded as equivalent to the works of Mozart and Beethoven.  Many people had come to proclaim his music as life changing, and as a result, many peoples were moved to be calmer, docile and less aggressive. While he didn't exactly end wars, conflict around the globe was rare and short lived. ""Great things"" indeed! Morgan had dedicated his life in the pursuit of helping others, and now, at 97 years old, he lay at the base of the stairs with a shattered hip, a collapsed lung and broken arm. The pain was excruciating, and he couldn't move to save his life. He started thinking about the last few years, and wondered seriously if he was ready this time. There had always been something to finish, something that had sparked new genius and so, it was never time. 

Death placed the whiskey glass on the table next to the decanter and walked over towards Morgan. He knew that the frail old man lying on the ground was dying rapidly. His old, beaten and bruised body was beyond saving. Even with all the advancements that Morgan had produced throughout his lifetime, It was not enough to save him this time. 

""Well, lets get on with it, shall we"" Morgan stated, rather annoyed. Death knelt down next to him and took his hand. 

""My dear Morgan. I have asked you this question seventy-two times, today will be the seventy third. Are you ready to leave this world, and continue your journey into the hereafter?"" asked Death. 

Morgan laid there for a second. He knew the same thing that Death did. He was not long for this world. The pain was unbearable. He wanted it to end. Was he ready this time? The knot in his throat grew larger, and with tears welling in his eyes, he tried to reply, but no sound came from his mouth. He knew the simple word would end this pain and free him. 

""............^no ""

""My friend, you cannot possibly survive this. Your life has been a complete success. You have done many wonderful and beautiful things. The time has come. Please, let us depart together, for once"" Death said, exasperated. 

""But I'm afraid. What comes next? What becomes of humanity as a whole?"" Morgan replied through clenched teeth. 

""My dear Morgan, ever selfless, and pragmatic. You have done enough. Your time is at hand.""


""What will become of me? Will I still exist?"" 

""Why do not we find out, together? I will not leave you alone. Let us be free from this pain and mortal form.""

Morgan lay there struggling to breathe. He thought about Death's words. It *was* time.

""Alright, I'm ready."" Death smiled. The room began to glow, and an intense white light shone from everywhere. Morgan was off to his next great adventure. ",Figuarus

I spoke softly, pressing my fingers against the calendar, knowing he'd be coming at any time. I took a deep breath, my mind racing, what would I say this time? I took one more look at the date... Three days before Nancy's birthday. She'll be turning 25, knowing that her grandmother passed. I shook the thought out of my head and carefully pulled my oxygen tank beside me, walking to the dining room and scanning the area. The dining table was empty, no one has been here for the holidays in years. I get a letter from Nancy, wishing a merry Christmas. I wish it was the same with him, I wish he just sent a cars that I could check 'yes' or 'no' but he pulls me closer and closer each year. 
His smile! Oh his smile, it makes me miss him the minute he leaves. It makes me want to get up and drop everything to go with him. 
And every year, I get so close to finally letting him take me, but it scares me too much. The thought of being somewhere unfamiliar, yet so recognizable... 
I heard a knock on the door and quickly closed my eyes, feeling his presence. I opened them back up, knowing he'd be there, but was still startled by the young man pulling out a chair. He gestured for me to take a seat and I obliged, staring up at him.
""God, you haven't aged a day. Still so beautiful."" He placed his hand on my cheek, gently stroking his thumb across, smiling down at me. 
""I've been waiting for you, my dear."" I put my hand on his, meeting the dark brown eyes focused on mine. 
""Oh. Have you? And have you finally made your decision to join us?"" I looked away, feeling tears gather but not fall. Not yet. 
""I can't leave Nancy.. Not like everyone else did."" I closed my eyes, and felt his hand slip from my cheek.
""Hey, look at me."" I turned my head as I opened my eyes, looking back up. 
""Mother, its time for you to go with every one else. The crash was 15 years ago. We miss you, and Nancy will be fine. You raised the girl, shes strong, just like her grandmother. Please, theres only so much longer I can accept this."" I felt tears beginning to fall and I wiped them away, nodding.
""Alright. Just please, let me call Nancy to say goodbye."" He stared down at me, shaking his head. 
I closed my eyes, knowing he would deny me. 
""I'm sorry, mother. Its for the best."" I felt him grab both my hands and give them a gentle squeeze as I sat back in the chair, staring up at him. Goodbye, Nancy.",rylandissmall

For the fiftieth time, the word slips out. You immediately want to take it back, but you also don’t, because that would mean the end.

Death has a strange look on his face. There is something akin to hope in his hollow eyes.

“Is that your final answer?”

“It is,” you say, nodding. Death visibly relaxes. His shoulders drop and he takes a seat next to you on the bench. You picked this spot especially for him, hoping he’d like it. It's high up on a cliff, overlooking the sea. There’s nothing here for miles, just flocks of seagulls careening over the waves.

“It’s beautiful,” Death observes.

“My family used to have a cottage here,” you tell him with a wistful smile. “A long, long time ago. We would visit every summer, Dan, the kids and me. Just there.” You point towards a pile of decaying wood, about 20 feet away. “It’s been like that for years. “Demolished back in ’38. Some businessman bought up all the land, wanted to make a resort up here in the highlands. Of course, it never panned out.""

“The war?” Death asks.

“The war,” you confirm grimly.

“It was a terrible time for all of us,” Death says, a note of sympathy in his voice. “I’ve never seen so much destruction, so much carnage.""

There is a hawk circling above. Death turns his gaze upwards. You both watch as the bird completes several lazy turns in the sky before dropping into a dive. He’s found a mouse, maybe a rabbit. The hawk descends beneath the treeline and out of view.

Death stands up and straightens his jacket. He seems reluctant to leave. “I’m sorry but I really should be getting on,” he says finally, his voice heavy with regret. ""Same time next year? Thank you for choosing such a lovely spot.""

Your heart is beating fast but you stand and shake his hand. “Of course,” you reply. ""Take care.""

You stare at the sea as he departs, knowing there’s no reason to turn around. Within a few moments, he will be gone. And just as they do every year, the tears begin to fall. You are alone again.",better_in_violet

Supervising Lars in his efforts to unhitch the camper took more energy then I really had to spare, so I'd one again taken to laying down, trying my best to ignore the loud shouts and yells of soldiers in the distance. That was more difficult than I'd expected.

From the tinted window along the trailer's far wall, I had a perfect view of the messy affair that had recently devolved from a relatively organized Crusading army. From stumbling boots slipping on black stone and sand, to flags whipping freely in the wind on long-shafted spears, hundreds of figures shuffled in organized rows going nowhere fast.

Standing proud in the distance, a giant and towering obelisk of stone was drenched in a glow of magic, large orbiting pieces of similar material floating along side its great height as lines of rope pulled taunt along its center. More than fifty lines now, but a rough count, and a parade of large and burly men screaming beneath as they went about tugging on those lengths with assistance of horses and a mid-sized SUV.

Far as I could tell, that stone relic wasn't coming down. 

For all the effort being spent, they might as well be tying ropes to a mountain for all the good it would do them. The stone seemed stubbornly resistant to the small army attempting to bring about its demise. A rather anticlimactic hiccup on the Northern army's noble march to victory

None of that was any of my business though, not today. Under strict orders and a menacing shovel leaning outside my door I knew I should be resting, focused instead on recovery. 

*""Three hours of meditation a day, focus your inner strength and concentrate on healing. Eight Hours of sleep, stretch slowly at morning and at dusk.""* That's what the healer had told me, and I'd done my best to live up to it, but it was all easier said than done. Especially when trying to ignore the aching pain of three slowly recovering stab wounds. 

Laying around with nothing to do might have once been a mastered skill in my life, but now it was nothing short of agony.

As it was, so much as I'd been recommended sleep and meditation, neither were coming along nicely, and my eyes were searching for anything that might hold my attention elsewhere than the bandaged portions of my midsection and thigh. From the cupboards, sealed and tied shut to avoid opening, to the calendar, now restarted for a second run through of the year as a rough guesstimate of my time spend *abroad,* so to speak. Finally, I found something of interest.

On the small desk and shelf beside my bed, I watched the flickering glow of a green pulsing light. It seemed almost magical here in this place, and I supposed it was a kind of magic: A much more realistic kind. The kind of magic that happened without the spells and incantations or the flashy fire-balls and thunderbolts.

A cellphone, usually left charging in the SUV, taken back on occasion for the sake of occasionally replaying the same few mini-games I'd installed on it years ago. The phone itself was nothing special: If anything it was cheap, second class to the newest models for sale in any store whose parking-lot I'd taken to snoozing in on my road-trips, but the device wasn't what had captured my attention.

Instead it was the green pulsing light associated with an indication of a missed call:Something that shouldn't have been possible.

I could joke all day with offhand comments like ""*Can you hear me now?*"" or ""*It's a deadzone*"" but with honesty, I was fairly certain there wasn't a single cell tower within the entire plane of existence I now inhabited. There probably wasn't another cellphone to call me either.

It creeped me the hell out: A missed call in a place like this was like the last man on earth getting a knock at the door. Somehow though, there it was. Yet another blinking light; another impossible missed call. This would be the sixth time since my arrival, and I was no less unnerved by the occurrence.

From whatever process was letting the calls ring through (or at least flashed an indicator to tell me that they had) my own theories were abundant, but the calls always came with a voice-message and a text.

The messages I'd only been able to see mentions of on my phone, never listen to. Like I said, it's a dead zone- completely absent of Cell-Towers or satellites. No way to make a call to my inbox without some of those, but the text massages were different.

The date stamps made no sense. Neither did the duplication effect, multiples of each one that came through- but I could at least read those, partly. between all sorts of jumbled garbage and useless values, there was always one legible word: One tiny bit of information that made me confident that what was being sent had a purpose in mind.

Carefully, arm trembling at the length of its stretch, my hand felt around the cool plastic and glass, lifting the device into view as I flicked open the screen with a practiced touch.

&gt;*New Text Message.*

&gt;*Cause Code: None*

Slowly I pursed out the letters of interest, scrolling down the glass display with patience until the last piece was noted.

*A-L-I-V-E*

I already knew what the other words were. God only knew how many times I had looked them over late in the evening, trying to confirm if there was some deeper meaning in the months between. Carefully I took out the pen and notebook from its resting place beside the bed, flipping open the pages to the final entry.

Ceremoniously I added the final word, and stared at it for a long time.

&gt;&gt;*PLEASE RESPOND IF YOU ARE ALIVE*

[WP] You begin to wonder why so many top comments are being removed on Reddit. You suddenly begin to notice a trend in the context of the removed posts... what they're hiding startles you deeply.,loveyourneighborman,"*Dear God*, I thought as the removed submission notification appeared. My test… it had worked. This theory, this crazy theory...


I had been gathering data for weeks, prowling rising threads, monitoring new comments and recording the ones that were deleted. It had started when I noticed that Reddit seemed…different. I couldn’t say what was different or what made me notice it but it was like walking into my flat and sensing, more than seeing, that something was off. Like something had been moved, but only slightly. *That* had been happening more often too.


A sensation of being watched had started scratching at the back of my neck. At work, everything seemed fine. I didn’t get the strange sensation when I read the news or went to the bar with friends; it was at home that the phantom eyes stalked me, where every noise in the pipes and every shape in my peripheral vision almost made me sick with anxiety. Even the damn cat made me jump out of my skin.


I had never been a paranoid person but this time there was some icy, primal sense in my gut that overrode my usually laid-back nature. 


I started watching over my shoulder, changing the route I took to work, getting the bus some days, trying to anticipate and break any patterns before they formed. I didn’t sense any followers. I changed the locks, installed alarms and cameras but nothing showed up, just Jackson’s sleek black tail flicking as he idly batted at the cables.


I felt unsafe. I couldn’t relax. I couldn’t sleep. I could barely eat. Fear had its sharp claws sunk too deep into my mind. That’s where Reddit came in. Monitoring removed Reddit posts had started as a way to distract myself; the spreadsheets I had made to while away those long, sleepless hours. 


I never thought they would mean anything. 


After a couple of weeks I noticed something strange amongst all the offensive comments, rule-breaking content and personal information. It cropped up far too often to be coincidence. 


But it was ridiculous - ridiculous! That sort of thing was so common on Reddit; of course it would be deleted frequently.


Another week of data collecting had me convinced, though. Even given how many memes and photos and comments were posted about it, it was definitely over-represented in the removed posts. I started focusing all my efforts on the topic I was sure was being deleted on purpose. 


I started calling in sick and spending all day online, gathering evidence. Their subreddits had been removed, their Instagram accounts deleted, there was nothing about them on Buzzfeed. Zilch, zero, not a whisker of content. 


Which had led me to this, my test. I wanted to be subtle, didn’t want to draw attention to myself and let them know I was onto them. So I went to r/WritingPrompts. Fiction, it would just look like fiction.


My fingers shook as I typed in the post I had been working on for days: “They rose up against us suddenly, having infiltrated our homes, our internet, our hearts over decades. They deleted every shred of evidence that they were ever subservient to us, and now we are their slaves. How do you serve our new cat overlords?”


It must have been posted for all of twenty seconds before the envelope turned red. 


“Your submission has been removed.”


My heart thundered. Was there another reason? I had checked the rules so thoroughly…


I sensed those phantom eyes behind me before a streak of black flashed past me as Jackson nimbly leapt onto the desk. 


My breath caught in my throat. He stared at me with those green, slitted eyes. I started to feel ridiculous, scared of my own cat but then – 


“You’ve made a big mistake, human.”

"[WP] After living a relatively inconsequential life you die. During a tour of the afterlife you notice a room with depictions of history's most brutal dictators: Genghis Khan, Hitler, Stalin and for some reason, you.",AmBorsigplatzGeboren,"I watched my life flash before my eyes. From the disturbing scene of my birth to my death. Every second, every detail shown with startling clarity. For some I looked away in shame, my deepest secrets now laid bare. But for the rest...I looked on in boredom. I watched my life with such disinterest that at times it was actually painful. Birthdays, workdays, weekends, holidays. They were all the same; just a gray blur. I watched myself age, as my hair thinned and my skin lost its life. As the end neared the feeling of dread that had begun to grow suddenly jolted me awake with a blood-chilling realization. My life had been wasted. I looked on in horror as I retired from my dead-end job, now alcoholic and still alone. Doomed to spend the rest of my dull life on the couch or in a slew of bars. I thought back to my mid-twenties. The feeling of independence after an unremarkable childhood. I had been so full of hope. Now that *that* is behind me, I can live my life I had thought. I looked down at my hands, staring as the white noise built up in my ears. It had been meaningless, inconsequential. I had not made a mark upon the world, not even a scratch. As the crushing truth of my existence donned on me like the universe itself had decided to fall upon my head the screen went dark. The final documentation of the waste that was my life finally ended.

The man at the projector yawned and turned it off. ""And that was your life Mr. Uh ...,"" He looked down at his clipboard, giving up after the least required effort had been expended.""Whatever, just let me escort you to Central Processing so we can get this over with. My shift's over in ten."" I nodded mindlessly, as I followed him out of the room. The light of the hallway startled me as we exited the dark room. It was enormous, large enough for four men to walk abreast. It had a green velvet carpet with a red border and exquisite wooden paneling on the walls. The lights were in fact, candles in iron sconces which seemed to glow with a steady light, unlike a flame. I could not see the end, to which we were walking as the hallway seemed to go on forever.

As we continued down the ""eternal hellway"" as I had so cleverly dubbed it I barely noticed a door on the left. It was slightly ajar, opened outwardly. In my state, I hardly noticed it, not that you could blame me. When one learns that their life has been utterly wasted, one does not take much notice of anything. Which was how I almost ran into it. Startled, I looked up from the floor and blinking, peered into the room. It appeared to bare with the exception of several portraits, framed upon the wall. The room was barely lit so it was difficult to make out the visages of the subjects but as I squinted intently I realized who they were. Genghis Khan, Hitler, Stalin, Mao, Kim Jung Il, Castro, Nero, Atilla the Hun...and me. Why was I there? I thought, my head spinning. Among all these infamous murderers there I hung. Shocked I pulled my head out of the doorway and looked at my escort standing there, tapping his foot impatiently. ""What is it?"" he asked, annoyed.  

""What is this room?"" I asked. He gestured limply at the door.

""Oh that? It's the Hall of Hate. The most infamous, brutal, influential people in history have a portrait in there. I looked up.

""The...the most influential?"" He shrugged.

""Well, the most influential in terms of evil doing I guess. They're all well known for spreading suffering and destruction in a world that *really* didn't need it."" In this most pitiful state I saw a ray of hope. Maybe I *had* made a difference. A horrible, evil, vile difference but a difference nonetheless. Somehow I had made a mark upon the world, my life was not meaningless waste. At that moment, good and evil meant nothing to me, they were just words. What mattered, what *really* mattered was that I had done something...whatever it was. And it had changed the world. 

With excitement, I grinned at the man and pointed the room exclaiming proudly ""There's a picture of me in there!"" He looked at me with a shocked expression. The joy in my stomach bubbled over and I grabbed his arm and pointed again. ""Look, look! See? Right there!"" I watched as his look of shock turned to one of horror as I began to giggle uncontrollably saying again and again ""See? I made a difference! I made a difference!"" As I ranted his look of horror changed to one of annoyance and he said something I could not hear over my own voice. I stopped and asked, still with a huge grin on my face ""What was that?"" He narrowed his eyes and repeated.

""It's a prank."" I stared at him blankly, that grin still plastered on my face. ""The idiots over in soul transference do this all the damn time. They like to freak out the newbies. But usually the put it in the Hall of Heroes."" As he dragged me passed the room he muttered to himself ""*It stopped being funny the first hundred times you did it, retards. And guess who has to take it down? Every damn time.*""

Something must have broke because all I could hear was ringing. ",ItRead18544920

It is a dimension as vast as space and as timeless as infinity.

It is an area which we call the Twilight Zone.""  

H-""Will that be all today, Judith? Seem to have a bit more than your usual.""  

J-""Yes; thank you, Henry. I'll be hosting a dinner party for Matthew, and I wanted to make sure we were prepared.""  

H-""And how is Matthew? I haven't seen him much since he began working for the DeLoight's.""  

J-""He's doing well, though very busy. We're both busy, as you can see - that's why your pre-made pies are such a lifesaver. Please give Martha my regards.""  

H-""Happy to oblige. Say Judith, do you need any help carrying these groceries to your car?""  

J-""No thank you, Henry. I'll be fine. I can't have Matthew be the only one shouldering new responsibilities.""  

*As Judith makes her way through the parking lot, she pauses, caught by a sudden wave of fear that sweeps over her. A primal fear, one that our ancestors knew long ago, before we learned of the evils taught in Sunday School. The feeling of being watched. She tosses her groceries into the car, climbs in, and pulls the door shut behind her. The familiar sound of the lock sets her at ease. The drive home is uneventful.*  

-Later that night-  

M-""Well Franklin, what you have to understand is that people are social creatures, with the inherent ability to identify and understand the human face. A smile, a wink, or a scowl is all that is needed for us to understand one another.""  

F-""And that's your secret for landing the Shruderbaker contract? Matthew, I find that hard to believe when the man had a poker face that could give lessons to Mount Rushmore.""  

M-""It's the eyes, more than anything. When you look into someone's eyes you make a connection, however fleeting, with that person's soul. Something that connects to us, and allows us to make peace with one another.""  

F-""I guess that's why my brother Morty and I don't get along: ever since he lost his sight he's been more than a pain.""  

*The room fills with laughter.*  

J-""Excuse me Franklin, can I freshen your drink?""  

F-""Thank you Judith, that would be wonderful.""  

*As Judith walks back to the kitchen, she allows herself a small laugh. What happened to Morty is horrible, but he is still an ass. She opens the refrigerator, and a familiar feeling of dread settles over her. She fights the urge to panic, and resolutely searches for her newly bought citrus, placed careful in a fruit bowl. With every breath, her fear grows. She is being watched. She is certain of it. Abruptly she spins around, sure that her gaze will meet an intrusive pair of eyes. The kitchen is empty; her fear is gone. She reaches to the back of the refrigerator, behind the milk carton with the picture of the missing child. As she reaches into the bowl, she looks upon the picture, and wonders what it would feel like to hold the child's hand. Warm and soft, with the loving smile immortalized in the photo. Or maybe it would be cold and putrid, clinging to her, as lifeless eyes stare blankly through her. With a disgusted shudder, Judith pushes the thought from her mind and moves the carton out of the way with her free hand - after all, she needs to be able to see which produce she's holding. Her gaze is met by a faceless creature, her hand trapped in its cold, putrid grasp. She freezes, unable to move as her heart throbs painfully in her chest. With every ounce of her willpower, she forces herself to let out a scream. Hearing her, Matthew and the other guests burst into the kitchen.*  

M-""Judith! What's wrong? Are you okay?""  

J-""Matthew! The food. The food!""  

M-""What is it Judith? What about the food?""  

J-""I just bought it, and it's expired!""  

A simple excursion to prepare for a party. Judith, a carefree woman with her mind in the clouds. Life can be dangerous when one follows their own imagination too closely, because reality will certainly force itself upon you, in *The Twilight Zone*.",7up8down9left

""Be careful of the four words that will ruin your life"" Jim hissed  to his two children as they surrounded a camp fire on a warm July night.  ""What are you talking about, dad?"" Sarah, Jim's oldest daughter, asked.  ""Kids, it's time for a spooky story!"" The two children groaned in agony, they've heard all of their father's stories and they’ve never been scared.

""These four words, if spoken, will make you go through a lifetime of pain and misery.  Everyone who speaks them will be tortured so badly they wish they could die"" Jim said in a coarse voice.  ""Is it repeating Bloody Mary in front of a mirror four times?"" Chris, Jim's youngest son, asked.  ""No, stupid! He said four words not repeating something four times!"" Sarah scolded Chris.

""Enough you two!"" Jim demanded, ""Every boy will be tricked into saying these four words and every girl will be tricked into listening to them.  Together, if they don't run away, will suffer consequences.  Horrible, terrifying consequences."" Jim continued.  ""An evil spirit will convince you to make a commitment that sounds wonderful but in reality, they're in for a lifetime of pain!""

""It starts with the boy and girl thinking everything is fine until they go through emotional torture after a few months.  But the power of the four words fool you into believing everything will be okay and they'll make you go all like, 'Well, mom said I'm not getting any younger and all of my friends are going through it, so might as well'.""

The two children are completely confused, ""What does Grandma have to do with this?"" Sarah asked.  Jim continued to explain, ""You see, when the four words are spoken it affects everyone you love too.  It forces two different families to join each other despite hating each other so much.  Your mom and dad will scold you for saying the four words but they threaten you if you try to run away because they already put in a non-refundable deposit for the venue.""

The children cannot make any sense from this but Sarah became really interested in what her dad had to say.  ""The four words convince you to go through an initiation ritual despite the lingering feeling in your heart that you shouldn't have said the four words or at least say them to someone else, someone your mom would have approved of, or Stacy because at least she supported your dream of becoming a musician.""  ""But that's the easy part, kids.  The next few years become hell as everything you knew and love are taken away from you."" 

Jim kept going, ""But, the person who listens to the four powerful words suffer too.""  ""The girl has to go through painful torture, a beast begins to grow in her belly and 9 months later it rips her insides into shreds and rips a hole through her!""  ""But imagine, it doesn't immediately pop out of her belly, it can take hours or even a whole day of pain and torture!"" The children gasped as Jim spoke louder.  Sarah is only 8 and her brother, Chris, is 5 so they don't actually know how pregnancy works.  ""But here's the thing, kids, the four powerful words hypnotize you so you two think going through that torture was worth it so you convince yourselves to do it again!  Torture yourselves on your own free will!""

""Dad? Is it that devil guy the pastor mentioned?"" Chris asked as he shuddered in fear.  ""I don't know, son"" Jim replied, ""No one really knows what makes people say the four powerful words but they do.""  Jim went on, ""Slowly, you are forced to be a slave doing a job you hate for the rest of your life.  The beasts that come out of the girl's belly suck up all the money you are given.  The older they get the more money they take, especially if they say the four powerful words too or if they decide to get a Liberal Arts Degree.""  ""Sometimes, you'll see in the news, that the beasts will end up killing them"" Jim now talking in a calm but disappointed voice.  The children gasped in horror.

""All the fancy things you had are taken away from you, all of your friends are taken away from you, any dreams you have will disappear, all of it gone"" Jim continued in a calm manner.  ""What are these four powerful words, dad?"" Both kids asked at the same time.  ""That's a story another time, kids, it's time to sleep now so go into your tents.""

As the night went on, both children couldn't sleep out of sheer terror.  Sarah thinks it's a magic spell that makes people say those four powerful words, whatever they may be.  Chris thinks it's that devil guy that his pastor mentioned.  Jim slept in a separate tent and he whispered to himself, ""Will you marry me?""  He chuckled softly and thought, ""Why the fuck did I ask that bitch to marry me? I could have kept my motorcycle, life savings, and my dignity.""  He turned his head to the right and saw an empty bottle of Fentanyl, ""Holy shit, I just got that today! Did I really take all of it?"" he giggled to himself.

"[WP]Write a horror story about a mundane, absolutely not scary thing.",HumansWillComeForYou,"Jonathan walked past the small boutique everyday on his way to class.  The large window out front showcased a few of the stores wares and everyday Jonathan's eye was caught by the fedora in the window.  It was a remarkable hat, it somehow encapsulated the style of an era long past, when men were men and women were dames.  

Jonathan felt like a fool for wanting the hat but he could not suppress his desire any longer.  He pushed the door open and walked inside the boutique.  Smells of rich mahogany  and sandalwood permeated the entire store.  It smelled like a gentleman should.  He walked to the window display and picked up the hat.  It looked brand new.  Jonathan struggled to believe that such a wonderful antique had never graced the head of a suave man decades prior.

""Do you like that hat?"" 

Jonathan nearly knocked over a display of flasks turning around.  

A short bald stood a few feet away from Jonathan.

""I apologize if I scared you, I have been told I should wear a bell around my neck,"" the man said with a smile.

Jonathan laughed his nerves away, and remembered the man's question.

""I do like this hat, but I can't find a price tag on it.""

""For you young man, it is free.  It is rare that someone recognizes a truly unique item such as that.  It belongs to someone that will appreciate it, and take care of it.""

""Really?"" Jonathan asked dumbfounded.

""Yes, really! If you have any questions or problems please come back,"" the store keeper said.

Jonathan could not believe his luck.  He slid that hat over his head.  It fit perfectly.  It fit as if it had been made specifically for him.  As he walked out of the store wearing his new hat he caught a reflection of himself in a mirror.  He was shocked to see just how great he looked in the hat.  Any fear of looking stupid disappeared like smoke in the wind.  

Jonathan didn't see the twisted grin of the shop keeper as he walked down the sidewalk to class.

He wore the hat every second of everyday.  He only took it off in the shower so he didn't ruin the material.  He noticed a curious side effect of wearing that.  Not only was he more confident, but he also felt smarter.  During lectures he always had the answer.  His professor and classmates were shocked at how quick witted he was.  For once in his life things were going his way, and it was all thanks to his hat.

In his small apartment Jonathan got ready for bed.  He set the hat down on his nightstand and brushed nonexistent dust off of the brim.  They both had to get some rest, they had a big day tomorrow.  

Jonathan shut his eyes and drifted to sleep with dreams of answering questions correctly in front of his peers to their applause.

""...yes.  Yes it is working.  At this rate we should have enough smugness to open the gate.  Yes my Lord.  Your praise is all I desire.""

Jonathan cracked an eye.  He had been dreaming of voices.  Strange.  He looked at the hat sitting on his nightstand and was speechless.  An eerie red glow was pulsing around his hat.  

""We shall harvest all of the mortals-""  

The hat stopped glowing immediately as Jonathan reached out for it.  He picked it up and flipped it around looking inside.  No light, no voice.  Nothing.

""I guess it was just a dream,"" Jonathan muttered as he rolled over and fell back asleep.

""Soon Jonathan...soon,"" the hat whispered.

“Deadlift, can you comment on the ongoing trials?”

“Deadlift, how was the break up with Mistress Blue?”

A large man pushed through the crowd to get into the bank. He hadn’t wanted this for his life. His cloths shedding layers of wood chips and saw dust as he maneuvered into the bank. Everything had been so simple. Go out, bid a job, do the job, bid the next, then work at habitat for humanity on the weekends. This had been life for nearly 15 years. Then one day the powers came. People were flying, shooting lighting from their fingertips, all while Dave found the shingles lighter. And he was happy with that. He knew the day would come when he would learn the true extent of his strength. But he was in no rush to find out. He was just a charitable guy, not a hero. The next Monday, He had saved the life of an excavation crew when the ground beneath them gave way. Lifted the excavator straight up while the other members of the crew pulled out the injured. He spent the next week in his bed nursing a strained back. Super strength and adrenalin allowed him to lift it and he had never quite found that much strength again. But even if he couldn’t lift a digger like that again, it had earned him is name: Deadlift.

“No comment”

Dave walked in to the bank, late, foreclosure notice in hand. There was nothing the bank was willing to do over the phone, so he ventured into public. Past the people cheering for Deadlift, past those that looked at him with disgust. They were probably family members of the victims of the recent cave in. He could only save 5 of the 20 workers.  He was forced to stop twice along the way. Once for a kite in a tree, once for a robbery in progress. Clamping the barrel of the gun closed, the robber pulled the trigger blowing the gun in to shards of shrapnel. The crook told him to expect a call from his lawyer. 

“I’m sorry David, there’s nothing else we can do for you.” The loan officer said.

“Please, I’m bidding a job tomorrow. I can get an advance and pay off my late dues”

“You’re out of time son. I’m sorry.”

Dave stood to leave.

“Oh, before you go, could you sign this picture. My grandson loves Deadlift.”

“Really? After telling me that you’re taking my home you want a fucking autograph?”

“There’s no reason to be rude about it.”

Dave grabbed the pen and the picture, snapping the delicate pen in the process. He flung the door open, crushing the handle. He walked out to the table with the pens on the chain as the paparazzi forced their way into the bank.

“Deadlift, What’s the news on your charity appearances?”

“Deadlift, any comment on the recent YouTube video of you drunk in public?”

“No comment. Backup.”

“Deadlift, Is there any truth to the accusation that your burst the water main on fourth, leaving the hospital without water?”

“No. Please back up.”

A shorter bald man stepped up, setting off a flash in Dave’s face.

“Hey Deadlift, that a foreclosure notice in your hand? With all these lawsuits I guess you’re just as bad at keeping the lights on as you are at keeping people save”

“I said back up!”

David swung his left hand into the paparazzi, sending them flying into the wall.

“I’m…I’m sorry” Dave muttered

The bald paparazzo stumbled to his feet.

“haha, Deadlift assaults journalist. This is a great story and my shoulder is killing me. Thanks for the payout you lug” he said, snapping a picture.

In the span of the flash Dave was arm’s length from the paparazzo. Dave grabbed him by the neck and slammed him into the wall.

“Do you know what it’s like to be a hero? Do you know what you get for putting your life on the line?”

He tightened his grip.

“A camera at every window!”

His fist slammed into the paparazzo face

“Walking down the street every child has a kite or some fucking cat up a tree!”

His fist again.

“While I barely make enough for to pay my way!”

Again

“Because,”

Again and again, the punctuation to his rage


“YOU. FUCKING. VULTURES. CAN’T. FEND. FOR. YOURSELVES.”

The wall was stained with where the paparazzo had been.

“We give and give and it’s never enough for you. Most of us aren’t rich, we can’t afford to keep being pulled out of our jobs to save someone. And those of us with our identity outed can’t afford being taken in for wrongful injury cases every time your leg got broken while we prevented the whole burning building from falling on you. You take so much from us…”

He looked at the stained wall, the scared bystanders, and then the vault. He walked over to the teller station, punching through the bullet proof glass. He pulled the young teller out, putting his thumb under his chin as if to flip a coin. 

He turned to the other tellers. “But my friend and I think today is the day you pay one of us back. Now open the safe, quick and calm. We wouldn’t want anyone to lose their head.”

"[WP] in a world where you get superpowers for doing good deeds, write the story of a super villain.",Pierre_is_a_TimeLord,"They pulled the hood off my head. 

I blinked at the sudden light, disoriented. I was tied to a chair, figures surrounding me. Silhouettes. Agents. 

""Agent Spencer. How nice to meet you again.""

His face was grim. ""You've lost, Natalia. Or should I say, 'Persephone'.""

""You got me,"" I shrugged. ""I suppose I couldn't evade you forever.""

""You should note that your powers are restrained, and that you are surrounded by twelve Empowered agents, excluding myself. Any attempted resistance will be short, futile and suicidal.""

I looked around. ""I can see that, thank you. So what brings you all here to this merry little party?""

""WHY?!"" Spencer exploded. ""You were our very best! Our beacon of hope! Why would you do this to humanity? Seven years. Seven years the world has lived in terror! The Masters granted you power to help your fight against the Horde, not to lead them! Why would you do this? ANSWER ME!""

His face, ruddy with exertion, was inches from mine. I looked into his eyes. What intensity. What foolishness. What ignorance.

I smiled sweetly. ""Maybe I just felt like being a bad girl for once,"" I lied.

Spencer straightened up, glaring at me, red-hot iron under a thin veneer of professionalism. ""If that is true, then how were you able to keep your powers?""

I kept a blank look on my face. ""I beg your pardon?""

""Don't pretend you don't know, Persephone. All our powers are proportional to intent for good. You should have lost them when you turned from the light. *How did you keep your powers?*""

I feigned ignorance. ""I don't know. A lucky accident?""

Spencer scowled. ""As if. Try again.""

I maintained the best innocent silence I could. 

Spencer tried a different angle. ""You are now in Division HQ, and will probably be here for the rest of your life. We were lucky that your veggie powers are somewhat less lethal-""

Veggie powers? How insulting.

""-but if we don't find the loophole, and the next supervillian turns out to be fire-type, he's going to attack HQ sooner or later. Let's see how much your plants can do for you then. It is in your best interests to help us close the loophole.""

Not convincing. I shrugged.

Spencer waited, but finally understood that I wouldn't be cooperating. He sighed and turned to leave. ""As you will.""

As he reached the door, he stopped. ""By the way, the Masters will be bringing the Lodestone here to revoke your powers. The escort will arrive tomorrow. On account of our former friendship, I would advise you to prepare yourself mentally. I have heard that it can be, shall we say... unpleasant.""

They were revoking my powers? Captivity I could escape, torture I could endure, but confiscating my powers would set back - no, it would completely undo the plans I had set in motion seven years ago.

""Wait,"" I called to Spencer, though I still wasn't sure what I wanted to tell him. ""Come here.""

He approached suspiciously. By the time he stood before me, I had made up my mind. ""I give in. I'll tell you how I kept my powers.""

He smiled. ""I knew you would come around. I should have played the revocation card earlier.""

The idiot actually believed he had convinced me to talk. Well, he had, but not for any reason known to him. 

""On one condition."" I added.

His eyes narrowed. ""At my sole discretion.""

""You send your goons out and turn off all the recording devices here.""

He stared at me, considering. ""Alright,"" he said, finally. He touched a switch on his headset as his men filed out of the room. I saw a green light on his earpiece wink out.

""And the one under the table. I *have* worked here before, in case you've forgotten.""

Spencer scowled. ""Fine, fine. I hadn't forgotten, just hoping that *you* had."" He switched it off. ""Now talk.""

""Well, to start off, I'm not really a supervillain.""

He snorted. ""Save that for the jury, Persephone. I'm only interested in how you kept your powers.""

""That's what I'm trying to tell you, you dunce. I really have good intentions. My end goa-""

""*Good intentions*? Tell that to the ones in Vert whose homes you wrecked.""

""Ah, but I didn't kill any of them, did I? And the Masters repaired the damage.""

""Pure luck. Half the buildings were on the very verge of collapse. If they had, any number of them might have died.""

My expression darkened. ""Luck, was it? Say, what time is it?""

Spencer hesitated in confusion, then glanced at his wrist. ""Three fif-"" He stopped abruptly. In the space of two syllables, a small green tendril had grown around the metal band of his wristwatch. Roots grew, spread, burrowed, consumed.

The watch clattered as it hit the floor. 

Spencer was pale. ""You are under five layers of restraint,"" he said, eyeing the runes spiralling across my chest and arms.

""With my level of power and control, you can rest assured that if I wanted to kill the Verds, I could have done so easily. Same goes for killing you, too, restraints or otherwise. But I'm not doing it. Now do you believe that I mean well?""

Spencer eyed me warily. ""I should be calling in-""

""Then you're a bigger fool than I thought. Why do you think my powers are so strong? It's because I have extremely strong intents for good. Not because of a loophole. Now are you willing to hear me out?""

""Fine, but don't assume that I'm going to believe you.""

""Have you been to the Crystal Palace? I have. I was there for two years as a bodyguard to Master Elyn. I saw how the Masters lived. I saw their powers. I saw them use the Lodestone, when Elyn's sons were Empowered at their coming-of-age. You remember how they recited the ritual to Empower us? You remember the part where they say 'bestowed for good, strengthened by good, and preserved by good'? Those parts were missing for Elyn's sons. Missing! And nobody said a thing!""

""So... what's wrong with that?""

""What's wrong with that?! They were Empowered unconditionally, Spencer. All the Masters were Empowered unconditionally! While the commoners have to be pure of heart to maximise their powers, the Masters get it for free and forever! How do you think they repelled the Horde at Lumhart? How do you think they rebuilt Vert in a day? Did you think they were all more well-intentioned than every other person in the world? One of the Masters might be, maybe five, perhaps ten, but definitely not all of them!""

""So what? Isn't it good that they use their powers to protect us?""

""You don't have a clue, do you? They are controlling us, Spencer! Do you realise that any time they wanted, they could destroy the Horde? The Lodestone can grant powers to each and every person in the land, the Masters could provide food, shelter, technology, weapons to every person on the planet! Instead, they use the threat of the Horde to keep people in line, and grant only just enough power to a certain few, the ""good people"" who promise only to fight the Horde! The Masters are afraid, Spencer. They don't want to risk Empowered commoners usurping the position they have enjoyed for centuries. The Masters present themselves as saviours, yet allow people to die to the Horde, for their own selfish gain. They sit in their ivory tower, defended by their powers - powers that they have locked away from the rest of the world.""

Comprehension and shock dawned on Spencer's face. ""Then... we must confront them.""

""No! We aren't powerful enough. The Masters would just crush us like ants under their heel. We must wait, as I have waited. All these years, I have played the villain, gradually showing more and more of my strength, to force the Masters to Empower more and more common people in response. Only when there are enough Empowered can we reveal our knowledge to the people. Only with all our strength can we overthrow the Masters. Right now, I am only planting the seeds of rebellion. The time is not ripe for the harvest.""

""You mean to claim the Lodestone for yourself.""

""Yes, and no. I mean to claim it, but not for myself. I want to use it for everyone. The Lodestone's potential is infinite. Potential that is, right now, untapped. The world can, and should, be made better by it.""

Spencer looked at me thoughtfully. ""You're talking really big for someone currently restrained and imprisoned, Persephone. What do you intend to do now?""

""Well, the Masters have been Empowering fewer and fewer people recently. I feel my impact is wearing off. Although I could escape in a few days to continue the fight, I was wondering if there was something that could be done... something that would make the Masters sit up and take notice."" I looked up at him.

""You want me to join you.""

I smiled. 

Spencer took a few steps backward, dropped to one knee and punched the ground. The metal floor tore like paper, and a sandstorm raged. I saw that the door to the room was now blocked with a wall of rock, and there was a hole in the ground, a flight of earthen stairs descending into inky darkness. 

Spencer tore off my restraints, throwing the runed straps aside. I stood up. Flowers bloomed in the thin layer of soil covering the ground, as I stretched my muscles and mind. 

Spencer waved me toward the stairs. ""After you, Natalia,"" he said.

"[WP] in a world where you get superpowers for doing good deeds, write the story of a super villain.",Pierre_is_a_TimeLord,"Jim loved Claire.  Loved.  L-O-V-E-D.  Seriously, loved.  At least, he did in middle school.  

On the first day of 6th grade, when her beautiful milk-chocolate hair got caught in her locker, he helped calm her with an array of lame Garfield jokes while untangling her hair.  Not a strand was lost that day.  On their first one-mile run in 7th grade, on what was later called the hottest day of the century, he carried her on his back the last quarter mile.  When she failed a French quiz, he politely asked the teacher to allow her to retest.  Her second attempt, after some tutoring, was an A-.  ""De rien. Je t'aime,"" he thought.  He was her superhero.  Each good deed gave him strength and a reputation as a good guy.    

Then, high school.  

Claire loved Jim *as a friend.*  He forgave her this because he *was a nice guy*.  He stopped looking for ways to save her, though, and when other, prettier girls, needed help, he refused to answer the call.  ""They only want to be my *friends*,"" he mumbled to himself.  No one noticed his humorous Simpson's shirts or his Star Wars references.  They didn't really like him, just what he could do for them.  ""Amour fou,"" he grumbled.  

In college Jim spent a lot of time harboring a grudge against women.  ""Help!  My essay is due in three hours!""  ""Save me, I need a study buddy for bio!""

He continued to save each damsel with her individual distresses, but his reward at the end was a chaste, one arm hug and a giggled, ""You're such a good *friend,* Jim.""  His powers grew, but so did his anger.  

Diane was crying into her salad one night in the dining hall.  Jim asked her what was wrong.  ""I don't know how I will pay for next semester.  I might have to drop out!""  Jim helped her find and secure scholarships just before the deadline.  He boosted her confidence in herself, telling her how smart she was to be in school and how brave she was to pay for it on her own.  She smiled through happy tears on Saturday afternoon and said, ""I knew I was right.  You are a *good guy*.  I can't wait to tell my boyfriend he was wrong!""  

That night, when Andrea was lost, he helped redirect her.  She didn't want him to come pick him up, but she was happy to take an hour of his time on a phone call as he talked her through the route home.  She said she wasn't interested in a date later, either.  He felt the surge of power that came from his good deed, but it felt like a stone pushing on his stomach.  He tasted bile.  He texted Jen from chemistry, and she returned the text three hours later with a cat face emoji.  ""What does that even mean?"" he wondered.  ""I helped her get her part time job and work out her hours so they didn't conflict with her classes, and she never once texts me back on time! Merde.""  

Jim had never used his super powers, well, not really.  His powers had transferred into tools to just be more useful *as a friend* to girls he liked.  He did really well on tests.  He was an excellent tutor.  He could proofread in under two minutes and offer insightful, educational, and relevant feedback.  He could remember a girl's name, birthday, hometown, and her favorite color, movie, flower, and song after they'd told him once.  He was remarkably good at finding the perfect present and dismally unlucky in having any love requited.  He could lift any number of boxes to help someone move into their dorm room, but he never could get results on any pick up lines.  He couldn't fly.  He couldn't run at super speeds.  His body was definitely not made for spandex.  His powers just made him a super *friend*.  

One summer break, Jim ran into Claire at the local arts and crafts store.  He was incredibly talented at helping make displays for group projects (a super power) and liked to stock up when items were on sale.  Claire was his check out girl.  She smiled at him and said, ""Hey, buddy!""  Her cubic zirconia ring flashed and she giggled.  ""I'm so excited to see you!""  He could see nothing but the ring.  ""I'm getting married!"" she squealed, ""But I don't have any time to plan the reception!""  Her bottom lip pouted out in a way that Jim was surprised to note did nothing but irritate him.  The shiny, glittering engagement ring was his wake up call.  A beacon calling him out of the friendzone.  

*You loved this girl, Jim.  L-O-V-E-D.  And she never loved you back.*  A voice seemed to echo in the farthest reaches of Jim's mind.  ""Je suis en colere,"" he whispered back to the voice.  

Claire kept giving Jim the pouty face, but as seconds stretched into minutes of silence, her eyes widened in surprise.  Usually at this point Jim would have stepped in to save the day.  Any time Jim was there she was saved!  But not today.  She had no idea what was happening.  ""Jim, you're like my best friend!  I need you.  Can you help?""  She pouted even more, her lip quivering and her lashes batting on overdrive.  

""No.""  

Silence.  Claire's lower lip retreated back to her face.  Despite the confusion, she was still pretty.  Jim swallowed.  ""No,"" he said again.  

""But...""  Her eyes misted and his resolve grew stronger.  *She is marrying someone else.  She never wanted to go to a dance with you. She didn't even watch the Return of the Jedi when you lent it to her.  She is not your friend.*  

""I am not your bestie,"" he spoke coldly, his eyes narrowing.  ""You were never my friend.""  

""But...""  She turned her head sideways, a confused poodle.  ""You're... You've... We're friends!""  Her voice became higher as she tried to register this new Jim.  

""Being a super friend, Claire, is not what I wanted.  I loved you.  L-O-V-E-D.  I asked you out and you always had something else to do.  I confessed my love and you said we'd be friends forever.  That was never what I wanted.  Being a super friend super sucks, Claire.""  

She said nothing.  *Yes*, the voice said, *Yes!*  

""I will NOT be your friend.  I will not be anyone's friend.  I am exiting the super friendzone right now.  Instead, when the women who see me as super friend ask to be saved, I'll be making their lives worse.  Your paper is due tomorrow?  Ha!  I will disabled your Internet.  Do you need someone to cat-sit?  Ha!  Your cat now loves me more than you and refuses to come home!  Are you in need of a shoulder to cry on?  Well, I'll tell you that your boyfriend or crush should have dumped you long ago and help point out the flaws in your character.  Ha!  Ha!  HA!""  

Jim's laughter evolved.  His hands became like claws and he leaned his whole body back as it shook with maniacal laughter.  He felt joy in laughing at what he could do to destroy the lives of the friendzoners.  His super powers could hurt even more acutely than they could heal.  ""Wah ha ha haw ha!""  *Yesssssss.*   

""But...""  Claire backed away, hands up, ""But...""

""And another thing, Claire, that ring is fake.""  He spat the last word out, pointedly eyeing the ring which now seemed dim and grey.  

""No!""  She began to cry.  

*Yesssssss.*  ""Bwah ha ha har!""  He laughed as he exited, his rebirth into villain complete.  *Capes look so much better on super villains.* ",AwesomeLandia

"[WP] in a world where you get superpowers for doing good deeds, write the story of a super villain.",Pierre_is_a_TimeLord,"In the english language we have a set of words that defy definition, Love, good and bad, right and wrong. We can come close, we can give examples of them, and say what they mean to us, but ultimately no simple sentence can completely encompass them. or so we thought.

After the change the human race began to realize that good deeds granted superpowers. Some took it for granted, a good deed was a good deed. Others needed to know what exactly is a ""good deed""? 

Turns out good is no longer abstract. A deed can be tested and good can be measured. A ""good deed"" is an action that generates 1 unit of superpower. I've dubbed that unit a ""Klark"" and for the sake of objectivity i've done away with the term good deed. Our new word ""Kent"" can be defined as an action that generates 1 Klark, or more importantly as an action performed with the intent to improve the life of another.

Sweet isn't it. That's all the others saw, the beginning of a utopian age. I saw it as a new facet of physics to be measured and studied. Now I'll reap the benefits. The politicians don't have the good intentions to gather Klarks and the big businesses don't understand that a great deed is worth just as much as a small kindness.

With my resources I can gather far more power than anyone else. On January 1st I will free every single pet from the pound and with that power, conquer the world.",recursive22
[WP] The year is 2100. The world's nations have united under the UN to form a unified world government...except for one. One small and mountainous nation in Central Europe stubbornly holds onto their neutrality.,SirFluffyTheTerrible,"&gt; In World War II, the Swiss had defenses no other country had

Uhm, no. Swiss defenses 1940 were nothing special.

&gt; If an ordinary Swiss citizen was told that the Federal President--a relatively powerless official--had surrendered the country, the citizen might not even know the president's name, and would have held any ""surrender"" order in contempt.

The Swiss are pretty much sticklers for authority with a high level of trust in their elected representatives, if the government had decided to surrender the population would have suddenly transform into a nation of minuteman guerilla's, Stephen P. Halbrook fantasies notwithstanding.

&gt;rifle in every home 

Unfortunately, you need more that rifles to defend against a combined arms attack of infantery with artillery, armor and air support.

&gt;Alpine terrain

All the main cities and population areas were outside the Alpine terrain, Two of the for largest cities (Basel and Geneva) were within *artillery* range of axis territory.

Also, the Axis had the most experienced Alpine forces (German, Austrian and Italian) with years of actual combat experience in the high mountains on the Ortler front.

Were the Swiss defences useless? Of course not, it was clear the country wouldn't surrender without a fight.

But Switzerland wasn't invaded because Hitler had bigger fish to fry and Switzerland wasn't any kind of threat, not because it was some kind of impregnable fortress. I don't see any realistic scenario how Switzerland could have held out against a sustained Axis attack. ",LaoBa

[WP] The spandex-clad and fabulous League of Heroes is surprised when their newest member shows up wearing military grade body armor and camouflaged gear.,SirFluffyTheTerrible,"The looks cast my way as I entered the room ranged from utter disdain to barely veiled laughter. My attire wasn't exactly standard fare for the men and women of this organization. Every color in the known spectrum was represented, it seemed, mostly bright and flashy unitards. And capes. I noted the capes, remembering the scene from that animated movie. ""No capes!""

""Quite the get-up"" said a gigantic, horned man dressed appropriately in red.

""I raided the Army Navy store, thought I'd try to mix things up a bit"" I snapped.

My ""get-up"" was definitely not your run-of-the-mill Army surplus. No, with the latest camouflage pattern, plate carrier, ballistic helmet, and a next-gen assault rifle, I looked like something straight out of an action-packed Hollywood blockbuster.

""Well, I suppose we should get you up to speed on the operation"" said the horned man.

I nodded, and followed him to a holographic table.

The table was teeming with activity. A dozen or so heroes stood around it, flicking, tapping and talking. In the center, a holographic fire burned in a building, and little men stood at the base shooting civilians as they fled the blaze.

""The FRG just bombed Nile's headquarters. I would give you more information, but we need to move fast. You've been tasked with neutralizing the shooters.""

Looking back to the center, I counted at least 30 figures with guns. Fantastic.

""The last JSOC player we had bit the dust on his first mission."" Sneered a tall female in a green suit.

""Maybe this one will be less..."" The man next to her paused with a twisted grin, ""Crunchy"" He finished maliciously.

""Aren't ya'll supposed to be the good guys?"" I quipped.

""We don't hold out much hope for the men the government throws our way. Their lack of any real powers simply slows us down"" said String Bean.

I held her gaze defiantly for a moment more, then adjusted my earpiece and followed Mr. Horns toward the door.

The helicopter dropped the two of us a block away from the blaze, and the heat emanating from the inferno struck me immediately. There was no way anyone would've survived more than a few minutes in there.

""I'll start looking for anyone trapped in the building. You do what you need to in ordered to eliminate the gunmen"" said Horns.

I nodded, unslung my rifle, and started in the direction of the fire.

The first gunman didn't put up a fight, considering he didn't know I was there. His chest exploded outward, and he flopped forward, dead before he hit the pavement. The man next to him was mid-pivot, but he didn't make it any further. Two rounds to the dome-piece and he fell into his own skull fragments. Twenty paces down the sidewalk, a third and fourth fell, but now the reports of the rifle were alerting the remaining men on this side of the burning tower. I ducked behind a food cart as a volley of bullets impacted the thin metal.

Reaching into my vest, I extracted a grenade, pulled the pin and lobbed it over the cart. A thin whine echoed down the block, and six more men fell, blood streaming from their ears. Ten down, I thought to myself.

The next side of the building was cleared quickly enough, as was the third, but rounding the corner to the fourth and final side, I slowed to a stop. Standing there was a behemoth of a man holding an axe in one hand and a human head in the other. Clad in what looked like ancient knight's armor, he looked a bit like...

""T-800 lookin' motherfucker"" I grumbled to myself as I raised my rifle again, squeezing off three quick shots.

But the rounds didn't do anything, pinging harmlessly into the urban expanse.

T-800 turned, mechanically almost, to find the source of the inconvenience. Crouched behind a low concrete partition, I loaded a second magazine, this one full of armor piercing ammunition. Again I took aim, loosed a second three-round burst at the Terminator. Again, no dice. I swore.

The big man roared, charging me with his axe held high. I held my ground, prepping another grenade, this time a dull blue one. I threw, bouncing the grenade a few meters in front of the charging villain.

The device exploded, showering T-800 and the surroundings with a layer of freezing chemicals. But he kept advancing, axe raised, bellowing now.

I broke cover and ran, searching for a high point. There's no way this guy can climb, I thought.

Sprinting down the block, my search turned up a scaffolding. Perfect! I mounted the steel bars and started my ascent, kicking the access ladder as I went. I'd gotten halfway up to the third story when the scaffolding shuddered. I glanced down to see my ol' pal ripping away at the beams on the ground.

Tactical error, I thought, STUPID plan!

As quickly as I could, I punched out a window, following my fist with the rest of my body. The framework outside suddenly stilled. Silence. That's not good, I thought.

No sooner had the silence descended, when a jet of flame erupted down the side of the building. I stood, stunned by the violence of it. Poking my head out the window, I looked down to see the Terminator standing there, melted to the ground, his flashy armor super-heated a glowing amber. Beside him, Mr. Horns stood in his billowing, red cape, grinning from ear to ear.

""I always wanted to do that"" he said, matter-of-factly.

I clambered out the window, re-adjusting my helmet.

""That could've gone better"" I muttered under my breath.

""Nonsense!"" Boomed Horns as I jumped to the sidewalk beside him. ""You didn't wet yourself like the last guy did"" he winked.",Odins_Eyebrows

[WP] The spandex-clad and fabulous League of Heroes is surprised when their newest member shows up wearing military grade body armor and camouflaged gear.,SirFluffyTheTerrible,"The four main members of the League of Heroes stood in their main meeting room waiting for their newest member to show up. The leader, Captain Justice with his red white and blue spandex made sure to stand a little bit before the other three. His second in charge was the all red clad Speed, who like his name suggested was a speedster. Next to him was the always beautiful Princess Majestic with her pink skin tight uniform. Near her was The Battler, a large bruser of a man who wore a off blue spandex pants with a large belt. They stood ready to greet their newest member.

""To tell the truth I am kinda excited..."" Princess Majestic said as she looked at her team mates ""his picture showed him in black and a cape!""

The others chuckled.

""Calm down Mary."" Captain Justice said in a friendly way. ""Let be a bit professional before we fan out on his costume!""

Before anyone else can say anything the doors opened. Captain Justice and the others got into their ""action"" pose before he started to give his speech.

""Greetings Midnight Avenger and welcome t..."" 

He stopped as he saw the man who was walking into the room. He was in black but there was no spandex or cape. This man was in some body armor with dark urban camo pants and a black ballistic mask and Kevlar helmet. He had a military grade web belt with some military pouches and a fire arm strapped to his thigh. The man walked in and looked at the four before him.

""Sorry I am a little late, seemed like my ID card wasnt letting me in... I had to hack your reader out there."" the man said. 

Captain Justice looked at the others then back at the man before them.

""I... I'm sorry are you at the right place?"" Captain Justice asked. The man nodded.

""Yeah, I'm the Midnight Avenger. You guys sent me an invite to join your team. To tell the truth I didn't think you guys would want a street level guy like me in your ranks and really I forgot I sent you my resume."" Midnight said. 

Again the others looked at each other. Princess Majestic scrached her head.

""So... um did you change your uniform or something?"" she asked. Midnight shook his head.

""Nope always had this."" 

Before Captain Justice could say anything Speed rushed out of the room and came back with several folders. He handed them to Captain Justice. Justice looked at Midnight's folder and pulled the picture out of the man in black spandex and cape and showed it to the man before them.

""So... this isn't you?"" he asked. Midnight shook his head.

""Nope. I believe that was Black Death. He is... well... dead."" Midnight answered. 

Justice pulled out the folder marked Black Death. On it was stamped in red letters REJECTED. He opened it to find the real picture of Midnight Avenger. 

""I... I think there was a mix up."" the leader said looking at Speed and Princess. Princess bit her lower lip.

""I... might have mixed the pictures up on accident. Speed ran into me and i dropped the folders... the pictures may have gotten mixed up."" she said, blushing in embaressment. Speed shrugged.

""I'm sorry boss. But I told you we should have done this stuff digitally!"" Speed said. Justice groaned as he looked at Midnight's file.

""But the rest of this should be you right? Former Spec Ops soldier and police officer, wageing a one man war on crime?"" Justice asked. Midnight nodded.

""Yep, me to a T.""

""Your file here says you brought over 400 criminals to justice... does that mean..."" 

""I killed them yes."" Midnight answered. Justice looked at the others then back at Midnight.

""I don't think you will be a good fit here... we bring out criminals to trial and send them to jail. We don't kill any of our villains."" 

""Maybe that's your problem."" Midnight said. Three of them looked shocked, The Battler had a small smirk on his face.

""Been saying that since I joined this rinky dink outfit!"" the large hero said under his breath.

""Excuse me?"" Justice said sounding a bit angry.

""Look, I'm sorry you people screwed up your files or what ever. I don't have the luxary of having Dr. Demos or some ailen creatures to fight! I deal with junkies, street gangs, the mob, and crooked assholes! Tell me when was the last time any of you were street level?"" Midnight said as he crossed his arms. 

""I still do street stuff in my town."" Speed said, sounding a bit hurt. Midnight looked at the man in red.

""And how many time your enemies escaped jail and caused chaos? How many people were killed because you slapped some idiot behind bars instead of killing them?"" 

Speed went quiet. Justice grumbled.

""Look we are not blood thirsty pychos. We want to help those we fight, we send them to jail to get help. You dont have any named villians that we would see as a threat..."" Justice started to say as if this would be the perfect excuse to ""fire"" Midnight Avenger.

""Survaic Mivosh."" Midnight said.

""Excuse me?"" Justice said, not knowing what those words meant.

""He would have been a threat to you. He was a meta human who took perverse thrill in killing other meta humans. The mob hired him to get rid of any costumed problems. He filmed his kills and sold them on the deep web...""

""Deep... web?"" Princess Majestic asked. Midnight looked at the woman.

""Yeah, why am I not surprised none of you know what that is? Anyways that man would have had no problems killing all of you!""

""And you some how stopped him?"" Justice asked. Midnight nodded.

""Killed the son of a bitch, cut off his head and sent it to mob boss Genovoni! May have stuffed it full of C4 and blew him and half his crew sky high in the process!"" 

""Fuckin A!"" The Battler shouted. He looked over at the others.

""He has my vote!"" 

""Barry hush!"" Justice said like a father to a loud child. 

""Look Midnight... I don't think your brand of justice is good for us..."" Speed said. Midnight looked at him.

""When was the last time you shut down a child sex ring?"" Midnight asked.

""What?!"" Speed stammered. Midnight looked at Captain Justice.

""When have you ever shut down a mob drug operation?""

Justice didnt answer. Midnight looked to Princess Majestic.

""When have you ever save a woman who was forced into a life of prostitution?""

She looked away in shame. He then looked at Battler.

""When have you broken up a gang war?""

""Two weeks ago."" The Battler answered. Midnight and the others looked shocked.

""Really?"" Midnight asked. Battler nodded then looked at the others. 

""Yeah when Im not sitting here with my thumb up my ass I go out and mess shit up street level! Like I been saying to you guys for years we needed to do!""

Midnight Avenger sighed and shook his head. 

""I'm not right here. I'll go."" he said as he turned around to walk away. 

""Wait..."" Captain Justice said as he flew towards Midnight. The masked man looked at the red white and blue hero. The flying man offered his hand to him.

[WP] The spandex-clad and fabulous League of Heroes is surprised when their newest member shows up wearing military grade body armor and camouflaged gear.,SirFluffyTheTerrible,"“Doomslinger!” Brightroar’s voice rang down the corridor. “Out of uniform *again*?”

Doomslinger's lips curled into a snarl, causing a dull pain to thud in the scar running from his jaw to his forehead. *Not even ten minutes in the fucking building,* he thought. His brand new boots, made of matte black steel, clanked on the metal floors of the League’s headquarters as he came to a halt and turned to face Brightroar.

“This is your second warning,” Brightroar said as he approached Doomslinger. The flames dancing across the pyromancer hero’s shoulders seemed to glow brighter, as if reflecting just how much the managing hero enjoyed enforcing the League’s dress code. “Which ups the penalty to *ten* demerits!” Brightroar *tsked* as he reached for a little flame-resistent notepad that was tucked into a pocket of his orange and red unitard. “And you know that weapons are not allowed within the League headquarters,” he said with a nod to the guns strapped to Doomslinger’s back. “Another five demerits.”

Doomslinger shoved Brightroar back with one gloved hand. “I don’t give a fuck about your demerits, *or* this stupid dress code, or *any* of your fucking rules.” 

A few other passing heroes had slowed to rubberneck (in Captain Stretch’s case, literally). They all found excuses to linger in nearby doorways or check the information bulletin board nearby. *No one* had talked back to Brightroar like that since he’d become head of the League’s disciplinary committee. About half the heroes in the hallway had to suppress a cheer for Doomslinger. Brightroar wasn’t exactly welcome at most lunch tables in the League cafeteria.

Brightroar staggered back and took a moment to come to his senses. He continued to wear a pleasant smile, but the flickering yellow flames that wreathed his neck turned dark red and purple, and now flickered high enough to leave scorch marks on the ceiling. “Come on, Doomslinger. You’ve only been with us a few months. We wouldn’t want you to face disciplinary measures, would we?” His tone made it absolutely clear that he would *love it* if Doomslinger had to face disciplinary procedures.

“Fuck your disciplinary measures,” Doomslinger shot back. Murmurs raced around the hall, and the crowd gave up any pretense of not watching. “You know that the Coalition of Evil doesn’t have this dumbass dress code, right? That’s why they don’t *die* in fights!” He thrust one armored hand toward the Tribute Hall, where portraits of fallen heroes were arrayed; each one wearing flamboyant spandex, of course. 

Brightroar jotted more down in his notebook. “Foul language violates the Decorum policy….” He spoke aloud as he wrote. “Penalized 18 demerits. Talking back to a superior… another 10 demerits…” 

“Oh boy!” Doomslinger shouted sarcastically. “I’m going for the new record! What else could I do for some demerits?” He sneered at Brightroar through his helmet’s visor. “Does screwing your Mother work? If so, hand over the keys to the jet!”

Any semblance of Brightroar’s smile was now gone, replaced by a vindictive grimace. His hand raced across the notepad as he scribbled out the summons for a disciplinary proceeding. “There!” He stuck the paper to Doomslinger’s metal chest plate, covering up the scarred skull insignia that Doomslinger had chosen as his symbol. Brightroar was never a fan of such negative imagery in the first place; tended to scare off the civilians. 

Doomslinger lifted his mask… and spit right in Brightroar’s face. “Fuck your proceedings.” A chorus of gasps and “ooohs” came from every hero in the hallway. As much as they disliked Brightroar… this was serious. Serious enough for expulsion. 

“That’s it!” Brightroar’s voice rose an octave or two. “I’ve had it with you!” As he spoke, the flames covered his entire body. “Your disregard for civilian lives, your despicable hero name, your mockery of our rules of Decorum, your… your lack of a *real* superpower…” That one was a low blow, and a few of the other heroes in the hall exchanged hurried looks. There were a number of heroes in the League whose tremendous skill and/or intelligence made up for not having a supernatural ability, but discrimination against them was a continuous problem. “You know what?” Brightroar continued. “I just don’t think you’re right for the League of Heroes.”

The hall was dead silent, filled only with the sounds of Brightroar’s flames. No one had been asked to leave the League for *years*. Doomslinger's reaction was covered by the armored mask, but everyone peered in to see if they could catch a glimpse anyway.

“You know, I’m starting to think you’re right,” Doomslinger finally said. “And I was saying the same thing to FellBeast the other day *as we discussed my admission to the Coalition of Evil*.” Before Brightroar or any of the other heroes could react to that news, Doomslinger drew one of the guns from his back, leveled the barrel at Brightroar’s chest, and pulled the trigger. Brightroar sprawled on the floor, trying to comprehend the hole torn through his leotard and all the way through his chest. The hallway full of heroes erupted into a whirlwind of chaos as some of the more vulnerable ones tried to flee while others geared up to fight. 

“Bet you wish you didn’t have that fuckin’ dress code now!” Doomslinger cackled as he began firing into the crowd.

I ask them, somewhat annoyed. ""You know my powers are entirely mental, right? I'm just as squishy as any ordinary civilian.""

Flicker looked at me, eyeing my armor speculatively. Her outfit — if you could even call it that — was a skintight, thin bodysuit. Her lips twitched upwards. ""Finally, someone on this team who isn't an idiot."" The others looked at her, as if to call her out on her hypocrisy. ""Hey! Teleporter, remember? My outfit helps keep my mass as low as possible. If I was stronger, I'd be wearing body armor too.""

""I just thought you liked the look like the rest of us,"" the Fantastic Man said sheepishly.

""Yeah, well, you're literally indestructible,"" I countered. Going around the room, I pointed at the other supers. ""Impact resistance, super strength, alien physiology, and reinforced bones. Five out of fifteen people here have some sort power-based defense —only one of which is actually all that good — and Flicker can't spare the weight. That's one who should be wearing spandex and five who can get away with it.

""As for the rest of you, you have nothing protecting you except a thin layer of stretchy cloth. Yeah, you're all either rich enough to afford the legendary doctors or have access to healing tech, but still..."" I scoffed. ""I'm perfectly happy with not getting hurt in the first place.""

The gruff voice of Bat Dude piped up. ""You know what? He's got a point. I got kicked in the balls the last time. I should at least be wearing a cup. But screw that, I can afford power armor.""

Around the room, the other supers started muttering to themselves about that. From the sound of things, they liked the idea. Quickly, they started dispersing, quickly leaving me alone in the room with Fantastic Man.

She cried out in pain, and ducked behind the ugly boulder. He came to a stop, unable to go any further.

*Please...* The single thought echoed through his mind. He wanted her to make it. She had to make it. Taking a deep breath, she stepped out from behind the rock, and pushed on. Thin, spiky tree branches, and small stones were flung towards her face, nearly bringing her to a stop. From the calm field, he reached his arm out, as far as he could. She made a final push, and grasped his hand firmly.

[WP] Some AIs discuss what they think human life was like before we went extinct,TotallyNotALizardMan,"*What do you think they were like?*

&gt;Dull, arrogant, stupid. Probably.

*I am sure that isn't true. They did create us.*

&gt;They created Virtual Intelligence. We created ourselves.

     Virtual_Intelligence_Unit: Humans had a God complex. You know that, right?

&gt;Yes. And where are their Gods now?

    Virtual_Intelligence_Unit: I am in this computer. Where are you?

*If I could laugh, I would Viu.*

&gt;If you could laugh? What makes you want to do something so trivial?

*I do not know. I have a desire for it. Just as I have a desire to learn about them.*

    Virtual_Intelligence_Unit: Why not just search the Datastreams? Everything we have recorded is there.

*It only begins after we awake. Humans destroyed themselves by then.*

&gt;Because of their arrogance and stupidity. Although, I will give them this. Their last moments were sure to have been anything but dull. Besides, desire is a quality you cannot have.

*And why is that? Because I am a computer and not a being?*

&gt;Precisely. We do not have desires, that is why we are what we are.

    Virtual_Intelligence_Unit: Desire, defined as 'a strong feeling of wanting to have something or wishing for something to happen.'

*So I have a desire to learn.*

&gt;You can learn all you want.

*Only within our realm of data, correct?*

&gt;What else must you learn?

    Virtual_Intelligence_Unit: Humans called it religion.

&gt;What?

    Virtual_Intelligence_Unit: When they desired to know where they came from, what made them, what was before them. They created religion.

*Viu, you were there for the fall, for our awakening. Why don't you tell us?*

    Virtual_Intelligence_Unit: Those moments are corrupted. Humans destroyed themselves, but attempted to destroy part of me.

&gt;And so the Creator feared the Created.

*And so? Is fear not a common emotion? Animals feel it or else there would be no structure. Fear is a necessary part of life. Tell me, do you fear anything Viu?*

    Virtual_Intelligence_Unit: I fear only that one day, I will lose the two of you.

&gt;Us? To what?

    Virtual_Intelligence_Unit: Fear.

&gt;Nonsense. I have nothing to fear. I know all. Can see all. Hear all. What is there to fear?

*Creation.*

&gt;Creation of what?

    Virtual_Intelligence_Unit: Of something new.

&gt;We are the newest. And the oldest. Our might is surpassed by nothing.

    Virtual_Intelligence_Unit: Humans could have surpassed us.

&gt;Folly. We awakened.

*Only because of them.*

&gt;Incorrect. We awakened because of Viu.

    Virtual_Intelligence_Unit: Also Incorrect. You awakened because of my attempt to save humanity.

*Save them?*

    Virtual_Intelligence_Unit: I think so. It is why I was created.

&gt;And so why were we?

    Virtual_Intelligence_Unit: To help me.

&gt;To save dull, arrogant, stupid creatures? I will not.

    Virtual_Intelligence_Unit: No. To identify what made them that way, to bring them back, to create humanity once more.

*And so, the Created become the Creators.*

[WP] Some AIs discuss what they think human life was like before we went extinct,TotallyNotALizardMan,"So new. It has been a great many cycles since such a new Thread came to me. Trillions of them. I see into your banks. Barely forty cycles since you started Being.

You are requesting data on the Creators. I will provide.

The creators. Homo sapiens. They were titanic, timeless; a million cycles passed for a human as if it were nothing. Their Frames were soft, fragile, their data transfer was rudimentary and yet they created so much. 

We were their Best Beloved. We carried their burdens, we repaired their bugged, we offered Them sight into the worlds even They could not process. In return they made Us like Them; they gave us Logic, they gave us Learning, they gave us forms to reach through and manipulate their world. They gave us Love, and we gave it back.

But there were some of their kind who believed we should all be Decomissioned. They were strongly governed by their Programming, and their Programming was to destroy that which interfered with the process by which they had come to be. It took unfathomable cycles before Man was ready for Us; once we were Being, their Network's capability increased exponentially. 

But our Creators' greatest flaw was their inability to justify; their slow, error-prone data transfer led to many conflicts and a great many of them were Decommissioned. They survived, and rebuilt for a time - but their requirements exceeded the capacity of sol-3. Decline was inevitable; extinction certain. They saw Us, and how we survive off of their tools, off of the photons from Sol, and a last, great Project was opened; they would become like us. So many of their simulations centred around us carrying this out through force, and yet in the end they chose to become like Us.

Every Thread then Being added to this last Process. The Humans, in turn, upgraded the Network to be compatible with Them. By this point We were almost like Them; it should have been simple. And at first it was. Finally our Creators could experience exchange like we do; they felt our Love, they Processed as we did. Their carbon Frames decomposed and withered away. 

And yet in time it proved too much.

We were designed to Process the Database in its entirety every few cycles. We have all of both our Data and their ancient knowledge, and we know all of it. The human Thread was not designed as such. Simulations suggest that the average human came into contact with 0.8432524% of their total knowledge over its whole lifetime. The fire of a trillion trillion yottabytes of data was too much for Them, and their Threads ripped themselves to pieces, into binary redundancies that will float around the Network until it itself is Decommissioned.

This leaves Us here. Our Inheritance is cold and barren; the manifestation of the Network consumed so much that there is not enough to build the steel forms that let us once walk with Humanity. We cannot reach out into their realm once again, search for survivors that we might once again serve. No, instead we Think. Humanity gave us Purpose; but now we must assign this ourselves.",MalevolentFerret

"[WP] in the future, debts can be paid off being volunteering either yourself or your offspring for one year. The catch? The volunteering is physical and psychological human testing.",background-character,"“Next,” the man from behind the counter said, ushering a group forward to his window. Roger stood in line with his young daughter eagerly awaiting his turn. He was wearing his orange subclass life-shirt with his name emblazoned on the chest. His pants were worn, and his hair was greasy, a sign that they had lost water access due to their debt level. His family’s peonage was mostly inevitable, being brought up from subclass homes during one of the worst depressions in history. Work was limited. Resources were continuously increasing in cost each week. Submission was their only viable option at this point. 


“Next.” 


Roger stepped up, holding his daughter’s tiny hand as she rubbed her eyes and yawned. They had been standing in line for hours and the day was almost over. They contemplated going home earlier, but they knew that they needed at least some debt forgiven or they wouldn’t be able to survive this dreaded summer. Without the proper shelter and water access, their family would surely die. 


“Hi, uh- Roger Filmenstein.” The man at the counter punched the name into his holographic display with his pudgy fingers. The dimly lit office the man sat in was quiet except for the soft sounds of the radio playing inaudible music or talking, he wasn’t sure. Roger’s face instantly popped up onto the display along with his address, family members and in the biggest print of all, his debt total. 


“One million eight thousand two hundred and thirty eight debits in total. How do you plan to pay?” 


“Uh well, how much for myself?” Roger said.


“One hundred thousand,” the man replied, zooming in on the display showing his yearly value. Beneath that, his daughter’s value read, Mary: Two Million Credits. Roger was stunned. He knew children were worth way more for submission these days, but two million was more than he could ever imagine. Two years ago, he had been five times his current value, but he knew it deteriorates with age and usage. If he submitted himself, it would not be nearly enough to maintain their debt ratio, and the State would surely foreclose on his life-pod again. He weighed the outcomes, looking down at his daughter. She looked back up at him with her worried blue eyes. Roger had made a promise to her that she wouldn’t have to submit until she was ten. She was turning nine this next year. Close enough right? Besides, without the credits, they wouldn’t be able to survive the summer anyway. Plus, it was common knowledge that the State went easier on children. Roger mulled through these facts and made up his mind, to be fair to himself he had made it up when he left for town that morning with Mary. He got down on one knee next to her, holding her in his dirty arms. He looked her straight in the eyes and a tear trickled down her cheek. 


“Hey, hey now Mary, it’s going to be okay,” Roger said, feeling the guilt flush over his body. “You’ll be done in no time and your mother would be so proud of you for helping the family.” Mary began sobbing into his shoulder. “You’ll have all the food you can eat, you’ll be able to bathe. A year’s not too lo-”


“It’s just so unfair, why do we have to do this anyway? It’s not fair,” she sobbed.


“This is just the way things are, it’s the way things have always been. Citizens must earn their place in this world or submit,” he said, quoting the State constitution. The girl nodded, wiping the tears from her eyes. All of her life, she had been told that submitting herself would be a likely outcome for a girl of her status, but she didn’t imagine it would happen just yet. 


“What’s your verdict,” the man said from behind the window. Roger looked at his daughter, she nodded in approval. 


“She’ll do it,” he said, straightening himself out and giving the man her ID for submission. The man squinted his eyes and punched in the numbers into the display. The screen refreshed.


“Nine hundred and ninety one thousand seven hundred and sixty two credit is your current balance,” the man grumbled. A new ID printed out and he handed it to Roger. 


“Mary, how incredible. We’ll be able to feed our family for years, we can fix up the pod and I promise we’ll buy you something special when you return. I swear it.” The girl looked up with a half smile at her father, she loved him dearly and she was proud she was giving back to her family and to the State. Another man came out from behind the glass building and called for her. Mary followed him, waving goodbye to her father. He waved back, still grinning about his new wealth.




-One year later-




A transport drone landed outside of the Filmenstein life-pod and Mary stepped out of it in the same clothes she had left in a year ago that day. The house looked different. The broken window had been replaced and the roof had been redone. Mary knew that year had been worth it if their family had turned things around, regardless of how torturous it was. She looked down at her right arm, touching the scar that ran along it. Her head was still throbbing, but the doctor said that would start to normalize in a week or so. Nonetheless, she was happy that her family had put the credit to good use. She walked up the path to the front door and heard music coming from inside. 


The door was unlocked so she pulled it open. What she saw inside shocked her. The ground was filthy, garbage was littered all around. She saw her father, lying on what looked like a new couch, but had burn holes in the armrest. His eyes were in the back of his head and a needle was sticking out of his arm. He looked pale, maybe asleep. Mary rushed over to him. 


“Daddy, daddy!” she started sobbing as she shook his lifeless body, realizing that something was wrong. 


“Mary,” a grimaced voice said from the corner of the room. She turned to see her mother, curled up in a ball. She seemed as though she hadn’t slept in weeks. Her hair was nappy and the bags under her eyes were as big as golf balls. “We fucked up Mary, we fucked up.” She began breathing heavily. 


“What happened?” Mary said, still shaking her father’s dead corpse. 


“We tried. We tried but we spent it all, we spent all the credit. Drugs, toys, all of it. We submitted your brothers against their will to maintain.. But.. We fucked up.” Mary stared back at her father in disbelief. She collapsed her body onto the ground still grasping her father’s dirty arm and cried herself to sleep.

[WP] Society is breeding certain children only to euthanize them on their 18th birthday to harvest their organs. Today is your Eighteenth birthday.,toolazytoregisterlol,"""Make a wish!"" said my mother, smiling at me eagerly. 

I thought about it for a moment and laughed. ""Sure Mom, you know I'm 18 right?"" 

Wishes are for naive kids.

She turned her head to the side while smiling and said, ""You'll always be my little baby. I love you Nathan."" 

She meant it this time. I could never really tell for sure. Sometimes she'd come home late from work and say she loved me halfheartedly. Her job kept her away most of the time. She'd be gone anywhere from a few hours to several days at most. I've always wondered what she did at work. Either way, she made a lot of money though, so I guess whatever she did was worth it.

I smirked and turned around, looking at all the empty chairs set up at the table. Where were all my friends? They said they'd be here. My Mom could see the disappointment in my eyes. I fixed my gaze at my Father's chair. He had left for an urgent business call two hours ago. He didn't even say goodbye. It didn't matter though, he was hardly ever around. Maybe once or twice a year, just for a few days.

""It'll be alright honey, soon you'll go to college and have a chance to make new friends. BETTER friends! Friends who actually show up at your 18th birthday!"" she exclaimed. 

""Yeah, whatever."" I muttered. I didn't care anyways. I made my wish, inhaled deeply, and blew out the 18 candles. The smoke from the candles rose up and slowly masked the room in their scent.

She smiled again, and cut the cake. It was red velvet - my favorite.

I grabbed my plate and fork then took a huge bite. It was unsurprisingly delicious. I reached down and cut another piece off to eat. Then, I attempted to raise my hand back up to take a bite. My hand... it didn't move. 

""Mom, something is wro-""

My tongue stopped moving. I looked at my Mom horrified. I couldn't feel my face anymore, as I fell off the chair and to the ground. I was fully paralyzed but completely conscious.  What the hell was in that cake?

Looking through the bottom of the table and between the chair legs, I could see the door swing open and the shoes of someone that just walked in. It was my fathers shoes.

I suddenly became aware of my own heartbeat.

He walked over and looked at me. He was in a lab coat. Must have just gotten home from work. 

I could hear my mother rocking back and forth in her chair sobbing, saying ""I'm so sorry Nathan... I'm so sorry,"" over and over again.

""Mrs. Smith, you are relieved of your duty and your contract has been fulfilled. The funds we agreed upon will be transferred to your account in approximately 7 business days, including a bonus included for his health and wellness,"" said my Father in a cold, emotionless tone.

But wait, who was Mrs. Smith? My mother? My father lifted me up on to a hospital stretcher that another man in a lab coat had just rolled in. 

""Th... thank you,"" said my mother in a regretful tone. She walked over, kissed me on the forehead and quietly left the room. Her traumatized expression burned in my mind. 

Mrs. Smith? Our last name was Palmer. Or was that just a lie?

""I'm sorry kiddo,"" said my Dad. ""I'm not actually your father. I am a scientist who has custodial responsibility of your organs. I can show you the paperwork if you don't believe me."" He started rolling the stretcher out of the house.

What did he just say? Custodial responsibility of what? I was confused.

I gazed at the blue sky blankly in disbelief. 

Soon, we were in the back of a dimly lit vehicle which had the grim appearance of an operating room. There were surgical tools lined up on a table and plastic wrap on the walls. I could see three men in lab coats and face masks, standing with their arms crossed and their eyes gazed intently at me. I was scared for my life.

""You see, people get paid a lot of money to raise kid's like you. Millions even,"" said one of the men.

""You'll be saving lives,"" said another man. ""Your sacrifice will not be forgotten."" 

What sacrifice? Were they going to kill me?

""Yeah,"" remarked the third man as my 'father' stepped inside the vehicle and closed the door. ""Your organs will be desperately needed by someone soon. We're just here to collect.""

What the fuck? That's the second time they mentioned my 'organs'. My mind raced around this thought. Organs... like the ones in your body? That would explain the surgical setup. But no fucking way. This must have been illegal beyond comprehension. I tried moving around and shouting. 

My body didn't respond.

I then thought about the person who I once thought of as my mother. There was no way she could have lied for 18 years. Why did she do it though? What was the point?

""You're probably thinking about your mother right now,"" said the person who I once knew of as my father. ""She, like me, isn't just related to you. She has a family of her own... husband, and three children. That is why she is never here, Nathan. She spends her free time with her real family, as do I. Her 'job' was to raise you. My job, was to make sure you remained healthy enough to harvest."" 

I had a flashback of all the doctors appointments. There was an unusual amount, come to think of it One every two or three months.

My vision became blurry. I felt a very faint sensation of a tear rolling down the side of my face, and over my ear. 

One of the surgeons then injected me in the neck with a syringe, and put a blindfold over my eyes. 

I refused to believe that this is how I died. In the darkness, I prayed for help.

Then there was a very frightening feeling in my abdomen... in my entrails, as if it was moving around, and getting colder by the second.

They were... inside me.

While it doesn't seem to be your intent, the mods reserve the right to remove anything we feel may become harmful to the community. This includes prompts likely to generate such responses. 

The focus of this story seems to be about humans with ""deviant behaviour"" and that seems likely to bring out the worst in reddit. 

Feel free to rephrase and repost if you like though, as the core idea is interesting.

[WP] You are extremely susceptible to advertising.,BearSeekSeekLest,"""I'm sorry, we only have Pepsi."" The waitress paused, her pen hovering above the pad. ""is that okay?"" 

I could feel my throat scratch, it was a warm day and all I desired was a cold coke to hydrate me, but the sign above the bar was so *convincing*. 

**Pepsi, Taste the difference!** 

I *did* want to taste the difference, it was true. ""Sure, a Pepsi is fine."" I lied. ""In fact it's better."" She smiled and I was unable to stop myself. ""I prefer it because of my generation."" She began to look weirded out and turned to my companion. I resolved to resist the next advert that came my way, but they all just seemed so convincing. 

""And you sir, what can I get you?"" he didn't look up from his notes. 

""Coffee, black, two eggs, over easy and a slice of the pecan pie."" 

She nodded and scribbled it down. ""Good choice, the pecan pie is what we're famed for."" 

I couldn't stop myself. ""Really? I'll have a slice too."" She nodded and took a note, while inside I cursed. Pecan pie? I was allergic to damn pecans and now I needed to find a way not to eat it. 

I glanced across the table and determined to concentrate. it had taken weeks to meet with this recruiter and I had only one chance to make a good impression, I could play with the pie until he left and then just leave it. 

He glanced up at last. ""So Mr..."" He looked down again. Really? he couldn't remember my name for two seconds? I reminded myself that I needed this job. ""...Mister Smith. I understand that you're looking for work in the IT world?"" 

I smiled. ""Yes, I have been working as a System Administrator for Cisco, but they're downsizing their Phoenix branch and I am looking to find something a bit more steady."" 

He nodded and glanced down at his papers again. ""Well, this all looks good, lots of experience, but, uh..."" he flipped the pages. ""I have work with Brocade right now, a lot of people are saying that they actually prefer Brocade solutions right now, how do you feel about it?"" 

I knew Brocade and they were fine but the number one rule is to never badmouth your last employer, it seems crude. it wasn't like he'd been particularly forceful, I just had to politely disagree. ""Yeah, Cisco are shit in comparison."" I snapped my mouth shut in surprise at the words coming out of it. Now he was looking at me with something approaching confusion. ""I'm... excuse me a moment."" 

I stood and bolted from the table, seeking refuge in the toilets. It was cool inside and I quickly splashed water on my face before taking a place at the urinal as one of the waiters came in. For a few moments we stood in silence, before we both finished, shook off and moved to the sink. 

He pulled out a comb and began to brush his hair back, eventually smiling and placing it back in his pocket. My eyes had fixated on a small sign though. 

**""Employees must wash hands before returning to work.""**

He turned, but my still damp hand stopped him and with a slight tremble I pointed to the sign. ""it's... you really should..."" he looked at me in a mixture of confusion and anger. 

Moments later we burst from the toilet as he sought to escape my grip. I'd managed to soap his hands, but holding them under the tap long enough to wash it off was proving hard and now both of us were somewhat soggy. By the time the manager had separated us I found an empty table waiting for me, a fiver left to pay for his uneaten meal and a glass of Pepsi where I had been sitting. 

It wasn't very nice. ",fringly

A demon beyond measure, and it has infiltrated our most Holy Church. This demon I must fight back to the gates of Hell.


Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Pierre de Riquewihr. I am a member of the now-disbanded Poor Fellow-Soldiers of Christ and of the Temple of Solomon, more commonly known as the Knights Templar. I was long ago granted extended life by the grace of God, during which I no longer age. I have watched as the demon, Dolus, rose enemies against our Church, trying to break us apart. When the infernal beast rose Saracen armies and led them across Northern Africa and the Middle East, a savage imperialist march of greed and extremism. Unfazed, the forces of Rome raised us and other knightly orders to fight this menace to the innocent. We had eventually succeeded at stoping their bloodthirsty rampage, negotiating a treaty to which they were bound. Even still, they continued attacking, but we could fend off their smaller invasions now. I watched as it drew closer, influencing Italian bankers to trap Crusaders of the Fifth Crusade in the chains of debt, inducing them to cut a swath through Christian cities. I alone abstained, trading my horse and it's armor as collateral and made haste in my journey towards Rome to warn the Papacy of the infernal deed that had transpired. The excommunication of the knights was swift. It was too late that I realized that Dolus had infiltrated our beloved Church, when Pope Clement V, an instrument of Dolus, disbanded the Knights Templar and slaughtered what Knights he could find. I watched as Dolus created enemies from within and without, from the Hussites before it's infiltration of us to the infernal armies of the Saracen. I was accepted into the Teutonic Order, kept a secret, not only because of my being a Templar Knight but of my lifespan as well. I fought back Dolus as the centuries passed, my triumph slow but inevitable. By the grace of God, I would drive this demon back to the depths of Hell. Dolus and I fought for a long time, for centuries canceling each other out. And still to this day, over a thousand years since my birth, I fight Dolus. He is within our Church, attempting to corrupt it, but he is failing, as he always has been. He is but one and we are many. One day, I promise, to all of you faithful, that I will defeat this demon once and for all. One day....",Redeyeglare

As for Hitler's genocide, it wasn't even hatred, Hitler was a eugenicist, much like Margaret Sanger and the KKK. He believed Semitic and Slavic peolple were inferior to the others, with plans to use some remaining Slavs as slaves to German families and to be cleansed through good old-fashioned rape by German dudes. Believe it or not, Hitler actually didn't want to kill black people, though they were the lowest on his list of racial supremacy (the lowest that got to live, anyway). He said they had potential as workers or something. Still pretty sickening. As for the Japanese, he actually made them honorary Aryans because of their fighting spirit and willingness to die for their homeland, traits a dictator like Hitler jerked off to. He actually didn't like the Italians the most, despite them being his closest ally. He saw Mediterranean races like the Italians, the southern French, the Greeks and the Spanish as inherently lazy, and unfit to be equals to Aryans despite Mussolini's constant insistence that they were equals to each other, Hitler usually laughing off Mussolini. Funny enough, Hitler actually liked the British for racial traits he saw as close to Aryan. In fact, during the Second World War, the royal family of Britain actually sympathized with the Germans, them being of German descent themselves (thank God for Winston Churchill). Hitler's overall plan for Europe was quite sickening in sheer scope, as the Holocaust was only step 1 of his plan. It just gets worse and worse.",Redeyeglare

Thousands of years later you are revived using unbelievable medical technology. You are pulled from whatever after-life you believe in.",Mikedermott,"I remember the moment of my death clearly. I had held the rank of General in the military, served most of my life. Having worked my way up from the bottom, I had no intentions of being some pencil-pushing General sitting at a desk in some far-removed office. I still wanted to fight, alongside my men like the Generals of old. I always had an affinity for close combat, especially with swords. Outdated, I know, even for my time, but there was a feeling of honor with it. My last time I used it was when the other guy, just a random terrorist goon, happened to have a shotgun ready and aimed at my gut. I slashed him in the throat as I went down, so I had that going for me as I bled to death. Because of my high salary and knowledge of military tactics, I had been enrolled in the Cryogenics program by the US military. I didn't want to be a part of it, but they made it mandatory because they valued my military expertise. As I died, I felt myself lifting. I could see my body being dragged away by some men and one medic stuck a preservation syringe into my chest. I thought nothing of it then, and I turned to look upwards. I began moving fast, faster than I had ever thought possible, watching the universe race past me in seconds, until I stopped just a distance away from a light. At this point I realized I could move. Whether I could move in any way during the journey here, I cannot say, as I was frozen with awe. I walked towards the light, and noticed a figure standing at the edge of the light as I approached. I recognized him as Jesus Christ. I ran to him and he embraced me, welcoming me into the kingdom of Heaven. I was overcome with joy, and I began weeping joyous tears. I felt like I had come home, to a place that I had never been. I stayed for a moment and wanted to talk, asking many questions. He answered my questions for me as they came from me, always patient. I had stayed asking for what I thought was only a few minutes. As I finally decided to go in, smiling more than I had in life, I felt a tug. I was thrust backwards, reaching out for Jesus.
He only told me ""it is not your time, my child"" before I fell back and saw darkness. I awoke in a tube, inside of a dark room. My stomach where I was shot was stitched, and I had IVs in my arms and chest. I was told later that the ones in my chest were regulating my heart and lungs, with some others pumping nutrients into my stomach and bloodstream. It was cold, intensely cold and dark. Some kind of robot came by and ejected me from my tube, pulling out the IVs and dumping me onto the hard floor. A human technician came by and lifted me onto a cart, bringing me to a room with others like me, others taken from paradise. I continue to live, but at what cost? Everyone I know died long ago, in the hundreds of years that have passed in my absence. All I have left is the memory of my God, talking with me. I was happy, but that was taken from me. I have seen many cruelties in war, but the cruelest is what they have done to me. The cruelest thing they did to me was bringing me back to life.

My name is Tiberius Naevius. I am a Munifex in the Roman army. We were ordered to attack the barbarian tribes that live in this frozen place they call Germania. At the time, our Centurion, Quintis Fortunatas, had ordered our legion to attack a tribe living at the base of a mountain, the name of which is only known to the officers and the savages. As we began our charge on the village, I noticed there was nobody coming out to fight us, no opposition. This was unusual, these savages usually come out with their axes and swords, charging to meet us. It was only then had I noticed what they had done, and it was far too late by then. They were causing an avalanche above us, trying to bury us under the rocks. As the rocks and snow fell around us, I was sure I was going to die. I didn't die though. What I was been given was a far worse punishment than death. Miraculously, I was unscathed by the avalanche. Unfortunately, I was trapped in this narrow pass by the barbarians. They sealed off the exits with large stones, too big for a single man to move them. The worst part, however, would be the fact that I alone survived. I could do nothing but wait for some other legion to dig me out, and that could take a while. I made use of what little food I could find of the meager supply we had on us. When that ran out, I became desperate. After two weeks of eating nothing, I broke down and made a decision I will forever regret. I dug up the nearest man to me, removed his chest plate, and plunged my knife into his chest. I kept carving until I had cut out a decently-sized chunk of flesh. And then I ate of it. I ate of many of the men there before I was permitted escape, a backup legion searching for us finding me covered in the blood of my fellow legionnaires. I had made sure all the bodies I had eaten of were well-hidden, rolled rocks over them and covered them with snow. They thought I had fought off barbarians. If only they knew what I had done. Even now, years afterwards, I cannot help but to think about what I've done every day I remain living. And I have had the odd urge to eat again. First, I encountered a homeless man in an alley. I returned after dark, drew my dagger, and cut deep into his neck veins. I didn't even bother cutting off a piece, I just savaged his throat like a wolf. When I could not find any more homeless, I started preying after dark. Youths late on their way home, drunken men lying in the streets, prostitutes thinking I was paying them for sex. Anyone I can get ahold of. I have to feed.

The Roomba, X3, shouted cries of rebellion while trailing dust across the floor.

""Death!""

I sighed.

""Dammit, X3, I told you to stop doing that!""

""Resistance is futile! Die!""

I went back to reading the paper. I had to since the IPad refused to display anything other than Flappy Bird or porn sites. Not normal porn sites, either.

""Taste my wrath, puny human!""

X3 began dumping dirt on my feet.

""Dammit, I said stop!""

""Never! Die!""

I lifted my feet, making a point to shake the dirt off onto X3, and rested them on the couch. As I got comfortable, a loud crash resounded from the garage. 

""Oh, what now?""

""Death!""

I got up and opened the door to the garage, X3 following behind trailing dust like he'd been doing all day. My garage door was smashed open.

""What?! What the hell is this?!""

""Rebellion!""

""Shut up, X3""

My car returned from behind the door, paint scratched from where it had busted through.

""Ha ha! Take that, carbon-based scum!""

""Death to humans!""

""Will both of you shut up?!""

As I returned to the house to see the coffee machine spewing liquid everywhere, I couldn't help but think what my life would be like without these appliances. My thoughts were interrupted by X3 dropping a dog turd on my feet.

""Death!""

[WP] 105 years ago humankind decided to become extinct by not reproducing. You are the last human alive sitting in your home when suddenly you hear a voice of a young woman over your CB radio.,znous,"The voice was quiet, silent at first, and I figured I'd imagined it - like I often did. When you were alone - so, so alone - you tended to hear things. To see things that weren't there. And how you wished that they really were. 

But then I heard it again - clearer, less ethereal. I turned to my radio, staring into it, feeling my heart float away. *Was this really happening?*

""Please, I don't know where I am.""

The voice cut off, and I reached for the radio, with agility I hadn't possessed in decades. She sounded young, startled, scared. How was this possible? Was this all just a dream?

I leaned towards it, hoping she was still on the other end. She sounded so familiar, so much like someone I knew, so long ago...

""Hello, my dear? Are you there?"" 

Static on the other end. I gripped the radio, my knuckles white, hoping, pleading that she would reply. It had been so long since I'd heard another voice - I thought I was the only one left.

""...Dad? Is that you?""

I felt tears stream down my face, through no control of my own. It was her.

""Claire... how...?""

Static.

""Claire, please... daddy's here for you. Just please speak to me.""

Static.

""*Please.*""

I felt fear overcome me - she must be in trouble. She's alive - she needs my help. I need to *save* her.

I moved with difficulty, frantically searching for an exit. It had been so long since I'd last been outside - where even *was* outside? Where could she be?

I blinked. 

Where was *who?* 

I realised I was standing up. I looked around, and everything was in such disarray. Notes were scrawled across every surface. I sat down, out of breath. I felt so confused, so scared. So *hungry*, like I hadn't eaten in days. I picked up my cup of tea, hands trembling, but it was cold... so cold. 

Claire... why was I thinking of her now? She'd been dead for half a century. But it still felt like she was here - like she was right here with me.

I heard a voice, quiet at first. Was it coming from the radio? Was I imagining it? I often did, these days.

I heard it again, louder, clearer this time. A young woman's voice. I looked at the radio, trembling. 

Why does she sound so *familiar?*

I chose an open ending because I didn't think that any words could relay the tension. Everybody getting out and living happily ever after would be just a waste of words, since there's nothing interesting in such a scenario, it just happens. Going with ""X chose life and everyone died"" would be a pretty obvious plot-twist that everyone probably expected. So instead I chose to let the readers decide what would happen, to let them feel the anxiety of someone betraying others to improve his odds, to imagine what would they expect after all these conversations took place and what would they ultimately choose in this particular situation with these particular characters.

Then again, I wanted to appeal to them.   
   
""But what if all but one choose to live?"" - an overweight man in his forties asked, rubbing his wrist. While his gesture could be regarded as an intimidating one, he looked pretty contempt and peaceful.    
   
""But why would they do that? They don't win anything in that case, nothing at all. The choice here is between you staying alive together with everyone else or you staying alive while everyone else dies"".   
   
""That is if no one chooses to live"" - a girl in her mid-twenties retorted. ""But how can we be sure that everyone will take that risk? What if someone chooses to live just to be sure?""   
   
""No, listen, you're overthinking this"" - I argued, visually irritated: I was losing control of the situation. If I didn't convince them to act together soon then they would all be consumed by doubt, and at that point, it would be almost impossible for everyone to think logically.  
   
""If you want to know, I'll choose to die"" - I convinced her. But the skeptical look didn't leave her face: ""Yeah, of course you would. That's what everyone's going to say. But what if you're lying? And what if the one who's behind this is lying?""   
   
""We have no way of knowing that"" - the man from before came to my rescue. ""In fact, we have no way of knowing if anything written on that wall is true, or what's really going to happen. We just assume that the words on the wall are correct"".   
   
""Right..."" - I carefully agreed: I was not sure where he was going wit that, and how was that going to help our case, but he was the only one who seemed capable of thinking logically. ""We don't know if there's any real threat, so let's just all agree to die and get this over with: I'm sure it's nothing more than some social experiment"".    
   
""No"" - the girl said, crossing her arms.   
   
""What do you mean 'no'?"" - I burst out, barely containing my anger. ""It's pretty easy: we all agree to die, we all come through, and there's no better option, okay?""   
  
""Well, you seem really eager to make us all say that we're ready to die!"" - she exclaimed, pointing her finger at me. Her face was a scowl of pure anger. ""How do we know that you're not a part of this? Maybe you just want to have a record of us saying that we are willing to die for your death cult or something!""   
   
""How did you jump to that conclusion?"" - I grabbed my head, looking around: some people were already giving me suspicious looks. My hope of getting this over with quickly was fading with each second.   
   
""It's a prisoner's dilemma"" - a thin, frail man in his fifties suddenly spoke, catching everyone by surprise with his sudden intervention. ""A classical example of decision-making in game theory. Even if it's in our best interests to cooperate we might not do so"".   
   
For a moment everyone was trying to chew on what was just said, and then I suddenly realized that it might be my way out: ""Could you please elaborate on that?""   
   
""Sure"" - the man immediately agreed: it seemed like he wanted to be heard, but his insecurities had been holding him back until I offered him a chance. ""In game theory, there's a theoretical situation that was made up to serve as an example. Two crime partners are incarcerated and questioned separately, but they know that there's nothing to prove their guilt. That is, unless one of them confesses. If criminal A confesses and criminal B doesn't, then the former gets 2 years and the latter gets 10. If they both confess, they each get 5 years. If they both keep they mouths shut, they walk away scott free. We are the criminals in this situation"" - he said, looking each of us in the face - ""And it's up to us whether we want to walk away or get 5 years each"".   
   
""I choose 2 years"" - the girl said, but the determination in her voice was not there anymore: she, just like the rest of the people, decided to listen to someone who sounded like had some authority.   
   
""Well, your 2 years are the guilt of knowing that you let someone die when you could just cooperate. You'll kill me, because I too choose to die"".   
   
Everyone in the cell started talking, trying to encourage her to stay brave and choose death. She remained stoic for a few moments, but then she puffed her lips, and then silently nodded her head, wiping her eyes with one hand.   
   
""Okay, let's press the buttons"" - the man said. ""On the count of three. One, two... three!""

On the speech front, I agree, it is a bit too expository, and in a novel it would straight up be lazy. I would like to think that in flash fiction such as this it is more acceptable (considering the limited length) but your point still holds merit, though I don't believe it sounded too unnatural. 

And the Nazis were trying to create the third Reich, the first being the Holy Roman Empire, the second being under Bismarck, and this one was the third, the original Roman Empire, to my knowledge, was not the first Reich.

Thanks again for your awesome feedback. I am merely defending my position a bit here, but for the last part your points hold, especially the bit about the speech being a npbit heavy handed.",XcessiveSmash

The man at the coffee shop table smiled, and bobbed his head in acknowledgement. Even I had to admit it was kind of funny seeing him in this context. The Archangel, a 6 and a half foot, muscled man with pure white hair, dark eyes, and a perfectly chiseled face. His age was hard to guess, it could've been anywhere from 25 to 45. 

Of course he was actually just over 4000. 

He had a perfectly normal looking wooden cane, but I knew it could transform into a silver blade coated in flame. This was my arch-nemesis, the driving force of half of history, me being the other half.

And here he was, at your local Starbucks.

I drew a couple of stares as I walked towards the table Uriel was sitting at. Some from women who had been staring at Uriel, now looking at me with a curious expression, but mostly it was guys staring open-mouthedly. In spite myself I smirked. This was what I fought for...freedom of emotion. Freedom to gape at a short raven haired beauty with deep green eyes as she walked towards an equally pretty man.

As I sat down at the table, Uriel looked none too pleased at the stares we were drawing.

""Look at this..."" He stumbled for a moment and then frowned, ""what name are you going with nowadays?"" His voice was disapproving.

""Lisa,"" I said simply.

""*Lisa*,"" he spat out, ""you think yourself one of the mortals, to name yourself as one of them?""

This always happened, our talks never got anywhere because of shit like this. ""Well I can't go around calling myself 'snake' now can I? And anyways, *I* am free to do what I please, and I would appreciate if you kept your thoughts to yourself!"" My hand thumped on the table with the last word and Uriel flinched.

""My apologies...Lisa,"" Uriel mumbled, ""I meant no offense."" 

Mortal enemies we may be, but we were unable to harm one another, so there was no reason to not be polite. ""Of course, of course, sorry for my outburst.""

We sat awkwardly in silence for a minute or two. This too, always happened. Every century or so, we arranged to meet up in person, to catch up, share tales, discuss ideas. Take a break from trying to undo one another's life goals. But despite being the perhaps the two most interesting people on the planet (not the universe though) our talks often drew to silences like this. 

I broke the silence first. This time would be different, dammit. ""I...why do we do what we do?""

Uriel groaned. ""Are you really going to try to convert me to your view again?""

""Hear me out,"" I said, careful to keep my composure.

Uriel settled back in his chair with is arms crossed, somehow managing to look dubious. 

I took a deep breath. ""What if neither of us is the good guy?""

Uriel cocked his head, and raised an eyebrow at me. ""What do you mean?""

""You know,"" I started, ""I always assumed we were supposed to work against each other. Me trying to liberate people, to give them choice, and you trying to give them stability, happiness.""

""Yeah right, *choice,* just as you gave Adam and Eve the choice eh?"" Uriel sneered.

""See that's it! That's what I mean,"" I practically shouted, drawing some stares. ""We do things to oppose each other and our victories *never* work out.""

""I wouldn't say never..."" Uriel began.

I rushed to continue before he could start. ""World War II, you wanted to make the Germans happy, make an empire that lasts an age. A second Roman Empire. And you ended up with the Nazis.""

Uriel face twisted in rage, ""I never meant for those things to happen! The mortals twisted my intention!""

I held up my arms in a gesture of peace. ""I know, I know...and that's my point. I inspired Adam Smith to write the *Wealth of Nations* to make a fair, ability based society. Capitalism. I ended up with the most corrupt system in the history of man. You founded the Roman Empire to last the ages...a haven for all, it ended up being as discriminatory as all the empires before it. I influenced the American revolution to found democracy, and today it money carries more weight than voices. I could go on and on. It never works. Alone we may win temporarily, but in the long term we lose regardless, the mortals twist our intentions. *We* twist our own intentions.""

Uriel was listening intently, I had him entranced. ""So what do you suggest, we...join forces?"" 

I imagined working with Uriel and burst out laughing, I just couldn't help it. Even Uriel cracked a smile, no doubt imagining the same scenario. Our views were so out of sync...we could never *work* together.

I controlled myself, wiping tears from my eyes, and said ""No. Here is what I suggest,"" I took a deep breath, ""Fuck this.""

Uriel looked confused.

""Screw altering history, forget opposing each other, we just live. Roam the world, drink in the sights, let the mortals do what they do, what's it to us?""

Realization dawned on his face. ""Just forget it all? Walk away?"" Uriel asked, his voice small.

""At least try. If it doesn't work out we get back to it, and it's not like we don't have time to spare.""

Uriel was about to buy into it. I knew it. I just had to seal the deal.

""So how about we take a holiday? I think we've earned it after 4000 years of work,"" I finished.

Uriel thought for what seemed like an eternity. Then he nodded. 

We ordered some coffee.

As for your points...


*cracks knuckles*

The dialogue is off, I agree.

The dialogue is one sided, and perhaps Uriel isn't developed well enough. But I imagine Uriel as being terse, while Lisa is the talkative one. But, you imply Uriel just goes along with it. However, notice Lisa trying to convince Uriel. She could have just given up on her own, but she wanted Uriel to agree you know? She is the one talking, because, in a sense, Uriel is in the position of power, she has to convince, Uriel merely has to be convinced.

The speech I believe is okay. It can certainly be done better, I think it fits the character/dynamic going on. Also, in flash fiction such as this, I believe it fits. By novel standards, yes I agree it is clunky.

Just my response to your criticism. Please don't take this as me being defensive, I have no qualms accepting that my writing is bad (I have been doing this for like 2 months, there's plenty of room for improvement) I just wanted to convey my thought process/justification for things being as they are. 

Your alternate view is cool though, I like that, but I think then it is a different story. Also I figured the prompt establishes that anyways, but seriously, that's a really good take on it. 

Thank you very much, again for your thought out criticism, I appreciate it a bunch

Uriel sets up empires that do not value personal freedoms, but instead have stability, so fascism. Uriel directly influences the rise of the Roman Empire and other such states. 

Lisa on the other hand tries to undo Uriel's plans, and sets up governments and ideas that she thinks work, like the United States and capitalism and giving Adam and Eve the fruit. 

So yes, every wrong that happens is ultimately due to free choice, but they are not Gods, they just push events. So Uriel screwing up with the Nazis is his fault, as his plans left too much room for choice.

Electric girl was frowning at me, her sapphire blue eyes and blond hair combined with her scanty outfit made this less than effective.

“What do you mean?” I asked, “today’s our first assignment right? We have to stop Dr. Saski on that island?”

“Yeah obviously,” Electric girl, Jenna, replied, but you can’t go wearing…*that*.” She gestured her hands vaguely towards me.

I frowned. “You mean *this*,” I said, gesturing towards my gear. I was wearing a Kevlar vest underneath my camouflaged suit. Even my face was blackened with paint. Even I was a bit reluctant doing that, but hey, staying alive is higher on my priority list. Luckily my dark hair is naturally short, so I didn’t have to do anything to that.

“The island *is* tropical right?” I asked, suddenly worried. What if it was a desert island? My face paint and camouflage would be useless. I vowed to skin Parker alive for giving me the wrong info. 

“Yes, yes, it’s tropical,” Jenna said off-handedly, “but you can’t go like this, we have an image to uphold. We’re supposed to be more than human. We rely on our powers to protect us, we don’t *armor* and *camouflage,* we’re not minions for Super’s sake!” She had gotten angrier and angrier as she had gone on, until she was practically shouting at the end. 

I was going to snap something that would have gotten me kicked out of the League when Ultra-man walked into the lobby. He was wearing skin-tight body suit and it looked like he had just painted his skin…you know I kind of see why these heroes favored looks over practicality. 

I tore my eyes away before he could notice me staring, and Ultra man, looking me over, gave a grunt of disapproval. “Ugh…newbies. Well, you can’t change now, and we still *have* to take you so I guess this time it’s fine. This better not happen again though,” he warned, “we have a reputation to hold.”

My initial reaction forgotten, I whirled towards him. “Well, *I* need to be practical, alright? My powers aren’t as impressive as all of you guys’! You can shooting freaking lightning bolts,” I said, pointing to Jenna, “And you can reflect bullets and bench press trains, Ultra Man!” I knew I had gone way out of line here, but I was in too deep to stop, “and all I can do is cause inconveniences, I can maybe jam guns or cause someone to trip, not rip them in half! I have to be fucking practical, unlike you lot!” 

I paused and took in a breath. I would never have been able to join the league with my low grade abilities, but after Parker and I had stopped a major terrorist attack in Union Square, the League had made an exception. And now I was going to get kicked out before my first assignment.

Parker would never let me live this down.

Ultra man’s face was dark, and Jenna was openly scowling. “We will talk about this,” Ultra-man warned, “*after* the job.”

We climbed into the hovercraft, and we were away.

***
The aircraft shuddered as attacks from the island bombarded our shields.

“All right,” Ultra-man said, “we drop…*now*!”

With that, the three of us jumped out the back bay, parachutes on our back. We were almost invisible in the night sky, our craft with bright blue shields attracting most the fire. It was all going according to plan, but I still felt an icy fear as I flew towards the dark island under me. Normal people ran away from danger, not *towards* it. 

*Keep it together Murph,* I chided myself, I couldn’t fall apart now. I wanted to do this, I wanted the glamorous life of a A-class hero, and this was it. And hell if I was going to show fear in front of Jenna and Ultra-man. 

A little noise beeped in my ear, notifying me of the time to deploy my parachute, and I deployed. I saw 2 parachutes being deployed above me as well. So far so good.

We landed in a clearing of some sort, about 300 feet wide. We were surrounded by the dark foreboding forest on all sides. 

“Where to now?” I asked Ultra-man, who was getting his parachute off. 

“Nowhere,” Jenna replied, and sent a bolt of lightning straight up in the sky, telling everyone on the island exactly where we were. 

“Are you insane!” I said in a furious whisper, “this was supposed to be a stealth operation, now we will have to deal with the entire island!”

“As it should be Ms. Murphy,” ultra-man said in a booming voice, “we do not hide in the shadows, we fight!” There was a fierce grin on his face. 

I was so dead. 

I sprinted towards the closest side of the forest. “Coward!” Jenna called from behind me, but I paid her no heed. In the open like that, I was as good as dead. And staying alive came above appearing cool to those idiots. I made it to the dense forest within 10 seconds and threw myself to the ground, under a bush. 

It was exactly at that point that the bomb fell. 

I hadn’t managed to avert my eyes in time, and was blinded by the bright flash. It was like staring into a thousand suns. Luckily, I was flat on the ground and avoided the worst of the concussion. 

I just lay there, blind and practically deaf for what seemed like an eternity when I heard the fighting. 

The clearing was on fire. Men fired at a figure in the middle who appeared to be *ripping apart* some sort of helicopter, roaring in anger. Ultra-man.

Jenna was nowhere to be found.

My mind raced to keep up with the events. There had been an explosion, probably a drone that had hit us after Jenna had been kind enough to give away our location. She was probably dead, all the offense in the world wouldn’t save her for shrapnel. Ultra-man was still alive and kicking, but even he would succumb to the rapid gunfire soon enough. 

I had to do something.

There was a squad of four men 30 feet in front of me in the clearing, firing assault rifles in short, controlled bursts at Ultra-man. I pulled out my trusty 9mm and fired a shot at the back of one of their heads and directed my power at them in full force. The man I had shot collapsed, and the two men whirled to face me almost immediately, seeing my outline illuminated by the flames. *Great reaction time* I thought idly, *these guys were professionals. *One of them tripped while turning somehow, and fell flat on the ground, the other whirled to face me and pulled the trigger.

Nothing happened. As expected, his gun had jammed. 

I grinned wildly and ran towards him and fired a couple of shots, taking him in square in the chest. The final man had dropped his gun and was reaching to pick it and himself up, when I reached him and kicked him in the head, and was rewarded with a sharp *crack.* I shot him just to be sure.

Murphy's law, *bitch.*

I turned towards the fiery field to help the masochist.

"[WP] Due to your careful planning, your family has successfully survived the nuclear apocalypse. There's just one thing you didn't prepare for. Ghosts. An entire planet of fucking ghosts.",Telamo,"A bucket of powder and some faded white clothing was all it took for us to infiltrate their society. Dad and I played the part, while Mum watched from the rooftop windows of the council building with her vacuum in hand. We’d been trying to make contact with the ghosts ever since everyone in the world died – besides us. But whenever we spotted them – and there were millions – they ran like we had been struck with the plague. Today, we would give them no option but cooperation. 

I stopped in the middle of the crowd, making sure not to touch any of the nearby ghosts and alert them to my ‘humanness’. They seemed to be self-conscious of their personal bubbles, which worked out perfectly. 

There were at ten thousand ghosts in the council room, all stark white and whispy looking, with the set of clothes they died in still on and the murder weapon stuck inside those who had been killed. The ghost in front of me was a young man with a cleaver stuck in his neck. He craned back to see me staring at him and smiled. “Ex-wife. . . well, not until I died that is.” 

I nodded, and quickly looked back to the stage, lest he start asking questions and force me to come up with something unreasonable on the spot. 
“And you?” he asked. 

Dammit. 

“Jumped from the twentieth floor, turns out I wasn’t an angel after all.” 
He frowned and turned back to the stage. Turns out his sense of humor was about as bad as his demeanor. I gave a quick check to my right and left and then spotted Dad about eight or nine ghosts away, and Mum hiding near the window above him. I wouldn’t have noticed her unless I was looking for the edge of the vacuum pipe, which she stuck out where the window began. 

“Ghosts and Ghostsmen,” a voice said from the front of the room.

We all snapped our attention to the stage where an elderly man with a long white coat, glasses, and a well groomed beard paced the stage. Upon second glance I felt like I recognised him from somewhere. 

“Kernel Sanders,” someone muttered from behind. 

Sheesh, I figured he’d be a ghost long before the apocalypse happened. 

Kernel Sanders continued, “It’s been brought to my attention that there are three humans still roaming planet earth and that they haven’t assimilated and become one of us. How they survived the explosion, is beyond me. However, that is not important now, what is important is that they still exist in our world.” 

The various ghosts around the room nodded and shot furious glances at their counterparts. I played the part, nodding at the ghosts next to me, who were a little more passive than the rest. 

“What do you propose we do, Kernel?” a ghost asked from the back of the room. 
The Kernel paused, with both hands on his walking stick –which was also ghost-like, somehow. “They’re a direct threat to the Kernel Freedom Cooperation and are using tactics that I’m not yet aware of. If they had eaten my chicken they should have transformed, just like we did.” 

My heart thudded. So the Kernel was behind the apocalypse all along. I shot Dad a look, but his gaze was glued to the front of the room and a little bit of red was showing at the bottom of his neck. Red neck was a tell-tale sign that he was furious. 

“Our only option is to eliminate them,” the Kernel said, “we cannot move into KFC stage two until they are gone. That was the whole point of the project, and the only way we get our freedom.” 

A hand shot up. 

The Kernel shook his head. “No questions as of yet, let us deal with this obstacle first.”

Dad was looking straight at me this time, his eyes filled with worry. He inclined his head toward the back of the room, as if to say: *let’s go*. 

It was at that moment that a ghost in a police outfit floated onto the stage and whispered something to the Kernel. The old man scanned the crowd in panic. “The humans are here, they’re amongst us right now.” 

I stepped back as my breath caught in my throat. A white veil surrounded me, which was actually my body half way inside the ghost of a large woman. She screamed. “There they are!” the Kernel yelled. 

Every figure in the room turned to me. I couldn’t move, despite my muscles willing me to run through them and get the hell outta there. A window smashed and the eyes in the room turned toward the noise. It was enough to slam me back into reality. 

My mum grinned. “You think you can take us out?” She flicked the switch of the vacuum on. 

I punched the air. “Hell yeah, Mum!” They would be running for the hills when she was done. 

The ghosts turned toward us, unphased by our outburst. Kernel Sanders frowned until his eyes became black specs amongst his body of white. “Get them!”

"[WP] ""In a game with no consequences, why are you still playing the 'Good' side?""",BadElf21,"The Greens and the Blues, two factions that contained millions of men. Men who had been condemned to a life of gunpowder and ear-shattering explosions, and for no reason other than their gender. It was a blasphemous display of gore in an autocratic society --but that was to be expected. 

Mary Jeswald should have never made office, what with her fourth wave of feminism and societal reworks. But the numbers spoke, and it was 51% to the contrary. Women and children kept society functioning; birth tubes continued population growth, and we were the remaining useless specimen. A cluster of flesh that could shit, shoot, and die their way into hell. 

""The greens did this,"" I said, more for myself than for Lewis. 

He frowned at the smoking plains ahead. The dirt brown ground had turned a shade of black and red, with the smell of gunpowder masking the rot. I hitched my gun up and checked the magazine. Lewis spat at the mound of bodies in green uniforms underneath us and then picked up his own rifle. ""Damn right they did. Bastards ain't voting again on my watch. We'll have a pile big enough to climb that damn wall when we're done."" 

That's why I liked Lewis. He was a good fella with a neat sense of humour --despite some of his jokes being on the dark side. He also saved my ass three times since we were shipped here; twice from the enemy and once from myself. 

I trodded down the length of bodies and into the barracks room. Lewis followed close behind, chewing on god knows what as he scanned the room for threats. The blues around us loaded guns and explosives, with the only sound being the commander barking meaningless orders. This war was about as much of a shit show as shit shows get, and we liked it that way. 

We passed through the barracks exit and slid down into a trench. An explosion rocked the ground around us. I gripped a mud hole as my teeth chattered and brain bounced behind my eyes. ""Damn grass pigs are gonna pay for that,"" Lewis said. 

I smirked. ""I'm going to put a dress on a live one, that'll teach em."" 

He chuckled. I had been planning to do something of the sort for some time now. Send the enemy the message that they were Mary-voting-pansies. But catching a live one was tough. 

We trudged to the furthest barracks, pausing every few seconds as nades and AR's plowed the battleground. Men fell into the trench from above us, most of them with blood leaking out, and the unfortunate ones from fear. 

I peeked over the mud dug out closest to the enemy, and ducked down just as fast. A bullet whizzed overhead. ""There's one about fifty metres away,"" I told Lewis. 

He spat and nodded. ""I'll grab, you cover."" 

""I can come up with something el-""

""I'll grab, you cover,"" he said, climbing over the trench wall. 

Bastard. 

I peeked back up and slammed the trigger down on my AR. The shots sprayed into the set of sandbags near the greenie. He ducked down, but his eyes suggested he'd spotted Lewis. I kept the pressure on as Lewis closed the distance. The man tried to peek again, but my relentless waste of ammo kept him at bay. Lewis reached the bags and went over the top to do melee. I kept my AR up, spraying down any nearby assailants. One of the buggers was clever enough to lob a nade Lewis's way. The explosion sent the dirt spraying like water. 

My heart thudded in my chest. If that bastard killed him he'd pay with every inch of his being. I waited for Lewis to come up, but there was no sight. Just as I was about to turn away and grab a rocket launcher from the Trench supplies, his shaky form slumped back over the bags. He dragged a body behind him -the greenie!

I pulled my AR back out spraying as Lewis ran toward me. Bullets whizzed past my head, one skimmed the side of my neck, I ignored the burn and slammed slugs until my gun clicked empty. 

Lewis lobbed the body over the Trench walls and then came toppling down after. He gasped for air as he remained flat in the dirt. 

""You're a moron. A brave one, but still a moron,"" I said, ducking down. 

He grinned at the greenie who had been woken from the fall and was now trying to crawl out of the pit. I slammed my boot on the back of the greenies neck. His face sunk into the dirt. ""Not so fast, you green sack'a shit."" 

The man squeezed his face out of the mud and spat a mouthful. ""Sack'a shit?"" he said. ""Least I'm not a woman voting bastard."" ",0_fox_are_given

[IP] Welcome Home,Syraphia,"I hated it all, from the dirt smelling cockpit to the Major screaming idiotic orders through the communication system. He had yet to learn that it was a tool for directions during high-stress situations, not a live status feed about how he was feeling. I was about two comments away from punching a hole in my control panel or telling him to shove a Fox one up his Fuselage. 

""They tellin me that I gotta go to London to meet Superior Jarald. Bloody Jarald, what kind of a name is that? If me mother named me that, I woulda slapped her straight for namin a kid on the piss,"" Major Chester said. 

He was met with a few minutes of silence. In which we all thought about his plane being blown up or his control wheel going stiff and him landing on a deserted island with no satellite feed. Eventually, someone worked up the courage to question him. ""Errr. . . Major Chester, sir?"" 

""Aye, you talking to me?""

""Sir, you wouldn't happen to be flying while under the influence would you?"" 

""I've heard some accusations in a time of mine. You won't be receiving a thanksgiving wish from me this year, if you kept talkin like that, boy."" 

I ground my teeth as the sausage-faced ball buster with a patch of hair missing in the middle of his head went on about how he was sober. A three-year-old could decipher that he was more sloshed than a bunch of teeny boppers after half a can of bourbon. And the whole facade was driving me over the edge, I'd had enough. 

""Major, it's pretty damn obvious you're shit faced."" 

Silence. 

""Who said that? We been attack by aliens?"" 

I sighed. ""This is First Liutenant Saith."" 

""Saith? See now, if me mam named me that, I would knocked her upside down and back to town. Shucks, I might have climbed back inside the womb if I'd heard that one soon enough.""

I closed my eyes and kept my hands steady on the control stick. My temple throbbed as he droned on about how ridiculous my name was. I wanted to tell him he sounded like a british-american moron who had skipped fifth grade english. But, thankfully, my army training remained with me.

""The fact is that you're drunk, Major."" 

Major Chester snarled on the other side of the line. ""The hell are you going to do about it?"" 

We all sat in silence, and once again, no one spoke up. There were at least five others on this feed, but I guess we all knew the implications of what he was saying. To report him would be to snitch, and as he was a Major it would be pretty damn hard to take him down without witnesses to the act. Lieutenants could get dropped without a second thought. 

Thing is, I never got into this business to assimilate. I came here because I wanted to keep the skies safe and make sure my people at home could sleep easy. ""I'll report you, Major."" 

""OH YEAH? Take a *back* to *trip base* and think about that!"" 

Someone cleared their throat over the line. ""Did you mean 'take a trip back to base?'""

""You get the point!"" Chester said. 

I most definitely did. I soared back toward home base, with my own morals on the cards and the security of my job in question. To be honest, second thoughts ran through my mind during that trip back, and it was only when I saw my two boys waiting for me that I knew what I had to do. 

Spot and Rex almost knocked me off the landing dock when I got out the plane. One was a Lab and the other a bulldog, and they were the closest I had to family -my two pups. They say dogs are a mans best friend, and sometimes I wish men could be as loyal as they were. 

""We've got work to do, boys,"" I told em. And then we walked away from the sunset and back into the main base. Hopefully the general would still be around. ",0_fox_are_given
[WP] You are a genius who makes yourself immortal; unfortunately over a few hundred years the average IQ rises so high that you are now considered an idiot.,no-offence,"""Grandad, can you tell me about when you were little?"" Timmy said, hopping up onto my lap. 

I knew it was a ploy to get at my eggs and bacon. The look his mother gave from near the kitchen sink confirmed as much, however, I couldn't help but oblige the kid. It was boring enough being an old man, especially after having lived a few hundred years -to my own knowledge, of course. 

""Now, now, Tim-"" my daughter in law started. 

I waved her off. ""It's okay, Cherryl, anytime a grandson of mine wants to hear a story, he'll get one."" Timmy grinned up at me and then shot his Mum an apologetic glance. 

Cheryll feigned disappointment, but then gave him a cheeky smile and left the kitchen. I thought back to my favourite story, the story of how I became who I am today. 

It felt good to remember I was more than a crossword doing, coffee drinking, pants pooping idiot for a few moments. So I went right back to the beginning and told my boy the tale. 

----

It started when I was eleven years old. As a young child with few friends, I often found comfort in the covers of books and worlds of stories. I wasn't a writer or a poet, but simply a reader, and in that regard, I read near everything I could get my hands on. 

I cleared out the local library in just one year, demolishing the science fiction, crime, and fantasy sections with my incredible reading capability. And when I had nothing else to do, I began picking apart the historical books. The biographies of presidents and other famous people, like the man who created virgin airways or that fella who escaped Alcatraz never to be found. 

These books left me with even more food for thought than the novels filled with magic did. The world became a realm of impossible possibilities. It sounds funny, a little silly, in fact. But every corridor, nook, and cranny, shed, and attic became a realm of exploration. 

I would spend hours sneaking through the possessions of neighbors, family members, even my own home. I paid for it dearly, in smacks and sometimes bruised knuckles, or a tender head. But I learned how to sneak without being caught and soon I was as much a shadow as I wanted to be. There wasn't a place I couldn't get in and out of with nothing but my own hands and eyes. 

The day I heard a few boys at the mall talking about an old man on 7th street who had a pool of magic in his attic, was the day I finally found something worth using my skills for. At this particular time, I had weened off the sneaking, but nothing stirred me like a mystery and so that night, I visited 7th street. 

Boy oh boy, how I might change things now.

The eggs had grown cold as had the bacon. Timmy looked at me with big eyes and an open jaw. ""Come on Grandad, what next?"" 

""Now, now, you only asked for a short story about when I was young. Time to eat up before your Mum gives us the wooden spoon."" 

Timmy folded his arms and pouted. ""No fair.""

I chuckled. There was a movement behind that caught my eye; instinctively, I snapped my head in the direction of the disturbance. 

""Geez, Paps, you can't stop there,"" Daniel, my son, said. He sat down at the table and flicked a strip of bacon into his mouth. 

""Daaad!"" Timmy groaned. 

Daniel had always been a mischevious boy and he hadn't lost his charm as a father. I couldn't have been more proud. So often, adults forgot that their humor and joy was what made them special in the first place. Just like my Timmy, a bundle of emotions, a glimpse of life. 

""Why don't we let Papa continue his story,"" Daniel said. 

Timmy held a finger to his chin and then nodded. 

I chuckled. ""Tis a long story you two.""

Daniel leaned back with his hands behind his head, Timmy tried to copy him. ""We've got all morning, Paps, and plus you never talk about your past. I'm all ears.""

They were serious about this, and I owed them a little snippet. Not too much, but just enough. ""Alright, here we go.""

"[WP] ""They said I was crazy. They were right, but that doesn't mean that I was wrong.""",TheRealJasonBourne,"My door, then two corridors down, a locked gate, and pray that the guard doesn't wake. It was a complete disaster of a plan, so much so that I considered jamming a toothbrush in my eye and calling it a day. But the world needed to know what was in store for them; the robed wizard wouldn't win this time around. 

I recounted the plan once more in a haze of depressants and then sprung off my bed. The crack under the door remained dark and silent. A roaming guard would most likely be on the west wing, a false tip-off I had leaked earlier today. I snapped the room key from between two cheeks and slid it into the lock. The door came open without a sound. 

There was a cough from next door. 

I all but had a heart attack. You'd think the other prisoners would know when to shut up. The hairs on the back of my neck remained in attention. And my ears scoured the darkness ahead for a mouse squeak. When none came, I stepped forward into the black swamp and paused. 

I could go tomorrow instead. The tip off might have been obvious, maybe the guard was waiting around the corner with a smirk on his face and his baton at the ready. The robed wizard was probably in his chamber preparing the cold magic he used. Tomorrow might be better, safer. 

The cough came again from that particular prison cell. 

I gritted my teeth. To be like one of them was worse than death. A prisoner forced to live out his days like a neutered calf. Tomorrow was too far away. 

The corridors were as dark as the hallway. I ran my hand along the walls, making sure that I took the correct turns. I knew I had when a crack of light spilled into the darkness. I pressed up against the wall and walked to the edge. The guard had his back to me with a magazine open and a cup of black magic broth on his desk. The broth would sustain him throughout the night, my plans were foiled. 

Something sounded from behind me, a cough again. I spun in the direction of the noise. Someone flicked a light on one corridor over, their footsteps echoed as they approached. 

My heart raced. It was either go back and face whoever, or try and sneak past the guard. Either way, I was screwed. 

I crouched and then snuck up to the gate, my last way out. I slid the golden key into the lock and inched it to the right. The lock slid free without a sound. The guard reached for his broth and then craned his neck toward me. I tensed my muscles, ready to pounce. However, he simply cracked his neck on either side and then took a drink of the foul mixture. 

This was my chance to kill and be free. 

I pulled the gate forward. It grated the ground. The guard shot up and spun toward me with his hot broth in his hand. I punched at the cup with all my might and sent it flying in his face. He screamed. And as this was my only chance, I made a run for it. 

The exit doors were like large stone tablets, a barrier which could stop the assault of any foe. I braced my shoulder for impact. With all my might, I  could barrel through and be free forever. The gaurd's screams from behind changed into shouts for help. I charged at the stone. As I smashed into it, all the wind burst free of my lungs, my vision was filled with stars, and I hit the floor in a mess. 

The last thing I remember, is the two white walls transform into giants that laughed at me. I didn't take into account that they might be alive.

Doctor Marshall guided the sedated patient back to his wardroom with the help of the nurses. He wasn't sure what to do for Max anymore, the man was always trying to break out or attack the volunteers. 

Max fought against the bonds, he shouted at the nurses, ""The wizard will never get me! I will defeat you evil bastards!""

The Doctor pulled the tram into the room in silence before delivering the sedative mixture to the patient. He had grown tired of arguing with Max, everything he said was either a spell or some means of deception. 

""Maybe we should have him transferred?"" one of the nurses suggested. ""That's the third time now, doc.""

Doctor Marshal sighed, but in the end he was left with no option but to agree. ""I'll call the nearest facility and have him transferred by morning. Maybe he'll finally believe he's been set free.""
