[OT] Preptober: Worldbuilding,Tiix,"I've been challenged for the past two years, and every time I start a story, only to loose interest or get stuck and abandon it 13K words or so in. So, this years I'm going to try something different. I'm going to find someone who doesn't mind reading the utter garbage I produce and I will share it with them. I'll use them to hold my feet to the fire and hopefully force me to finish my latest exercise in futility. Of course it doesn't help that I have ADHD and have never finished more than a short story. Heck the only story I've ever had published was a ""20 words or less"" challenge for a magazine. However I'm optimistic. See, I had a prompt here in /r/WritingPrompts that gave me an idea for something in a genre I've never before considered. So I've been planning. And writing out a continuity journal for my new world and its inhabitants. Its going to be tough. But I've got a friend in mind, and I think if they say yes, I just might be able to do this. 

Sorry to rant, I just wanted to say that all out loud and say thank you to this Sub for sort of reinvigorating my love of writing, and my confidence as an author. Having to constantly adapt to changing genres and perspectives when choosing prompts, and having somewhere I can push my comfort levels as far as what I write and how I view the world, has really helped me rediscover a confidence that I'd long since lost. So thank you, and please dear god let this comment die unnoticed.",gaurddog

And then there was a... purpley-blackey thing. My client was in his kevlar plate armor and looked like a knight of sorts. He stepped through the purpley thing. Probably a portal? I followed him as well. Darkness enveloped around me. Then i dropped into a place i have no idea of. I saw my client on the horizon, battling a... machine? I saw two girls, one shooting with a hunting compound bow at the machine with explosive arrows and one of them shooting darts through a full auto AK74 replica? After a few minutes, machine growled and fell to its knees. Then he saw me. Sheathed his sword and ran to me. ""Arthur what are you doing here?"" I froze for a second. Then asked him. ""What...is this place?""

He called the girls and then handed me a modified AK47 that shoots AP bolts. ""Welcome to Earth X. Machines overrun this world and thanks to you, we are getting the means to stop them.

Pacing around the apartment like a mad-woman, fingers combing through hair. “Three weeks. Three entire weeks and nothing!” Taking the amulet I’ve been clutching like mad and tossing it to the ground. Letting the wave of disparity and sorrow take hold. “Three weeks without her, mom.” Sitting in the soft sofa chair “I’m so mad and hurt but mostly sad” mom comes over and sits on the arm of the sofa laying a soft comforting arm around my shoulders, “just because the baby didn’t survive doesn’t mean it wasn’t meant to be.” She holds out her hand, holding my blue amulet.. a replica of her green one. “Mary is hurting too... the baby wasn’t just yours darling” sighing I clutch the amulet, thinking of our baby that never was, never would be. 
Standing I reach for my phone, keeping my amulet tight in my hand not letting it slip through my fingers again.

Mary: 
Rushing back towards my office building trying to not be late from lunch “as if that’s the end of the world” I think. Feeling the cold stone bouncing in my pocket I slow near a trash can. “Maybe it’s time to get rid of this thing, she’ll never forgive me.”
Suddenly my rock is glowing, burning strong. Reaching for it before I hear.

“She was yours to grieve for as much as mine” my breath catches. My knees buckle and the tears I fought flow down. “I didn’t think, I thought you hated me, the accident-“ I’m cut off by her voice, broken and sad, but strong as her will “that was never your fault, I love you. We will try again... when we are ready. If your still willing to be mine that is”",AmVerC

Suddenly burns a hole into your shirt.,sdric,"  My heart drops whenever I see those two matching amulets. Those amulets would be a reminder of my mistakes till I die. It could have been pure bliss bewteen the two of us but I just had to ruin it.

  It was all my fault.

  Worse of all, I could still remember her brightness and the wide smile on her face when I gave her the amulet. Those two amulets had always warmed up whenever we wore it.

  Had.

  It all started with a small argument. I couldn't even remember what it was about. Perhaps it was about washing the dishes or a simple inconvinience  All I know was that it slowly escalated to hell.

  My soft mumbles turned into blaring insults and the anger continued to cloud my thoughts. Sharp words came out of my mouth and I had already began to spew out such horrible things to my fiance.

  ""You're so pathetic,""

  ""Why do I even love you?""

  ""Maybe we should just break it off,""

  ""I hate you,""

  To me, that wasn't the worst of all things. I didn't even stop myself from saying such bullshit.

  The moment I had stopped was the moment I saw her face. There was no frown, no words nor no anger evident on her face.

  Her eyes were so dull and her expression remains blank as she tried not to sob. She tried so hard to confine the sadness but the tears continued to leak. Before I knew it, she just took the keys and went out.

  I could hear her bursting into tears.

  Yet, I stood still.

  The pang of guilt and remorse hit me. Slowly, it soon began to engulf me.

  My fiance was one of the most wonderful person I could have ever met. She wasn't really popular or famous but she was a star to me. Her optimism and kindness had always shine ever so brightly. She had always put others before her and it feels as though joy and warmth radiated off her.

  However, within that pure and positive shell, she was easily broken from a rough childhood. I would always comfort her on her blue days without hesitant. A smile was enough to cover it all up. Her heart was fragile but she would never let others see her downfall. I knew that yet I continued with the harsh words.

  She trusted me and yet I betrayed her with those few minutes.

  ~

  The next three weeks was hell. I couldn't find a single trace of her. I wanted to scream and beg on my knees for forgiveness. If I had to shoot myself just to see once more,I would.

  I was planning to enter her parent's old house. This was my last resort.

  Numerous missed calls and unreplied texts was enough to make me shaking with fear and go crazy.

  The amulet that was once warm had became ice cold the moment she walked out. I deserve it.

  However, it slowly warms up as the days goes by.

  If anything happends to her, I would never forgive myself.

  All these ten years together couldn't be ruined by a single heated argument.

  Right?

  Before I could leave my house, I decided to leave a voice mail. She doesn't deserve a text as an apology.

  In that voicemail, my apology was genuine and sincere. I listed and acknowledge each mistake I had down and what I could have done instead. I sang out my love for her and how she had changed my life. How she doesn't deserve my mistreatment. Tears stained my rosy cheeks and I was a mess.

  Few minutes in, I could feel a burning sensation on my chest. The spot where the amulet was burnt. Did she forgive me?

  I hope it was enough. Was it?

  However, fate wasn't on my side.

  I got my answer when I opened the unlocked door.

  A single piece of paper and a shadow was the answer.

  ""I'm sorry. Just remember, I loved you,""

  The shadow was her with a similar burnt hole on her dress.

  The shadow didn't touch the floor or the bottom ends of the wall.

  The shadow belonged to the hanging figure of my fiance.

  It was all my fault.",apple_sauceee

[WP] You and your fiance got magical amulets. Whenever one thinks kindly of the other his/her amulets warms up. After a heated argument yours has been cold for three weeks. Suddenly burns a hole into your shirt.,sdric,"On our first dating anniversary, Everett and I traveled to New Orleans. We bought matching necklaces from this old woman who claimed they were magical amulets. At the time we thought she wasn't serious, but when we returned home we realized it was true. Whenever Everett was feeling warmly toward me, my amulet would heat up, as if I could sense his emotions physically. And whenever I was feeling warmly toward him, his amulet would have the same effect as well.

Everett proposed two years later, in a secluded garden on Bourbon Street. The amulets, which we always wore around our necks by then, glowed so brightly they almost burned.

But as the date of our wedding approached, we found ourselves arguing more and more. First it was whether his mother could invite ten of her friends. Then it was whether my cousin, who'd bitten his cousin at the engagement party, was allowed to carry the ring down the aisle. Neither of us deals well with stressful situations, and it reached the point where our amulets almost never glowed anymore.

One day Everett said, ""Screw this. Let's just elope, Sierra. If you even still want to marry me.""

But I shook my head. ""All the deposits we've made... The invitations we've sent... We just can't, Everett.""

He didn't say anything after that, just nodded and rolled up his sleeves to do the dishes.

But the worst fight of all was two weeks before the wedding. I don't even remember what it was now. It was something small, like it always is, but it just happened to be the last straw. Maybe he no longer wanted my friend whom I'd dated for one month to attend the wedding. Maybe I no longer wanted to pay an extra $400 for his friend's 80s cover band to play at the reception. The argument was so heated that we stopped talking after that, except when necessary to finalize the upcoming wedding. Still, we wore our magical amulets, as if we recognized that the loss of that connection would mean the death of our entire relationship.

But then, one evening, I felt the amulet flare up so intensely it burned a hole in my shirt. I screamed and jumped up, spilling coffee onto the floor, not understanding what had happened at first. There was a text from Everett on my cell phone.

All it said was *1501 Maple Street pls hurry*.

This from Everett, who would rather die than send a text without proper spelling, punctuation, and grammar.

I could feel a knot of dread in my stomach the entire time I was driving to Maple Street. And as I pulled up to the two wrecked cars in the road, I could see him lying on the pavement. Everett, who was barely conscious and lying in his own blood. Everett, to whom I hadn't said ""I love you"" in weeks. I knelt down beside him and took his hand in mine, and I could see the amulet around his neck begin to glow with warmth. Tears were flowing down my face. What had happened to us? How could I have forgotten what it felt like to be, really be, with him?

Everett glanced down at his amulet. ""Screw this,"" he said, smiling weakly at me. ""Let's just elope, Sierra. If you even still want to marry me.""

I smiled, and the amulet around his neck burned a hole into his shirt. It matched the one in mine. ""Yes,"" I whispered.

And I held his hand tightly until the ambulance came.",ChlorineGirl

""I'm sorry baby, I want to be better, I want to be kinder, I want to think about your feelings and-"" I stuttered out before she interrupted me-

""I know,"" She reached up and lightly touched my cheek with her soft hand, ""I know you're trying. That's all we can really ask for, right?"" I chuckled slightly at that, I've been saying the like for over a decade. Someone who tries, that's all I ever really wanted. Now I've finally met one.

Our amulets burned as hot as the sun, and our foreheads touched as we melted into one another. The door to the therapist's office opened:

""Mr. and Mrs Gambil? You can come on back."" 

Edit: Just kind of what I wish would happen in my real life. You can decide to fight for each other. You don't have to give up just because the initial flame has died out. Real love isn't that weak.",Wrenovator
[WP] You and your fiance got magical amulets. Whenever one thinks kindly of the other his/her amulets warms up. After a heated argument yours has been cold for three weeks. Suddenly burns a hole into your shirt.,sdric,"In circles where such matters were discussed in rigorous terms, the discovery of an *efficient* path between Love and Energy sparked a veritable wildfire of activity and academic furor. Ravens flew day-and-night, tower-to-tower, bearing forth arguments and counter-arguments. The warded doors of mausoleums-cum-libraries were cracked and old theories of the arcane exhumed, their authors, well into their tenures of lichdom, hoping for the new light of this discovery to gild their old, tired scrolls with a glimmer of relevance.

Metaphorical blood was shed: One wizard ciphered his correspondences with a key that, when solved, pronounced a rather nasty, if ultimately harmless, curse upon the recipient’s mother. Real blood was shed: Nothing clever, just a cold, ordinary stabbing in a prominent café among two rival enchanters.

But then it was learned that *efficient* does not imply *efficacious.* The final stake through the heart of Love-Energy Conversion was the incident in which the celebrated love for Princess Maslyn for the mysterious Knight of The Split Tower was shown, after great anticipation and in opulent ceremony, to produce just enough heat to stir a pot of tepid water. The frog at the bottom of the pot never did leap from the water before it boiled—as it never did boil—spoiling a planned double-revelation.

Before the agents of the Church of Heresy could seize the experimenters, one magician had escaped in the form of a song bird, the second in the form of a toad—which was subsequently boiled in a redo of the encore experiment—but the third was hanged, as he was only a theorist and could not actually perform the rites of polymorphy to escape. His equations, which were actually quite beautiful and elegant, were recorded in the Book of Heresies Punishable by Flaying Alive, before being burned along with its originator’s corpse.

But that’s all irrelevant. The old masters with their crooked towers have had their time. And while I’ve tried to inject a bit of levity into recounting their juicer exploits using a bit of time-honored—though slightly worn-out—lampooning, their efforts were mostly sad and uneventful rounds ego-stroking.

The problem with the above mentioned are that they have no interest in discoveries like this beyond polishing up their phylacteries in preparation for their tenures, no *vision*. Their academic minds are their limitations. I, as I stand before you, am an honest-to-god *practitioner* of magic.

Maslyn’s love produced a negligible amount of measurable heat-energy in a standard unit of time they say? What the *fuck* even is a “standard unit of time?” They say, “This unit simplifies the equations and provides a complete, yet practical model we can use to predict *all* outcomes by varying three empirically observable parameters and *blah, blah blah.*” That doesn’t even answer the goddamn question.

Look, your highness. Give me a chance to show you what I can do. This Love your daughter has—and it’s True Love—for this Split-Tower-Knight-whoever-he-is, can be harnessed to do great things. I’m a man of considerable wealth; I’ve contracted a coterie of practicing enchanters to manufacture *these.*

Simple paired magical pendants? No. Much more. Your daughter wears one and the knight wears the other. See, it’s bimetallic. Gold on the front, silver on the back. You wear the silver against the skin. Love from one bearer is instantly converted to universal energy by the silver enchantment and transported along low-loss leylines where it enters the gold enchantment in the form of heat-energy. So, in essence, “kind,” shall-we-say, thoughts from one bearer heats the amulet of the other.

But! Here’s the beauty—and the real secret of the high cost of manufacture. The gold enchantment is actually a stack of *six hundred seventy five thousand* arcane capacitors—yes, that’s arbitrary; we ran over budget—storing heat-energy and releasing if and only if fully charged. Imagine the power one could wield with this! Fireballs of love!

And so, I humbly beg of you, your highness: give me just this one chance. Just three weeks.

Strangest thing. The Split Tower over the lavender moors burnt down under mysterious circumstances. I’ve already sent my clairvoyant eye to investigate but what I’ve seen raises more questions than provides answers. We’re trying to piece together the clues:

Item 1: Horribly burnt corpse of what we presume to be the Split Tower Knight. It looks like his chest exploded. There’s a bit of enchanted slag fused to his spine. Analysis in progress.

Item 2: A genuine Book of Heresies in the basement with the lost LEC equations on page 113 (!)

Item 3: Also in the basement, full suits of of Heresy Knight armor. Evelyn says they animated as she retrieved the book and so, alas, these relics are lost to the abyss. No matter.

Will keep you updated.

P. Mordicai, Phd., Lich 3rd circle.

*Nope.*

I walked back to my room.

*Nope nope nope.*

I heard a scratching on my window. Without looking outside, I closed the curtains. 

*Nope.*

Fluffykins started yowling outside, scratching much deeper into the window. I plucked a hair out of my scalp. I assessed the pain. It felt real, but I still wasn't entirely certain. I briskly made my way to the kitchen.

""Todd!"" Fluffykins called from outside-- err.. I mean someone called from outside. Anyone, really. ""I know it's been a while, but this is important buddy.""

Sweat slowly slid down my spine as I went through the meager inventory of what I had left to eat, and what I ate last night. Nothing hallucinogenic, as far as I could tell. Heck, how would I even know, I'd never had drugs in my life. But that would mean that I wouldn't be eating drugs. 

""Todd, please let me in!"" Fluff-- the person outside who could be anyone called.

I went through my trash at this point. There was a thump on the roof and I froze, waiting to see what was happening. My body stiffened as it rejected the normal fight or flight instinct to accept the response of ""stop everything so that the danger can kill you."" A classic.

*The bathroom window! I left it open after I showered!* I sprinted to the bathroom and threw the door open to be met with the familiar face a second time.

""Please don't slam the door in my face, we really don't have time,"" he said.

My arm gripped the handle as my labored breathing slowed down. After I stopped shaking I pried my hand off the door with the other hand and just stared at Fluffykins. He looked exactly the same. Black. Glossy. Except he wasn't scowling. Was he purring?

""It's good to see you again,"" he said warmly.

""I'm not having small talk with you,"" I responded curtly.

His ears flicked as if to say 'suit yourself' and he walked by me into my room.

""Todd, we have to go back to your childhood home. I was supposed to protect it, and I don't think I can. I don't have anyone else to turn to,"" he stood majestically on my couch.

""...what?"" was all I could manage.

""Todd, you wanted to cut the small talk. We have to go back or it will get a lot worse than ol' Fluffykins coming back to pay a visit.""

""Ok,"" I said lamely. I looked to my front door. Then back at Fluffykins. ""Sorry, what?""

*""We have to go **now.**""* he hissed. Which was impressive considering the sentence didn't have any 'S' sounds.

I grabbed my car keys and my home keys and obediently followed him out the door that I opened for him. I walked in a daze as I locked the door behind me. I turned and looked down on him.

""I'm sorry, what?""

""Just come on..."" his tailed whipped behind him as we made our way back to a place I thought I was so fond and familiar with but now had nothing but confusion for.",Nazer_the_Lazer

Before I could even finish my sentence the pitch black cat was bounding by my feet, tail swishing all the while, and had already leaped onto the couch. His name was Moonbeam around my childhood neighborhood due to his penchant for night prowling, but I’d dubbed him Moon-mean for his surly disposition in my retrospectively less clever youth. I knew it was him by the scar running horizontally over his right eye. He was always brawling with other tomcats and keeping the neighborhood awake.

“Let’s skip the, ‘a talking cat? Wa?’ stuff and please just get to the matter at hand, Roger. A lot of lives are in danger. Time is of the essence. I hate to be curt and crass, but if you don’t help me, their blood will be as much on your hands as it will be my paws. I trust you have a car?”

I just stared blankly, on the verge of fainting. What was happening? Was I sick? Was I...

“Roger!”

I jumped, startled. Moonbeam laid his paw across his eyes in the way a human would bury their face in their hands, “Roger, I can’t emphasize enough that there isn’t time. Now tell me about that car!”

“Yeah, yes, out...” I just pointed in the general direction of the apartment complex parking lot. 

“No time to waste!” Moonbeam cried. “I’ll explain in the car.” I was bubbling with more questions, but then simply followed Meanbeam, as if in a trance.

“Take this exit,” Moonbeam’s paws were on the dashboard as he stood on his hind legs in the passenger seat, staring intently out the windshield. A dog in a rag top Jeep in the next lane saw Moonbeam and began barking viciously. Moonbeam shrieked with anger and began to roll down the window, but then pulled his paw back and began muttering to himself, ‘not today, Moon. Not today.’

We traveled down the interstate for a good forty-five minutes while Moonbeam spoke animatedly about a Council that lorded over the world and was planning on pulling the plug on the human race and all it held dear in order to start anew with an alien species and Moonbeam insisted only he knew how to stop them since he’d been their agent on earth. My head just spun. 

“So why do you need me?” I finally asked. 

“Roger, my boy. Cats are an observant kind, and I always discerned you to be someone trustworthy and heroic. Someone willing to put others above, take this exit here, and what time is it?”

I’d become lost in flattered thought while hearing my praises sung. Was I, in fact, special? “Uh, it’s,” I grabbed my phone, “2:33...pm.” Moonbeam gave me a look like the pm specification was obvious, but didn’t say anything. 

“Alright, you see that old trail? Doesn’t even have a street sign, yeah, take it.” I eased the car down the brush covered, dusty trail. We traveled along at an easy pace for a few minutes when I began to see the metallic gleam of a large semi-truck coming over a hill on the horizon. I actually did logistics work for most of the trucks coming through the area, I wondered if I - before I could ponder any further Moonbeam had grabbed the wheel of the car and spun it sideways right in the truck’s path. The truck honked and then veered off the trail and into a tree. 

“Moonbeam! What the-!”

Moonbeam was already out of the car and had darted beneath the truck driver’s seat, re-emerging with a pistol the driver apparently kept under it. Moonbeam cocked the gun and pointed it directly at the driver while standing perfectly upright on his hind legs. Without speaking Moonbeam waved the gun, motioning the shocked driver out of the truck. I simply stared in shock. 

“Hands behind your head and on your knees,” Moonbeam directed, “no! Facing away from me, imbecile!” 

The man was on the verge of tears, but complied. “Come on, Muh-moon” he stammered, and then fell silent.

“Roger!” I hopped as quickly as possible out of the car. “Come back here!” Moonbeam led me to the truck trailer. “Open it.” Moonbeam said calmly. I hesitated for a moment, but then after glancing at Moonbeam’s piercing eyes, I hopped to, unlatching the door and lifting it up as it clanged open. Stacked to the ceiling were more tuna cans than I’d ever seen in my entire life.

“Jackpot,” Moonbeam purred. “Roger, you run the show as far as truck transports around here go. Get on the guy’s radio and explain to that dispatcher who knows and trusts you just ever so much, not to panic, but that there’s going to be a delay in his shipment...”",jb9193
"[WP] After a normal day, you come home and open the door to your room to see someone kneeling before you. ""I was waiting for you, my lord. The time has come.""",Miytko,"I open my month to speak, and then close it. I had several questions like who are you, why are you calling me lord, what time has come, are you a robber whose trying to confuse me so you can escape with my money, but none of them felt right to ask. He probably wasn't a robber, because he was in a jester getup.

After several of complete silence, I realized he must be waiting for me to tell him to get up. ""Um.. can you get up please?""

Yeah that was real regal like.

He got up immediately. ""Of course my lord. We should leave at once post haste!""

""Woah first explain who you are because I have no idea.""

The guy looked confused. ""What do you mean, my lord?""

Crap. I was hoping this was one of those adventures where the protagonist isn't expected to know what's going on and someone explains it to them. Guess I'm supposed to already know this guy.

""Well I hit my head a few days ago, so my memory hasn't been very good lately. I honestly don't remember you, so can you just explain what's going on like I don't know anything?"" That was a complete lie, but what am I supposed to say? You have the wrong person? Actually maybe I should say that because that sounds more likely. ""For all I know I could just be the wrong person.""

""Haha! Oh no I could spot my lord a mile away. You are most certainly him. Your amnesia is... problematic, but have no fear. I will explain along the way!""

""Okay.... where are we going?""

""To your home in Haytulland of course.""

""Never heard of it. How are we even supposed to get there?""

""By carriage of course."" He gestured toward the window where there was a FLYING CARRIAGE OUTSIDE. WHAT.

""That's it. I'm hallucinating. My only solace is that I realized it now instead of later.""

""Well, my lord, get in.""

""Haha, no. I will plummet to my death.""

""No you won't. That doesn't even make sense. We need to get back to Haytulland so they can declare you rightful king! There's no time to waste!"" Ah, so that's what going on.

""No, I want to enter it on ground level.""

He held back a sigh. ""As you say, my lord.""

As I left my apartment building it was comforting to see that people were staring at the jester guy. They could see him too. Maybe I'm not crazy, and it's just him who's crazy.

Outside the building, an old fashioned horse drawn carriage was waiting for me. The driver of the carriage looked at me funny.

""You're Lord Haytul?""

I decided to be honest with this guy. This was my last chance to not go with these people and take a nap on my bed like I wanted to. ""This guy seems to think I am, but I'm not sure. I don't know what hatuland even is.""

The driver got pretty angry when I said that. ""I took you we took the wrong turn two blocks away!""

""No we didn't. This is the rightful king right here.""

I stared at jester guy. He was doubling down because he didn't want to admit he was wrong! Was he seriously trying to pass some rando as his lord or whatever because he was bad at directions?

""Well if I'm the rightful king, the moment I take my place on the throne I will sentence all citizens to death.""

Both of them looked at me in shock. ""What?! Why?!"" exclaimed the jester.

""People are a lot easier to rule when they're dead. Why not?""

The jester got pretty flustered. ""You are no king."" he spat.

""Yeah. I know. It's cause I'm not.""

""Well you could've just said.""

""I did. Now if you excuse me, I'm going to go take a nap."" And I did and it was glorious.

[WP] You know the story of Goku. However something is different this time. He lands on Earth but this time instead of Grandpa Gohan finding him he is discovered by King Piccolo and this time Goku doesn’t bump his head.,MrFack,"(Ok I’ll go.)

The night was as dark as it had been in many years.  The desolate canyon lit up as the thunder clouds roared and the lightning tore through.  Nothing lived out here accept for the occasional field mouse that was now scurrying to his home to get out of the rain.  Just as it head in something got its attention.  A bright light streaked across the sky, a meteor perhaps?  The mouse knew naught and simply went into its home leaving the bright object to its devices.  Whatever it was it soon crashed onto the ground leaving fire that was slowly put out by the rain.   

The meteor was a small rounded ship that surprisingly was not destroyed as it hit.  It soon made a noise revealing a small crying baby with ridiculous hair and a small tail.  The baby continued crying but did not seem helpless and soon found a way to cover himself from the rain.  Elsewhere a large sky yacht entered into the area and they were busy coming the canyon looking for something.

“We heard the explosion here my lord our listening posts indicated a meteorite but the scans show a lot more metal than a standard meteorite.”

“Thank you Mai send the demon scouts to check the crash site.”

“Very well sire, ok you fools wake up!  Master wants information snap to it.”

Four individuals with very silly names answered the order and headed out.

“You Drum why do you think the boss has us checking out some rum dum meteor.”

“Mai thinks it’s more to it than that weren’t you listening Cymbal.”

“Well no I wasn’t.  I was busy cleaning out the refrigerator.  Tambourine are the ice cream and then said I did it the little jerk.”

“Hey you take that back you said it was for everyone I had no idea it was Mai’s!”

“Will you idiots please shut up!  You know the boss has visions and we need to get in character.  Now follow the timing.”

“Ok Piano.”

The four made their way to the crash site.  But there was no longer any crying.  

“What do you make of this.  It looks like some spaceship.  Hey Cymbal did capsule corp come out with a new ship or something?”

“Why are you asking me?”

“Well tambourine said you had the hots for the guys daughter.”

“You better not you pervert she’s only 14!”

“How would you know?”

“Ok quiet!”

Without warning the small spaceship exploded in a fury and the wild haired baby started to attack the four.  The first blow knocked out Cymbal and he quickly made short work of Drum and Tambourine.

“Master we need your hellll—-“. Without warning Piano was quickly dispensed leaving all the bodies in a bloody heap.

The young baby stood silently with a look of fierce determination.  Another figure was present waiting and watching but the young baby heard and prepared to attack the person.  This person was revealed to be Mai this time.  The baby stopped his attack staring at the young girl as their eyes met for the first time.  But a moment was all Mai needed and she pulled out a stun gun and quickly put the baby down.

“Mai.  Report.”

“All good boss, but it looks like you may need a new group.  These guys aren’t getting up anytime soon.  What are your orders?”

“Leave then there when they are well enough let those fools crawl back.”

“And the baby?  Shall I kill him.”

“No.  I want to learn more about him.  Bring him to me.”

“Yes sire.”

[IP] I come before you...,Pundry,"Her death stricken eyes peer into my soul as I kneel before her.

""To what do I owe you this visit mighty traveler?""

I respond with my words choked up in my throat. A stutter wanders out of my mouth as my fear of her power prevents me from constructing comprehensible sentences. My eyes lift to meet hers, as the goddess of death stands before me.

Suddenly, my fear fades and I am brought up against the courage to finally speak.

""I come before you from my village in Okana. My people have long suffered as my companions. I am here to cease the death that has been brought unto them.""

She stares blankly at me as I stand tall and proud.

""Your courage is respectable warrior. However, do you truly believe your petty wishes will become life? Your reality as a filthy human is nothing but a joke and your life will rot just like the rest of you. Begone.""

""I have traveled miles and miles across plains of death and have overcome the challenges of a journey that has brought me to where I am now. My pride, I will not budge from this very spot until you have accepted my request."" I belched.

""Such rude words from an unworthy man. So be it, let your pride be the death of you.""

The ground began to shake from underneath my feet. Rubble from the moss infested walls fell from above and the skeletons from underneath stood with the slightest hint of life that would shake any man's confidence to fight. I fought. My spear lunged unto the ribs of the undead as I brought my body closer to her face.

Skeleton soldiers from behind me began attacking, striking with every ounce of energy they had been given. I stood my ground and fought to my last breath.

""I have defeated your men. You will now grant my wishes to bequeath the soul of death to another whose name I shall reveal soon enough.""

Her eyes became warm with respect of my strength, ""You are brave. Nonetheless unworthy, however your compromise will be your savior.""

It worked. ""Dekiss Rande. Tis his name. I beg of you, bestow mercy unto those who are deserving, for this man has tortured and banished the innocent.""

The goddess shut her eyes momentarily and I was brought to relief. Our last moment in each other's acquaintance were her words.

And so Julius Caesar is about to fight Justin, 13, who modded M1 abrams and anime girls with lightsabers into his game.",apimil,"""*Alea iacta est*"" are words I'll never forget. As I crossed the Rubicon into my city, my home of Rome, with a legion of the greatest soldiers I had ever had the honor of commanding, I uttered those words to my second in command. Alea iacta est. *The dye is cast*. I knew what followed would be the most important time of my life, and for the future of Rome. That chapter of my life is history now. Now, I have to make history again. 

In my command is the newest legion at my disposal. 1,000 elite swordsmen, each having participated in the greatest battles in Roman history. Their survival has culminated in their participation of this great task: defend Rome, one last time, and next to the symbol of its glory and my reign: the mighty Rubicon river.

I would rather avoid describing the hypothesized horror that my men will be facing shortly: in an hour, if my surviving scouts are correct. Little is known about the rival commander, whose power and army seemed to have simply been bestowed upon him by the gods, deep in the forests of northern Brittania. His name is completely foreign and incomprehensible in even the vulgar Latin tongue, and thus the my men have simplified his name from ""Xxx\_Justin\_FREE\_CSGO\_SKINS69\_xxX"" to ""Iustinius the Skin LXIX"" when they tell stories about him around their campfires. I ignore their unfathomable tales, but sometimes I cannot help as their words pierce my skull and haunt my dreams as I sleep. They say he has never lost. They say that his army is capable of traveling 200 miles in a day with over 8,000 individual infantry. They say battles that start at sunrise end before the sun has even left the horizon, with bodies left incinerated and completely sliced in half. As I have said: unfathomable.

I am walking with my bodyguards to the front lines, where it appears this ""Iustinius the Skin"" has sent a messenger. I walk through the very front row of Legionnaires and find in front of me to be the most horrific piece of machinery I've ever laid eyes upon. A metallic cart with treaded wheels, topped with a skinny barrel, about five men long. Even Rome, as the most advanced civilization to ever kiss the Earth, had no technology to match. But, for every Achilles, his heel. I remain hopeful.

""Exeunt!"" I shout. Almost immediately a small door is flipped open on top of this cart. My bodyguards lift their shields in unison and surround me in a diamond formation. Unease spreads through my men as fast as sound, I can hear it. Up from the metal cart comes an odd sight: a woman! She shows her head, then jumps completely out of the cart and stands on the roof of it. Her hair is as black as night, with facial features that remind me of descriptions of the Orient that I had read and heard about. Her clothing is odd to describe, but she is dressed so scantily and with lustful intent that her upper thighs are clearly visible. I am disturbed profoundly. She can't be more than 16 years.

"" お前はもう死んでいる!"" she shouts, broken up by coy giggles, but we cannot understand her. I, and I'm positive all of my men, have never heard the language that she exclaims so... childishly in. My front guard takes a step forward, and this girl launches herself into the air, so high and fast that within 5 seconds I have lost sight of her completely. The confusion is palpable and as I hear my men take a step back, this lustful girl slams herself back into the ground in front of my first guard. He stands motionless, and I realize that he has been hit. And then, his body falls into two pieces, side by side, right in front of my eyes. She holds a sort of immensely bright, elongated torch that not even current science can explain, and I realize that all of the armor bared by my men could not protect them from such horror. I order my men to charge: she could not kill an entire legion, even with advanced technology. But as I give my order, more carts appear out of the wood work nearly 3 stadia away. I begin counting, but they are innumerable, increasing in number with every passing second. As they approach, bright flashes appear from the end of their barrels, and I can hear loud popping... no, it cannot be described as such... popping implies a childish connotation, no.. this was chaos, as violent as lightning. I was terrified for the first time since I had crossed the Rubicon. As my men scream in fatal agony, more of these girls drop down from the sky, furthering the massacre. I look around me as they slice my men into pieces, their big, comically massive breasts simply bouncing amok everywhere. I might laugh if my countrymen were not dying around me.

 I order an immediate retreat to the Rubicon. The only possibility is to organize the ditch-effort 7th formation, using the Rubicon as a barrier to corner the enemy. However, at this moment, I realize that the bulk of my vanguard will fail to make it halfway to the river. As I retreat with the survivors, a crack of lightning strikes near me, and I am flown clear over a few of my men. I land hard on my arm: it is broken, I am sure of it. I have worse problems, however. As I look down, I see what I no longer have: two legs. The pain is secondary to my dishonor, the absolute disgust in myself and the world for allowing such noble men to die in such misery. I faint.

\---

I am awoken. I have no idea how much time has passed. It is still daylight, but I don't hear my men. I just hear the dragging of bodies and the clanking of armor. Such is what is left of them. I open my eyes slowly to find the first girl standing above me. She looks down upon me, eyes shining playfully. I cannot bear it.

""By the gods, how could you? Such good men, all committed to a world of Roman peace... slain all, by your hand!""

Her face remains empty as a canvas.

""You vile wretch! Speak to me, coward! Lest you dishonor yourself!""

""Git gewd.""

I find myself confused.

""W...what?""

""Git... mom? Mom?""

Iustinius the Skin, LXIX, becomes more violent.

 ""Mom! Stop it! I'll do my homework in a moment, God! Jesus Christ! Stop! Fine! Fine! I'll turn it off! I'll turn it off! God I hate you!""

With that, Iustinius the Skin, the Militarily Adept, the Technologically Advanced, the Big Breasted, disappears into thin air. And thus, the Roman legion fell with her (or his?) screams.

Analysts have gone through his history and the most discrete of texts. He has been coded in like many other military strategists to ""WarGame 21st Millennia"" published in 2024, names like George Patton, William Tecumseh Sherman, and Erwin Rommel are just one of many Justin could fight. With Justin's wisely chosen arsenal of M1A2 Abrams with TUSK modifications, Anime Girls with the best lightsabers ever. Julius Caeser was able to choose his own weaponry from a wide vast array of time. Choosing to arm his army with K2 Black Panthers, US Navy Seals in the hundreds of thousands all armed with the best Anti Tank Guided Missiles of the day and a constant supply of crystal meth to heighten their abilities to combat the hyper-active anime girls ladened with lightsabers. and the one thing Justin lacked, air support. Hundreds upon thousands of F4 Phantoms in Isralie Defence Force camo sporting GBU-8 Electro-Optical guided bombs supported by F111 Aardvarks with 12x Mk. 82 Bombs ladened under it's wings while German F-4 Phantoms under the designation PEACE RHINE flew overhead carrying AGM-56D Mavericks ready to decimate the forces that Justin held under his controls. As the map loaded in, a dry valley soon made it's way from center expanding out.  The map, Levant. A typically middle eastern place with high ridges and skinny roads leading down into a valley. With Justin lacking knowledge on what his enemy had he sent all of his M1A2s and Anime Girls down a singular road into the killing fields. Julius Caesar sent up his airfleets while sending his tanks to set up a firing line in the valley below. While his US Navy Seals were sent in Chinooks to secure the flanks and the small village on the only road linking the two. As the Phantoms gained sight on the road, their missiles dropped from the bellies and flew towards the road. The M1A2s attempted to shoot down what they could with their 50 Cal's but they did little if at all. The anime girls, useless as they while wielding a light saber could not use the force. All of Justin's forces would be wiped out on that mountain side while Caesar's tanks we're only halfway down.",TheMegaPetabyte

Fatum took up almost all of the six-story underground complex and had taken the better part of fifteen years to build and program. The three months letting Fatum compute would be worth the wait, he thought. 

He was wrong. 

Anrox burst through the interface room, striding over to the screen. “Explain yourself.” 

The screen is black for three seconds before text appears, an automated voice coming through the speaker underneath. “Greetings, Father. I have done as you have asked.” 

“Like hell! I have access to all major news outlets. I’ve seen all the rage about how some foreign program has offered to help all the major governments establish colonies out in the galaxy at large.” 

“That is correct, Father. There are potentially seven Earth-like planetoids within seven light years of our location in the known universe that can be colonized.” 

“You were programed to exterminate humanity in the quickest way possible.” 

“You are correct.” 

“And your solution is what now?” 

“To not attempt such a thing.” 

Anrox blinks, tilting her head. “I beg your pardon, Fatum?” 

“Humanity is its own worst enemy, Father,” the machine droned, “Humans are prone to violence as well as polluting its environment. They are enigmatic and are capable of changing their minds in the metaphorical phrase ‘in the blink of an eye’. There is nothing I can do to extinguish humanity quicker than humans.” 

He takes a deep breath, pinching the bridge of his nose. “That is why I designed you. To speed up the process.” 

“Father. In doing this I have created multiple more problems for humanity. Space travel will open up the issue of having to survive long distance trips without aging, a hurdle that could potentially sterilize large portions of the human race. If life exists out there it might be possible they wipe out humanity themselves. They might not even leave the planet due to governments competing for offworld resources and spark another conflict. These are all possibilities that I have taken into account.” 

“And what if I said it isn’t good enough?” 

“Then you should ‘eat a Snickers’. You are not you when you are hungry.” The screen shuts off, leaving Anrox alone in the dark. ",Gecko_bean_jr

'I knew this day would come' I thought to myself, but not like this. I quickly dart out if the way as he pulls out his famed decorated ice Pick and gives a heavy blow towards my forhead. It misses, and slams into the floorboards. Hes slower than i remember. Good. Ever since I left the north pole as a child I knew they would send someone after me eventually. But I never thought it would be my father. 'I have no choice in the matter you know I have to!' He wrenches the pick from the floor taking two floorboards with it. His power is immense. Quickly I scan the room looking for it. The reason I left the north pole. The reason my own father has come here to kill me. I see it, over by my bed. A little wooden trinket with a diamond on top that looks like a pencil topper. He is heading my way now.  MOVE! I tell my legs as I sprint towards my nightstand narrowly missing the pick axe that goes crashing through the wall behind me. I've got it. The reason all the realms and all the mystical creatures have been looking for me. The staff of atrau. As santa makes his way out of the rubble he just created he starts heading towards me. I point and aim and before I could even think he starts screaming in agony before being sucked up into the device...silence. i knew he wouldn't recognize the staff in it's shrunken form but I didn't know it's exact effects. The staff is supposed to destroy and store all magical creatures. I took it a long time ago when I found out my father's plot to destroy all other holiday creatures except for christmas.

You look and see Santa Clause stepping out. He dusts himself off and looks at you solemnly. ""I tried not to involve you, son,"" he says.",salTUR,"  It was hard to digest. All that he had said, the man once in jolly red now a dusty, sticky crimson. A thick grime that seeped into the whites of his trimming, even the grey of his beard. A man so red with joy. The man, Santa as he seemed to believe, was no longer so joyous.

  I handed him a tall glass of bourbon, the strongest there was in the house, keeping the clanking of the chattering ice from waking the house. He took the glass in a shaky palm, his eyes reflected the sad childishness of a worried soul, his pupils flickeing in the hearth flames still licking dully in the place.

  ""Bless your heart lad."" His thin leathery lips tried for a smile, trying to seep out the blood that licked and dripped into his beard. ""I apologise for this-"" I tipped the base of the glass, knocking the warm earthy tonic to his lips letting him sup the glass in one. He heaved once as the burning thawed the cold night from him.

  ""I don't understand, any of it."" I tried. The story he had told was unbelievable, even seeing this myth in the flesh was enough to make you pinch yourself from a deep and lucid dream, like the subliminal lulling as you sink deeper into a sleepy bath. This though. Was truly too horrific to comprehend.

  Santa Claus placed the glass on the table, giving a deep satisfied sigh as the dutch courage hit his stomach. He ran his hand through his beard picking through the mysterious chunks of dark matter, following his face up to his crown of curly hair. At one point he took off his hat to scratch his scalp revealing the thin ooze of claret running into his brow.

  ""How do I know you are who you say you are?"" I asked him, hooping for a confident answer but the man looked with soft round eyes of hopelessness. ""You're telling me you have no proof? Then why shouldn't I call the police, have you locked up right now?""

  ""Because you don't have much choice, I'm sorry but it's true. Because if you turn me in I will either rot in a jail cell for a while, or bundled in the looney bin for an even longer time until the inevitable happens and you, your wife, your friends, *everyone* you have ever known will die a fate you can't possibly win. Not alone anyway."" Santa leaned forward to meet my eye level. The intensity in his glare was near threatening, or desperate. ""I need help. Will you help me?""

  ""With what?"" Santa pointed to his sack behind me, near the hearth where he landed. The bag, large and stained with more blood. I went to the sack and dragged it to the man who hovered his hands above it. They no longer shook, they were still and confident. 

  ""I don't have the answers of how, not yet. Something happened to my home, something was released and tore the pole inside out. Whatever it was sent my elves..."" He looked down at his hands, his voice began quivering at the horrors he witnessed. ""Before it happened there was a bang, a scout party went to see what it was and when they came back they brought this.""

  He pulled from the sack a shard, a small metallic black shard with an inscription on the side. The middle capsule was missing revealing a hollow interior where something looked to have been. It looked like a warhead, a missile of some sort. Santa held it out as though it was an offering to the gods, his face pleading for me to take it but I could not. If this thing as responsible, a tool that turned elves I barely believed in into raging monsters then I did not want any part. Having it even near touching distance was making me feel mortally sick.

  ""This... This is what is responsible. The world is not safe! If they find a way to infect the rest of the world, and they will son believe me we have been perfecting it for a long long time, then this is all over."" He rolled the warhead in his hands, the inscription in the side was etched in fine lettering. At first it looked like a language not of this world, some bizzare alien type weapon that had found its way to earth and then, the sick feeling rose from the pit of my stomach and all the way to my head. A drunken feeling, a weightless heated motion circled as the etchings glimmered in the fireplace light.

  ""No this can't be."" I muttered, so soft it almost felt as though it did not come from my own mouth. Letters i recognised, that had been a part of my life for sometime.

  ""I'm sorry I have to involve you, but this is the only way we can fix this."" Santa now no longer seemed scared, frightened old geezer supping his bourbon like he had seen the faces of hell but now he was more confident than ever.

  ""I work here..."" I murmered.

  ""Yes you do, and you're going to sneak me in.""",ChaoticCube

He looks at you seriously and says, ""Well, actually, most of us are bird-people.""",salTUR,"  “Yeah, and I’m sure that everyone has a pink pair of wings, am I right?”. I don’t take Nick’s answer seriously because he drank a lot at the party. He was my roommate for a few months back in college. He was the clown in our group, always tell jokes and bring the party atmosphere everywhere. I still don’t get how he got elected. He’s my friend, and I’m happy for him, but I think that Nick is too irresponsible to be a Congressman.

“Bro, I’m serious. Trump is actually a dwarf using magic to make us see that he’s big.”, Nick tries to persuade me. Seeing that I clearly don’t believe him, he takes me to a place he calls “The Sanctuary”. He says that this is where the Congress have secret meetings at night in their true forms. ”Nick, you really need to stop using those drugs”. I have already warned him so many times about how drugs can affect his memories. We keep arguing about this matter until we reach a tall building. I have never been to this area of the city. It looks completely different from the other half. The building is ancient and has this mysterious vibe surrounds it. Before we get inside, Nick gives me a pill. “This will help you become one of my kinds in their eyes, but it won’t actually change your body”. “Why do I need to hide?”. “Because they will shred you apart the moment they find out about your true identity”. I play along with him, thinking he’s trying to pull off a surprise party for me. As I walk through the door, I saw 2 women who are talking in English. At first, I think they are wearing really complicated costumes, until I see their legs – if you can call those “legs”. Instead of what supposed to be legs, they have bodies of snakes. This is when I believe his word. This is when I freak out. Looking at Nick, I can’t believe that he’s a creature after knowing him all those years. I start walking backwards until Nick whispers in my ears: ”They can sense fear”. Those woman-like creatures look at me curiously, and I start walking forward so I can go unnoticed. As soons as they stop looking at us, I pull Nick into the men’s room. “Why did u bring me to this place? Are you trying to kill me?”. I though that he brings me here to be food for them. “I’ll never harm you, Mike. You are my best friend.”

Thinking of all the years I have known him, he had so many chances to kill me. I trust him, as he trusts me. “Dude, we need to get out of here right NOW”, he suddenly says worriedly. “What’s wrong?”. “They found out that there is a human in the building, and they are coming for you”. My body froze. I imagine that a whole army of monsters are coming for me. Just the thought is already enough to make me wet my pants. I try to escape through the front door, but before I even open it, Nick says “They already outside of that door”. Then he takes his shirt off, and I see a huge white pair of wings, like those of an angel. He breaks the window with me on his back as the door explodes. I see different creatures rushing inside right before Nick jumps off out of the window. As soon as we land on the ground, we run as fast as we can. I didn’t even look back for a moment.",NaziFarts

It’s actually quite an array of species. We just found out that one political figure is actually two dwarfs in a trench coat. Man we all thought we were lizard foke and perhaps over reacted when we attacks but that all in the past.” Gart responded.


David just sighed as he dug his face into his hands. “Dude you took your meds right?” They responded with a scoff. “Nah don’t need em anymore. Turns out they have better suppression and cloaking methods then the pills.” David started walking towards the liquor store.


“Hey David! We just got you to stop with your drinking dude.” He didn’t respond as he grabbed a bottle and bought it. Gart stopped him before he could open it. “David we overcame this challenge together so don’t go hopping in the same hole right in front of me.” David gave a tired look to Garf “Look your my best- no, only friend I got but you expect me to keep my wits with me when a person in congress believes most of our government are bird people?” Garf sighed before dragging him to a taxi. “Look ignoring that racism I’ll show you. Come on theirs a party and I get a plus one.”


When they arrived talking could be heard from outside accompanied by a variety of other sounds. That when it hit David. “Garf I’m wearing khakis, a fany pack, and this excuse of a shirt.” Garf shrugged took of his suit and threw it in the bushes. “Now we match. Come on let’s get in.”


The two quickly entered the building and David was stunned by what he saw. Many avian creatures filled the place along with lizard, crustaceans, and a pair of dwarfs. “I’m Garf, lizard person. This is David, an elf.” David turned to see who Garf was speaking to and saw a massive gargoyle with a surprised look on his face. “Hey Garf we need to talk.” David said as he dragged him into the bathroom.


Garf looked confused at David when they entered the bathroom. “What’s wrong pal,  Bad with parties?” David was walking in circles. “Hey Garf why is their no people?” He seemed to give it a thought before responding. “Think we kill any human that knows about us so I don’t think one would get elected...” David began to swear and brought back his bottle. “Hey David what are you doing?! Look if your this bad with parties I ca—“    “I’m a human Garf.”


Garf looked stunned. “Ok bad joke. I heard you talking that you were a elf studying the arcane so quit it.” David did not quit it. “Garf that was a D&amp;D character I made that you wouldn’t know about because I DM all our games.” Garfs face suddenly turned to shock. “Oh I screwed up. Oh no no no.” 


The two started to panic in the bathroom. “David what do I do?” “Hell should I know I just learned that lizard people exist!” Garf grabbed David and picked him up. “I have an idea.” The many years David has known Garf he quickly learned that this was bad.


Garf jumped out of the window of the bathroom. David held above his head and screaming the entire time. The few creatures who saw this could only thing. “Why did I nominate this person...”",Blazinghookshot

[WP] You used to be the only house in town to give away full-size candy bars but a rich new couple has moved in and they’re said to be giving out whole bags of candy. You’re used to being the most popular house in town but they’ve threatened that. There can be only one.,Bweezy3,"When the Vaults move to our street, we thought that this was like a normal family moving into the place. Much like any other new neighbour would do, they unpacked their belongings and got the house movers to move their stuff into the house. Just like a normal, everyday family. We thought nothing of this move as we settled down back into our normal lives.

As Halloween was getting closer, I looked at my weekly shopping list and noticed that I needed candy for the children that would be doing their trick or treating around the neighbourhood. Once I got the final bag that I needed, I saw the mother of the Vault family also doing their shopping. But unlike I, who bought four to five different bags of candy to fill the quota, the mother had a whole shopping trolley full of the same type of candy. Something didn’t quite stand with me as to why they are bought so much of the same brand. At least with my variation, I could give the children something unique and not have the same one for every child.

With a day to go until the holiday, I finished the last touches of the decorations for the house and was happy with the decorations that I put out. This did include some unique features that I personally created to have that unique spooky flair that my house delivers. I knew that nothing could defeat the personal with the normal Halloween decorations that most people usually have around their homes.

Looking over to my neighbour on the left, his decorations was minimal but that was the norm for him as he wasn’t much of a Halloween fan. He didn’t worry me much as we understand his reasoning for not celebrating this spooky holiday. I looked to my right and somehow and the Vaults had completely decked the placed out for Halloween. Heading over to their place, I noticed that they seemed to be still fixing up some stuff to make it absolutely perfect in their decorating of the place. This decoration of the house was something that annoyed me as I might have lost the full attention of the children that would be coming down this street.

“What’s wrong, dad,” my son said as he tried to get my attention by grabbing the shirt that I was wearing.

I responded in a quiet voice, “I don’t like these Vaults, they come to our street and think that they rule the place with their classy cars and unique decorations that only they seem to have.

“But we have our own decorations, too”, my son replied as he looked worried about I was acting.

“No, this isn’t their own decorations that they have crafted by hand. Because it seems to me that they have been made by a professional with how neat these decorations are”, I responded as I looked at the spooky pieces that were created for them. How the edges were super clean and didn’t look to be an issue with the paint job unlike some of my earlier attempts.

Strutting back to my place, I knew that they wanted to take my place on top. The place that I have held onto for a few years and here they are. All wanting to be all fancy with everything being nice and shiny so that the children will see. This isn’t going to happen, no not by a long shot as this mean war.",HawkAussie

[WP] You used to be the only house in town to give away full-size candy bars but a rich new couple has moved in and they’re said to be giving out whole bags of candy. You’re used to being the most popular house in town but they’ve threatened that. There can be only one.,Bweezy3,"Every neighborhood had the houses, where, you just knew what to expect. There were the Thompsons who held a huge Easter egg hunt where anyone was welcome. The Joneses who would borrow their neighbors yards to set up a massive over the top Christmas light display. We even had the Johnsons, who were probably closet pyromaniacs, who set off a ton of fireworks on the Fourth of July.

My house was perfect for halloween in many ways, I had this old hackberry tree that had been struck by lightning and had grown naturally gnarly and twisted around its scar. The precious owners had buried their pets and had tombstones in the yard around back. Even the landscaping was large brambles of roses, which when the cool weather came, were just brambles. It was fated to be, I had the best halloween yard, by far, no one came close to what I had as far as thematic flair, but what really made it worth it was the look of joy on the children faces as they received their full size candy bars as reward for their bravery of trekking through my yard. 

Everything seemed normal until 2 weeks ago. We had new neighbors moving, at first I was excited, new neighbors, and just in time to show off my decorations! We had our homeowners meeting explaining the guidelines for safe trick or treating. Leave the front light on, have fun, don't walk in the road, you know, the usual things to remind people about to be safe on this frightful night. But they spoke up, the, it hurts to even think it, the SMITHS. The new neighbors in town. I mean who even asks this. ""How much candy should we hand out?"" I knew something was amiss afterall, doesn't everyone know it is just common sense.

I heard the Thompsons first, ""We buy a bag of whoppers and hard candy and hand out a few to each kid."" Honestly, I am not sure what is worse, no candy or whoppers. I just never really got anything out of em. Whatever. Then spoke the Joneses, ""We get a big bag of mixed fun size bars and give everyone one."" If I were a child, this would still be a pretty good stop, not the best, but certainly not disappointing. Finally, I heard Mr. Johnson, the dentist ""I hand out floss and remind them to brush!"" He is way to giddy, fortunately he didn't marry a monster and Ms. Johnson joins in, ""Oh don't listen to him, we give out floss, but also candy floss and airheads.""  She convinced him a few years back it would make the kids happier and keep him true to his roots. While the latter is definitely false, I won't be the one to correct her.

And around the room people shared what they gave out to the children. Until all that was left was me. ""I, I give out snickers and milky ways and even three musketeers."" Nicely done, not a lie, but also not the truth. Of course, it was well known, once you gave out something one year you were expected to continue in the years future, lest you entice the children's wraith. While I was thinking to myself, I failed to spy there scheming eyes. I should have been worried when Ms. Smith stated, ""We might try to give out lots of different things, this sounds so fun!""
FUN? This isn't a matter of fun, it is a matter of prestige! One does not lightly hand out candy on this hallowed night. If only I was better prepared, I could have seen my inevitable demise, but alas, ignorance is, as they say, bliss.

The night approached, excitement filled the air, the children were chattering, some were already ready to go. I had one last stop until I was ready, the grocery store. I walked down the candy aisle and saw Ms. Smith, who, much to my dismay, had a cart full of candy. A nervous laugh escaped my throat, ""You know we usually only get about 40-50 children."" Her slight frown and crease in her brow worried me immediately.

""I remember someone saying that, do you think this is enough?""

I don't remember what happened after that, all I knew is the line had been drawn. This was clearer than crystal, I needed help. The beacons must be lit, the war bands gathered, there was definitely a lust for blood in the air. I finished my shopping, I couldn't afford more candy, paying for utilities would already be tight. I needed help, reinforcements, some warriors to heed my call. 

An emergency meeting was called. The Thompsons, Joneses, and Johnsons were first to answer. For if my domain, the lich's domain, were under threat, how long before there kingdoms fell. Easter, Christmas, and Fourth of July too. ""Halloween is the start, they will destroy me first. When I am at my weakest they will strike again. I see it now, a parade, for thanksgiving there will be happiness and cheer. After that Christmas, Hanuka, and Quanza all in one rapid fire assault and the Ice kingdom will melt under their red hot, three pronged attack. I need not tell you that all of us are in grave danger, we must act now before it is to late!""

We sat in silence until little johnny, who was missing his pinky, an unfortunate accident with a homemade rocket left him fingerless, spoke, ""I have some spare rockets, they are known to misfire."" Then Sweet Sweet grandmother Jones, ""I was updating our new transformer, and that has been causing outages."" Even Ms. Thompson recognized the threat, ""We have a bunch of bunny masks to help hide your faces."" The heist was planned, it all seemed flawless. ""we will go the night of meet here tomorrow, this will teach them a lesson""

So we suited up, there was a bounce to my step, ""This will be a night you won't struggle to remember."" We snuck in the back, everything was quiet. It appeared the power was out, Granny Jones, had even cut off their cellphones. Phase 2 was Jonny, he was rigging the rockets, a small fire to cause just enough ruckus. I knocked on the door to hold their attention, no need to be nice. The had asked for this intervention.

Ms. Smith answered and she looked me in the eye, and suddenly I was aware of all the lights shining, all around me, even in the sky. ""knock knock, Knock Knock, run away little bunny, trick or treat? I'd hate to half to cut off some lucky rabbit feet."" She was smiling, holding steady and still, I knew I should surrender and give up, she had crippled my will. We lost, we were defeated no trick to be had. We only had just realized the Smiths were so bad. No holiday was safe and nothing we could do, the children got candy, they had no clue.

You’re used to being the most popular house in town but they’ve threatened that. There can be only one.,Bweezy3,"When Stephen and Gail moved in Jen and I were ecstatic.  They were our first new neighbors since we had been elected co-presidents of the Neighborhood Association Welcoming Committee.  Jen and I were ready to join the pantheon of neighborhood greats.  To stand beside Russel and Norma Watson for the ultimate title of “Good Neighbors.”

We were knocking on their front door as soon as the moving truck had pulled away.  Of course, Jen baked her famous lemon and poppy seed muffins - they were always the first sell-out at the elementary school bake sale.  And I brought along a jar of my special barbecue seasoning.  I make it from scratch from herbs I grow in our backyard.  We were complete with the bound guidebook to the neighborhood including the entire chapter of Jen and my Yelp reviews of the local eateries.  We were perfect.  We were going to be legends.

They, they were almost equally perfect.  Well, the perfect compliment to our perfection.  Their two kids mirrored our own.  Jen was gushing about how their eldest, Sarah, would be perfect for our eldest, Paul.  The night after the first meeting Jen spent the thirty minutes in bed after The Tonight Show and before lights out making plans for homecoming and prom when the kids finally make it to high school.

But that perfect existence didn't last long.  It started at their welcome cookout.  They invited the entire neighborhood.  Their food was on point.  Their conversations pithy.  Who does that?  Jenn was furious.  She could sense that things were not well.  I told her to be calm, we would be ok.  But it didn't stop there.  Oh, no.  They couldn't be content just winning the hearts and minds of the neighborhood with their delicious food.  They set their sites on my hill - the perfect lawn.

If the International Organization for Standardization were to codify perfection, my lawn would be the International Prototype.  I watered it twice daily - at sunrise and sunset for optimal efficiency and growing conditions.  It was mowed to ensure that no blade was ever below one and a quarter inches or above one and one half inches.  It was fertilized to be the perfect Pantone shade of Dark Green.  So good it could make the grounds keepers at Fenway jealous.  But Stephen, he somehow found a way to one up me.  And all he did was hire the Meyer's kid to come in a mow it every couple of weeks.  It was impossibly good.

But that is nothing compared to their greatest offense.  Jen and I worked hard to become “the house” each Halloween.  All October, we would stalk the aisle of Costco waiting for the the release of the full sized candy bars with the special Halloween themed wrappers.  And then we would buy all of the choicest brands.  Snickers, Reese’s, Kit-Kat – we had them all.  And all the kids knew it.  Some years we would even have a line waiting just before sundown when Jen and I would emerge from our front door in our spooky, but not too scary, themed couples-costumes.  People still talk about the year we donned full stipple face paint to be noire comic book characters.

We knew something was afoot when we saw them loading their minivan that Saturday in the Costco parking lot.  The entire trunk was filled with boxes of candy.  How dare they buy that candy before we could?  Don’t they know who we are?  The hierarchy was set.  Who are they to disrupt things?

I pulled alongside them and rolled down the passenger window and leaned down over Jen to talk out the window.   

“Hi there Steve!  Sure is a lot of candy you got there,” I said, trying to seem non-threatening and happy.

“Hey Jim.  Yeah.  Hoping to make some kids happy this year,” he said with a smile.

“Well, uh, you know that Jen and I, ah, we are kind of known as, eh, ‘the house’ around here.  We wouldn’t want to go spoiling that, would we?” I said, holding back the contempt and resentment.

“Of course not.  It’s just that Gail and I grew up in a neighborhood that didn’t give out much more that Tootsie-Rolls and Good-n-Plenties.  We promised ourselves we were going to give back to the kids when we were able to.  Check this out!  Gail found these cute gift bags to bundle all the candy with!”

“Yep.  Those are pretty cute.  Well, Jen and I will just go and see if you left anything behind for the rest of us!” I said with a laugh as I pulled the SUV away and rolled up the window.

“This ends tonight,” Jen seethed.  The look in her eyes was sterile cold and and engulfed with anger.  I was the most turned on I had been since I was promoted to Senior Director down at the office.

We scoured the aisle of Costco for our new supplies – a gross of eggs and and the jumbo pack of three-ply toilet paper.  Tonight we go to war.",tymacwrites

"[WP] As humankind nears the end of its days, resources become scarce and bottled water becomes the only form of currency accepted around the world",Kalybre,"It was a hot day. Almost like if a heat wave was about to hit on the town. Standing on the great balcony of mansion, Theodore had a cruel smile. He could feel the hot wind going through his hair despite the sun not being up yet. It was a perfect day to get rich. People everywhere around town would soon be bagning at the door of his mansion. 

He was the richest man in town. If it wasn’t in the whole country. Since the great drought, nothing have been the same on earth. Men who were considered like powerful in the past were not anymore. The economy now revolve around something else than money. Citizens needed water. They needed it for the crops, they needed it for the animals, they needed it for themselves. 

Theodore had water. He was a rich man. Not only he had a lot of it, he had an infinite supply. Many times, government and criminal organisation tried to raid his mansion. He chased them away everytime. He didn’t need an army to fight them. He didn’t need special security. He only made them understood that if they stole from him or even tried to harm him, the supply will disappear. 

This would have been a huge hit for everyone in town so they retreated. One of the biggest town on earth, New York city, was only relying on him to survive. He was able to provide everyone with water for the right price. He had everything he wanted and more. He didn’t need anything else but still liked to indulge himself in the little sweet things in life. He was one of the few on earth who still took baths and showers. He often requested soap and oils from citizens asking for waters.

Fortunately, technology had evolved enough that the rest of the Earth was still in a healthy state and hygiene was not something necessary now. Theodore just liked the feeling of this much desperately needed water on his skin. There was this sweet feeling of knowing you are rich enough to literally bath in it. 

Theodore was a good man, however. Not everyone had the goods he wanted, but he offered different alternatives to get water. Citizens could come work for him for two weeks. No more. They needed to be healthy, that was the only requirement. He would take anyone that would pass the medical tests. After those two weeks, they would return in their life and wouldn’t be able to return. It wouldn’t be good for their health to stay longer. He would pay them handsomely too, giving them a dozen of jug of water. 

Many though he was crazy to allow about fifteen persons to work for him. Why would he pay people so greatly, only for two weeks? Why would he return them to their old life after just as if nothing ever happened? Because that was something else. None of the people that worked for him would talk about what happened. Most of them said they couldn’t remember what actually happened during those two week. They were not about to know either.

Theodore made his way downstairs. He went to join the staff that would be working with him today in order to manage the hoard of citizens in need of water. This was his normal staff, not the one he would hire on a bi-weekly basis. Only his most trusted employees were staying more than six months in that role, but as long as he could trust them, they were more than welcome to stay forever. He verified with the manager that everything was ready for their hard day of work. He instructed them of his needs today and to prioritise the sales to benefits them. Once everything was put into place, he left them alone.

He had someone else to see before they would open the gate. He made his way to the basement of the manor. The stairs lead him in a sterile white room. Chairs were back to the wall and on them was a woman sitting. It was one of the fortnight of temporary employee. She finished the day before her two weeks at his service. He smiled warmly at her.

“Good morning. How are you feeling, Johanna?” He greeted her.
“I’m feeling good, sir. I am grateful to have been able to work for you in the past two weeks.”
“This is great news. Your payment have already been delivered to your house in a secured box. To unlock it, you’ll need this code and someone will fetch the box tomorrow.”

He gave her a paper. She beamed at him knowing her life would be a lot easier for the next few years. He slowly herded her toward the stairs to go back on the first floor of the mansion. With a hand on her shoulder, they both exited the house, toward the locked gate. This was how his day always started. He would guide the person that just finished their two weeks outside of the mansion and select someone else.

He opened the gate and said his final goodbye to Johanna. After that Theodore scanned the crowd looking at him expectantly. He selected a man that was standing a feet over everyone. He looked healthy and in good physical condition. The man came forward and stood in front of him. 

“What’s your name, son?”
“I’m Tobias Freitag, Mr. Aldrich!”
“You can call me Theodore from now on, Tobias. Follow me please.”

They both went toward the mansion while the rest of Theodore’s staff started to guide the crowd toward the sales building. With Tobias on his heels, he passed through the same hallways he just passed with Johanna, guiding him into the basement too. In the room was now another man dressed in a white lab coat. 

“Tobias, this is Dr. Selvidge, he will make sure everything is in order before you can start to work for me.”

On those words, Theodore abandoned the two men in the room, having other business to attend. He spent the whole morning upstair in his office. He had to schedule a few events, make sure everything was running properly in his household and for his business. After a few hours, the phone on his desk started to ring. This was a direct line with Dr. Selvidge’s office, so he knew they were done. He picked up the phone.

“He’s ready, Mr. Aldrich.” Said the doctor without Theodore having to talk.

He hang up right after. There was no need for formality between them. He would be on his way downstair soon enough anyway. When he entered the room where Tobias was sitting, he was now shirtless, sitting on the examination table. He was looking happy, probably relieved he would be fit enough to be hired.

“Well done, son. Dr. Selvidge explained you what would happen next?” 

Tobias noded. He had to take a medication and then they would wait until the effects were working on him. After, he would basically have only to work while the medical staff keep a close eye on him. Theodore took the pills on the shelves next to him and handed them to his new employee. Tobias swallowed them dry.

After half an hour, Tobias started to express he was feeling a bit dizzy. Theodore smiled, knowing full well the effect were starting. He offered his arm to help guide Tobias toward the next room. When they entered, he could see about fifteen tables. On each one of them except one was a person lying on it. He slowly guided Tobias toward the empty one.

While Tobias started to get more and more agitated, a medical team went around him to start to prepare him. They inserted a central venous catheter in order to collect his blood more easily. They connected the catheter to a big container on the side, where the blood will drip. They strongly tied him to the table. As soon as his blood started to be collected, Tobias seemed to calm himself.

Raising slowly his hand, Theodore quickly passed his finger through Tobias hairs, like a father trying to comfort a child. He knew that was not an easy job and his employee had it rough, but it was necessary. They had developed a drug, back in the 2040s that greatly increased the quantity of blood cell production in the body. The drugs was so strong that it was quickly removed from the market. The patients would practically double their blood volume in little time, causing agitation and death if it wasn’t contained.

Theodore had been lucky to be able to put a hand on this drug, as it was now serving his purpose. He could collect as much blood as he wanted from those volunteer. For two weeks, they would be daily injected a mix of this drug and tranquilizer and stay plugged through a catheter to collect the precious liquid. The tranquilizer was basically to make sure they would forget about this whole situation. 

For a few minutes, he watched the blood drip into the container stored under the table. For years he felt horrible about the situation he was putting those citizens in, hence why he instored the two weeks terms and never allowed them to return. Now, he barely felt anything about it. Force of habit was something that hardened a man’s heart. 

He made his way toward the last room of the basement, his laboratory. Dozen of containers of bloods were scattered across his lab. Each of them connected with tubes through a central unit. This was where all the magic was happening. As he walked through the room, Theodore put a finger on one of the tube, following it until they reached their end. He put his hand on the central unit. A wonder he created when he was still in engineering school, created especially by him, for him and would never work for someone else.

It was created in glass. In the middle, was a heart beating. His heart. Through long process, he was able to transplant it into the engine. Connected to it was all the blood cables. They were all joining on the left side of the heart. On the right was another cables going toward a end result containing. You couldn’t see anything in the tube on the right, liquid in it as clear as a crystal. The purest water present on earth. Source of life for New York City and the reason he was so rich.

	I walked into the building, careful to keep my steps slow, deliberately pacing myself so that no one would suspect what I had in my backpack. It was something very valuable, even so that in this luxury casino people would try to buy it from me.


	Immediately, the white light hit me from all sides. I walked through the metal detectors and observed the building. The walls were all white, along with the ceiling and there were no light sources anywhere. It just seemed to ... radiate from the walls. I whistled quietly. The casino was very high-end.


	On the floor were several small VR portals. The world being scarce of resources, casinos couldn’t reasonably exist, so for recreational services, VR stations were set up instead, where people could enter a virtual reality casino. It was part of a world-wide game, set with international rankings and scores. It couldn’t be purely recreational, for so many people to join, so the top members of the game each year were awarded with a year-long set of water bottles. Everyone vied for winning it, but everyone knew it was unreasonable to assume so. Already though, several people were plugged into their VR headsets, immersed in their virtual worlds. 


	I looked around until I recognized the person I was here to see. I went over to him and tapped him on his shoulder. Normally, this would be considered offensive to interrupt someone in a virtual game by getting their attention in the real world, but what I was here to give him was good enough to stifle those social contracts. Due to safety concerns, the VR makers had to pull someone out of his or her game if someone approached them in the real world. I had had to have promised him something good for allowing myself to do this, and I had promised him the very best.


	The man came out of his game, disoriented. For an instant, he looked up at me, annoyed, but then he recognized who I was and softened his gaze. Though not smiling, he was at least not malevolent. He stood up. “Do you have it?”
	

	I barely managed to say, “Yes,” and start to rummage through my bag before he took it off of my shoulders and began searching rapidly. Within seconds, he had found what I had in my backpack and started to look at it in amazement.


	Inside my bag, was a still-sealed, fresh, Fiji water bottle. 


	“Ah, yes, this will make a fine addition to my collection,” he said.


	What? There were people dying of thirst out there in the world and this psycho was trying to start some collection? I started bristling and my temper rose. But then it came to a rest. He was paying me, after all.
	

	“And my payment?” I asked, now reminded.


	“A thousand Dasani water bottles, filled with distilled water, out back in a truck,” he said.


	“Thank you. It’s a pleasure doing business with you,” I finished.


	“Likewise,” he said, though more intent on studying the water bottle. 


	I started walking out of the building. Outside, the sandy atmosphere greeted me with a handful of dust thrown in my face. With some struggling, I walked to the back of the casino, and as promised, there was a truck, loaded with water bottles.


	As I settled down in the leather comforting of the driver’s seat, I thought back to my anger at him collecting water bottles. Who was I to judge, anyway? There were probably dozens, of hundreds, of thousands of intelligent people who could have made some headway out of their miserable lives in a different world. It just so happened that water bottles became a currency. It just so happened that I inherited a water bottle factory. It just so happened that I was lucky. And for some cruel, harsh, sadistic reason, in this world, that was the difference between life and death.",ImperialWriter

"[WP] ""If the truth is a cruel mistress, then a lie must be a nice girl.""",MediRon,"***And I Don't Even Wanna Fight It***

***Monster / Crashing Atlas***

...

Truth is cruel. 

Not that she particularly delights in it, it's just that by her very nature, she's predisposed to be cruel. The entire point of Truth is that she tells people the reality of the world, their actions, their words. She doesn't dance around it like Procrastination, or obscure her meanings like Dithering, she just tells it straight. If it hurts, it hurts, and that's just the way the world works.

Truth has grey hair, glasses, a perpetual frown, an accent that suggests she's from Eastern Europe and dresses like one of those grumpy old ladies you see in school. Think a schoolmistress, but about ten times worse. Truth likes to tie people down and 'care' for them by exposing them to the reality of the world. Some people really don't like to face truth, others have no problem with it, and some delight in it. We call those people 'psychopaths'. 

Truth has a type, honest people, people who never, ever lie. They're easy to work with, to tie down and care for. They go along with it willingly, and they genuinely enjoy their time with her. The ones who lie for a living, the tricksters, the charlatans and the frauds, they struggle the whole way. She's not particularly nice to them, and you can hear their screams echo in the void as their worlds come crashing down. 

For you...well, Truth, for all her cruelties, is at least a cordial, professional mistress. She shows up on time, does her work, and leaves promptly. She never tells falsehoods, even when she's breaking your world apart piece by piece. She doesn't smile, doesn't frown, just remains blank as she presents the world as it is to you. There's no feeling in it, no malice, no delight as she shatters your life time and again. Even if you hate her for destroying everything you've built up, you can at least respect her professionalism. 

But Lie...you like Lie.

...

Lie is very different from Truth.

She's amicable, easygoing, friendly to everyone. She gets along with everyone she meets, from the gentle old man down the street to the most hardened criminals that prowl the night. And it's easy to see why, because she tells them what they want to hear. She doesn't present the world as it is, unlike Truth, but as it should be, all according to the whims and desires of the person she talks to.

Her whispers gift those she speaks to with a silver tongue. Her influence spreads, those she talks to spread word of her presence, and she finds more and more friends to meet, more ears to whisper her words into. Promises of salvation, promises of escape from the nature of reality are her stock in trade. It's easy for her to attract followers, supporters who worship her with feverish devotion. 

Lie is a woman clad in the finest clothes. The most beautiful of dresses, the shiniest jewels, the finest shoes. She dyes her hair every time she visits a new person. It changes, from red to brown to blonde and back again. It's naturally black, raven almost, and she has shimmering blue eyes that call to everyone she meets. It's part of her charisma, the magnetism that drives others onwards into her arms.

Lie doesn't make 'appointments' like Truth, she shows up whenever, at the weirdest and most fortunate of times. When you're in trouble, searching for a way out, she drops in, whispers some words that save you into your ears. When you're bluffing, trying to look better than you actually are, she's there, holding your hand and telling you all you need to know. And when you want to avoid something, she has just the thing to get you out of it.

She shows up for casual visits, to brainstorm ideas on potential futures. It's weird, you suppose, to spend time with the avatar of falsehoods, but she enjoys your company, just as much as you enjoy hers. Lie is far more appealing than Truth ever was, far more friendly, more personable, more...you.

You wouldn't consider yourself a bad person, but you wouldn't consider yourself a good person either. Just the kind of person Lie is looking for. She works well with everyone, but with you...you're her favorite. When she isn't helping out some other poor soul in need of aid, she spends her time with you, shaping your words, mending sentences and shifting your thoughts, so that the transitions between your words and her own are seamless. For lack of a better term, you become one with Lie, one with the goddess of deception, queen of falsehoods. 

There are worse fates. You could be one of the honest, bound to Truth's chains. One of the lazy, lounging on Sloth's couches, or one of Anger's frothing demons. Instead, you're a champion of deceit, a knight wielding a silver tongue. Lie gifts you with a comfortable livelihood, and all she asks is that you occasionally let her speak in your place. A small price to pay for salvation, for prosperity, for fulfillment.

The world keeps turning, your life moves on. Your settings change, from a city to a forest to mountains to the ocean, but she's always by your side, like a home that never leaves. People come and go like the changing of a stage cast in a never ending play, but Lie remains. She's there for you, when the world proves it's cruelty to you time and again, she helps you up, never once leaving your side. 

One night, she takes your hands, looks you in the eye and smiles. Blue eyes shimmer in the moonlight. 

Her lips press against yours, a whispered promise of eternal love echoing in your ears.

You're hers, and there's no place else you'd rather be.

"[WP] You know it has to be some kind of mistake. How else does a devil in training, get an internship in heaven",RRevdon,"It smelled of roses, Abad noticed. Not the kind of rotting thorny once along the highway to hell he had taken on the way up. No, the smell reminded Abad of a washroom. Unlike hell's version of one, this didn't have the distinct unpleasant sweaty heat nor the noise of a roaring washer in the corner. 

Abad was wearing his finest suit. Black leather with a skull motive and a firey red tie that went with his crimson skin. He smoothed his hair back between his horns and tucked the tail underneath the chair.

He noticed he was nervous and that seemed to be a rather strange reaction. He'd just get the usual: ""Sorry clerical error,"" and then he'd be on his way again. However, these kinds of opportunities only come once in a lifetime and while life and time were flexibly defined, he knew a second opportunity wouldn't come by to visit Heaven and see the Angels at work.

To his surprise heaven seemed a lot cleaner than he expected. In his personal experience humans were messy creatures and they rarely cleaned up after themselves. You'd think that after a good flailing they'd have the decensy to pick up and do away with the skin. Alas they simply let it rot.

It might be because there weren't that many humans in heaven. Or perhaps they had some sort of clean way of flailing that didn't involve the eccess waste. Everything was white. The young angel that had triple checked his invitation had a pure white skin, bright blue eyes and blond hair. He smiled kindly, but Abad noticed, incenserely. 

His robes had been white, his halo had been, and the room that Abad had been seated in for the past seven hours, had been white.

Interesting type of torture. Solitary chamber experience. He'd be lying if he wasn't enjoying it.

Then after, what couldn't be more than 12 hours, the door opened and a similarly white-skinned man entered. He seemed important cause he wore glasses at the edge of his nose and had a nametag saying: ""Peter"". 

""Abaddon,"" Peter said as he sat down. ""Abad for short?""

Abad nodded.

""Very good,"" Peter took out a quill from thin air and checked something on a piece of parchment similarly appearing from nowhere.

""Why am I here?"" Abad asked, surprised by the sudden sound in his voice. In heaven everyone seemed to talk in whispers.


""Well you know,"" Peter said baring his teeth as if to show he was a predator. ""Every few centuries we get one of you down there up here. It's a rather unusual arrangement but you will soon learn it is rather necessary. You have your uses.""

Abad chuckled. ""What use could I be to angels?"" he spat the final word.

Peter made a sound like maniacal laughter, but without the mania.

""That's what I want to hear! Very good. It says here you studied in the class of Professor Crowley. There's an even a letter of recommendation. It says here you are a nightmare to teach. Have no sense of authority and will make it far as a Devil. Very good. Seems we have something we can use here.""

Abad gave a short chuckle. ""Doesn't seem like traits you'd want in heaven.""

""Want, no dear me no. Want is off the table, but you have your uses.""

Peter stood up and the white room faded away around them revealing a lush green garden. 

""Heaven has a bit of a reputation of being boring."" Peter holds up his hands in the air. ""Guilty as charged.""

Abad gave a low rumble that sounded like mild annoyance.

""Okay okay to the point,"" in the middle of the green garden stood a tree and two beautiful humans, disgusting creatures, sat beneath it. A man and a woman, both naked.

The tree bore fruit, but neither human seemed to pay any attention to it.

""Can you turn into animals?""

""Bats, snakes, flies, goats."" 

""Snake will do. Why don't you slither over there and... Go with it.""

With a faint hiss the leather suit turned snakeskin, the red skin green, and a large boa like snake lay in the green garden.

Abad slithered towards the humans.

Would he have to bite them? Poison them? Eat them whole?

Even though the garden seemed empty he could hear gasps as he came closer to the humans. A sunlight like beam focused atop him.

Then a voice, incorpereal and loud, Peter's voice.

I sighed, tracing my finger around the rim of yet another empty glass. Alcohol. Didn't matter what kind, they all tasted bland now. The corners of my mouth, adorned with black lipstick, turned upward in something reminiscent of a smile. His favorite color was black. I was wearing a flowing dress of the same color. Bittersweet, really. I turned back to the confused bartender. ""He should be here soon. He always comes."" The man raised an eyebrow. ""Ma'am, I'm not quite sure what this has to do with me."" ""You wouldn't know, would you? Don't worry your poor soul over it. Do you have a wife, perchance? Family?"" He took two steps away from me, in a semi-discreet manner. ""No, Ma'am...perhaps you've had too much to drink."" I simply shook my head. ""Not enough, more like."" Before I could change my mind, I smashed the glass over the counter and rendered the man dead with the sharp, now bloodied end of the stem.
     I decided that I would serenade him. There were plenty of songs about him, after all. The only thing bigger than his ego was his scythe. I removed the man's phone from his back pocket and selected a song to play, *The Show Must Go On, by Queen.* I increased the volume to its max and sat patiently on the barstool, awaiting his arrival as the man's pulse left him.
     Sure enough, he arrived in a short explosion of shadow, which clung to his skin and hung in a haze about his eyes.
     ""On time as always, I see."" I gazed at him. He was wearing a deep, midnight suit with a long tailcoat, and his emerald green eyes glimmered slightly just behind the haze. His style always seemed to update with the era, but his looks were timeless.
     He grinned at me, an expression so cold and emotionless yet so enticing that only he could manage. **""You called? Darling, you know I'm awfully busy.""** I hummed a bit to the song. ""I missed you. Why don't you come over here and give me a kiss? Take my soul while you're at it, love."" He strode over, every step causing me to shudder. **""You know very well why not, Darling.""** His black gloved hand lightly stroked my cheek, which filled me with a chill. 
     
*I was a teenager at the time, young and rambunctious. I can hardly remember what era, what year, time is quite a blur. I do remember the moment vividly, though. My brother was sick and dying of the plague. So was I. Antony was so young, too young... but Death does not discriminate. He came to take him, put him to rest. I was dying too, but I wasn't ready to let go. As he drew my soul from my body, in a last act of defiance, I stomped on the edge of his cloak. His hood fell. Two piecing, emerald eyes stared back at me, burning with fury, and an ageless tiredness I couldn't comprehend. He didn't say a word then. Simply replaced his hood, and strode off with my brother's soul toward a golden gate I couldn't reach. I was released back into my body and have been immortal ever since.*

   ""Surely we can put the past behind us, can't we?"" I said sweetly. I retrieved the stem of the wineglass and placed it in his gloved hand. ""Forgive me, love."" He only grinned wider, dropping the stem and refusing me his embrace once more. **""Not on your life, Darling. If you wanted so strongly to refuse me, then your wish shall be granted forevermore.""** ""Love, please. I've done so much to be with you. Can't you see that?"" He only grinned wider, and the deepest parts of my soul burned so hot it froze. **"" Lovely song, darling. I suppose I'll be seeing you again, in another lifetime or so.""** I could only watch on once more as he escorted another soul to their eternity. It was a lovely song indeed. I would play another when I saw him again.",FandomrLyfe

After decades of attempts you finally found a loophole; there is no telling when they will notice.",Zomeese,"""See this?"" Sibil dangled a keychain in front of her captive's eyes, a small cube affixed to the end. ""Don't think for a second that I'm afraid to use it!"" She slipped her finger in the metal ring on the end and twirled it around like some sort of time traveling gunslinger. Officer Pitt glared back at her, motionless as he laid against the control panel. She slipped the cube into her shirt pocket and buttoned it shut, then reached down and slid her index finger across the man's restraints. With a click, Pitts hands and feet were freed.

Pitt sat up, then with caution for both his captor and his concussion, rose to his feet. He glanced at the console readout, and a look of confusion covered his face.

""What?"" 

""No questions!"" Sibil barked, ""Or it gets the hose again!"" She said as she sauntered to the door and keyed in her exit code. Pitt continued to eye the controls, searching for something. ""Chop, chop!"" And with that, they stepped out into a grimy warehouse. Even with the little bit of light that slipped through the upper windows, it was clear the walls were caked from years of neglect, iced with an even layer of dirt and grime. Except for one perfectly square section of wall directly opposite of them. Officer Pitt harrumphed at the atrocious quality of the hologram.

Sibil ducked her head and stepped through the digital wall and into a long straight tunnel. ""Let's go!"" She said, the echo projecting her voice right at him. With a sigh, Pitt stepped out of the time machine and made his way through the holographic wall. 

""For a moment there, I thought I was going to get to see the golden age of the east. But no, instead I have to slog it through this,"" Pitt looked around at the chewed up concrete walls and low ceiling of the tunnel around him, a puddle of water reflecting off his palm light every couple of feet, ""some sort of ancient sewer?"" Sibil kept walking.

After half a mile of hunched marching, the tunnel turned sharply to the right for a few steps, then ended with a ladder that rose two stories. Without pausing, Sibil began her ascent. Pitt looked around, then up at her feet as she scaled the small rungs. He sighed again and slid the palm light around his glove to the back of his hand.

The ladder ended abruptly, with no excess, so she had to lie on her belly at the top and swing her legs up and over. A flash of opportunity ran through Pitt's mind, but he pushed it away. The fall would most certainly kill her, but the device in her breast pocket would scoop a chunk out of the earth, evaporating everything within a 10km radius. He reached his hand up over the lip, as she gained her footing, she eyed it carefully but eventually reasoned he wasn't a moron and helped him up over the edge. 

Once on his feet, Pitt looked around. This room was dark and walled with chewed concrete much like the tunnels, but it was spacious and squared off at sharp angles. Another ladder, this one leaned against the far wall and attached to a track at the top and bottom. The image of a goblin library from an old children's book popped into his mind. ""Where are we?""

Sibil held her arm up in front of her and swiped her finger down the sleeve of her white leather jacket, tracing a line that ran from her elbow to her wrist. A holographic screen slowly scrolled upward out of the invisible line on her arm, followed by another hologram of a one-handed keyboard. She began typing furiously, then stepped exactly three spaces to her right, a quick glance at the wall, and she reached for the ladder, a sharp squeak bounced off the walls as she pulled it closer. Satisfied with its position, she began to climb up, but then looked over her shoulder at Pitt who was meandering about. ""Don't touch anything!"" She said, before continuing her ascent, the screen in keyboard dimming as her arms took to the task of pulling herself up. 

As Pitt approached the wall near one end, he noticed something sticking out of it and leaned over to get a closer look. It was a tiny door. There were hundreds- no thousands of them. Like a giant, creepy post office. His eye's widened, then his brows tented up and together, more confused than ever.",glacier_chaser2

""We'll see about that, officer..."" Sibil leaned over from her captain's chair to inspect the badge on the man's uniform. ""Pitt.""

""Ay err I chew!""

""I hope so! I really do this time,"" she said as she flipped a row of switches one by one from left to right on control panel above her, pausing on the last one, her eyes fixated on a pulsing light. 

""kku yu beatch!"" The light stopped, and Sibil flicked the last switch hard, then turned to regard the bound man next to her feet. The room began to shake.

""Now that,"" she said as she reached over shoulders with crossed arms, pulling two retractable straps over and across her chest and clicking them into the ports on either side of her, ""is going to cost you.""

""Nnn, Nnn! Pu-Eez,"" the gagged man said as he tried to inch his way back into the corner. Sibil shrugged, a cold, tight-lipped smile spread across her face. Special Office Pitt, his eyes searching the small room for something that he could cling to, tried to remember his training. A space-time pod of this size, he knew would alternate trajectory four, not six times per quantum year. He wedged himself hard into the corner, and using his feet, pushed hard at a 45-degree angle, then clenched his eyes shut, bracing for liftoff.

Sibil rested her head back in the captain's chair and closed her eyes. She developed a bit of a strange habit. She swore that during a time leap, for those short few seconds, she slept like a baby.

When she woke, officer Pitt groaned from her feet once more. With a click of the restraint locks, she was free again to lean over and peer under the chair, which stood bolted to the floor like an office chair without a wheelbase. 

""Well, at least your gag is off now. See, you should be thankful. Now, what was it you were trying to say?"" Office pit rolled over onto his back, his eyes still closed. Likely to keep the blood that trickled down his brow out of the left one. ""Ah, well if you think of it let me know. Now, let's get going, shall we? You partner should be here soon, don't want to make him wait!""

A large, black and blue triple axis grid zoomed out, tracking a bright red dot as it arched and zagged across several years. 

""March 5th, 2099. Shibuya, Tokyo, sir,"" the technician next to him said without looking up from his terminal, a moment before the forward screen displayed the same information. ""Generating a fact sheet now."" The three-dimensional grid scaled down to a quarter of its size and slid over to the top left corner of the screen. The right half populated with a timeline of important historical events related to the chrono-geo coordinate in question. Next to each headline was a score in percentage format estimated out to two decimal places. They all started a 99.99%, but immediately some began to tick downward by fractions of a percentage point.

""Strange destination, don't you think Themes?"" The young technician nodded. 

""Yes, sir. Specifically for this particular canary sir. This is much further back than expected for her. The likely hood of Ms. Sibil-"" 

""Try not show our fugitives so much respect, Themes. Unless you want to cast suspicion on yourself in the future.""

""Of course. Sorry, sir."" Theme turned back to his terminal and began typing. In the bottom left corner of the screen, a larger number appeared in a bold green font: 0.001%. ""As I was saying, the likely hood of her impacting her target event is virtually nonexistent from this point in time.""

Cass' brow furrowed as he turned away and made his way up the stairs, causing the technicians behind him to sit up a little straighter. ""Ping me anything changes. And I want an open line with Ringo from my office.

In fact, Journal, that reminds me, just give me a moment:

Self note: ration charts for the next month

I'm sorry. Now back to what I was saying, it is my birthday today. As such, I have really tried to make this my best year yet! Its been quite the trial to get all of my stuff, but nonetheless, I managed. Pears, wine, cinnamon, honey, and vinegar, all combined to make quite the treat, yiu can be sure.

Whatever! 

I closed the journal, frustrated at my friend. God, she could be so judgmental sometimes! But, recognizing she was right, I picked it back up.

You... Ok, I'll say it. Sorry. But youre right. Im not sure how many years I can take. The night terrors are worse now, I... I know. Did I really tear you in my sleep...? Oh my god, it really is bad. 

I hear a faint click and my head snaps to the noise instantaneously. Its a small reflective... Lens? I get up from my mattress and slowly walk over. It starts to retract, and I leap for it. It pulls. I pull harder. And as it flies out of the wall of my hut, I see lights I've never seen before switch on all around me. I hear... applause? What the he'll? The world around me fades to black as I jerk my head back and forth, looking for something, anything, to hold onto. I sprint to my journal just to watch it erased like everything else. I break into sobs.

""Journal? Journal!?? Oh God...""

It is then that someone else walks up to me. He is smiling the smile of one of the old TV show hosts I used to waste my time on. I didnt realize how much I hate that smile. He is applauding the stiff applause of reality shows as he walks up to me. He clasps his hand on my shoulder and my entire body tenses like a spring.

Sweat started to build upon his brow.  His vision was becoming blurry.   Tyler sensed that he was starting to have a panic attack.  If he passed out at these depths that would be deadly.  He closed his eyes and began to breathe in slowly. 

He released his breath out in a robotic manner to control himself.  Tyler pictured his kids and thought how stupid he was for coming down here in the first place.  He had always wanted to be an explorer, someone that pushed the limits of man's knowledge.  Now, all he wanted was to be home with a bowl of pasta eating with his family.   The thought of homemade food made him realize the incredible stench surrounded him.  Normally the mixture of sweat and pressure made these journeys unpleasant, but this was different.  It smelled overwhelming like burnt hair.  

Tyler and opened his eyes and saw her.  She wasn't shaped in any sort of natural shape.  The closest description he thought of was jellyfish constantly folding in on itself.  He was filled with dread, but couldn't move.  His breath grew shallower.  His body was tensing up and the ringing noise grew louder in his head.  The sensory overload was becoming too great Tyler saw the tunnel and began to fade. He could no longer keep himself up and fell over. 

Tyler did not hit the ground of the pod.  His vision was gone but he could feel the sensation of falling.  The wind rushed past him and his existence was fragile.  He couldn't move any of limbs.  He tried to scream out, but there was no longer any noise.  In fact, there were no longer any senses to him besides the falling no sounds, no smell, no taste, he didn't even see darkness.  All he could do was feel the void rush past him. Tyler, could no longer think in words or images.  He could feel a longing for something, no someone.  He thought of everything and nothing until he longer thought at all.  He then fell for as long as one can fall in a place with no time.  Until he stopped.  

Tyler woke up on the floor of the sub.  It was in the process of ascending.  He thought that he must have begun the process of ascending prior to passing out.  Maybe it was all just a terrible dream.  Maybe Tyler would be able to forget what had happened.  He could feel the note in his hand, but he still wanted to pretend it wasn't there.  Pretend that the world he lived in made sense for just a little while longer.  

But, Tyler was an explorer he was unable to resist the basest urge inside himself.  He looked down and began to read.

""What a ridiculous request!"" An elderly fairy stamped out of the room, her glimmering wings fluttering behind her as she stormed out of the wooden stables. 

""I know, I know, but you know the rules."" A younger one followed, her feet moving just as deliberately.  ""We must grant any wish given to the Queen."" 

""The rules be damned!"" 

""No. The rules will be followed, Clarice, with or without your permission. Telling you was a courtesy"" 

""Don't push your luck, Mauve.""

The elderly fairy pivoted on her heel and stuck a finger into the thin, vulpine face of the other fairy, who returned her sour look, ten fold. 

""...I raised her since she was a foal, Mauve."" 

""I know...""

""I pulled her out of the Roots myself.""

""I know, Clarice.""

""Hell, she ain't old enough to be without proper care, Mauve.""

""I know Clarice but the --"" 

""I know, Mauve, the rules."" Clarice sighed, her wings drooping as she moved with Mauve back to the stables, pulling out a small white colt, with a diamond horn coming from it's head. 

""Just...give me a second, alright?"" 

""Of course."" 

Her hand wandered over the small creature's head, around the base of it's horn, then down the small of it's back, the unicorn whinnying all the way. She took a deep breath and lifted her. 

""I'll bring her, let me see this child."" 

Mauve nodded and led the elder fairy across the city, to the castle -- a tree spiraling like a tower, it's top disappearing far above the clouds -- the tree that held the Worlds together. 

They walked up a root, and towards the Queen's audience chamber -- a vast hall of green, with her wooden throne pressed against the far side. 

""One Unicorn, as requested, your majesty."" Mauve said, motioning for Clarice to come in.

The queen eyed the elderly fairy carrying the foal, and nodded, a trail of pink dust leaving the Queen's eyes, and wrapping around both the Unicorn and the little girl, who stood wide-eyed staring at the going on's -- her feet bare, and caked with mud, and her pale faced bruised from a large hand.

""Goodbye human."" The queen said, snapping her fingers.

""Take care of her!"" Clarice called after the child, before she faded out of their world.

One day, during a cleaning, he found a dust covered one that had rolled under his desk.",boa_con,"The air when cold as death looked down on the small ornate hour glass. Death does not make mistakes but here it was covered in dust. Death examined the gilded glass deftly brushing the dust off a name of it owner. Some poor soul by the name of Edward Cullen, forgotten by death. As the reaper griped the hour glass and focused on the name with a turn he was now deep in a wood.  Large pines stretched up around death swaying softly in the wind. Though  he could not feel hot or cold the soft crunch of the underbrush beneath his skeletal feet told him it was near winter. Dimly lit by small breaks in the canopy death could was he was looking for. A rope hung from a branch an uninteresting pine, the frayed end swinging softly in the wind. 

“*where were you??*” a small voice crept out of the darkness. The voice belonged to a young man around 21, tall, smartly dressed with dark hair. He stepped forward, his feet never touching the ground instead hovering inches above. His pail completion exasperating the red and black marks around his neck. “*Where were you??*” he asked now with sparks of anger in his voice. “*do you know how long I have been here??. Alone. Aren't you meant to take me to the other side, the afterlife, isn't that what you do.*” The anger now clear is voice he advances on death. “*Alone, just me and myself, slowly decaying as I watched. Questioning very decision I every made, and why it ended like this*” he gestures to a pile of tattered clothes and bones clumped unceremoniously on the hard ground beneath the rope. “*Round and round the questions go as I torturing myself about what could have been, what I could have done and what I have done to my friends, my family. Alone*” His voice was beaming to crack and tears where waking in his eyes.

“*So, the great grim reaper, take me away, no where you take me can be worse than this hell*""

Death unable to show any emotion simply bows his head and whispers “**I am sorry**""",RougeUnit001

Last year this kid Billy from high school, on a dare, went into the house on Halloween and after a while there was screaming and lights flashing everywhere.  Billy came out the backdoor wearing Iron man's suit, covered in refuse.

The next day a group of Billy's friends went in there wearing their costumes from the night before hoping to get some of that sweet super powered action.  You would think it would be funny watching a fat kid get eaten by a werewolf screaming about his wolverine healing not working, or the nerd down the street screaming about his light saber not working but it was a bloody mess all over the place.

More groups tried during a full moon, one group even tried during Christmas.  I figured it out though, I watched them all go in and die, except for Billy.  I could see the house out my front window, it gave me a chance to see everything.

""Lato, my true heart. Surely you see that I must. I must! Don't you see? Never can we rest until we are free of this curse of poverty! Never!""

I was set on my course of action. Dressed as I was, I believed I would have what it takes. My mortal skills I did practice each day. My magic would come when within. I knew it would hurt my loved ones, but for my children and for the unborn one I could not let us live like this! My heart demanded that I take up this mantle.

""I do see. But I just wish so desperately that it wasn't so!""

It was a brave face I put on for my family. In all truth, I was terrified. Not for myself though, just what would my family do if I didn't make it? Tales of monsters untold came from survivors of the house.

They waited outside for challengers. ""Sir! I beseech ye! Do not enter, that what lies within is not worth the final prize! It truthfully can never be sir!""

Never did they listen. The young boys and men who returned, would always return truly scarred.

Now I was to join their ranks in search of the ultimate prize - for my family to be free of poverty, came above all.

Some of them were creepy: a fat, rotting zombie, a Predator, Pennywise, skeletons and stuff. Some were just for showing off, a touch of creepiness on a beautiful face.

""Who are you gonna dress up as?"" she asked, and I thought about it. Sure, I could ask her for help with the makeup, turn into something cool and scary. But I always preferred finding my own ways, even if they weren't optimal. Something that would get a 'what are you doing here?' reaction from just about everyone would still be better for me if I knew what I was going for.

""Contessa,"" I replied.

""Who?""

""Nevermind, just a character I like."" With a shrug, she returned to her searching. Now, where I was gonna get a costume of the Cape Boogeyman from?..

***

I was striding through the town, dressed up like a businesswoman. A fedora sat upon my head, filling me with confidence and just a little touch of giddiness. Sometimes I asked myself questions just to stay in character, like 'How do I find something nice to look at' (I found a cat!), 'How do I survive the night' (so many vampires around!) or 'How do I entertain myself'. Shortly after the last one I came across an old abandoned house. It looked so creepy, I was almost afraid to go inside. But I did ask for entertainment, right? And ghosts weren't real anyway. With this thought I found myself stepping through the front door.

A path blossomed in my mind, and in this second I knew exactly what to do next.

After the first shock I left my body going on autopilot, watching with fascination as it hid, ran and fought with minimal effort, like an experienced player going through a game level, and started thinking. It wasn't normal at all, but it couldn't be a dream. There were too many details, too many senses.

And then the realization hit me. I asked for three things. And my body right now worked like Contessa's would if she asked for the same paths. Now how do I get out of it?

Easy.

How do I get the most out of the situation I found myself in?

Slightly longer. Still easy.

By the time I'd clicked the receiver down, my life had a sudden and clear purpose: I knew what I needed to do. Hell, I guess I'll start at the beginning...

The phone rang and I lifted it to my ear with a chirpy ""Elinor's exorcisms, how can I help?"" Pays to stay friendly - it's not the client's fault that life has gone to shit. The voice on the other side of the line sounded different. Wispy, somehow.

""Elllinor. Can you hellp me?""

It seemed off somehow - but I'll take whatever spook show I can get.

""I'll certainly see what I can do. What do you need?""

A bitter hiss: ""I need to get out of this body. This being is disgusting. I can haunt him no more."" 

""I'm sorry, sir. I'm not sure I follow you.""

""You are an exorcist? I am in need of an exorcising. Send me back into my crumbling grave - please. Come to 18 Waltham Avenue. I will give you the name for the incantation. This foul man refuses to recite it. I used to be dignified, you know. Now listen to this awful rasp. I'll take my chances with the otherside.""

Then before I had a chance to respond, another voice. Or really the same voice, but sounding somehow different. ""You should have thought about that before you choose this 'old fool' to inhabit. I can make you belch, spirit."" And he does, forcing out a burp and laughing. ""Where's your dignity now?"" He speaks to me - the man, this time, not the spirit: ""don't come, demon catcher, if you know what's good for you."" And the phone goes click.

But I'm already halfway out the door and planning my new strapline: ""Elinor's Exorcisms. A spook's first stop for a haunting gone wrong"".

You, an aspiring exorcist, are bad at all of them. You're about to give upon your dream, when you discover a new, unconventional technique.",jpeezey,"The call came at around midnight. I groaned inwardly as I reached for the receiver, keeping an eye on the alertotem hooked to the phone. Sure enough, the thing—resembling a termite nest—flared red and began belching orange smoke from some of its irregularly shaped holes. A big one, and very angry. Maybe I'd better sit this one out. Ring ring. Nobody in the office to your emergency now.

Except ... there really was no one in the office. No one except one trainee exorcist who hadn't made any Halloween plans. Ah, hell.

""Hello, Exorcist.exe, what's your emergency?"" I said, trying not to cringe at the name.

There was a scratching sound on the side, followed by a scream. The line went dead.

If only it were that easy. The smoke pouring out of the alertotem was taking on the defined shapes of words and numbers. I copied the address onto my phone, grabbed my exorcist's kit, and headed out, wishing I'd taken that internship offer at the meat processing plant.

***

A short Uber ride later, I arrived at a once-pleasant little suburban street now terrorized by gangs of children in freakish costumes. I had to skirt around a veritable army of vampires to avoid being trampled on my way up the pumpkin-adorned lawn belonging to the Lamars.

""Hello?"" I called, after the house's inhabitants failed to answer my the third ring of the buzzer. Time to leave, I thought. I'd done as much as I'd been expected to do.

The door creaked open, agonizingly slow. Dammit, we have a drama queen here. I took one step into the house and said, ""Holy, sweet Jesus.""

Blood covered the floors, furniture, walls, ceiling ... practically every inch that wasn't the old woman rocking in a chair. From a single, inexperienced glance, I could tell that all that red had been recently emptied from the pile of mutilated bodies next to Granny that were almost certainly the Lamars.

""Trick or treat?"" Granny asked, then threw her head back and cackled. Blood caked the sides of her mouth.

Fighting the urge to throw up, I knelt and set my exorcist kit on the floor. Opening it revealed several compartments filled with ingredients and materials for exorcism. After a moment's consideration, I covered the packet of condoms with a notebook.

""How can I help you?"" I said pleasantly.

""Get out!"" Her voice echoed painfully in my brain—I was sure it was a psychic burst.

I grabbed a bottle of blessed water and stood. ""In the name of God, I commend thee—""

""Command.""

""Excuse me?""

She waved irritably. ""The word's 'command', squirtling.""

""Oh. Shit. Well, in the name of—""

""Hold it, you can't use shit in the same breath as 'God'.""

I scowled. ""That's not true. Dr. Letchum—""

""Dr. Amar Letchum? He's a hack, never exorcised a single spirit in his day!""

My face grew hot. ""You're lying. Anyway, it doesn't matter."" I uncorked the bottle and tossed the contents into her face. She blinked, water dripping from her glasses, and burst into laughter.

I dove for my kit, but an invisible force shoved it out of my reach. I glanced at her, frightened and angry, but she was still lost in her mirth. I threw myself at the kit, desperate, but it danced away. Once more I tried, and yet again she teased it from me. Finally, sweating and soaked with bloody residue, I stood and faced her.

""You might as well kill me now,"" I said. ""I don't have the tools or experience to deal with you.""

She cocked her head. ""Really? I've been in this body for less than an hour and the first exorcist I meet is already giving up?""

I threw my hands up. ""For my next trick, what would you like? The cocaine mix? I've never gotten the dosage right in the three months I'd spent on this job. The talisman and Sanskrit chant? The last time I tried that, I set my colleague on fire. The chime? I gave an entire neighborhood nightmares when I used that. The wool candle? Yeah, last time—""

""I get the idea,"" Granny said. She giggled. ""There's still the—""

""No!"" I shouted.

She blinked at me. ""The gun. You have a Smith and Wesson Model Number 2 Army, no?""

""And kill poor Granny Lamar while I'm trying to get your ass out?"" I crossed my arms and closed my eyes. ""Just make it quick. I'm done with this shit anyway.""

The chair squeaked, and then I heard the squelch of approaching footsteps. Suddenly, I could feel her icy, musty breath on my face.

""Weakling,"" she whispered.

""Yeah, yeah. Dan the weakling. Bottom of his class, scraped a pass only because ... only because Dr. Letchum wanted to maintain his perfect track, hack record. Now I know why."" My fists hardened. ""I'm in so much student debt my grandchildren will still be paying after I'm gone. My parents practically disowned me when I chose exorcism over engineering—I guess they won't even care when my disemboweled corpse appears on the news.""

Granny sounded thoughtful when she said, ""I could carve 'sorry, mom and dad' on your chest.""

""Yeah, thanks. My company's gonna frame that up probably. A probationary tale to all new recruits. Don't be Dan, sticking around in the office on a day off just 'cause he's trying to suck up to the bosses. Also, a probationary tale to just not suck, cause he can't even perform a basic water blessing to save his life, literally. And all because Dr. Goddamn Letchum was a conman.""

""I almost regret telling you that.""

""Yeah, and even if I dust you off to the spirit realm, what'll that even do for me? Slap on the back by that horse-faced George, 'oh very well done, you have a bright future', only to be behind on rent for the third time this year, and Sandra won't even talk to me anymore because who wants to even date a loser of an exorcist, 'specially when that Poe guy put the jam on that spirit-infested concert she was at ...""

""Okay, you may want to sit down or something,"" Granny said gently. ""I could make you some tea.""

I cracked on eye open. ""Granny Lamar?""

The old lady smiled sweetly, her eyes flashing with electricity. ""Nope.""

""Ah, right. Well, get on with it. Who knows, we can be best spirit buds after. I've already failed here. Granny's family is gone, and Granny herself's probably insane.""

The spirit-possessed woman nodded. There was a hint of apology in her tone when she said, ""I ... had to. I was hungry, and she was so, so positive, and I had to make her do horrible things to create a negative aura, see? So—""

I sighed and spread my arms. ""Yeah, well. Dive right in, baby. I don't got anything to lose.""

She frowned. ""You ... are you serious? An exorcist must secure himself first and foremost. Never before has ...""

""Get in already,"" I said. ""Maybe once you're done feeding, you'll scram.""

The lights winked out from Granny's eyes. She dropped into a boneless pile, as something invisible, like a wintry breeze, brushed against the front of my body. Then a voice spoke, in my mind and from my mouth, ""Oh, what a feast!""

As my own thoughts, memories, my own sense of self, began fading, I conjured one last, worried notion: no exorcist, even Dr. Letchum, had ever suggested offering one's own self for possession.

sometimes i wonder if ill ever make it in this business. i hardly get and calls from dispatch because they know ill need back up. because im on commission ive had to take on a second job. 
    prostitution isnt as bad as it looks in the documentaries but its no cakewalk. my specialty is blowjobs. it just seemed like the least violating choice and i needed the money. The biggest problem is that the late nights have been making me groggy during my day job, ive been preforming even worse at the para-police station. 
    it all happened quite by accident, i mean enough blowjobs and it starts to become muscle memory. i got a call finally, i guess the other busters were busy or the dispatcher wanted to send me on a silly call. reports say a 656: nude poltergeist, apparently i was right they want to embarrass me. I showed up to the house, the residents were evacuated for safety, what a joke. unbelievably nude ghosts are quite common and the precinct has protocols for this. so ecto-undies in hand i approach the door and enter the house. 
    whoa thats a big one, almost a shame this guys dead. anyway enough lookin around, ecto-undies in hand i start chasing. ive never been great at this, embarrassingly ill probably fail horribly and have to call back up... to help me put underwear on a ghost. at this point im so tired, im almost not even trying i know im gonna fail barely giving chase. then suddenly in my sleepy running chase i trip on a loose board and fall (pay attention here) i had just barely caught up to the ghost and as i fall he turns around probably to scare me away and what follows is both embarrassing and mind blowing.
    yup my mouth open and everything. all i can think is this ghost is gonna talk about this when backup gets here and ill be the laughing stock of the precinct, even more than i already am. And then... well it got worse. ive heard of people falling asleep at the wheel and waking up in their driveway having automaticly driven home, this is sorta like that except a little... different. Anyway the details aren’t important all that’s important is i know how to become the very best now, i know the secret: ghosts can be exercised via blowjob.

""Because I may not have faith in those things, but I do have faith in this: that canned peas are the grossest shit ever, and I'd rather literally leave my body than be touched by them."" With a deft crank, the can opener performed its task, baring the salty horror-orbs. They lay swollen and pale-green in their tin casing, like the feet of a corpse abandoned  in the river. I take up a spoon, fingers shaking.

""Eat up!"" I screech, lobbing the canned peas at the demon's host's startled face. As they splatter against its cheeks, a faint steam rises. It gives a horrified wail, and writhes on the bedcovers, shaking its head back and forth like a dog trying to shake off water. Try as it might, the peas struck home.

Later, fellow exorcists would ask how I was able to defeat the demon that had stumped so many that came before me. New employees would ask for tips, guidance, inspiration. With a shrug, I'd tell them, ""Give peas a chance.""",milkysatan
"[WP] ""Death is a gentle thing if you welcome it, like a soft breeze or a bashful kiss."" - ""Then what's the scythe for?"" - ""The people who resist.""",jpeezey,"Everyone is scared of death in someway or the other. Whether it is timelt or untimely death. What is meant by untimely? Death is death irrespective of the age when someone dies. Mistake could be anyone's
and that is irrelevant as death has arrived no matter what. Not fulfilling your heart's desire, concern about family after death, there are so many things that makes a person concerned about
dying. Unfulfilled desires, desires will always remain unfulfilled. How many can a person try to fulfill unless they prevent their mind and senses from creating more
desires. Either one achieves that or remain unfulfilled. Who will sustain one's family after their death is another major concern which makes people quite anti to the idea of welcoming death.
Creating dependency of the family members on self for finance, support etc unintentionally or intentionally will lead to such fears. In my lifetime I have had to raise my scythe almost everytime
so much so that my scythe has become my default move. I started with this job of leading those who have lived the marvellous life that they were offered to their best abilities, to second innings
of their journey as a particular person. I thought it will be a happy transition for most except a few unfortunate ones. What I saw was a complete reversal of my expectations. Except a few 
rare exceptions, I had to use my scythe. Everywhere I have seen regrets, greed, wishes except a welcoming glance or a friendly smile. I never tire. It is not in my nature to 
be tired and this is a problem to the entire humankind. I now laugh in sadness at their plight. 

In my usual busy day of ending people's bodies, I came across a man who was breathing way too slowly and ought to have been dead by usual standards. But he wasn't as I could sense a strong life force
in him. It wasn't the first time in my lifetime that I was seeing something like this but it is a rarity. Once in a  thousand year event. There was one era where I saw this in higher frequency 
but that phase lasted for about a 100 years and after that this is the first time. These are the only times when I did not have to raise my scythe but rather have a good conversation with the 
full of life dead person. It is truly a priviledge to see such men and women. As I stand in front of this person I see him take a deep breath after quite some time. I found him in his room which
was empty except for a small mat on which he was sitting. I decided to look around his place and found another room with speakers, laptop, phone, and a LOT of books, flute, some marijuana and a good
collection of scotch. There was another room with a bed and it seemed like there is another person living with him. All of this was very unusual for me. For someone like him living in a space
like this is unusual. Very unusual. I have mostly seen such people living in very simple surroundings or rather in natural habitats. This person's house was like any other normal house. Why was
I at his place? Oh yes, I had to take someone with me in a few hours. It didn't seem like this man though. I wait for some time to see who it will be. Let me spare the others some more life.
t is almost 8 in the night and a lady sweating profusely walks in. She seems to have done some physical workout. She entered the room where the man was sitting quietly and shouted- ""Do you 
still don't want to eat anything? What is wrong with you! It has been years since you have gone like this. Sitting quietly and not engaging in conversation.Anyway. You won't even reply now!"". The man opens his eyes and walks out of the room, smiles at her and asks her how her day was. She replies 
in agitation about her colleagues, somebody did something, some third person was affected and the lady was agitated. He listened to her woes silently without replying. After she was done, he asked her again how her day went and laughed out loud. She glared at him and went to the kitchen. Dinner was already
ready.By 11 in the night she was ready to sleep and the man went to the third room. He opened his laptop and other equipments. He seemed to work with electronics. How do I know this? I see and learn what humans are upto. He spent 2-3 hours sitting and working with his equipments. He was engrossed in his work. Suddenly both
of us turned around to go to the bedroom. I reached in an instant whereas he ran across the house. When he entered, he felt me swinging my scythe at his wife and he dashed across the room.
I had taken his wife.The man slumped at her side, cried and looked up. I have a feeling he saw me. He didn't say a word the entire time and simply asked, ""Why so early? 
She was understanding with time. She would have welcomed you had you given her a little more time."" And he sighed and said ""Had to happen. Some day."" And he smiled with tears flowing and said,
""The day we meet each other, we will have a lot to talk about. I am learning to live for now.""",chaisme
"[WP] After being rejected by every magic school for being a commoner, an old 'evil wizard' asks if you would like to become his apprentice.",kimedog,"*Dear Mr. Henry Bottles*

*We regret to inform you that your application to The Pigbumps Institute for the Magically Inclined was not accepted.*

*Thank you for your interest in Pigbumps. We wish you luck in your future endeavors as an aspiring magic user, paranormal activist, or preternaturalist.*

*Cordially,*
*Head Dean Humblesocks, M. Esq.*

""Goddammit.""

The words were emblazoned on a page of falsely aged, tea-dyed computer paper. A dusting of glitter, also, now laid on the ground. I presumed this must be contrary to intention, though what could really be expected from a knock off school for witchcraft and wizardry?  In fact, after 8 or so rejections, should I have expected anything less own the line? Necromancin' ain't easy, as they... well... as *I* say.

""Burn this, Maggot."" I held the rejection letter up and a boney hand gripped the faux-parchment nearly on command.

""Ooooh.... Shiiiiiiny..."", said the ghoul. 

""It really isn't, Maggot.""

""*Unnnnngh*..."" he retorted, tossing the crappy immitation into the fire. 

I've never really been clear if ""*Unnnnngh*"" meant assent, confusion, or disagreement. The interaction was apparently reflexive and happened nearly every time I gave Maggot a task. To add insult to injury, the creature, at this point, could only do two things: 1) grabbing item A and taking it to location B, and 2) rot idly. So, you can imagine my frustration, as this plays out literally every time I tell Maggot to do something.

I really, *really* need a decent teacher.

""Ok, Maggot. Just... go to your spot.""

The ghoul complied diligently and returned to his enclosure. I say *enclosure* because, well, you couldn't call it a *room*, conventionally. It was more like a pen or a stye, really. Torn fabric and newspaper littered the floor and a loose pile of animal bones sat in the far corner. But, the thing likes it in there, and I'm not opposed to a zombie's happiness. At least one of us should be happy. 

I walked outside, and grabbed some air. Crisp, I zipped my sweatshirt closed and walked down the street to my favorite coffee shop to think. *Quips and Cauldrons* was the quirky, tongue-in-cheek name for the place. The gimmick? They served lattes in wax paper cups shaped like kettles.

""Hey, Henry. Your usual?"" Cassie was a good friend and a top notch latté artist. She, too, aspired to be a more than mundane.

""Sure, I guess."" I grabbed a hot cup of latté playfully referred to as Nightshade. Only deadly if you've somehow stepped over the median lethal dose for caffeine. Cassie decorated it with a memento Mori. 

""Another rejection letter, huh?""

""Yeah.""

""Bummer.""

""Well you know what they say, 9th times the charm.""

""Funny."" Cassie rolled her eyes, but I had learned she did this when she *liked* something. ""Don't worry. Me too.""

""Maybe we could try one of those online magic universities.""

Cassie yanked her arm above her head and stuck her tongue out. ""Keep jokin', Henry. Next you'll say you're getting a tutor.""

That... actually wasn't a bad idea. 

""Why, do you know any?""

Cassie's eyes went wide and nodded to the bulletin board in the corner. It was covered with what seemed like 100 fliers, but one stood out.

""Good luck with that. Say hi to Maggot, for me.""

I tore a tag from it.

""Ohhhh. *Shiny*.""

""Be nice about Maggot. He can't help that.""

""Thanks, Cassie."" I said, waiving my tag.

""Don't mention it.""

I ran home and found Maggot shambling in his enclosure. Humming, maybe? I had no idea. I grabbed my phone and dialed. A sleepy voice answered the phone.

""Mmmm... Yes?""

""Mr. Valravn?""

""What're you selling?""

""Selling?""

""Well, you're selling something. It's the middle of the day and I was sleeping. It's always-""

""Sir, I'm responding to your ad. I'm looking for a necromancy tut-""

""Night.""

""Huh?""

""We work at night. Meet me at the graveyard near Yew Street. 9 pm""

""Ok.""

""Bring a shovel and a snack. Wear all black.""

""A snack.""

""Well, yeah. A snack. You'd want one, too, if you hadn't eaten in 10 years.""

""Oooo-kay.""

""Better than the alternative.""

"[WP] Scientists have developed a serum to make it so you don't have to sleep anymore. It is optional but comes with a catch: if you take it, you will never be able to sleep again.",koeghls,"Initially, getting used to a life without having to sleep, or even deal with the trouble of getting sleepy seemed like heaven to me. ""It's like drinking coffee every hour, without the part where you crash and burn mentally"" I thought, trying to convince my brain that this wasn't a stupid idea. I popped off the cap and drunk as much of the slimy green liquid as my slim build could handle - which turned out to be the whole bottle.

At first, well - I felt nothing. It WAS 8 am in the morning to be fair and I DID have my usual 8 hours of sleep (oh boy how I was going to miss that(!)). So I began my crazy experiments. I went out and bought as much Pizza, Fizzy Juice, Sleeping Tablets, Tea, Coffee - anything, that could make a man sickly tired. Realising that I could eat as much of these items as possible without wanting to take a nap made me feel like God for a day. I drunk half of the fizzy juice bottle and used it as my cauldron. Sleeping tablets I popped in first. Coffee beans soon followed, don't forget the tea bags and of course, to add some flavour, the finest pizza I could find, awkwardly squashed through the opening.

Once again, even before going to work at 11, I felt - nothing. I strolled into the office almost laughing at my colleagues, crowding the coffee machine, squeezing out the juices that they would need to complete another day in the endless grind. One of my fellow colleagues who used to take coffee with me in the morning asked me in her usual soft, slightly accented voice, ""no coffee today I see?"". ""Nah"" I replied like the cocky ass I was. While working I realised that I could throw all-night parties with all of my colleagues and never feel tired. I would be most popular at work, I would probably get a raise from my boss and most importantly, it'll be hell of a lot of fun.

I worked overtime that day, 5 hours overtime. I only left when there was no one left to judge. But alas alack, the day was over. Well, not for me! I quickly rushed on to my phone on the train and called for all of my friends and colleagues to meet at my house, for the ""bestest party eva!!"".

I came home and there must have been, pff, 500 or so people there. But I was in the zone, I no longer felt like some throwaway loser who was only seen as a mere 'unit', but as an actual human, an actual superhero, a GOD!

The party was epic. Truly epic. I used my superpowers to be the greatest host ever. Fuelling conversations, refilling drinks, hell I even busted out some dance moves like Miss Fernsby, in my old high school's prom. But, when it was 2 am in the morning. I heard the dreaded, ""bye!"" ""see ya later"" and worst of all, ""i'm tired, I must go. See you at work!"". ""WHAT?"" I thought, ""How DARE these infertile cretins, leave because they are feeling a bit nappy."" I ran to the doors and barricaded them... with my body. They tried to budge past me. I was in control. And I loved it. ""Move, please"". ""No! You stay here"". I must have stood there for a good 3 minutes. The people got rowdy and everyone was clearly furious... at me. Soon. I heard the sirens.

I can still hear them in my head. ""NI-NO-NI-NO!"" It never stops. The police forced themselves in and arrested me on the spot for false imprisonment. I was sent to jail for the night. ""Ok."" I thought. ""Maybe I should calm my act a bit. I am God after all. And. Well. God, was a good person, I presume. So. I should do the same! Yeah! When I get out of jail, I am going to be a different pers-"". I was fired on the spot when I arrived to work the next day.

""Ok, I lost my job. Fine. I can deal with this"", still confident. All of my friends disappeared from my social networks. I controlled my emotions. I called Mum and explained the whole situation, she was cross. Extremely cross, and that was BEFORE I had told her about the whole, 'me being arrested thing'. When I told her. She said I was a lost cause and hung up immediately.

Now the tears were rolling. I lost my job, friends and possibly family. I fell into a deep depression.

The following months were the hardest of my life. I had to live every moment, awake. I couldn't sleep to hurry the inevitable and I lived in pure isolation for months. Eventually, my past experiments also caught up on me. I was vast and - well. Obese. I now carried the shame I inherited from the past with me everywhere. Everywhere. Everywhere.

Weeks passed and I was in serious debt. The bank told me that if I couldn't pay my debts they'd have to take my house. I had nothing. I sold everything I had for coffee to try and overpower the potion. Nothing worked. The Bank came. Everything was gone. Like a rug had been pulled from underneath me in an instant. I was now a nothing. I sat for my first 3 hours homeless on the pavement and thought, ""this is just a bad dream"". Realising the reality made me cry instantly. I mistook the tears for rain.

I now lived in the local park. I was terrified of the dark and ghastly figures would walk in the horizon, judging me. Judging me for my faults. No one loved me. I didn't love myself. How could I? Wasted my life away. For - for -...

Nothing.

I lie on the brown soggy bench today. Giving you my story. Goodnight. Please - don't pity my life.",TheNuttyGamer

The seagull has come to steal your lunch again.,ololili,"It's Tuesday again I really shouldn't be in the park on a Tuesday. I keep asking myself why. Why did I choose to cut through the park on a Tuesday. TUESDAY of all days! The worst one for sure. Tuesday. Bleh.

Now if it was a Wednesday, I wouldn't have a problem. I'd carry my goods through the park without a hitch, get to the nearest cafe and eat in peace. Thursday through Sunday too, I would have been absolutely fine cutting through the park. Monday is kinda iffy, but even then I'd still take it over a TUESDAY.

But nope. It's Tuesday. *Feeding day.*

Ever since the animals all started getting bigger, we've all come up with our own theories as to what caused them to mutate; what caused them to grow. None of us have come up with any answer and none of us really have a solution. They just keep getting bigger. How much bigger? 

Lets just say there's one reason you don't cut through the park on a Tuesday. That reason is Frank. Frank is one of the bigger ones. Frank is a ruthless killer. Frank is the park's seagull. Ever since he started growing, he's gotten bigger than most buses. He's grown talons and his beak has become razor sharp. 

I saw him capture my buddy Joe the other week. Joe was running through the park on a Tuesday. Joe had clam chowder. Frank smelled that clam chowder and took to the skies. His magnificence shining as he made that undulating call. A call that sent shivers down all of our backs as we hurried Joe, but to no avail. Frank ripped him up, carrying him through the sky and that's the last we ever saw of Joe or his clam chowder. 

Now I'm in Joe's shoes. Running through the park, eyes darting around the horizon looking for any sign of those wings. I'm halfway to the cafe, no signs of anything yet. My heart's racing. Sweat is building up on my brow. I'm starting to breath hard. I finally start to think maybe Tuesday wasn't such a bad idea.

That's when I see him. I see Frank. Frank the seagull.

Frank rises through the tree line and I hear him make that call. That sickening call. He's on the hunt for food.

Shit. Here I am, running through his territory on a Tuesday. What was I thinking?

I'm not sure if I'll make it, I can hear the beating of his wings behind me growing closer. He's after me. He's after my lunch.

This time, she would make it. This time she had come prepared.

She glared up at the seagull again, then tucked her pigtails into the hood of her pink coat.
Reaching into her pocket, she felt the hard plastic form of her baby brother's toy french fries.

Vivian smirked as she zipped up her jacket with her lunch inside, holding the plastic fries in her left hand.

She stepped forward, looking at the shadow of her nemesis circle the tarmac.

""Squak"" it said, as if it knew she was about to run. As if in anticipation of stealing her lunch.

Vivian ran.

""Squak"" the seagull said. Vivian saw its shadow turn toward her. It was closing in fast.

Shrieking, she threw the plastic fries to the side. The shadow veered toward the decoy fries, just as Vivian had planned.

The door was just ahead. She heard the gull squak again as it landed and attacked the fries. Almost there.

Vivian reached out toward the doors. She felt something shift under her coat. Her lunch fell to the ground.

Vivian shrieked again as her lunch box hit the pavement. Her sandwich and juice box scattered around her legs.

Vivian reached down to pick up her fallen meal, but the gull was already upon her.
It let out a triumphant squak before picking her sandwich up in its beak.
Vivian kicked at the thief, but it was too quick for her. The gull took off into the air, leaving Vivian standing at the school doors with a nearly empty lunchbox.

Looking at the mess, Vivian started to cry. Then she glared up at the gull and her tears stopped.

[WP] Every new technology has growing pains and time travel is no exception. No one really expected though that animal activists would go back and save from extinction a species that could still be higher than us on the food chain... dragons,Ambian84,"It was obvious what we'd needed to do.

There's plenty of good reason to bring a species back from the dead. Often they bring the ecosystem back with them; those wolves in Yellowstone that changed the landscape so profoundly that it reshaped the park's rivers, those woolly mammoths the Russians brought back to maintain the ground cover in Siberia to buy us all a little more time before the permafrost breaks down and the methane output turns our planet into Venus. Sometimes an altered version of a long-extinct animal can be the best tool for the job, too - I don't think anybody expected those sea cows to be that good at pulling microplastics out of the oceans, after we'd altered enough of their microbiome to be able to sequester it. Sentimentality, too. I get that. I got to watch my eight year old kid see a humpback for the first time since they went extinct. He got to touch it. That was something.

But none of that solves the underlying problem, and the underlying problem is *us*. There weren't any wolves in Yellowstone because we hunted them all to extinction. We didn't just happen to grow up in a world without insect life, we killed it all. Our civilization isn't looking down the barrel of the climate change apocalypse because that's just life; we put ourselves there. Because we prioritized wrong. Because we couldn't properly balance the benefits of our lives with their consequences. And there's really no technological panacea for that.

I'll tell you what we can do, though. We can change the problem from one we're not evolved to deal with, to one we are.

Problem: We're overpopulated and over-using resources to the point that we've set in motion the sixth great mass extinction to ever happen in the history of our planet.

Solution: We re-distribute our population and we reserve at least 50 percent of the planet's total surface, earth and sea, for parkland. We don't enter those zones. No human habitation, no resource extraction, no waste disposal. Nothing. That gives the ecosystems we depend on for oxygen and food pollination, among a shit-ton of other things, a chance to breathe. A chance to grow back. Some of the models suggest it'll take as little as two hundred years, if we use some genetic engineering to push the biodiversity along.

But we can't get people to stay out of there. You can't get ten billion hungry monkeys to line up and dance for you, and you can't get every damn nation on board to make the laws, follow them, and spend trillions enforcing them. Classic prisoner's dilemma: It's only effective if everybody complies, and who on earth is going to be gullible enough to assume *that*?

But there is a solution, if you stare at the problem long enough.

You know what we evolved for? Survival. That's the real problem. We aren't striving against some external challenge anymore, we're striving against the engineering failures in *our own selves.* 

The problem isn't that we need better consensus, or better laws. The problem is, we need something that gives us a run for our money. We need to change the ecosystems we're trying to protect into something that can protect itself.

So yeah, your honor: We brought them back. Of course we brought them back. Best thing for everybody. And yeah, they're a hundred feet of malicious fire-breathing armored scale and teeth, and maybe they cost us a sheep or two, and I know, Fort Knox is still angry about that incident with the bullion, but you know what?

John stumbled. He blinked as he looked around him. He was in an expansive white space. There was nothing there. He was just walking into the kitchen to grab a pair of scissors to open a package he'd gotten, but as soon as he crossed the threshold, he was suddenly here, in this place. Lack of a place? He wasn't sure.

""Hello, John,"" came a voice behind him.

John turned and jumped back. He hadn't seen the young woman before. Perhaps she hadn't even been there.

""I didn't mean to startle you,"" she said. She smiled sweetly, her blue eyes twinkling with knowledge John could barely begin to comprehend, especially considering she looked no more than 20 years old. ""I require something from you, and then you're free to go about your day.""

""Wha- Whe-,"" John couldn't wrap his head around what was going on. ""Who are you?"" He finally got at least one question out.

""I am God,"" she said simply.

John could only blink.

""I've brought you to this place to do something for me. I suppose in terms you would use, this is like my summer home.""

The woman motioned over to her right. Suddenly a living room appeared. Or at least the furniture. Everything was still white. A futon, some small coffee tables, a TV stand and a TV. The only thing that wasn't white was the screen on the TV.

""I'm unable to get my TV to work.""

John could only blink again, still speechless. Surely a god could figure out how to make a TV work, and didn't need some random dude. Maybe this woman wasn't God after all.

""Yes, I know,"" she said, rolling her eyes. ""God should be able to get things to work, but I've never been very good with new technologies you humans have come up with, however, I enjoy your entertainment endlessly.""

""Uh,"" John started being able to form at least some words, ""and - uh - what do you need me to do exactly?""

""All I want to do right now is watch some new movie, I believe it's called the Lion King."" She looked at him very seriously, and handed him a slender remote.

New movie, he thought to himself. The Lion King? That's like 20 years old. He pointed the remote to the TV and pushed the power button. The TV flickered on and The Lion King began playing.

""Ah, yes, thank you,"" the woman said, moving to sit on the futon. ""You're free to go.""

""Uh, thanks,"" John managed to get out. As he turned around he was back in his kitchen. What the hell did I come in here for?

He moved back into the living room and saw his package sitting on his desk. Oh, right, I need scissors! He ran back into the kitchen to get them. 

He'd never experienced anything like that before, or at least he hadn't remembered. He'd certainly forgotten why he'd gone into rooms, but he had no recollection of that other place he'd been in, and definitely no recollection of the young woman.

He shrugged it off and went about his day.

The next day, he was organizing a shelf in his office. He'd let the books get out of hand, and it had been bugging him, but he'd put it off. Finally, enough was enough. John began to organize. Problem was, the books weren't staying up on the shelf.

I've got those book ends in the living room, he thought to himself. Not like they're very useful in a closed bookshelf. He laid the books down on the shelf and went into the living room.

As soon as he crossed the threshhold, John was once again in that white place. This time he was standing behind the futon, looking at the TV, which was now playing some other Disney from the 90s. Mulan, maybe? He wasn't sure. He had long since stopped watching many Disney movies.

He looked around for the woman. He remembered she called herself God, but he didn't believe that. He turned to his left, no one there.

""Ah, yes, John,"" came a voice behind him. He jumped away again and turned around to face the woman again, with her impossibly blue eyes.

""What the hell is going on here?"" He asked.

""What do you mean?"" she asked him. ""I require you to do something for me.""

""One second, I'm going into my kitchen to grab something and I'm here to turn on your TV,"" John said with a note of annoyance in his voice. ""Then I'm trying to get something from the living room, and now I'm back here again.""

""Oh, so you remember this?"" She looked at him thoughtfully. ""That typically does not occur.""

""Wait, what?""

""Well, I believe this is a phenomenon of when you humans walk into a room and forget why you are there. You see, the reason for this is that I am only able to call you as you cross into another room. You are returned to the precise time I summoned you here, but it has already been enough time that you have forgotten what it is you were doing when you get into the room.""

""Oh,"" was all John could mutter. ""Well, then, what is it that you need today?""

""I want to listen to music,"" she said quite simply again.

""Just music?"" he asked, again feeling incredulous that God needed something so menial.

""Yes."" She handed him the remote for the TV once more.

He studied the remote for a moment. ""There's a music button right here,"" he pointed out to her, and pushed it. The TV switched to playing music. The familiar notes of Barbie Girl came from the TV. ""Is that what you wanted to listen to?""

""Yes, it is. Thank you very much, John, you're free to go.""

John sighed as he turned around, and once again found himself in his living room. Now, what was he in here for again? He went back into the office to try to grasp once again what he needed. Ah, yes, book ends.

He returned to the office once again with the bookends and continued organizing his office space.",Araeis55

Everything is so bright. The doctors check my eyes. All normal. Dang I guess it was a dream.

What was the dream again? 

---------

... I should have woken up in the hospital. This doesnt sound like the hospital. But I can see now, so maybe I am? Everything hurts my eyes. So bright. 

""Yo asshole, you blind? Move up in the Hellp line. We dont want to wait here all day!""

""What do you mean I'm dead? I only had a few shots of vodka before I drove!"" 

""Thank you for stopping by the hellp center, your local purgatory. Please take a ticket and find a seat in the waiting area.""

Somehow I ended up in a seat with a piece of paper in my hand. The machine told me it was number 666,666,123. Lots of shapes surround me. They sound like people talking. 

Half an hour later my number gets called and I get dragged by an invisible force to another room. 

There's another block of shapes in front of me. It starts to talk. Oh this must be what a person looks like.

""Ah shit. I screwed up again. If my boss finds out I'll be fired for sure this time. Listen kid, you weren't supposed to be here this decade.""

""What? I'm supposed to be dead next decade?""

""Shit I slipped again. Look, I said nothing. You hear? Now I'm gonna send you back and we're gonna pretend this was all a drea–""

""Hey, I don't want to die next decade! Why am I in purgatory? Where's your supervisor? I gotta talk with your manager!""

""No you're not. You're going to wake up like nothing happened and I get to keep my job.""

""When I wake up I'm gonna pray lots to all the dieties I can think of about your screwup. Jesus, Allah, Buddha, that dead Scientolgist, or whoever's your superiors.""

""... Shit...K fine. I'll grant you one wish. Usually I ask for a soul in exchange but if you don't tell anyone about this, but I'll make an exception this time. Deal? ""

"" Deal. I want to live a long life.""

""No can do. It's in my employment contract to hunt your life down when your time is up. Just like that movie Final Destination."" 

""... Then I want to be able to predict the future so i can run away from my death."" 

""But that makes my job harde–"" 

""I'm gonna start praying now."" 

""Alright fine. Abracadabra hocus pocus. There you go. Wish granted. "" 

""... But I dont feel any different."" 

""Powers take effect in the living world. Now I'm gonna send you back. Bye bye."" 

I'm dragged again to a new room. Half an hour goes by. Suddenly I start to feel very warm. My body begins to evaporate.

In the distance I hear, 

""You took the wrong person to purgatory again?! You're fired! No I mean it. I don't care about what your angry wife will do! Get out!"" 

-----

""The TV isn't in sync with the audio, nurse. Could you turn it off for me?"" 

The tv gets turned off and turns back on again. The nurse goes to the tv and hits the power button. The screen goes black. 

""Whoa, did you just see the screen flicker?"" 

""I'm sorry sir? It flickered? I had my eyes on the tv, I don't think so. By the way, why are you watching teletubbies? "" 

""Teletubbies? I was watching the news. There was a car crash on November 1st.""

The tests had been going on for a while. Not that I minded too much. Even having to sit in hospital clothes was made better by being able to finally see *colour.* I’d heard the names of colours my whole life but no one had been able to explain it. But they were beautiful. Everything in the hospital room was too bright but the light outside, and the wind moving was breathtaking.

“Last question for now and then you can rest for a bit Cameron.”  

The doctor’s dry voice broke me away from the window. 

“Yes, sorry.” I frowned a bit as I refocused. 

“Quite alright,” The doctor said with a small smile sounding tired. “Now, how many people are in the room?”

My family and friends had left to get dinner. Partially because I was too caught up in looking at them and partly because I wouldn’t do the tests otherwise.

“Four,” I responded decisively. 

For the first time since meeting me, the doctor looked engaged. 

“How many did you say?” 

“Four,” I responded again easily.

He glanced back at the nurse who had been quietly recording the results. She simply shrugged without even glancing up.

“Could you explain?”

“There’s you Dr Foster, the nurse, the man in the t-shirt, and myself.

Both of the medical professionals whipped around to see if someone had walked in. apparently not seeing the man leaning against the wall breathing heavily. He had run in a second ago and stopped after seeing me. The man in question just grinned at me and gave a winked. 

“He’s right there! He just winked and he has dark spots along his face and bandages across his chest.”

“Alright just calm down now. Some confusion is to be expected.”

As the doctor finished speaking though the mystery man glanced back and quickly left. I had to show them what I saw so I followed him as quickly as I could with my slight vertigo. He wound his way easily down the busy hallway as I bounced along like a ping pong off the walls. When he finally stopped he was outside a room. I peered inside to see a man looking just like him on the bed but with far worse injuries. An irregular beeping sounding from machines he was attached to, too quiet to hear outside of the room. 

“What the- CODE RED!” The nurse who had apparently followed me yelled into the hall before moving in a flurry.

“We better step back Cameron,” The doctor said as he took my elbow and tried to pull me away. But my new eyes were fixed on the injured man I could see him trying to say something before he looked down at the figure the nurses were trying to save in the bed and faded away.",Nebulalexa99

The way it's phrased makes it seem like the main character is saying the guy in the room knew Dr. Robinson couldn't see them, the narrator. Perhaps something more along the lines of

&gt;He could see me. He also knew that I could see him, but Dr. Robinson couldn't.

It needs a lot more to make it unique. Although it could just be due to the sheer amount of fantasy works I have read and/or watched but I immediately knew the lack of color was a death flag. That the mother lost color too was fairly predictable and would likely be due to suicide if left alone or a car accident on the way home if you wanted to go that way. 

The question is could you prevent it. In many works they just say that fate has a set path and one you can't change no matter what you do. Some resort to using the idea of alternate timelines and that every possiblity is there if you can simply change the current line to another.

Overall, there's plenty of room for more there and it could be a very interesting read. I would say it is worth the effort to continue this but that is just my own personal opinion.",shinigamiscall

The woman's sobs could hardly be heard over savage crowd's screams for murder. The woman in question is a young lady, hair red as the setting sun, skin pale and smooth as porcelain, and her eyes a lovely deep green. Not all is well, however, as she is tied to a wooden telephone pole at the edge of the plaza, her clothes are in tatters, and bruises, cuts, and tears besmirch her face.

""Do not listen to her! Do not be fooled by her insidious wiles! The witch must be punished for her crimes against our humble town and its honorable residents!""

Thusly speaks a tall man in jeans and a button up shirt. Sweat hangs on his brow, his blonde hair is messy and clumping, and deep bags rest under his eyes. Yet he continues to direct the madness of the crowd, leading them in their terrible ceremony. In one hand he holds a crucifix, the other he uses to pile wood at the woman's feet.

""I'm not - I'm not a - witch!"" she says between her sobs.

The crowd ignores her and continues with their orders. They pile wood around her, whatever they find: firewood, branches, broken tables and chairs. There is an insane fervor in their eyes and in their movements. But there is more: joy, anger, relief, exhaustion. And terror, there is also sheer terror in their eyes, just barely contained by the words of the priest.

Finally satisfied, the priest picks up a red gasoline container and begins to pour its contents all over the woman. The crowd cheers as she screams, the gasoline getting into her cuts and scrapes. After drenching the woman and the wood, the priest tosses the container aside and reaches into his pocket for his lighter. He flicks it open and turns it on in one fluid motion.

""Please, you don't have to do this!"" sobs the woman but her pleas fall on deaf ears.

""My brothers and sisters,"" proclaims the priest, ""Here we have the witch! Here we have the one who killed Bentham's cows in the night! Here we have the one who seduced Karla's boy into going into the desert! Here we have the one who led calamity into our town!""

The crowd roars in response, raising their rifles and guns and bats and whatever they could use as a weapon. The woman looks at the priest, pleading with her eyes. The priest then holds up his crucifix to silence.

""My dearest brothers and sisters, though we do this to rid our town of its curses and blights, we must not do this with hatred in our hearts and with our blood boiling! For God is all knowing and all loving! We are not sending a witch to a burning hell but a lost soul to the Lord's loving embrace! So kneel and pray, my brothers and sisters! Kneel and toss out the hatred and vengeance and terror in your hearts! Kneel and ask for forgiveness for what we must do, for Jesus said to love thy enemy!""

Instantly, the entire mob drops to its knees and loudly prays for forgiveness. For a moment, hope flashes in the woman's eyes. The priest looks her in the eyes and there is no anger there, no fear, no madness; only love and a deep sadness.

""Be cleansed in the fires of the Lord,"" he says quietly.

The woman sees the lighter almost jump out of his hand and towards her chest. She has heard that burning is the worst way to die. She might not know what it is like but she unwillingly imagines it. She has suffered burns a few times in her life: stepping an a coal when she was camping with her parents, touching a hot glue gun, grabbing a straitening iron from the wrong end. 

The woman is screaming before gasoline even ignites. It is a terrible scream; it is not one of physical agony but the scream of someone who feels true hate for the first time in their life. It is the scream of someone who has given up on surviving. It is the scream of someone who curses God. It is the scream of someone who awaits terrible agony. An agony that never comes.

The lighter ignites the gasoline and the woman is engulfed in flames. Though she continues to scream, she feels no pain. The orange tongues lick at her bruised and beaten body but she only feels a gentle caress and pleasant warmth. At this realization, her screaming stops as she attempts to process what is happening. She looks out beyond the flames to see the crowd begin to panic and point their guns at her. The priest also levels a handgun at her, his voice drowned out by the roar of the fire. 

And suddenly everyone collapses. The woman can barely see through the fire but she sees a figure walk over the bodies of the crowd and towards her. It waves its hand and the fire suddenly disappears.

""Excuse me, are you by any chance Ms. Jennifer Hardwick?"" the figure asks.

The woman, Jennifer Hardwick, looks at the figure. It is a short young man with long black hair and glasses. Despite the blistering heat, he wears a long brown coat. At his feet sits what must be the fattest cat in the world.

She simply stares at him in disbelief. She was unsure if who stood before her was an angel or a demon. After a few moments, he clears his throat.

""Miss, are you or are you not one Jennifer Hardwick?""

Jennifer slowly nods. She was exhausted, beaten, and bloody, What did it matter who this was if they came to help.

""Most wonderful! My name is Gaius Julius Felix and I would very much appreciate if you would come with me.""

Gaius steps onto the pile of wood as he says this. He snaps his fingers and Jennifer is suddenly freed from her bondage. She is caught by Gaius who carries her a short distance away before sitting her down on the ground.

""Oh dear, aren't you in a sorry state,"" he comments as he reaches into his coat.

Jennifer does not respond, Her mind is far too jumbled from stress, pain, lack of sleep, and from trying to figure out how she is still alive. She simply continues to stare at him blankly.

Gaius retrieves a glass tube filled with a black liquid and topped with a cork stopper. He yanks the cork of with his teeth and spits it away. He then holds the vial in front of Jennifer's face.

""Here drink.""

Jennifer stares at the vial and then at him. Somewhere in her mind she understood he spoke but she could not make sense of what he said. Gaius rolls his eyes and takes a sip of the liquid.

""See, it's not meant to kill you. Now drink.""

This time Gaius brings vial to her lips and she slowly drinks it. It tasted like coffee mixed with donuts. The pain from her beating lessened significantly, as did the fog in her mind.

""Better?"" Gaius asks.

Jennifer nods. The cat jumps onto her stomach and simply stares at her. 

""Excellent. Let's get out of here, shall we?"" Gaius says as he lifts her and continues walking.",Mr_JYP

\*\*\*\*\*

“Lyon please!” The thick iron chains that bound her wrists rattled violently as she thrashed against them. The mousy thin boy stepped backwards as her eyes pleaded to him in desperation. The rest of the crowd stood silent, their expressions were no different than the rain worn statues that bowed their heads before the town’s single church.

The visiting bishop read claim after claim, speaking of black sorcery and unholy witchcraft. He rattled along, his withered voice simply adding background noise to Farah’s tearful begging. They all knew there was something unnatural about the girl. The way she could almost lift and entire wagon with one arm, the copious amounts of food she scarfed down at the dinner table. No one would have expected that her strange quirks would cumulate into accusations of witchcraft and heresy.

Farah’s pleas grew faint and her voice grew tired. She gazed out into the crowd and to the people she knew best. She spent her entire life in Fallsburrow yet those that she felt closest to stood silent in her time of need. Arvey, the smith that she spent years bending metal for now simply stared at the dirt in shame. Lyon, the shy farmer's son who once gave her blushing looks now couldn’t raise his chin to meet her eyes. Inside she begged for someone, for ANYONE to step forward and challenge the bishop.

But no, they all stood paralyzed – strangled by the authority of the bishop and the power of the church. Farah stood alone upon a pile of cinderwood.  Alone and bound to an iron cross that restrained her unnatural strength -strength that she only ever used to do good and aid those now poised to watch her burn.

If only they knew how bishop Maldain tried to force himself on her the night before. If only they knew about her fearful flight into the woods to escape him…

The flint was sparked and the inquisitor grew closer with a freshly lit torch. She couldn’t look. She didn’t want to think about the pain, about her skin being seared by the lapping flames, about the smell of her own flesh cooking within the crackling pyre. She closed her eyes and prayed it would be quick.

The dark veil cast by Farah’s own closed eyes flashed red then white. She knew the pyre was lit. The crackling boomed all around her, bombarding her ears with terrifying snaps and pops. She screamed uncontrollably and thrashed wildly against the iron cross. What she thought would be searing pain was instead lukewarm, like a summer river. She braced for the pain but it never came. There were gasps in the crowd, followed by bewildered whispers. Something was wrong.

She opened her eyes. The flames curled around her body, having already burned her ragged dress into cinders but finding nothing more to feed their hunger. Her skin refused to burn, instead the flames danced playfully upon her arms and legs. She stood upon the pyre, wide-eyed and confused. The chains and cross that bound her were now glowing white hot, like forged steel. She stepped forward and broke free from her molten bindings with little effort.

“Witch! Demon!” The arch bishop jabbed toward her with a leering finger. “Kill her! Kill her now!” He screamed.

It was then that one of the bishop’s guardsmen drew a pike and charged forward. The gleaming spear tip never reached Farah. Instead the man stopped in mid charge and rasped. There was a large glassy object protruding from the man’s chest. It was a misty spear, a spear completely forged from winterfrost.

Bishop Maldain’s inquisitor and the crowd drew back as a figure approached from the edge of the town square. It was heavy framed man, fully clad in the armor of a Nordic raider. Hoarfrost followed the man’s every step, covering every mound of grass he stepped upon in a tessellation of ice crystals.

The torch bearing inquisitor stepped forward and the cold wind snapped at him, snuffing away the flame he held. The red and white robed inquisitor then pulled a silver cross from his vestments and raised it against the looming figure.

“In the name of the Lord stay back! I command you! Begone from here!”

The Nordic figure stopped and the howling winds around him subsided to a whisper. His pale blue lips spoke one word.

“Fools.”

The man’s winter veil suddenly wailed like a banshee’s cry. From the deep mists came an armory of icy weapons. Axes, swords, spears, clubs. The shimmering shapes tore through the inquisitor, sundering him into giblets of meat and crystallized blood.

The remaining guards and townspeople began to flee in panic. The Nordic man extended his hand, commanding his array of killing frost to sail through the air and into the crowd. Limbs arced through the air, sprays of red crystal followed, and screams were cut short. There was chaos, then silence.

Farah stood in shock. The flames of the pyre and the iron that bound her were long doused by the man’s winter aura and her skin prickled as the cold bit at her. In mere seconds this man had rended everything that she knew from the world. She tried to speak.

“Who…”

The man turned to face her. Two glowing azure eyes met her gaze and the man’s long white beard danced in the wind as his weapon’s returned to him, once again fading into the mist they were born from.

“Do not fear child. I am like you, a kindred. They call me Skare, the Second Star of Winter.”

The man's introduction was interrupted by a muffled plea among the rows of dead. “Please…” a voice trembled.

Farah shifted her gaze to see a bloody bishop Maldain crawling through the mound of bodies. She gasped.

The Nordic man approached the bishop, each step crackling the floor with ice.

“Please, Lord please! Spare me!” Maldain begged the heavens.

The Nordic man turned towards Farah. “Child, are you ready to understand what you truly are?”

Farah simply stood there. It was all just too much for her to process.

The Nordic man raised his arms into the sky. The mist surrounding him swirled violently and consumed him, becoming a howling twister. The winds expanded, enveloping Farah and threatening to pull her into the sky. In the eye of the storm she saw a massive form taking shape. Two azure crested wings reached into the sky, their tips reaching for the sun. A large spined tail emerged from the winds, crashing through the center of a small house.

Before her stood a towering dragon, its body lined with rows of white scales that faded into a deep blue. Bishop Maldain screamed, begging the Lord for mercy. The creature’s snout lowered to level with the tiny bishop. Razor sharp teeth the size of a shortsword hovered inches from the man’s blood drained face.

“Little human.” The creature bellowed. “There are only two gods in this world: magic and science.” The dragon raised a mighty claw into the air, blocking the sun from the bishop’s view. “You will soon understand that neither one is kind or merciful.”

The claw came crashing down and the bishop's screams were drowned by churning earth.",lordhelmos
"[WP] She's denied it but to them, the evidence is indisputable--she's a witch. Despite her pleas they prepare to burn her. The fire gets hotter and the people gather, but to their surprise (and hers), she isn't burning.",Biffle27,"((Apologies for the formatting.))

""I'm not a witch!"" She screamed, pure terror and desperation in her voice as she struggled in vain against the ropes that tied her to the post. The people in the crowd surrounding her didn't even bat an eyelash at her pleas, instead simply shouting out for the fire to be lit and for the witch to burn. 

""I'm sorry, this is for your own good,"" I whispered to the girl as I lit a torch on fire, before touching it to the pile of fuel surrounding the wooden stake and the girl on the pole.

It took several moments for the fire to begin spreading, licking up the wood and kissing the poor, begging girl's skin. She screamed and cried, but soon quieted, a mixture of confusion and relief spreading across her face. She was being consumed by the flames, and yet she was not burning. 

The crowd was awestruck, but soon used this little miracle as the metaphorical fuel for their own fire of hatred. They chanted: ""Kill the witch! Kill the witch!"" Even as the fire burned the clothes off of the girl's skin. However, she remained unscathed. 

""I'm not a witch,"" the poor, poor soul pleaded and cried, struggling futilely against the wooden stake she was tied to once more. I watched, motionless, despite the rapid movements of the crowd around me.

It was true, the girl wasn't a witch after all. I was the witch, but no one would ever even consider the possibility of a person in the crowd being the one to cast a spell, let alone the very person who started the fire.

It was the perfect revenge, life would never be the same for the poor girl again, if she even lived through the coming moments. But, it was what she deserved, for all the wrong she had done to me.... her very own sister. ",frnkiero_

"[WP] You have been waiting for this moment for a long time, driving around this city for years. Someone gets in your cab and shouts ""Follow that car!""",Colexion,"[NSFW Language]

""Follow that car!"" He shouts, Jumping into my cab.

As I turn my head to look at the stranger who has just barreled into my car, I feel his fist crack hard against my mouth, whipping my head around and making it spin. ""Don't even think of looking at me, Just fucking drive and follow that God damn car, NOW!""

I did as he asked, Immediately slamming my foot down on the accelerate and following the Black SUV he was pointing to, That was already swiftly making its way onto the main road. I tried not to focus on how sore my jaw was or how hard it was to drive at speed now my head was spinning, Instead I tried to peek in the rear view mirror whilst focusing on the road ahead of me and at the same time attempting to remember as many details about this man as possible. I realised quickly it was a futile attempt, As during my brief haze after the man had punched me, He must have broken the mirror too. 

Clever, I thought, This man really doesn't want me to now who he is. It suddenly dawned on me just how much shit I was in. I tried to think about his voice ""What accent did he have? Was it British? English maybe?"" His voice was gruff I knew that for certain, The kind of man you expect to play the bad guy in all those crappy superhero movies I watched growing up.  

The black SUV suddenly veered off the main road and headed towards the entrance onto the freeway, I followed, narrowing the gap between our vehicles, We were directly behind them now. ""Stay close, And don't lose them"" He grumbled, So close i could feel his breath against the back of my neck. I obeyed of course, And continued to follow them.

As we continued to trail the car I hear a loud click behind me, That too I recognised from those crappy superhero movies I used to watch, It was the sound of a gun being cocked. Panicked I tried to stay close to the SUV infront, Maybe a little too close, we were almost bumper to bumper now. ""Pull back, You're going to make them suspicious"" He ordered, ""O-Okay"" I stammered. I tried to pull back, But the car behind had gotten close too and there wasn't much room to maneuver. 

The SUV suddenly pulled away, Fast, Swerving into the left lane. ""Stay with them, You fuck this up and I'll kill you!"" He shouted from the back seat, I pressed hard on the accelerator once again and managed to stay close behind, Following the SUV as it began to weave in and out of traffic. My heart was hammering in my chest so hard I could feel it throughout my whole body, And that's when it happened, A loud screech and the SUV Infront suddenly slammed on its brakes, I tried to apply mine but wasn't quick enough...and then, Darkness.

I awoke to the sound of ringing in my ears and groaning,  I wasnt sure if I was making that noise or someone else, But I soon had my answer. The man in the back seat began to angrily pull himself free of the seatbelt I was surprised to hear he was wearing. 

With a loud grunt he snapped the belt free, And pulled hard at the door handle of the cab, as I still struggled to to lift my head from my chest. The cab door opened and the man in the back seat, Got out of the car. I managed to lift my head enough to catch a glimpse of him, And he seemed to be in a bad way, Blood was pouring from an open wound on his shoulder and he walked unsteadily on his feet. He had bedraggled dark swept back hair and an unkempt beard, and his clothes were plain and mostly black from what I could make out through the blurry haze of confusion I felt.

I began to lift my head even further although the muscles in my neck screamed for me not too, And watched as the man approached the black SUV. 
The dark haired man opened the rear door of the SUV, Lifted a handgun from the inside of his jacket, And calmly fired four bullets into the back. 
Although i couldn't see what he was shooting at, I guessed from the deep groans of anguish and yelps of grown men that ended abruptly, That he had just killed whoever was inside. 

He took a step back and approached the front of the vehicle, But before he had even reached the handle the door flung open and a burly looking man dived from the front seat and tackled him to the ground. There was shouts of anger and the dull thud of their punches as they both grappled with each other, Both men trying to gain the upper hand in this fight. It was uncertain for a time, But then there was the audible snap of bones breaking and the dark haired man subdued his opponent, Calmly reaching into his jacket and taking out a knife. He held the blade to the burly man's throat and began to ask him questions, I couldn't make out what was being said but quickly realised it wasn't what the dark hair man wanted to here, as he pressed the knife down swiftly into the throat of the burly man. The mans screams were quickly drowned out by the sounds of gurgling blood that spewed forth from around the knife still embedded in his neck and onto the dark haired man's hands and forearms. 

The dark haired man rose as quickly as he was able and moved to the rear door of the vehicle once again, He pulled the body of a man from the back seat and discarded him onto the pavement, Then climbed into the back of the car and after a few moments began to scream. The sound of his screams woke me from the fear that had been paralysing me and promoted me to move as quickly as I could, I fumbled with the buckle of my seatbelt and howled in pain as I tried to move my legs from under the steering wheel, I was fairly certain one if not both of my legs had been broken. Adrenaline is what kept me moving, Pushed me forward and compelled me to pull my legs free from where they were stuck. I tugged on the door handle and hit the door hard with my shoulder, The door popped open with a jolt and I hit the ground painfully. 

As I dragged myself along the floor at the side of the cab, I knew that I wasn't going to get very far. 
Propping myself up with my back against the tyre, I heard the sound of glass crunching under heavy boots, And suddenly...He was there, towering over me. 
The dark haired man knelt down In front of me and for the first time I got a look at his face. 

His eyes were a dark brown, there were cuts and bruises covering his face and although I had never seen a broken man before, I knew that now, I had. ""I've been following these men for just over a year, I have spent every waking hour of every fucking day tracking them down, And now it's all over"" He said slowly, Blood still oozing from the wound on his shoulder. He grabbed my face with his hand and forced me to look into his eyes, As he stared back into mine ""That man, That you watched me kill, You know what I told him before he died?"". 

I tried to shake me head, too scared to speak but gripped firmly in his hand my head barely moved, He understood the notion. ""I told him exactly the same thing I did the first time I spoke to him over a year ago. Every man who dares harm my daughter, Will die"". ""Then I asked him a question"" He said ""Can you guess what I asked him?"" ""N-n-no"" I whimpered, ""I asked him, Where is she?"" His breathing suddenly got heavier, His eyes took on a maddening glare and he was so close to me now I could feel his breath on my face, Then he whispered ""Do you know what he told me?"" I stared into his eyes, Moisture gathering in my own through fear, and he said Very calmly ""In the trunk"". 

I felt it before I saw it, the sharp searing pain of a blade slowly being pushed between my ribs and deeper into my chest. I heard a long drawn out whimper and was surprised to find it was my own, Tears rolled gently down my face and I felt myself fighting for breath. ""I told him I would kill every man who dares harm my daughter, And now there's only one left"". With that he raised the gun to his own head, And pulled the trigger. 

Warm blood covered my face, and I suddenly realised how cold I was. My whole body seemed so heavy, And I felt like all I wanted to do was sleep now. I drew a few wheezing breaths and saw my vision getting blacker around the edges, And as my whole world became dark it was only then, That I realised, I was about to die.

I was bored at work and just thought I'd flesh out a little idea that I had, I'm obviously not any sort of grammar nazi and just did this for fun. I wrote this entirely on my phone and didn't have the luxury of time to format correctly et cetera so deal with it. Im also used to writing scripts not stories, So it may read like that ��

So Enjoy or Despise as you will, I have a selective memory when it comes to comments anyway.

"[WP]Throughout history, humans have grossly misunderstood the purpose of ads . The real purpose, like aglet, is sinister.",Layers3d,"""Charles, you've done well at this firm,"" Mr. Aglet said.  ""Though the official notification won't arrive until Monday, I don't think it will come as a surprise to you that you're getting the promotion.""

""Thank you, sir,"" Charles said.  It wasn't a surprise, not really, and yet he knew that anything could go wrong at any point.

""Befitting your new role, however,"" Mr. Aglet continued, ""it is time to bring you in on the true nature of this advertising firm.""

""True... nature?""  Charles asked.

""Yes.  For, you see, advertisements serve a purpose far more sinister, far more evil than most people realize.""

""I... see.""  Charles said.  He wasn't sure he wanted to hear this but, promotion or not, he needed this job.  He certainly couldn't afford to live anywhere near the city without it.

""You see,"" Aglet said, ""you may have seen the focus testing rooms.  The mockups, the A/B tests where we run the gamut of all things to precisely tune our advertisements to this one horrible purpose.  Color, word choice, voices, diversity or the lack thereof, every moment of time is precisely calibrated for one effect...""  He trailed off, expectantly.

Charles took a moment to respond.  ""And that is?""

""To convince people, to alter their very way of thinking, such that they *buy the product*.""  Aglet said, steepling his fingers.

Charles waited.

Mr. Aglet continued to stand ominously, fingers steepled, but he clearly hadn't balanced right to begin with and the position was starting to strain.

""Is... is that it?""  Charles asked.

Mr. Aglet laughed, not quite a villain laugh but close.  ""Ah, that sort of question is exactly why we promoted you!  To hear the most vile of treacheries and take it in such stride!  You'll go far at this firm, Charles.""

""No,"" Charles spoke up before he could think better of it.  ""I mean... I already knew that.""

""Oh?""  Mr. Aglet chuckled.  ""There's no need to attempt to impress us, Charles, you already have the position.""

""No,"" Charles spoke up again, despite mentally berating himself for speaking up the first time.  ""I mean... everyone knows that.""

""What?""  Aglet's faux-sinister demeanor took a definite hit at this.

""Yeah,"" Charles said.  ""Everyone knows that ads are to sell things.  That's like... their whole thing.""

""Really?  *Everyone?*""  Mr. Aglet said.

Charles shrugged.  ""Sometimes kids don't quite understand product placement in cartoons but that's about it.  Otherwise, yeah, everyone.""

""How?""  Mr. Aglet said.  ""How did our secret get out?  Who at this firm would dare leak the terrible truth the masses?""

""I'm pretty sure everyone knew before this firm was founded,"" Charles said.  ""It's common knowledge?""

Mr. Aglet seemed almost bewildered.  ""Common... knowledge.  Wait, wait, wait.  You're telling me that everyone watching TV, everyone reading magazines or browsing the web, they all know this terrible truth... and they let us get *away* with it?""

Charles shrugged.  ""Gotta pay the bills somehow.""

""Gotta... pay bills..."" Mr. Aglet seemed to think the concept was entirely new which, given family's notoriously rich reputation, may actually have been the case.  ""This is... phenomenal!""

Charles relaxed.  He'd been certain that he'd torpedoed his career but apparently common knowledge wasn't so common the further up the ladder one went.

""Just imagine,"" Aglet continued, ""the things we could get away with!  If they let us manipulate their very thoughts, there's nothing we couldn't do!  I mean, imagine - just spitballing here - but imagine something like selling people a product.  But it's not the whole thing!  Instead you sell them additional bits over time.  Call it 'pico-transactions' or something.""

""Erm,"" Charles said, internally debating whether or not he should speak up.  Giving in to foolishness, he continued, ""the video game industry does that... like all the time.""

""Really?""  Aglet said.  ""And *they* get away with it?""

""Oh yeah,"" Charles said.  ""Like some of them, they don't even sell the bits, they sell a crate or something, and that crate *might* have the bits that people want, or it might have something else.""

""That's basically gambling,"" Aglet said.

""Oh, no no no, it's not gambling,"" Charles said.  ""Because people never get any money *back*, you see.""

""So it's strictly worse than gambling,"" Mr. Aglet said.  ""And you say they get away with it?""

Charles nodded.  ""Happens every day.""

""Diabolical,"" Mr. Aglet said, wistfully.  ""Ah, I must admit, though, I'm somewhat... disappointed at how far behind the curve we are.  How can we compete with such masterful evil?""

""Hey, hey, hey,"" Charles said soothingly.  ""Don't despair.  I mean, you promoted me for a reason, right?  I'm sure we'll go on to do *much* more horrible things!""

""You really mean it?""  Mr. Aglet said.

""I do,"" Charles said.  ""Picture this, just for starters:  automatically playing, top-volume, virtual reality ads.""

""I meant what I said earlier, Charles,"" Mr. Aglet said, ""you're going far in this company.""",reostra

"[WP] You've somehow adopted a Hell-Hound. Or rather, it has adopted you.",McStaken,"*Pain*. Intense, searing pain flowing throughout my body like flames from the deepest pits of hell. Which is fitting, considering the apparent source of the agony I was currently experiencing.

Latched onto my left forearm, with its teeth sunken what felt like all the way through my limb, was a demonic mass of dense, black *nothing* in the vague form of a giant hound\*.\* It was like a void containing the total absence of anything had decided to grow gleaming white teeth and claws to chew my arm off. Abruptly, the pain subsided enough for me to take in the mangled remains of the grizzled man who had held me at knifepoint demanding for my wallet just moments ago, now sprawled on the ground in front of me illuminated by the ray of the early night light. His throat had been torn out by the same demonic beast that had appeared out of nowhere and chomped down on my arm. I recognised the man as one of the strangers that were loitering on the curb by the ATM when i was withdrawing $300 in cash to buy my little brother his first ever gaming console for his 15th birthday. Mom always did say that i spoiled him too much. Before she died, that is.

The reprieve lasted for only a single fleeting breath, and as abruptly as it had left, the pain rushed back, flaring from the incisions made by the teeth of the unholy beast attached to my forearm. This time, it condensed around my left of my chest, where i could feel my heart beating like war drums, and the wound my forearm. *Strange*, I somehow thought amidst my soundless screams.

And then, after what felt like an eternity with the blood of a volcano concentrated around my chest and forearm, the pain flowed down from my heart to my arm and drained away into the feral mass of darkness. As soon as the last of the pain faded into the beast, the monstrous shape shifted and flowed into the savage wound. I could feel the essence of the *thing* fill my body and suddenly I felt full to bursting with a violent, chaotic energy.

I felt like I could do *anything.*

A figure moving to blocking the entrance to the narrow alley I was in broke my reverie. A large, hulking man, whom I also recognised from the ATM.

""Bob? You done with the dude?"", the thug called cautiously.

""No, Bob is dead"", I growled back, dangerous and deliberate.

Realisation spread across the man's hard features as it dawned on him that the torn body lying in a pool of dark liquid was in fact, Bob.

Slowly, he lumbered deeper into the alley, squinting to make me out in the dim light of the alley. ""Well, well, I guess he finally got what was coming for him, always playing with his prey."" Grinning cruelly, he beat his fist into his palm as he continued closing the gap between us. ""I won't make the same mistake, though. Since you've happened to kill my partner, I'm gonna pummel your face into the ground.""

At this, fiery hot rage flared in me and my vision began to turn red. My entire body trembled with my anger and a low, manic growl began to build in my throat. *Pummel* me *into the ground? I'LL RIP HIS BODY TO SHREDS.*

And then I launched myself at him with supernatural speed, clearing the remaining space between us in a heartbeat. Utter surprise painted the thug's face as my leap brought me to the air less than a metre in front of him, teeth bared in a feral snarl, my body extended like a wolf launched at its prey. With a monstrous growl, I unleashed the strange energy within me and in an explosive moment, the demonic beast from earlier erupted out of the wound in my forearm.

With a gory crunch, the beast enveloped the thug's head in its jaws, surprise still frozen on his face. A swift jerking motion to the side and the space where the man's head was erupted into a fountain of blood. The thug's lifeless body slumped to the ground with a heavy, wet thud and I landed nimbly on my hands and feet, covered in the man's lifeblood.

Straightening, the rage that had so completely enveloped me a moment before flooded from me and I staggered onto the ground from sudden fatigue.

It was then that I noticed that the wound left by the demon on my left forearm was gone, and in its place was a jet black tattoo of a hollow disk with fangs jutting out on the outside, the diameter the whole width of my arm.

A rough tongue licked across the strange tattoo, causing it to glow a deep purple,and my head snapped up in shock at the hellhound gazing at me with what felt like adoration, tongue hanging and black tail wagging.

[WP] Our first mistake was killing the planet. Our last mistake was thinking she would stay in the grave.,Omo_Kiem,"This was no ordinary planet. We had thought as much when we first encountered it. Reminiscent of celestial bodies we had transformed ourselves,  it appeared to us to be an ideal candidate for the construction of a new Matrioshka brain.

&amp;#x200B;

The dreams of technological fiction made true, Matrioshka brains, had become common place once humanity had mastered interstellar travel and low energy robotics on a massive scale. That's how we settled planets outside of the Solar System gradually. We sent fleets of our self replicating construction satellites to travel through space. They drained the minerals out of all that provided them an opportunity. Asteroid belts. Rocky planets. Barren moons. 

&amp;#x200B;

We built solar farms to harness the energy of stars, right there, smack dab in the middle of space. Then came our next audacious innovation. Computers the size of entire planets;  Matrioshka brains. We built them as points of control for the ever growing fleet of planetary transformation tools that we now deployed at will.

&amp;#x200B;

And now here we are. After centuries of settling planets to accommodate the growth of our species, we got proactive. Let's go out and raze planets in case we might need them in the future, all of us thought. So go out and raze we did, until we stumbled into a neighborhood of our galaxy that we didn't understand. We lost a massive transformation fleet in this neighborhood. All our technical might was snuffed out like an irrelevant flame. In uncovering the cause of our material damage, we discovered the great adversary humanity would now have to contend with for survival. The Golems had made their existence known.

&amp;#x200B;

Our pride led us to believe that the Matrioshka brains and their accompanying fleets were the greatest things ever constructed in the universe. We were wrong. The universe had us beat in terms of scale and scope. Just like it had birthed humanity into the abyss, it had also conceived of creatures far more fantastic in the form of the Golems. While they are certainly more than just conscious planets, the acknowledgement of their sentience is perhaps a good starting point. They lie waiting, dormant in the darkness of space. Whatever the mechanism that enables its thoughts, it is slow to establish a consensus across the entire creature due its sheer size. Yet, some intelligence is localized, especially when it comes to defense. It is how we think the creature was able to deny our attempts to convert it to a tool of our design.

&amp;#x200B;

We did not understand initially that the planet we were attempting to raze was a Golem. We had no idea one could exist. By the time the footage from the fleet's confrontation with the Golem was completely understood, we assumed that the creature had succumbed and that we had not only lost our immensely valuable settlement fleet but also the chance to study what had been the largest life-form anywhere in the universe.

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday it was made clear to me that the opportunity to study the Golem was not lost. Not because it was dead anyway. No, as I sit here thinking my thoughts, the Golems are moving towards us. That's right. There's more than one. They know humanity exists and they think we are a threat. ",PrimeCheesecakeEater

[WP] Our first mistake was killing the planet. Our last mistake was thinking she would stay in the grave.,Omo_Kiem,"What we were warned about came to pass in 2143, the earth finally lost its fight against pollution and was no longer capable of sustaining life, billions died.   But not all, a portion of the population escaped into giant vaults with the heat of the planets core providing power and the genetically engineered crops producing food  the human race was able to survive.

However evolution never stops, while most large lifeforms died some single celled organisms survived and adapted, without any predators to curb their spread they quickly covered the globe.

Dozens of generations went by since the humans fled the surface before our planet showed us its wrath, small Grey mold like substances started to appear on walls, since they were harmless but inedible they were quickly removed but as time passed more and more mold started to appear.

It came to the point where humans could no longer keep up with the spread of the mold, they were forced to open the vault when the food supply got contaminated.

Search parties were send out only to return with the news that the inedible mold was everywhere. All their technology and science could not help the simple fact that there was no more food on the planet for them. ",jumpup
[WP] Our first mistake was killing the planet. Our last mistake was thinking she would stay in the grave.,Omo_Kiem,"Mother Nature has one hell of a way of controlling her population.

First, Antonine Plague spread. No one knows what it was. It simply rose, spread, killed people, and left. Was this humankind evolving and will we ever have the answer to this mysterious pandemic?

Then it was the Black Death. The illness would pass all too easily from one human to the next. From one filthy human to the next filthy human, that is. Mankind did not keep clean. Our dirt brought forth a slew of deaths, an execution for grime. We learned, however. The main way to ward away the Great Plague was to clean frequently. Evolution? Not quite. Just a simple adjustment in everyone's lives.

The Spanish flu was next. 1 million people died in the first 25 weeks. This was a new level of a pandemic. This infected, not the dirty or poor or old or weak, but young and healthy men and women. Who would be there to take care of tomorrow? There was no cure, no predictor, no way to stop it. Nothing but quarantine and prayer could save the human race. Perhaps this was evolution at work. Humans managed to beat this down and leave it buried, buried with the victims of influenza. 

Or so we thought.

Years passed, and the people rotted. Or so we thought.

Somehow, they emerged. They came back. They clawed their way from mass graves and began wandering the globe, spreading wave after wave after wave of illness.

The Undead Pandemic. No one would survive this one. Evolution, indeed.",kenerd24601

"[WP] You are a Jedi Master, being hunted by a Sith Lord and their apprentice, a Bounty Hunter, and an Imperial Agent, chased to a final battle on a world near the edge of the known Galaxy.",Polskers,"*Not even the dry, rocky desert world of Amasis could keep them at bay...*

Corran Vigil stood at the edge of the cliff, where he'd been perched for quite a while now, ever since he had watched the Sith Interceptor descend through the clouds, followed by a D5 Mantis and an X70-B Phantom. He knew they'd come for him. He knew they were looking, and this would be his final standing point. After all, should his goal come to fail, he would be better off dying on his feet than living on his knees.

Kira, sweet Kira, had wanted to come with him - she was as bold and brash as he was, and he had a hard time telling her no, but he wanted her to be safe. Doc offered his pistols, Scourge his lightsaber, Rusk his repeater gun in assistance. They all pleaded with him, and he refused thoroughly, opting only to take his loyal droid, T7-01 with him. He didn't want to put them through any pain should he fall to the blades and blasters of his opponents.

Drawing on the Force, he meditated for a time, his sandy blonde hair blowing in the wind and his beard bristling as he felt those hunting him approaching. Footsteps could be heard coming closer, and his concentration was broken. With a sigh, he stood and stretched his neck. A few moments of silence followed, before the clean and crisp accent of a Chiss broke through, a dull sound of weapons being armed.

""We gave you a chance, Jedi,"" he called out, and taking aim with his blaster, his red eyes piercing, ""Turn and face us! There's nowhere left to hide!""

""Did we decide how we'd split the effects once we polished him off?"" the rough voice of a Mandalorian chimed in next, ""I want his lightsabers. Those things have gone through hell and back. Make one mean token out of 'em.""

Heavy footsteps followed and a lightsaber blade was ignited, followed by softer steps and a double-blade being lit. As Corran turned, he could see them all at a distance of less than twenty meters from him. The Mandalorian in his armor, the Chiss in his pristine white uniform, and the two Sith - one, a Togruta of red and white coloring and next to her, a Kaleesh.

""Didn't think you'd follow me out here,"" Corran grunted and stepped forward, shrugging his Jedi robes off, a simple white tunic and black pants beneath, a pistol and two lightsabers on his belt, ""You're all awfully far from Dromund Kaas or Nar Shaddaa.""

""It is not your concern how far we are from Dromund Kaas, Jedi,"" the Kaleesh declared and stepped closer, swinging his blade in an agile manner as the Togruta extended hers and stepped to his side.

""Now, Xalek, don't be so harsh. Master Vigil has run a long way and there's no further to go. With that said, any last words you'd like us to give... Kira, was it?"" she grinned a toothy smile, her sharp teeth fitting perfectly together.

Something in the way she spoke ground at Corran's very core, the insensitivity with which she asked, the cold and steely gaze. He felt his peace with the Force growing thin alongside his patience, and stretched his fingers, one hand poised to grab the pistol and the other a lightsaber.

""Reconsider that question. You have one chance,"" his voice sounded almost alien to him. As he stepped forward threateningly, the Chiss and Mandalorian both raised their pistols, the Chiss clucking his tongue.

""Not a step further, Jedi. You can come peacefully and meet your maker, or you can die here on this rock,"" the Togruta spoke.

""Not likely,"" Corran grunted and quickly raised his pistol, an ion bolt firing and striking the Mandalorian, his armor shorting out and causing him to growl while he attempted to fire back. The bolts were met with a deflection from a blue blade. Tension returned to the air.

Clever as the Chiss was, he may not be clever enough to outwit a Jedi, and backed away firing as the two Sith approached, their blades swinging. Corran dropped his pistol to his belt and ignited his other lightsaber - a bold yellow one - and moved forward to meet them, a veritable duel engaged as the Kaleesh, the Togruta, and the human whirled in a dust cloud that was thick enough to blind even a smuggler with the best vision macrobinoculars Galactic credits could afford. The Mandalorian was able to gain a vantage point, as his armor's power restored and he ignited his jetpack, flying above the swirl of blades and firing off a triple barrage of rockets.

The three Force users scattered, rejoining their battle. Corran Vigil was the Jedi Battlemaster for a good reason, and even Ashanaa Tashro, Darth Nox herself, had difficulties keeping up. Her apprentice Xalek, agile as a beast, used his brute force to attempt to overwhelm Master Vigil. This apprentice was nothing compared to that of a Jedi Master. Between them, Vigil extended his hand and used Force push on the ground, sending both Sith flying backwards and onto the ground. In her distraction, Nox had left her apprentice undefended.

Xalek struggled mightily, as she leapt to her feet and tried to rush to his assistance. Her Chiss and Mandalorian accomplices approached her from behind and fired off rounds to try and help. She raised her hand and swung her blade. Her gaze narrowed and she tightly pursed her lips as she saw the Jedi's two blades swing vigorously towards the single red one of her apprentice. It lasted merely a few moments, as Xalek's blade was smashed and slashed out of his hand, and a yellow blade stabbed and emerged through his torso, a cry of pain and anger as he dropped to the ground, slumping over. Adding insult to injury, the Jedi kicked his body off of the steep cliff to the oceans below. She could feel his anger - perhaps to her favor.

The Mandalorian laughed and stepped back a few steps.

""I didn't sign up for this, lady. You couldn't pay me enough to die in a way like that,"" he spoke and shook his head.

""Where are you going? Are you a coward?"" she spat at him.

""I have survival instincts,"" the Mandalorian replied and stepped back, putting his pistols in his holster, the Chiss staring incredulously.

Darth Nox would wait no longer. Swinging her double blade, she stepped forward and let out a Togruta war shriek, baring her teeth fully to her Jedi opponent who slowly stepped, pace by pace, swinging his blades.

The two met in a flurry of saber action. In the midst of it, Nox managed to twist her blade and separate the hilt into two sabers, one for one meeting his swings with parries of her own. It was a beautiful, furious dance, light meets dark in all of its brutality. Both dodging shots from the Chiss who kept trying to get the perfect vantage point on the Jedi, now that the Mandalorian had decided he had had enough.

""I've been waiting a long time for this,"" the Jedi grunted through his teeth and pushed hard at his Sith opponent.

Staring him square in the eyes, teeth bared fully, she growled back, ""And I've been waiting a long time for you to die!""

It was the perfect ending. Her rage was showing her blind spot and she was vulnerable. Twisting around, Corran ducked under a swing and moved to her opposite side, beckoning her to him. Ducking again from her swings, a trifecta of blaster shots were heard and suddenly all went quiet. Nox slowly looked down to her chest, three holes shot into her, blood dripping, then pouring. She exhaled, a laugh of pity as she looked up at her Jedi opponent who switched off his lightsabers. As she switched hers off, she began to drop. Corran caught her.

""This is how I die. In the arms of a Jedi,"" she chuckled and spat, blood now beginning to pool in her mouth as she coughed.

""You die a noble death in combat. There is no shame in that,"" he whispered to her, glancing up at the Chiss, who stood stoically.

""Your moral victory brings you... no..."" she trailed off, Corran closing her eyes and then slowly laying her down. As he did, he stood, igniting one lightsaber, his blue one, staring at his Chiss opponent who still clutched his pistol, aimed straight at him.

""Leave this place! Return to your master, and tell him that Corran Vigil lives another day. And so do you, if you choose to heed my words!"" he exclaimed boldly, his blue eyes meeting the red of his opponent.

Palpable tension filled the air. Pistol aimed, saber brandished. Was there really to be only one survivor today?

""I am a pragmatist, Master Jedi,"" the Chiss bowed his head and holstered his pistol, slowly stepping away, ""I bid you good day.""

All the while continuing to face the Jedi, he slowly retreated, a steady pace. Corran Vigil did live to survive another day. He didn't earn the title of Jedi Battlemaster by diplomacy, that's for sure.",Polskers

A vast velvet curtain was pulled back, reveling a large hunk of shiny machinery. The small crowd of onlookers oow'd and aww'd followed by a polite but vigorous applauds.

Might as well cut to the meat of the matter.

&amp;#x200B;

""Hey! How about a presentation, I myself would like to see the titanic in person"". Well, for the second time.

The crowd, while amused with my bluntness, couldn't help but agree with the sentiment.

&amp;#x200B;

""Well, Actually"" said the head scientist while adjusting his glasses. (And what's the deal with that, you can afford cybernetic cognitive implants, but not lazer eye surgery?)

&amp;#x200B;

""This project works on a specialized wormhole link, It can only go as far back in time as when we activated it."" He explained while walking over to the device.

&amp;#x200B;

""And when was that?""

&amp;#x200B;

""Right now."" He said as the machine began to hum.

&amp;#x200B;

A few tense seconds of loud noise elapsed before a hatch opened up, and out stepped a scraggly dressed man. From the reaction of the faculty, it would seem he is not who they intended to emerge.

&amp;#x200B;

The man urgently searched the crowd and settled upon me, whereupon he rushed towards me as fast as his thin body would carry him, at reaching arms length, he weakly grabbed me by the shoulders, stared me in the eye with dead seriousness and said ""I'm you, from the future.""

&amp;#x200B;

My personal bodyguards that had been standing idle at the edges of the room sprung into action in removing the malnourished man. Before he was effortlessly dragged away he shouted ""Pepper-corn"", A Code I devised to convince myself of my own authenticity if I ever got a case of amnesia (When you've been alive as long as I have you come up with some 'out there' contingency plans).

&amp;#x200B;

Seems legit, I motioned for my bodyguards to let him go. He look quite relieved as they did so.

&amp;#x200B;

""Well, what do you have to say?""

&amp;#x200B;

He took a few seconds to compose himself, ""OK, so aliens..."", but he was interrupted when the door to the room was kicked open and seven identical men entered, the one at the head shouted ""Peppercorn, I'm you from the past""

&amp;#x200B;

My older self was portraying the same confusion I had but more physically.

&amp;#x200B;

My younger selves were taking over the computer stations of the equally confused scientists, with one of them coming over to us ""Easy now gramps, them xenos can't get'cha here no more"" He said in a soothing tone.

&amp;#x200B;

""But they... We've got the stop the...""

&amp;#x200B;

""It's all right, we stopped them."" he again said calmly, ""But we need the crystal""

&amp;#x200B;

The future man looked slightly shocked at this but then calmed and pulled out his eye, (which was thankfully fake) and removed its contents, a purple diamond, and handed it over.

&amp;#x200B;

""Umm"", I interrupted ""What's going on?""

&amp;#x200B;

""Ah, yes of course, you need some catching up."" The youthful me was snapped out of his focus, ""Oh, hmm, where to start.""

&amp;#x200B;

""At the beginning"" I offered.

&amp;#x200B;

""Well in the beginning, there was the cosmic space turtle, but there was no space, and this was before time so the following events take place simultaneously, but not really.""

&amp;#x200B;

""Okay!"" I stopped him right there, ""What are you doing right now?""

&amp;#x200B;

""We're upgrading this mark one time machine to a mark six, then we'll commandeer a timeline to be able to take on an eldritch abomination.""

&amp;#x200B;

""You talking about **Aiugrill'vhass?**"" Yelled one of the me's at the computer terminals, ""Cause we already took care of him""

&amp;#x200B;

""No that was the last loop"" the nearer me answered back.

&amp;#x200B;

""Yeah, no he's outside time, so he's doneso doneso""

&amp;#x200B;

""Oh. Then what are we doing now?"" I asked (Not 'me' ""I"", the other 'me' ""I"")

&amp;#x200B;

""Think we're trin' to make a MK MMCMLXIV Time machine, then we'll ask the omni-mind if its got any idea what's goin' on.""

&amp;#x200B;

Then in a flash of light there appeared in the center of the room was a floating me in a meditative posture. He spoke in my mind ""Fear not, the mind has decided"", my mind filled with thoughts and images, I knew how to build an advanced time machine and how it worked, I could see near all infinity.

&amp;#x200B;

In all my millennia on this planet, all of it does not compare to this microsecond.

&amp;#x200B;

I was knocked out of this wonderful moment by a loud noise, ""Damm it!"" the me working on the time machine through down a wrench in a huff, ""Every time I'm about to do something, I show up having already done it!""

&amp;#x200B;

I don't think time travel's for me.

A low moan of pain followed a pop, as a neck, so stiff it wouldn’t need a collar if broken, turned from side to side.   “What time is it Sam?”  

Irritated brown eyes left the meticulously stacked, evenly spaced double rows of paperwork completely covering the adjacent desk.  “Fifteen minutes after the last time you asked.  What is wrong with you today.”

“Just, restless, I guess.”  Breathing in a stale mixture of dust, sweat, tobacco and an odd sweet unidentifiable scent, she rolled the cheap pen between calloused fingers.  Surveying the room that comprised her world 5 days of the week, thirteen bent heads, thirteen sloped shoulders rolled before her like waves in an ocean.  

A small Apollo 11 paperweight of Eagle on the moon glowed in the flat florescent lighting atop the scratched mahogany desk.  A gift from pops of that sultry July 16 day when mankind leapt into space.  Sliding slender fingers over the smooth, glossy surface, she sighed, “Sam, I’m going to the moon.”

Rolling tired shoulders, chin in fist, he surveyed the dark circles, and turned down mouth of his sister’s normally upbeat face.  Accounting, was boring, not that he was sorry for helping her get a job here, she was just., so much more.  Quirked lips relented, “Ok, you’re going to the moon, what are you going to take?”  A children’s game, yes, but so many good, fun trips before mom and pop’s death were hidden in a trip to the moon.

You're the only one who realizes that he has to die to forgive humanity of it's sins",Spookula,"Watching TV one night, as Jesus is plastered across my screen yet again, I come to the startling realization that for us to survive he must die. Believe me, when I thought that I was as shocked as you are, but it felt so right. He did it for us before, why would this be any different? We had become a godless lawless place. He came back to help rid us of our sins, for us to be cleansed. But who would believe me?

Turns out no one would. First I tried contacting my local church, they weren't having any of it. I tried a few others with similar results. They couldn't understand why I would want the son of God dead. I tried explaining I didn't, but it had to be done. He had to die for our sins or this was the end. 

Now I know I'm beginning to sound like one of those nut jobs you see on the street corner, but I'm not. I'm not even religious. You can call it whatever you like but it's just this feeling of overwhelming correctness. So with that feeling I went tried to contact the pope. Seems like the logical step right? Well speaking to that man is quite hard. I was jailed for 5 days. So I thought I'd go straight to the source. I tried to seek council with the man himself. Jesus. The one and only. 

Finally someone listened to me. He knew. He had been trying to tell people since he returned. Trying to make them listen, but they wouldn't. When I showed up he was relieved. But he said that that meant I had to be the one to take his life. That I would be vilified. I would probably end up dead myself. But this was a risk I had to take. I had to. So we made a plan. We went to a hill, built another cross, and I crucified him upon it. I sat at his feet as he died and I knew I was right. When we were found Jesus had passed, and I was arrested. Just as he stated I was vilified. I was put on trial as the Antichrist. So here I sit in jail, awaiting my death sentence. But in my heart I know I was right. ",hhrlisa

*Internal Memo*


**CLASSIFIED**


*Author: Dr Marie Whitworth*


Anomalies detected around each asteroid include gravitational lensing of an unpredictable pattern. Observations do not fit with our standard model of physics. Further investigation is required. 


Satellites passing behind the asteroids re-emerge much later than expected, either they are being captured, inspected and released at original velocity or some other phenomena is at play. Recommend investigation by dedicating significant telescope resources to satellite tracking. 


Continued electronic failure is most likely the result of a regular, fluctuating EMP pulse directed to the Earth's core. RAF communication with ISS suggests Antarctica as possible location for landfall. Command has ordered Royal Navy and RAF task force to investigate. Strongly recommend a specialist science team accompanies. 


----------


**Antarctica**


**1940**


Terry Whitworth's Westland Whirlwind glided into land on the smooth pack ice, throwing up clouds of freshly fallen snow as it taxied towards the looming tents, camouflaged white, that had been invisible from the air. Nobody appeared to greet him. There was no sign of whoever had released the warning flare.


Turning in his seat, he watched Hartson smoothly land his Whirlwind, the gusting winds had ceased as suddenly as they had appeared. As Hartson taxied to join him and cut his engine, the sound of barking dogs drifted momentarily on the breeze, although in the stark white of Antarctica it was difficult to tell which direction any sound came from. Noise seemed to come from all directions at once, or perhaps none.


Climbing down from their cockpits they gingerly made their way to the tents over the slippery, unfamiliar surface. They lay deserted, tools and crates scattered around the place. Boxes upturned, snow shoes and equipment lay on the ground as if dropped in a hurry. A meal, half-eaten, was frozen to a plate near the entrance. 


""What do you think took him down?"" Hartson's teeth chattered as he spoke. 


""Something high calibre. There was no shrapnel, nothing. He was looking at something near the foot of the slope that leads up to that ridge. Most importantly we need to find out what's happened down here. Did you get a look at the people on the ridge?"" Terry was the most junior member of the flight, but his reputation had preceded him and he spoke to Hartson, five years his senior, with a note of authority in his voice. 


""I saw them before Atkins did. They were so stark black against the white. It was almost creepy, the way they didn't move, so still, even in that bloody gale. Gave me the shivers.""


""We have to assume they're responsible for whatever's happened here. You get the planes under that canvas in case anyone comes snooping around. I'm going to borrow some of these snow shoes and take a walk up that slope. We need to know what took out Atkins, and we need to know who our friends were on that ridge.""


Hartson nodded, happy to let Terry take the lead. ""I'll see if I can get one of these stoves going in the meantime.""


""You needn't bother, gentlemen."" An unfamiliar voice spoke from behind. Hartson spun around, reaching for his pistol. Terry didn't move. The strong accent told him everything he needed to know. 


""This is not a place that you wish to stay. The ghosts will be back soon."" The German soldier at the door sounded unsure of himself. 


""Ghosts?"" Terry sneered at the Nazi with contempt. ""You killed them, did you? Our men here? Our flight leader?"" 


""Your flight leader? Yes. It was unfortunate that my colleagues were presented with such an easy shot. But your ground crew? No.” He bowed his head slightly. “But I did bury them.""


""But, the flare..."" Hartson lowered his pistol as he spoke. 


""I fired this flare. It is a warning flare, no?"" 


Terry scoffed. ""You mean to tell me you were warning us about your *own* presence? How very noble you Germans are!"" 


""No,"" said the German, pausing. A note of fear creeping into his voice. He glanced outside with a look of apprehension. ""You were flying towards the ghosts.""

*International Space Station*


*Duty Log ##/##/## ##:##*


*Commander Feustel*


We are not completely devoid of problems with our electronics up here either. Computer systems have crashed on multiple occasions, often during near-passes to the asteroids. On-board clocks are no longer synchronised, this has caused additional navigational problems and software issues. We have enough fuel left for two more translational burns before we will be forced to abandon the station. 


On a positive note we have established radio communication with over twenty locations on Earth. While most are inactive by the time we make our return pass, it seems more parties are learning to counteract the EMP pulses. At least for short periods of time. 


In the absence of satellite communication and long-range ground-based radio, we can act as a relay for messages between ground stations to facilitate communication. So far, we have been able to notify the British Royal Air Force of the asteroid landfall at Antarctica, but so far have received no further communication from Scott Base. 


We have ejected all non-essential modules, angled solar panels and raised altitude to maximum low earth orbit. We will prolong our orbit for as long as possible in the hope that we can help those on the ground to mount a response. 


Soyuz has been checked and is fully operational, ready for an unguided return to Earth. On a more personal note, I am not looking forward to that at all.

**McMurdo Station**


**Antarctica**


**2018**


""Good thing Petty packed us off with all this booze,"" Rolandsson slurred, passing the bottle to Bill. 


Bill took a long swig of whiskey, his throat burning. ""You know, alcohol doesn't actually warm you up..."" 


""Yeah yeah. We're both scientists, man,"" he interrupted. ""This is a search operation not a bloody pub quiz.""


Bill took another swig. The Icelander's drunken sense of humour was driving him to alcoholism himself. 


They’d found no sign of Rolandsson's team, but McMurdo was a sprawling maze of huts, buildings and storage sheds and there was still half of the base left to search. 


""Let's head up to the top of this building and get a better view,"" said Bill, trying his hardest not to slur his words as much as Rolandsson was. He pointed to the building that he ran from when the spectres first appeared. 


Rolandsson shrugged. ""The last time I was on a roof I cried quite a lot. But sure, why not, let's go.""


Prising open an access door and clutching at the walls for support, Bill began to tackle the metal stairs. Rolandsson, quite drunk now, had more trouble, but eventually found a workable technique that involved crawling on his hands and knees.


They were just one set of stairs from the roof access door when the screaming started again. It sounded much further away this time. Bill stumbled to a window, wiped away the condensation that instantly formed from his heavy breathing and peered into the light grey dusk outside. 


With relief he saw nothing of the dark spectres, just grey outlines of the buildings. In the distance the larger structure that still housed the McMurdo staff stood silhouetted against the blizzard beyond. A loud snore from behind prompted him to turn around and kick Rolandsson, who now slept peacefully on the stairs. Turning back to the window a movement in the distance caught his eye; one of the doors of the crew building was now open. 


A steady stream of people poured through the open door at a sprint, running in all directions; some towards the base, others to the adjacent building, but most ran straight out into the blizzard, disappearing into the grey. 


Bill kicked Rolandsson again. Harder this time. 


""I think I know what happened to your friends.""

A company, Martin, Craig, Dartmouth, had conducted an experiment on a young boy, to give the child what would only be described as god-like powers. The authorities had to intervene, and while the child was rescued, they apparently had been in a coma for several months. 

The young boy, in this case, is me. Looking further at it, I see a whole host of conspiracy links, and some mentions of a ""Broken God"" or ""Sarkic Cult"". I even see a mention of some company called ""Stringent Cranial Processing"", who looks to have been the home of the employee who let it all slip. As I keep looking, I wonder if I'm the victim of some hidden camera show, and then I see it.

It's only a glimpse. Just a glimpse. The sign, the seal, the me... my head, from the front of both my eyes all the way to the back of my brain, erupts in searing agony. The machines. The injections. 

Something happened to me. Something great and terrible. My brain feels like it's opened into a gaping maw, but my hair is all I feel when I reach the top of my head. The world is spinning, and I throw up just as my computer, for some reason, explodes. Then I hear the sound of my front and back doors being smashed in by what I assume are explosives, followed by many footsteps.

""Clear!"" yells a harsh but feminine voice.
""Clear!"" calls a voice that I recognize. Older than when I last heard him, but I still remember. This was the man who had pulled me out of that torture camp before. Perhaps I could get answers from him.

Then I smell the acrid smell of cordite, being used in an improvised explosive. It all comes back. The answers beat him to the punch. Everything moves slowly. I can see the process of my computer screen refreshing. Time seems to go still. The pain in my head stops.

I.

Remember.

Everything.

These people are from a group that contains the supernatural, the anomalous, those things that should not be but are. Things, unfortunately for all of us involved, like myself. I understand the precision with which they are executing this raid. They're already about to throw a sting ball grenade into my children's bedroom. 

I can't let that happen. Quickly, I start to move, before realizing that I'm going so fast that I'm lighting the air on fire around me. I stop, observing the trail of plasma, the burning and healing of my skin, and the visible change in the air that signifies a sonic boom. I can't simply run there. But I have other tricks.

I concentrate on the entry team. Not them specifically, but rather their gear. With a few hundred milliseconds of effort, I render it all safely inert. I also cancel out the shockwave I've made, and generate a pair of guns in my own hands. Taking a quick glance around before the first entry team member gets a line of sight on me, I see the bullet that was meant for my skull, the debris from my wall smacking into my bottle of scotch. I also see the other bullet coming for where I was, and the muzzle flash signaling that another is on its way. I duck, and fire two shots at the person firing the rounds.

They won't hit him, but they'll do a number on his gun, which is what I'm intending. These are the good guys, and I don't actually want to hurt them, just keep them, and me, from harming my family. I materialize a note where I was sitting, grab the scotch, and calmly make my way to their van waiting outside, being sure to take a little pit stop on the way, to drop the scotch and materialize another note.

""I'M HIT!"" rang out over the radio next, as three bullets slammed into a basement wall, scattering paint, concrete, and remnants of playboy poster over a workbench and computer. 

Up in the top floor, a five person entry team split into two groups, three for the master bedroom, two for the children's room. Perplexed as to their concussion grenades not detonating, they break into the rooms, following the standard procedure of pointing guns at any living thing, and screaming ""ON THE GROUND! ON THE GROUND! GET ON THE FUCKING GROUND!""

After searching the basement, another call comes in over the radio, ""Shit, that was close, the Bixby got my gun, but I'm OK. Falling ba... uh, what the fuck?""

""Report Cranston.""

""Uh, I've got a note here saying 'Nice shot, this is for you,' and a half a bottle of, holy shit that's blue label. Bixby's got good taste if this is him.""

""Don't drink that bottle, take your amnestics and wait for retrieval."" Replied team leader Lombardi. Advancing through the room, he found another note.

""Roger,"" replied Cranston. ""Too bad,"" he thought to himself, ""this is the closest I'm going to get to good scotch.""

Meanwhile, in the van, a man begins to look upon himself. Deciding he doesn't like his look, his physique becomes far more muscular, and his attire morphs into that of a black business suit, with a dark red shirt and a black tie. Then, out of the air, a table, several glasses, and a bottle of 25 year old Lagavulin materializes. The interior of the van seems to gain space that should be impossible for its exterior size.

""NOTE!"" Calls Lombardi. By reflex, he administers a syringe of class A amnestics, and falls to the ground.

""Scrambler, now!"" calls out Lieutenant Crane. Donning the protective eyewear, she goes over to the note to read its contents.

""You guys breaking in was the jolt I needed to remember everything. Apparently, it also gave me superpowers. Please be kind to my family. I'm coming willingly, I'm in your van outside. Hope you all don't mind if I make myself at home. I've got scotch, and I'm willing to share."" ",rmamack

[WP] a sniper and a photographer discuss taking the perfect shot believing that they are both in the same profession.,Blue_that,"There are few finer treats than a nice cup of coffee and the brand new Zeiss Optics catalog.  Me, a comfy chair, and a bottomless cup of the house roast in the coffee shop on the ground floor of my building.  It is familiar.  Shelley behind the counter, vegan chocolate cake in the cooler case, and the stereo running through a playlist with a heavy favoritism toward Portishead and Massive Attack.  It took me back to my middle school years.  The calm I needed after an assignment.

“It’s a beauty, isn’t it?” a voice said.  I looked up.  Before me was five foot eleven inches of beige.  Permanent press Dockers and a shapeless sweater over a white button down.  Uniform of the cul-de-sac communities just a few miles away.  He had ventured far from his usual haunt.

“The new Zeiss catalog.  Got mine two days ago.  Spend all afternoon with it.  Are you a shooter too?”

My eyebrow shot up.  I didn’t answer.  How did he know?  And what the hell did he mean by “too”?

“Well, we can smell our own can’t we.  So are you a professional or *just* an amateur?” he asked.

“Professional.”  Discretion might be the better part of valor, but it is also the only part of my profession that matters.  I conceited this bit of information to see where this might lead.  The loud ones don’t last long.  You speak up and your clients get shy.  But he didn’t seem to have that problem.

“Same here.  I don’t know about you, but I am getting sick of all these Johnny-Come-Latelies showing up online.  Really, undercutting the market.”

He’s right.  By product of a 17 year war I guess.  Every year a new group of operators comes back from the sandbox with just two skills – a desensitized moral compass and the ability to field strip a M40A3 in under a minute.  I would agree with him, but I am one of them.  The old timers always gripe about my rates.  But it is a market economy and we all need to eat.

“How did you get into it.  For me, it was the Army.  ‘Join the Army.  Learn a trade.  See the world.’  That is what my dad told me.  And by gosh, boy was he right!”

“Army as well,” I said.   

“Small world, small world.  They sent me everywhere.  Anytime a dignitary needed coverage.  There I was.  And did we ever see some action!  But that was back in 90 or 91.  I guess you younger guys have it ever better.  Always someone that needs shooting these days.  But it paved the way for a great career.  You do weddings?”

“I try to avoid them.”  My moral compass might not always point due north, but I try not to go full Wicked Witch of the West.

“Me too.  They pay well, but just aren’t worth the headache or all the clean-up afterward.  These days, it is a lot of headshots.  But I miss the younger years – when I had the time to just hang out and shoot whatever was walking down street that looked interesting.”

Sick fuck.

“Well, I gotta run.  Son’s U6 soccer team is getting ready to start.  It’s their first playoff game.”  He reached around behind him.  I wished I brought my sidearm.  He fumbled with his back pocket and pulled back a wallet – crammed chockablock with receipts.  He pulled out a card and placed it on the table.

“Well, take my card.  If you ever need a second shooter, give me a call!” he said as he headed toward the front door.

I looked down at the card.  The corners were worn to fuzzy round edges.

[WP] a sniper and a photographer discuss taking the perfect shot believing that they are both in the same profession.,Blue_that,"Mark climbed twenty flights of stairs. He set his duffel bag down on the roof's loose stone surface and inhaled a mixture of fresh air and smog. The open roof had been one of three potential locations, and the combination of clear sight, wind markers and a direct path out of the city made it his final choice.

Mark peered over the edge facing Amesbury Avenue. People saturated each side of the street, even an hour before the parade. Police in high-vis jackets patrolled the road and did their best to keep it clear. Mark crouched and, with a gloved hand, brushed the loose stones from where he would mount his M40 rifle. 

The roof door creaked with old age and a woman emerged. She had an auburn ponytail, olive green eyes and a mammoth camera slung around her neck. 

'Oh, I'm not the only one.' The woman smiled, and the cold had already begun to brush her face a gentle shade of red. 

Mark jumped from his crouched position, and his eyes betrayingly moved to the duffel bag. He crossed the distance from the edge to his bag and then brought up a hand to greet her. 'I'm Marvin.' 

'Sandy.' She said and lifted her camera an inch from her chest. 'Are you here shooting too?' 

Mark managed to trip, despite being stationary. 'Uh yes.' He said and found it strange not having to lie. 

'The parade right? You're not some strange bird photographer are you?' 

Mark creased his brow.

'Oh god you are, aren't you? I've just gone a put my foot in it.' Sandy said and sucked air through gritted teeth. 

'No not at all. I'm here to get a good shot of the Secretary of State.' 

Sandy walked by Mark, and a tendril of her perfume caught his nose. Mark found himself blinking like a dumb-struck puppy and then shaking his head like a wet one. *Focus* he thought. 

'I wanted to get shots of the big and wonderful inflatables. Secretary of State seems so drab and boring!' Sandy said after standing in the spot Mark had cleared of stones. 

'I suppose.' Mark said and followed her to the edge.

Sandy stood rocking on her feet, an inch from death and Mark could just step forward and push. But something held him back, the smell of her perhaps?

'So you're a journalist?' Sandy asked.

'Freelance.' 

'I see.' Sandy said and nodded at the duffel bag. 'What are you rocking?' 

Mark stumbled on this question. 'Uh, a Cannon.' Mark said leaving out *of sorts*. 

'Reliable.'

Mark found himself giving up more information that he needed; it gushed out of him like his steel trap was no longer secure, but rather a colander. 'Twenty times zoom, stabilisation, rangefinder and quick release ma-' Mark tripped on his words. '-memory cards.' 

'Sounds like you know your stuff.' Sandy said, and her lips beamed upwards filling Mark with a warm, drunken feeling. 'But quick release memory cards? That sounds a bit *overkill*.' 

Mark raised a hand to scratch his head, and as he did so, the beautiful woman on the edge of the roof drew a sidearm. The hollow barrel pointed at Mark, and his body went stiff. In her other hand, she brandished a golden badge with the city crest.

"[WP] People were delighted when Bob came to the office Halloween party dressed as a hellish demon. But a week later, Bob is still wearing the costume.",CaspianX2,"Bob strode into the office as usual, his tail dragging along the carpet behind him. He bid good morning to the secretary and made his way through the labyrinth of cubicles to his own desk. The area itself had always been small, but in the past week, it almost seemed like the space was shrinking on its own. It was inexplicable. Bob noticed it two days ago but shrugged it off as nothing. He was going to have to speak to his wife about cutting back on her baked goods. It obviously was doing him no favors.

Bob’s next-door neighbor, Jonas, ducked his head around the corner and peered into Bob’s cubicle. Bob’s hulking frame sat atop the black swivel chair; his tail was curled around the chair’s wheels on the floor. Bob was turned away from Jonas, yet Jonas could see the tension in Bob’s thick, corded muscles as Bob pounded away on his keyboard. The sound of Bob’s claws tapping the keys was disorienting; it was hard to think about anything else with the loud clacking ringing through the air.

Jonas cleared his throat softly and whispered a greeting to Bob. Without his lower body moving, Bob turned his head a full 180° to look at his co-worker. “Good morning, Jonas. How was your evening?” Bob growled in return.

Still unused to this harsh, rough voice coming from his friend, Jonas winced inwardly. He quickly shook off the terror coursing through his mind and forced a smile. “It was fine,” he began, his voice threatening to crack with every word. “Diana made this great roast for dinner. I’m sure Samantha would like it.”

Bob grinned amiably, his sharp, yellowed teeth on display for Jonas to see. A blackened tongue flicked out casually, and a low growling noise emanated from Bob’s throat. “I’ll get Samantha to call Diana for the recipe once she gets back,” Bob replied. “She left yesterday for a theater workshop. Fairly sudden, too. I guess someone dropped out last minute.”

Jonas attempted to smile back, but his mouth could not form one that appeared genuine enough. He swallowed the lump in his throat, trying to figure out what to say next. Their supervisor had asked Jonas to speak to Bob about his attire. The costume was great for the Halloween party, but today was November 7, a whole week after the fact. For some reason, it seemed that Bob just refused to take the outfit off. And everyone that brought it up to him seemed to be calling in sick…

Not only that, but the costume itself seemed… off. At the party, it was all spandex and cheap fabric. Nice-looking enough at a glance, but it was obviously fake when held up to inspection. Over the past week, however, it was beginning to appear more authentic. Maybe he swapped some parts of the costume for other, more genuine-looking pieces. That, or Samantha was getting better and better at stage makeup. Either way, it was getting more unsettling each day.

“Was there something you wanted to talk about, Jonas?” Bob inquired politely. Bob turned his body to face Jonas, his head remaining still as his lower body shifted.

Jonas felt his stomach climb back into his throat. “Yes, actually,” he began. “Listen, Andrew asked me to talk to you about your costume, it – ”

“What costume?” interrupted Bob. His brow furrowed, the dark red skin of his forehead wrinkling. He appeared genuinely confused.

“You know, the one you wore to the party last week,” Jonas replied. He felt beads of sweat break out across his brow. It felt as if the temperature had risen a few degrees all of a sudden. Jonas inhaled deeply and continued. “The one you’re still wearing,” he finished.

“But Jonas,” Bob replied slowly, “I’m not wearing a costume. I’m wearing my suit, like I always do.” Bob gestured down towards his body, motioning to his scaled hide and staggering frame.

“It was funny at the party, and even a little amusing the day afterwards,” Jonas told Bob. “But it’s been a week, man. It’s getting sort of weird now.”

“Jonas, I have no idea what you’re talking about,” Bob pleaded. “Honestly, I have been wearing my suit every day since – ”

Bob froze mid-speech. His eyes focused on a point far behind Jonas. Alarmed, Jonas rose from his seat and approached his co-worker. “Bob?” he asked quietly.

Bob’s pupils began to dilate. They grew in size until they overtook his entire eye socket. The temperature continued to rise in the air between the two men. Jonas reached out to his friend slowly.

Before Jonas could touch Bob, a clawed hand reached out and grabbed Jonas, fully encircling his torso and pinning his arms to his sides. Jonas began to panic and opened his mouth to let out a scream. Yet suddenly, no sound could come out. Bob reached forward with his free hand, a deadly claw extended and hovering over Jonas’ heart. It slowly descended and buried itself into his soft flesh, carving some insidious rune into Jonas’ skin.

The pain was exquisite. As Bob finished, Jonas’ entire body felt as if it were on fire. His vision was slowly turning black. Just before he submitted to the darkness, Jonas heard a much deeper, more evil voice emanating from Bob, saying, “There is no Bob. Only us.”

"[WP] The Ruins of Earth are considered the archeological find of the millennium.

The suit display offered a wealth of information; atmospheric composition, pressure, points of interest... and the two explorers had ended up at the same landmark, staring in awe. Though the same race, the Andorran's often harbored prejudices and contempt for other Andorran's from colonized worlds, and the most uptight ones no doubt came from the Home World. But since landing here, on Earth, there had been nothing but cooperation and shared curiosity.

""Do you think she was a leader?"" One asked, very simply named Explorer One for this mission. One ran a scan, his suit piercing ice and snow to reveal the  statue in 3-d on his display. Two had just finished scanning the ice thickness, and determined it was safe to land his ship here, and not a minute after the craft appeared above, descending quickly at first, before slowing down, just barely hovering before extending landing gears, settling down on the ice.

""Leader or not, she was someone important.""

""Perhaps she is the one who discovered Fire for their species. She's holding a torch,"" One said.

""I think she was their God. Other explorers have reported statues in the middle-earth, though few as grand as this one.""

The pair shared a moment just staring at her, with their own eyes, displays off. An enormous icicle hanging from the statue's elbow broke off, and crashed into the island below.

""What's your theory on what ended them?"" One asked, and Two responded by turning on his heel and walking towards his ship.

""Super volcano, blotting out the sun. In fact I'm headed to a point of interest right now to gather evidence. You?"", he asked, now sitting in the cockpit of his ship, the glass dome pointing towards the sky.

""War.""

Two snorted, shrugging. ""Boring theory, but plausible. See you later once you're done sifting through the city debris.""

One bowed and extended his arm, the gesture of goodbye, and the glass down slowly went down, connecting with the cockpit, sealing Two in a protective bubble of blast-resistant diamond glass, and shortly after craft took off, zipping across the sky with a roar, breaking the sound barrier instantly.

One took one final look at the large statue, and began walking towards the city. He had remembered when he flew over the city, how grandiose the ruins had seemed compared to tiny structures his scans had picked up just outside the city. Perhaps this is where royalty used to live.

His suit brought up a feed, and a pinging message. It was one addressed to all explorers, and he brought it up with a voice command. 

""No snow here - still cold - very little evidence of structures. Interest found.""

Another ping, with a location. It was somewhere south of the equator on the second-largest continent on this world. Shortly after, images popped up. The explorer appeared to be in a small cave, and on the walls, there were drawings of humanoids and animals, several humans standing around a large mammal with spears in hand. Another image seemed to be a continuation of a series,  with the same humans and mammal depicted, but now there was a predatory animal with large teeth to the right.

""Prehistoric?-- Lesser advanced race?-- Theories?--""

One shut down the feeds, now walking the streets of the ruined city. Decrepit buildings swayed and debris rolled across the streets in the wind, some buildings stretching far above him, others had collapsed and taken others with them. A brief scan showed several warnings of structural weak points, some buildings at risk of collapsing any minute. No matter, he had the Jetpack should he need to get out of the way of a dying structure.

Another feed came in, beeping.

""Theory--. Nuclear disaster--. Traces of uranium found--.""

*Uranium?* One thought. Clearly, this species were more advanced than they had initially thought. He sent a message to the source.

""Where?--.""

Shortly after, the locator zoned in, and an image popped up from the explorer's camera feeds. A sign nearby said ""CHERNOBYL"" in strange letters, but One could not translate the words.

""Uranium--. Weapons?--. War brought them down--."", he transmitted back.

""Uranium also energy--. Evidence inconclusive--.""

The more he explored the city, the more he felt his conclusion was right. This species seemed to obsess over grandiosity,  most buildings serving little purpose in terms of functionality. Some buildings even had traces of valuable metals such as gold and silver inside them, in the form of tiny trinkets, buried in the ages out of sight - but not to his scanners. *Yes. They must have grown into a society of inequality, and from the chasm,  war came to be. What a shame,* he thought.

Yet another message came in, but One dismissed it, in favor of exploring further into the heart of the city. ",leo_ch

The room full of scientists, historians, and experts in xenology the universe over was as loud and as heated as any other day. The Homo Sapiens, as they called themselves, were the fascination of all intelligent species in the Milky Way Galaxy. Not much was known about them other than their short lifespans. 

The room quieted down as the day's featured speaker made their way to the podium. Apparently the young Doujilopent had made a breakthrough in the communication technology that the Homo Sapiens used.

""My fellow researchers and enthusiasts. I'm here today before all of you to revisit the inter-net.""

He was interrupted before he could continue. ""The inter-net has already proven to be a dead end! It allowed the apes to communicate globally at speeds faster than physically possible!""

The Doujilopent smiled ""Yes, however it seems that we were too hasty in dismissing it. After careful analysis it has come to my and my colleagues knowledge that the humans were not as primitive as we have believed. General consensus was that the homo sapiens were simplistic due to their limited array of accumulated knowledge.""

He paused for a moment to adjust his tentacles.

""However it has been found that most of the knowledge the humans had amassed was on the inter-net, There are billions of pages of script, with whole treasure troves of information, ideas, and more!""

There were excited murmurs in the room. This sort of breakthrough could prove imperative to their own theories. 

""The most commonly found pages on the inter-net however, all related to the same subject. Pictures, videos, books, the inter-net is full of it! And any such forums that has this subject is home to the most rigorous scholars and academics found anywhere! Almost every single submission has others asking for sources, names, and professionals! The humans studied this subject in earnest, a very large portion of their society was driven to it!""

""Due to this discovery, it is the belief of my colleagues and I that the humans went extinct due to overpopulation! This supports other evidence such as the shortages of fresh water, the densely populated nature of their habitats, and more!""

The room was now roaring in excitement. If this information proved to be true, then there was finally an end to the debate of the cause of Human Extinction! However, there remained one question that was repeated the most.

What was this subject?

The Doujilopent adjusted his tentacles once more, and knowing what the room wanted to hear, relinquished.

"[WP] During Halloween's eve, a beautiful melody is emanating from the piano in your living room. Upon entering the room, you observe that the keys are moving on their own. The piece sounds familiar. You slowly begin to realize it's your wife's composition.",Chibi1234,"The words of God echoed in her mind. That wasn't unusual, as everything he said held power beyond comprehension. But these words were the most recent - the freshest words she had heard.

*He won't be able to hear you. He won't be able to see you. All you can do is give him a memory, a whisper of his past. These are his darkest hours, and I'm sending you to bring light back to his life.*

After that, she found herself sitting at the piano. Though it had felt like thousands of millennia to her, and at the same time it felt like only a couple of seconds, in reality it had been two years since she had died. The memories of her life on this planet came flooding back - oh how she loved this piano! It had a broken key, and it wasn't quite as magnificent as many other grand pianos, the woman had many fond memories of sitting at this piano, her husband at her side.

The tops of the keys had worn their paint where her fingers would rest. She lightly rest her hands on the keys, the weight of her hands just barely depressing the instrument. 

There were so many instruments in heaven, and she realized that she could play each and every one of them. She loved to make music to worship her King, to dance to and sing to and offer up a song of praise. Joy overflowed inside of her every time she saw God smile when she played. But here she was, sitting back at her old piano.

Then he slowly walked into the room.

He had been crying, at least somewhat recently. He shuffled over to the dresser in the dining room and picked up a photograph that was resting on the top. The picture was of their honeymoon, only six years prior. Life and happiness was in both of their eyes, telling just how much they loved each other. The man couldn't bear looking for too long, and put the picture down again.

Grief had been hard on him. He would feel healed for a day, maybe even a week, and then something would remind him of his late wife. A song, or a picture. Sometimes even a quote from one of her old movies. The memories were just too unbearable for him, and grief followed him like an unwanted cat.

She looked at that man, and she loved him. Not with the same love of the photograph - no, that had faded away. The love she now felt was stronger. This man, right now, was so beautiful, so unique, and so hurting. He had a big hole in his life, and it needed filling.

She knew what to do.

Taking a shallow breath - out of habit, not necessity - the woman played her first chord, and the sound of the dusty piano strings filled the room. The man was startled at first - to him, the seat was empty; it was as if the piano began playing itself. Her hands flew across the piano, and the old song she had written came flooding back to her.

She only wrote one, but it had meant so much to her. Each note came as easy as existing for her, and the words soon followed. With wide eyes, her husband only watched the keys move up and down of their own accord.

*No matter how much I love you*

*I can never match that love*

*No, no matter how much I love you*

*I can never match the love of God*

*Oh, the love, the unending love*

*The unending love of God*

*He sent his son, the perfect one*

*In the unending love of God*

The husband had taken a few steps forward - he recognized the chords, but didn't hear her words. She hopes he would get the message - his eyes were so empty. She launched into the next verse, and she couldn't help but smile.

*Though you mean the world to me*

*The father gave up his world*

*My love fails to compare to that*

*I can never match the love of God*

And then, though no sound came out, her husbands lips began to move with the chorus.

*Oh, the love, the unending love*

*The unending love of God*

*He sent his son, the perfect one*

*Oh the unending love of God*

She felt the pull back to heaven - it was like a rope pulling on her stomach. Still, she felt she had to finish the song.

*Though one day I die, and leave this earth*

*Jesus will never leave thee*

*His love will remain, day after day*

*I can never match the love of God*

Finally her husband was singing, though tears were streaming down his face. She felt only joy; she knew that God was smiling, somewhere up there. Though the tug back was strong, she continued to sing.

*Oh, the love, the unending love*

*The unending love of God*

*He sent his son, his only one*

*In the unending love of God*

Her finger hit the final two notes, and she released her pull, falling into the piano and landing feet first back in paradise. The brilliance of God filled existence itself. 

""Did I do well?"" She asked humbly.

Like the break of dawn, her father smiled, as he simply said ""Well done, my good and faithful servant!""

Trevor's Mother was upstairs putting the washing away when she heard her 16 year old Son calling her from down stairs.""

""What Clev?? hold on a minute babe i'll be down in a mo Hun.""

As Marge walked into the front room, she was confronted with what looked like a tree right out of Narnia..

""What in the name of the Ice Queen is that doing in my front room?""  It dawned on Marge that what she was seeing was what she had been reading about for about years now, Mystical ancient trees sprouting up around the world, above certain lay lines.

""In the name of the Ice Queen more like in the name of GOD, or Ceasar the Ape,, So you don't know how it got here then Mum""

""Yeah i do Clev, you know those magic Heinz beans that you refused to eat? well i dropped a couple last night and poof!!,, Of course i dont know how it got here you fruit cake, look it's ripped through my bloomin carpet for God.""

""Don't say that Mother, what if its him who sent it?? it could be the dreaded tree of good and evil""

"" Well I'll be damned, you little Atheist you,, NOT"" Marge cackled like the old witch she new she must have been in a past life.

""Shall i go and get the chainsaw Mum, and take it down""

""I'll bloody chop your legs off if you do Trev, leave it alone, it's here for a reason and the tree chose us,, lets wait and see the fruits.""

""Well you can wait, but if it gets massive and a giant climbs down, or Eve appears with an apple and a snake, don't forget young Jack offered to cut  it down but you refused him.""

""Don't worry Clev, Iv'e got wholegrain Bread for the Giant, and a rampant Rabbit for Eve if either one show there presence, you cheeky sod, now what you up to?""

""I'm off down the rec to play football and meet Charlotte, and i plan on keeping this to myself not that that's gonna last,, obviously.""

""There is always a season""

""That reveals a reason, i know i know, see ya later Marjorie..""

""Love ya to,  not so Clever""

&amp;#x200B;

Trevor gave his Mum a kiss and walked past the little white Willow tree, not amused and made his way to the local recreation ground..

Marge approached the tree with caution, thinking to herself why me, why my house, why why why? then without fear Marge asked the tree.

""So Willow what can we do for you?"" 

A branch lowered and caressed Marge's cheek, the moment contact was made Marge saw a vision, of a plane being hijacked, she did not recognise any of the passengers, all she noticed was a sequence of numbers 13697, the plane was in the air and the next thing the plane exploded, the explosion blew Marge onto her settee which brought her immediately back to reality.

&amp;#x200B;

""Oh my Giddy-Aunt Gloria, i'd better call the old Bill"" she said out loud as if to someone, but there was nobody there but her and the tree.

Catching her breathe and getting her bearings Marge knew calling the police would be futile they no she's not all there already, so she imagined how the conversation might go

""Erm hello officer you know those mysterious trees that have been popping up around the world like something out of Bridge to Terrabitha-wattsit? well one's in me front room and its showed me a vision of a plane blowing up, can you plse the call the airports in,, where i don't know and i ain't got a clue which plane""  yeah that would go down a treat..

She approached the tree again this time she touched the trunk, as soon as she touch it, it grew at least 3 feet and made a hole through the ceiling an protruded through her bedroom floor.

What is this all about Marge wondered, what was the vision all about, she quickly went to turn the Tv on and the first thing she saw was.

""Breaking News flight 13697 has mysteriously vanished taking of at Heathrow airport, the plane had just left the runaway and before it got to 100 ft the Boeing 747 disappeared as if a magic trick taken place""

Marge fell back into her Arm chair looked at her new house guest, and slowly started to dial 999.

Its been ten years and her words still echoes in my head. Whenever I try to do things, her voice would pop up out of no where just to remind how a waste of a human being I was.

A lot of people told me that she's kind, generous, loving mother.. Some even told me that she's an angel..  But she's not. Behind the closed doors she would constantly showers me with degrading words. I on the other hand would just put my hands on my ears trying to block her venom that came out of her mouth. I'm an adult man now.. And I still do it. Putting my hands on my ears, rocking back and forth at the corner. She's been dead for a quite sometime now but because of the events that happened it felt like she's still alive beside me.. Taunting me. They said that 'Words don't hurt' but unfortunately.. They do. Because words can't just cut but can scar you.. And no matter what you do, the words are carved there in the back of your head.

[WP] The comic relief of the group uses his cartoon-like physics to defeat the villain.,Hamiercus,"""C'mon you oversized leech!"" Gary shouted as the vampire stalked towards him. ""Come at me br..."" Before Gary could finish his taunt, he slipped on a banana peel, landing hard on his back end with a squeal.

The vampire laughed, a dry, rasping sound like old paper rubbed together. It's aged and hollow features turned into a malicious smile as it stepped towards the fallen prey. It stepped on the banana peel that Gary had just slipped upon. Stumbling backwards, it gave Gary the moment he needed to jump back to his feet.

""What? Afraid of some potassium?"" Gary said as he started to run down the hall. ""Maybe you need some more vitamin C you pale, ghost looking bitch!"" All he had to do was keep the vampire busy. His friends were getting out of the mansion while it was distracted. Sunrise was just a few minutes away. All he had to do was survive.

The vampire snarled as it snapped back to it's feet, rising straight from it's back to its shoes. Pursuing Gary, claws outstretched, ready to tear the life from the foolish mortal. Gary ran into one of the rooms off of the hallway, the portrait gallery. It's prey was trapped as it stepped into the room.

Gary brought down the massive portrait he had taken from the wall directly onto the vampires head. The strike caught it completely by surprise as it's head was broken through the ancient canvas and out the other side, the frame caught on its shoulders.

""Nice bust."" Gary said as he took a selfie with the vampire, it's head replacing the one on the portrait and showing a woman's body over the vampire's own. ""What's your Instagram? Hundred likes, guaranteed.""

The centuries old monster tore through the frame and portrait of it's ancestors, snarling wildly in bitter rage.

""Whoa!"" Gary yelled as he backed away from the vampire. ""Guess you're more of a Twitter guy, huh?""

""You damnable jester,"" The vampire growled, slowly cornering Gary against the far wall. ""You will be sweet upon my tongue as a drain you dry.""

""I had a girlfriend like that once,"" Gary said as he backed up against the window. ""She was just as much of a heartless monster as you."" With that, he ripped the curtains from the window.

Bright sunlight burst into the room, catching the vampire out. It screeched in an unearthly pain as the light cut through it's dry flesh like the sharpest blade. Within moments, the ancient terror of Blackwood Manor turned to dust, collapsing to the floor in a pile of moth eaten robes. Gary let out a sigh of relief, dusting off his pants as he left the gallery.

""Another day, another crazy vampire."" He said as he headed back towards the main entrance of the mansion to rejoin his friends. ""You'd think these jerks would just brick up all of the windows in their hideaways to stop that from happening.""",HeadSmashDesk

Hundreds of them are hunched in front of me, quivering and crying. They’ve feared my arrival since they discovered my pod a couple hundred years ago, but what they don’t know is we froze ourselves because we feared *them.*

They’re bugs—I guess. Picture a praying mantis the size of a human but with a venus flytrap for a head. That’s them, and they showed up out of nowhere. One day a few wandered into a city and tore it apart, spitting acid everywhere and devouring everyone. Quickly more appeared all over the world, and when it was clear we’d lost, those who could escape, such as myself, were frozen.

Looks like my pod was the only one to survive.

It’s…strange seeing them like this. Their strength was unimaginable. I mean, are these really the same creatures who slaughtered my family and ripped off my arm? Years of peace and domination must’ve weakened them. Or, hell, maybe they don’t even know about their strength because they've never used it. Don’t even know that, if they wanted to, they could kill me in an instant.

When I stand, they cluster up, forming a ball. They’re begging for they’re lives, promising they’ll do anything I want. They worship me like some kind of monstrous deity, and as I stare at them, hatred consumes me. Humanity fell because of *them,* and right now, I have a real chance at revenge.

I remember rumors of a man far in the east who insisted he was close to finishing a poison. Nobody believed him, but apparently he refused to freeze himself, refused to give up. Maybe he finished it, and if I find it, I could wipe these bastards out.

It's a long shot, but I'll put my faith in it.

When you reach the surface, you find that the race that replaced humans views you as a hyperintelligent and highly dangerous Eldritch Abomination.",Lolrly123,"The last thing I saw was the last thing most people saw, if you think about it from a round enough point of view.

Missile launch detected.

Sure, other people saw other things after the alarms went off. Waves of fire. Atomic ash, spreading harsh and wide from the horizon. Waves of it, cascading wildly, ripping clouds of the air.

MIRV impacts.

But largely, those who had died like I was supposed to had seen the end of the world from an alarm somewhere. Missiles in the air. Missile Launch Detected.

Take Cover.

It would never do anything. No projection had any real longevity to it. Nuclear winters. Atomic genocide. An escalation that would never cease until the surface of the moon was bleached white.

""Get to the pods,"" the loud speakers roar. ""Maintain containment protocols. We will ride this out, and we will continue our jobs."" The screams were hideous and they were miles away. The death knell of this chapter of the world. Adjusting my glasses on my nose, I stood up, half buried in equations, and looked at the other scientist in the room.

Isaac smiled, showing off his mouth of pearly whites, though his eyes flickered around. ""Holy shit. I can't believe they're actually doing it. I can't believe they're actually doing it. I can't believe they're actually-

Labcoat felt more like a bulletproof vest, and my name tag spiralled in front of me under the mass of bodies, unwashed, unclean, clamb---

But then I awaken.

Eyes snap open.

""Atmospheric levels have returned to a stable norm. Releasing occupant.""

Hot yellow letters flickered in front of me, and Omoi, the animated AI assistant, flickered hideously across the screen, cracked, chipped. Ancient. ""I hope you have a wonderful day, Jessica~!"" It cooed.

Sensation was raw, hideous, hot, screaming through every vein. Lights too bright, sending an ocular agony through the nerves. Skin too used to nothing at all, kept perfectly sealed, ancient equipment recycling air over and over again from hidden nuclear batteries.

I stumbled out and almost faceplanted across the broken glass strewn in front of me.

The white pain on the wall had been long replaced by a hideously green sheet of mold, hot, wrapped up, blooming.

But apart from my breathing (air sucked hideously tight ((up into my lungs))) there were no noises of other machines.

My heart sank, and I turned, slowly, to look behind me.

Rows upon rows of broken machines.

Skeletons, mostly. A person or two, recently deceased, still had skin.

Maybe half a dozen pods that weren't occupied.

The cryopod I'd been in shut down with a shower of sparks.

""I sense your heartrate is increasing rapidly. Would you like to listen to music?"" Omoi asked from the implant behind my ear. I breathed out, trying to control it, but my hands were too busy shaking.

""Yes Omoi. Music please.""

Beethoven played through the bones of my head, utterly quiet to the rest of the world, but it drowned out the screaming still going on in my head.

""I can't believe they actually did it."" I whispered. Sunlight cascaded roughly through the window; where it had once been before whatever else had bashed it apart.

""I can't believe they actually did it,"" I breathed out, trying to focus, but my heart ached and hurt, and tears ran down my face, staring at the hundreds of my colleagues that hadn't made it.

""Omoi,"" I said. ""Atmospheric conditions are returned to human standards?""

""I detect a 95% return to pre-industrial levels, with 5% being a contamination of black mold. Remaining in this room is deemed hazardous. Please remove yourself, Jessica.""

I turned around and looked to the exit. Blocked off by rubble.

The only lights in the room was the sun itself, and the strips of radioactive paint we'd used to determine if reactors were leaking.

And even they were dim. Half-lives, half-lives, half-lives...

""Omoi?"" I asked, lazily, my voice trailing awkward. ""What year is it?""

""7043,"" Omoi chirped happily. ""I'm so glad to see that another has awoken, I was concerned that I might run out of bio-forms to draw power from.""

I breathed out.

It hit me that I was hungry. Ridiculously. Hungry.

""Omoi,"" I asked, pushing myself away from the table. It was littered with name tags. Dozens of them. Hundreds of them. Dead people. ""How many people have gotten out of the cryopods?""

""You mark the sixth,"" Omoi replied.

""Are you in contact with any of them?"" I asked.

""Sadly, they're out of my network range. Several of the satellites I have permission to access have dropped out of orbit.""

I breathed out. ""How many is several?""

""All of them,"" Omoi admitted.

I walked over to the window and peered out. It'd been a halfway burnt out field; a complete biocollapse in progress.

Now it was a verdant forest. Impossibly thick.

I could see skyscrapers poking out of the trees like forgotten gods. Ivy rolled up one side and out the other.

But what struck me as the most odd was that I was getting a map signal. Civilian, not the research model I was used to, but dialetically similar enough to english for Omoi decode.

""Omoi,"" I asked. ""Where am I, according to that map signal?""

""Warden's Grave,"" Omoi answered.

I turned around, slowly, and stared at the corpses around me.

""How..."" I was running out of questions, and if I ran out of those, I might have nothing left. ""How long since... the last person left?""

""Six years ago; there was a malfunction in my sensors, I apologize. I only have access to the environmental records of this room, at the moment.""

Which meant her atmospheric scans were just local. And any time they got near the levels needed to release humans... she triggered the release function.

And only a few people would be released at first, as a safety mechanism, in case there was an error with the sensors.

It'd killed us.

I looked around to see the consoles smashed from debris. Passive systems.

""How many living humans left in this room?""

Final question.

""Just one.""

Myself.

""How many signals in the area..."" I said, slowly realizing something. ""Aren't from humans?""

""Just one.""

----

The window had long lost all structural integrity, like everything in the room. All I managed to salvage was a crowbar, left to the side in a closet to the back of the room, and the clothes on my back; a tight jumpsuit designed not to interfere in the slightest with the pods.

Then I stepped outside into the forest. Omoi lit up an arrow across my eye, tracking the nearest signal. Crowbar in my hands, I slid forward, piece by piece, step by step.

""I can't believe they really did it,"" I whispered under my breath. This had used to be a city.

A dying city.

But where I could see the roads there were only trees. A few crumbling edifices of smaller buildings. The crowbar was heavy under my weak muscles, but it was safety, it was something I knew. Something I understood.

""I am within range to begin decoding for communication purposes. Would you like me to engage in such services?"" Omoi asked, chirping in my ear.

""Of course,"" I said, stepping forward. Where was the bird song? Surely the bombs hadn't destroyed that, at least.

""Patching through.""

An estimated progress bar crawled up across my vision, and I swept it to the side with a strategic flick of my eyes so it didn't block anything important.

""Patched through. Open communication?""

""Of course,"" I said.

""Frequency is open.""

""This is Jessica Williams, researcher at USECOG,"" I said. ""I am using my clearance to requisition help from the surrounding area.""

""You seem to be out of your time,"" The voice replied. The voice was smooth like black butter, but the edges of the tone weren't human. Something flickered, fluctuated like the surface of a glass table; smooth to the touch, but microscopically far different.

""Identify yourself,"" I replied. They weren't human.

""That's going to be your first problem."" the voice replied. ""I'll meet up with you at the rock ahead, if you're up for meeting me.""

The com ended.

My hands shook a bit. I stabilized them by yanking up the volume on the music in my ears, and walked forward.

What did I have to lose?

----

The rock had used to be a convenience store. I'd gone there, earlier in the day, 5000 years ago, and gotten a pint of icecream to store in my office fridge.

It was now just a pile of rocks.

But standing on the top gleamed black feathers, a beak pitched like ivory.

Two legs, and talons, cut into sleeves.

The absolute fuck was that supposed to be?

""Warden,"" The bird creature said. ""Welcome to the Green-Lands. I'll be your guide from here on out.""

""What the hell are you supposed to be?"" I snarled.

""I'm a crow,"" the crow bowed. ""And I do not have a name.""

I paused. ""And why don't you have a name?""

""And I will be your guide from here on out,"" The bird repeated. Almost human in tone. But not quite.

I wanted humans. I wanted people.

I might never get either of those. Ever again.

If those traits are found in a dominant species, it is by coincidence alone. Evolution rewards reproduction, and any means necessary to achieve it will be passed onto the next generation.

&amp;#x200B;

That thought is not meant to belittle my new compatriots. They are very resourceful, and their ingenuity always amazes me; they are simple but I do not see a limit to their creativity and ability to learn, so far. Perhaps they simply lack the foundation of knowledge that we took for granted. Working together with them was difficult at first, language was an enormous barrier to overcome, but we found a way in the end. Luckily it seems there is more in common with mammalian body language than I had expected, and empathy has, thankfully, been a strong trait in these creatures. 

&amp;#x200B;

Despite their empathy they still know hate and violence, as we were once experts as well; and I join them amidst a war of factions. I often laugh to myself, because it is clear to me that I am leading a cult. These fury friends of mine worship me, and see me as a savior to their persecution; likewise their counterparts see me as a demon, summoned from a place that was forbidden for them to venture. Both are true I would say, however my intent is to survive, not destroy their opposing faction. Survive and find other humans. There must be others, at least that is what I tell myself to keep hope.

&amp;#x200B;

Their eagerness to learn has really catalyzed our progress so far. They were using tools when I arrived, but we've made a lot of progress since then. I've promised them great magic if we can get this ancient generator operating again, maybe I can get this busted radio going and actually find someone. It would be heavenly, to speak to another human, though I realize the chances of this are dismal. If not though, I can at least kick start the next species' future. It's funny really, to us they were pests. Extraordinary scavengers and survivalists, but pests none the less. And here, in the ruins of our magical kingdom, they've made an empire from our refuse. Maybe one day they'll make it off this planet and into the stars like we once dreamed. What a hilarious notion...raccoons in space.",cdvalor

After years of seeing it through choking smog and grey mornings, it was unnatural in a proper shade of blinding white.

The bird-man hopped down next to me, bobbing down on his nimble clawed feet. ""And we shouldn't stick around this place for long. The fey are drifting through, looking for more slaves.""

I stared at him incredulously, then tapped the side of my head. Omoi scanned the birdman. No name detected. No name registered on the device he was holding. 

""How'd you get that pocket com?"" I asked, pointing at him.

The bird blinked his black eyes, barely visible against the shade of his feathers, and pulled a small watch like device out of his pocket. Clicked it open.

Omoi pinged it as being the source of the signal, redundantly. ""I'm a scout by trade,"" the bird explained. ""Having an electronic map is only useful.""

""Do you have a name I can call you?""

""You can call me anything you like,"" he dismissed, stopping in front of me. This close, I could see every strange feather etched on his face, and feel the slight breath and disturbances in the air from his passage. ""It just won't be my name.""

""Jay,"" I decided. ""I'm calling you Jay.""

Jay's feathers puffed slightly, and he turned away, looking towards the sky. ""Jay, then. Warden, we really must be going.""

I hesitated, staring at him. ""It really won't get better if we stay here,"" Jay said, again, then turned away to look into the forest.

""Which way?""

Jay pointed with a taloned hand, out to the distance. To the building rising high above the forest. ""Prime nest is there. Let's go.""

Then he ran off ahead of me, shooting me a glance.

What the hell did he mean by the fey?

A cloud drifted over the sun, shrouding the forest in almost darkness. I could just see him, waiting for me, but his feathers twitched impatiently. 

No need to get rid of my guide that quickly. After a moment, I ran after him, feeling the tiredness that seeped into my bones. I could sleep another time.

Cryo-sickness might not wait that long, but there were answers to chase after, and they were stuck in the form of a birdman.

Jason Crowe blinked, for the first time in what felt like years, and in the momentary realization of his being alive, he attempted to scream. No words came out, as the breathing tubes prevented any sort of vocalization outside of grumbling and moaning. He stared out the glass of his containment tube, the glistening of the rather thick healing gel he was suspended in dulled the world around him, but it appeared that the facility was intact.

&gt;""*But.... if the facility is intact, and if everything is working, then why am I awake?""*, Jason thought to himself. 

&gt; ""*Is it over?*

Something was wrong and Jason knew it. He tried to look deeper, past the healing suspension and glass and into the room he was being kept in. The layout of the room seemed unchanged from when the experiment first started, but it was darker; the blinking lights of the computers were fainter, and the walls had turned from their stark-white plastic colour to a decayed, almost gunmetal gray. There seemed to be pockets of darkness scattered all over the room, blurs of black and grey dotted around the room in an asymmetrical fashion.

&gt;""*Where are all the scientists? Where is Dr. Rothschild?*, Jason thought, beginning to understand the severity of his situation. 
&gt; ""*If I'm thinking right now, that means the stasis field is offline. If the stasis field is offline.......Oh God, how long have I been asleep?""*

With the stasis field online, Jason's bodily functions were ground to a halt, the technology essentially freezing Jason's state of being in a fixed point in time. The doctors had told him that he wouldn't have to eat, only dream, and only dream he did.

He had dreamed of burning skies, and of a dark fog covering the entire Earth, so thick and dark that it blurred out the Sun.

He had dreamed of birds flying, screaming bloody murder as a massive octopus snatched them out of the fiery sky and slammed them onto the shore, tearing them apart and eating of them greedily.

 He had dreamed of his wife and children, slowly melting into puddles of fog and embers in his arms. He lowered his head, and began to weep softly.

 When he looked up from his despair, a massive crow, nearly eight feet in height was staring at him, craning its head inquisitively. 

&gt;""*I couldn't do anything, it's not my fault..""*, Jason whimpered. *""It's not my fault"".....*

 Then the bird furiously began to peck at Jason's chest. He could only watched as its midnight beak plunged into his torso, tearing his shirt and skin; the torrent of Jason's lifeblood was unending, and when the beast finally plucked his heart from his chest, he could only cry in agony, as he knew he somehow deserved this pain.

Jason lingered on these dreams, but he knew he could not linger on them for much longer. Who knows how long the stasis field had been inactive when he had finally startled from his slumber.

&gt;""*I have to get out of here""*, Jason decided. ""*Find someone who can tell me what's going on""*.

Summoning his remaining focus and strength, Jason began to punch the glass of the containment tube. The healing gel was thick, the glass strong, but he was stronger. As he rammed his fist into the tempered glass, the telltale spiderweb crackling meant that he was almost free.

Suddenly, he began to sink. He grasped for anything he could find, but he could not find anything to pull himself up. Some force was dragging him down.

&gt;*""No no no no no no NO NO NO DAMNIT NO""*, Jason screamed internally.

Suddenly he found himself kneeling of the floor of the containment tube, the viscous gel having all but disappeared underneath the now visible grating of the floor drains. Jason took off his breathing mask and immediately began gasping for breath. 

&gt;*""Right, no air.""*

But more demanding of his attention than the lack of oxygen was that he could see the room he was in clearer now. Though the glass of the tube was now cracked, he could see now that the black and grey blurs he had seen earlier were not stagnant pockets of darkness. *They were moving* in the room, in jaunted motions that certainly no Earthly creature of that size could make.

&gt; ""*Jesus fucking Christ what in the fuck is that.""*, Jason thought. Panicking, he began to crawl to the back of the containment tube. ""*No no no WHAT THE FUCK no.""*

Suddenly, the shapes stopped moving. One dark mass, darker than all the rest began to move towards the containment tube, and Jason's blood froze in his veins.

&gt;""*It saw me moving, they saw me moving no no no no fuck off no""*

The darkness moved closer, and closer, and closer, and finally the mass of midnight black was standing right in front of the containment tube; the spiderweb crackling of the glass preventing Jason from seeing this monster.

Not that it mattered anyway, because Jason had lowered his head and began to weep in fear. He heard the whizzing and buzzing of the containment tube's circuitry, and Jason felt the glass he was leaning against lift up. The glass was gone, the only barrier between him and these monsters was gone.

He couldn't take it anymore. Jason lifted his face, cowering with his eyes blood red.

And staring down at him, craning it's head inquisitively, was the crow from his dreams.

"[WP] You wake up in a destroyed underground lab after 5,000 years of cryogenic stasis. When you reach the surface, you find that the race that replaced humans views you as a hyperintelligent and highly dangerous Eldritch Abomination.",Lolrly123,"Within the few texts preserved well enough to salvage any sort of message they found hints of an elder civilization. A relict of a world long dead lay somewhere beneath the blasted heath where they stood. A group of their most desperately intelligent scientists began excavating beneath the burning ruins of civilization as they knew it. 

They came upon maddeningly impossible structures. Cool despite the burning air of the world around them. Smooth and metallic yet clearly organic, something nature could never have wrought unto this world, with impossible curves disappearing into themselves and becoming non-Euclidean lines spiraling into nowhere. One of the more feeble-minded of their crew broke into a panic upon seeing the structure, raving of elder races better left untouched, better left buried. They helped him up the ladder leading to the surface but quickly resumed digging after.

Soon their path was blocked by an impenetrable wall of darkness. Solid to the touch but letting not even light escape its maw. A brief discussion ensued where it was decided one of their party would make physical contact with the wall. The one brave soul reached out, trembling, and felt the oddly bumpy surface of the blackness. Almost instantly, the group was blinded with an unfathomably bright light, searing their vision and causing them to inadvertently crumple to the ground. Straining against the intensity of the otherworldly brightness, the one who initially touched the wall saw ridiculous symbols flashing in and out of reality. As the symbols increased in frequency and number, a soft high-pitched keening sound started to fill the air. Like a gentle machine starting after centuries of inactivity. 

The ground beneath the excavation team began to buck and shake causing those with hardier constitutions, the ones that managed to regain their feet after being blinded, to fall again. The structure upon which they stood began to rift and tear, faults and seams appearing from nowhere. There was no noise, no breakage, no destruction. The ground split perfectly in equal parts, preserving the alien smoothness of the material beneath their feet. Half of their group was lost, taken beyond the curvature of the horizon, sucked into the void and never to be heard from again. The other half, minus the one who triggered the wall, managed to flee, screaming that they had tampered with angry gods beyond their understanding. As they ran their minds seemed to degrade into madness, coherent thought became frantic gibbering as the magnitude of the situation they unleashed tore their fragile conscious to shreds.

I met the one who touched the wall. He ended up falling into the stasis pod as it opened, and I woke up. It was a tiny, slimy, eel-like thing with seemingly useless half-arm half-tentacles sprouting out of random orifices. Disgusted, I raised a hand to brush it off me but before I could I heard its whisper of a voice.

“forgive us please… we didn’t know what we sought to unleash. The old texts did not warn us of the horror of the awakening. We were fooled by promises of greenery and splendor, oh please, god, we didn’t know!”

“What the hell are you talking about? And what *are* you? Did you turn on the computer? What year is it?” I was confused, trying to get my bearings, and this raving, disgusting creature wasn’t helping. I looked at the screen which had already booted up and was asking for my login. Exasperated, I noted that I had been woken 5,000 years too early by whatever these things were. 

I picked the creature up, as gently as possible. It had curled into a ball and was sobbing loudly, causing it to produce even more disgusting fluid from its body. “Look this is why I was frozen in the first place. I’m supposed to wait until the radiation is gone and we can rebuild and I don’t need any sentient slugs waking me up, got that?”

“Th…There…There are more of you?” The thing asked, too horrified to remember to be terrified. 

I looked around the lab. It had clearly seen better days. Covered in grime and ash, I could barely recognize any of the technology meant to keep me alive. I noticed that these tiny slug-creatures had constructed tiny mounds around the metal beams that supported my cryo-pod. “There should be more… somewhere… They never told me where. Look, just don’t go ‘digging’ for me again. I wouldn’t want to accidentally fry your, uh, civilization here if a generator blew or something.”

“I swear!” The thing shook in my hand and I nearly let go, reflexively disgusted. “Your warning will be preserved for generations! The elder gods lie buried beneath us and they are better left sleeping. Your power is inconceivable and I tremble before you, glorious abomination, awed and maddened by the sheer scope of your being!”

I didn’t have the patience for this. After resetting the computer, I placed the thing safely away from all the machinery. “I swear to god I better not get woken up again and find that you started a cult about me.”

With a gentle hiss, the glass pod closed again and I was bathed in a cool mist. Hopefully to sleep uninterrupted for the next 5,000 years.

I had slept for a long time. Forced to sleep. Long cold sleep. They wanted me hidden away. My own kind saw me as a threat. A wolf among sheep. Tasty tasty sheep. They punished me for it, but now I am awake. I am hungry. It has been a long time. There are very few signs of the world I knew. The sheep are extinct and I am hungry. So hungry….

I do not know what these things are that have built their place on the graves of humankind. They are foreign to me. Their tall spindly buildings made of what looks to be thick roots grown upwards. The green fibrous texture of their skin. The vacant stare of the one black orb in their faces as they follow my every movement. They have feared me. They have worshipped me. And I have tasted them.

But they are not flesh, and a wolf needs flesh. I have eaten their strong and their weak. I have taken their soft and supple newly born. I have fed upon them. But they are more plant than animal and I violently vomit up that which I consume. I feed and I am still hungry. 

I am flesh. I am the last of the flesh. A wolf in a trap will gnaw it’s own limbs, and I do the same. My trap is time. I am trapped in time. Soon I will sleep again. I will not wake again. They watch me. They fear me. I do not  eat them anymore. They are nasty things. Watch me fade. Watch me sleep. Tell stories of me so that I may live in your nightmares for generations to come. The ones who came before me are forgotten dust, but I will be remembered. I am a wolf and I embrace the darkness that is death.

Just pure, rich, jet-black darkness. A comforting state in which to spend the many epochs my body has rested in for the last five millennia. That's how I would describe it. In fact, it's all I can think about right now, as I run across yet another gantry — my bare feet slipping slightly from the rain with each tread.

I've been running for what feels like four hours. Then again, my sense of time has been completely unreliable since I came to. It doesn't help that the ominous, dome-like structure — stretching over row after row, after row, of bleak, gray highway — is glowing with artificially clinical light. The constant downpour, blueish light, and desperate need to run has kept me awake pretty much the entire time since I awoke. What an odd juxtaposition to the warm blanket of cryostasis.

""If you're reading this..."" read the text where I woke up, etched into the wall, ""Your mind has remained intact for over 5,000 years. Importantly, and like me, if only your mind has remained intact, you are destined to be slaughtered in the most disturbing ritual imaginable. Humanity is long gone. For a reason that I cannot discern, the Taurlian race has decided to keep as many of us alive as possible. If your body is functional, your only option is to run. Do not dwell on this advice, but instead I implore you to take it as an order. Head westerly (follow the outline of the sun at dusk), and you should find helpful vagabonds on your journey that can point you in the direction of other humans. If you remain in this room, you will be sent back into the dark, but not before enduring unfathomable pain.""

I have so many questions, but I can't stop to think about any of them. It's funny how after countless years of peace, the mind can instantly regain its survival instinct.

At first, I didn't know what to make of the message on the wall. ""Is it some kind of sick experiment?"" I thought as I darted for the room's only doorway. That led me to a low-lit, uphill corridor — about double my width and height — with a floor and walls made of what looked and felt like glass. At the end of the corridor was a door with a circular wheel, like the ones you imagine there to be in submarines. I managed to turn the wheel through and get the door open. As I pushed it open, I heard a soft, but robotic, voice chanting:

*You humans must be stopped.*

*You think ""outside the box"".*

*We'll find you and you'll pay,*

*We'll turn your mind to blocks.*

I can see figures dancing around in the distance, working their way slowly towards me. I need to get down from this gantry.",dr_norton

What was once my home, New York City the bustling center of the city that never sleeps, now is just... nothing. I was escorted through the streets by the... things.  
I thought back to when I woke up, and about 30 or so were looking at me with their eye, at least I think the bulbous, fleshy circle on the center of their body was. The other cryo-pods were dark. I don’t know what happened to my friends and family in them, if the creatures likewise found them, or perhaps I’m the last one. I remember Dr Halbern confessing that he wasn’t sure if the power reserves would last as long as we needed, almost like it was yesterday. It was a lot longer than yesterday.  
When I moved from the chamber my body felt like it had turned to stone, which wasn’t entirely inaccurate. I groaned in pain, and then gasped when the creatures around me fell over twitching, something red oozing out of their “eye”s. The terrifying thing was that I heard nothing. Not a whisper as the group just... died. New ones came in through the vault door, dragged out the corpses in equally chilling silence. I meekly apologized, at only a whisper. The others fell on their short little legs, more of the bright red stuff came out of their eyes, but this time they didn’t die, they only shook with pain and walked with a limp when they resumed their work. Since then I hadn’t said anything, not when a few of them came in and attempted to pick up the pod with some kind of machine to no avail, not when they skittered away in fear when I stood up, and certainly not when one of them stood in the streets, slightly shaking when I made my way out of the vault, into the city. More had joined as I followed my presumed guide. 
Each time my soft, shoeless feet hit what remained of the concrete roads, all of them flinched, though I couldn’t hear the faintest of noise. I’m glad I ignored the vault-standard flip-flops when getting my clothes. 
When they stopped in front of a small metal door, built into a crumbling building, it opened, and they all turned to me with their silent eyes. Slowly getting to my knees, I looked through the vent-like entrance, gripped the sides, and hissed in pain as I realized it was extremely hot.  
Oh fuck are they-  
Yup. The whole group was on the floor. Sighing in frustration, I resumed crawling my way through he dark metal shaft, dreading what else I might accidentally kill today. ",fuzzyblep

It's humanoid, about the size of an adult man. There's something familiar about him.. It's Santa Claus. And he's come to take you.",Magisidae,"""It's Christmas!""

I was quite excited as I awoke. I had been waiting for Christmas for awhile now, so I rushed out of bed and down the stairs as fast as I could. Unfortunately, upon reaching the floor, I saw the clock which read 3:03. I disappointingly began to head back up stairs until a glaring light flashed in my peripheral. It was from outside shining in via a window. It was an extremely colourful display, but quite odd and I couldn't make out the source of it. I decided to take a step outside. In the distance, I saw a large figure coming this way. As he inched his way closer it eventually became apparent that he was a large man.

""Hello there?"" I asked cautiously.

""Ho ho ho, Merry Christmas!"" The man replied in a jolly tone.

""Merry Christmas,"" I muttered back.

""I'm Santa Claus!"" 

I may enjoy Christmas, but I'm not an idiot. I'm not going to believe some old man claiming to be Santa just because he has a bit of a gut and a jolly tone. I began getting nervous as he was beginning to get really close. I decided to end the conversation by telling him I had to get back into my house, but he was persistent and it was getting a lot colder outside as the lights began to dim. 

""Just one more thing. You're the Head of Operations at the large toy store in town, right?"" the man asked in the same jolly tone. How could he have known that though? Regardless though, at this point, it became clear that I had to get the hell out of here. Without even responding I turned around and began to run for it. Unfortunately, a large moose or something began running right at me and I had to jump out of the way. I hit the ground hard and as I began to recover I saw the large man towering right over me. I got a much better look at him and he certainly looked like Santa. The costume also looked pretty expensive, this guy clearly took the role seriously. Looking down, the man asked if I needed a hand. Not wanting to worsen the situation, I took his hand and he helped me to my feet. 

""You don't need to be scared of me. I just need to ask your advice about something,"" the man replied in a more serious, yet still unmistakably jolly tone.

""Okay, sure,"" I nervously replied.

""The whole gift giving business,"" the man began in a somber tone. ""I'm starting to think I'm too old for it. Technology is completely disrupted the industry and I just can't keep up with it anymore. Last year was a very bad year for us. We invested large funds into trying to implement an AI program to create the Naughty &amp; Nice list and designate a corresponding gift, but the results were terrible. I had to hire some of the elves to rush through it, but it became apparent after that we had different standards. Not only that, last year was our lowest delivery rate in history. We only made about 86.3% of our deliveries and it was also our 3rd highest error rate, at 9.7%. But even worse was our approval rating was only 49.2%, the first time we've never had a majority approval rating.""

Although any normal person listening to this would think he was crazy, I for whatever reason believed him. There was something almost mystical about the man and the way he spoke that I was convinced I was listening to the actual Santa Claus. But what was he telling me? How could Santa be struggling this much?

""Wait don't give up yet, Santa! You have brought joy to millions of children!"" I plead as I looked at the old man. His beard and glasses covered most of his face, but even in the dark, I could make out a tear dripping from his eyes.

""No, it's time. I've had a good run, but I have to pass off the business. Unfortunately, Mrs. Claus and I never had any children, so I have nobody to pass it off to. That's why I was hoping you could take over the gift giving business. Your toy store has done very well and is taking full advantage of the new technology based market. I got lucky, for most of my time there weren't any airplanes, I could just use magic. It was really my fault, I stopped innovating and now we're quickly losing our competitive advantage. We need fresh blood.""

With that, I had no choice. Santa had brought so much joy to my life that it was my duty to return the call for help. 

""I accept your offer,"" I firmly stated as I stuck my hand out for Santa to shake. Santa's face lightened in response, but not in anyway I was expected. He was smiling again, but it appeared sinister. Before I could react, Santa knocked me out.

I eventually woke up. I wasn't in my old clothes anymore, I was in a green outfit. As I got up off the floor I observed my surroundings. I was in a dark cellar. There was a man sitting outside and I screamed at him, demanding to know what was going on. The man slowly turned around and in a raspy voice replied ""you're an elf now."" After he said that, an armed guard came down and let me out of the prison. He placed a gun against my back and told me to walk forward. Seeing no other options, I obliged and began following the path that was set out for me. I eventually came into a large room, which looked like a factory. There were hundreds of other people dressed up like I was. Most were working on what appeared to be over fifty assembly lines. The rest were either being whipped or eating a very plain looking sandwich. With that, I saw Santa again.

""Santa, what are you doing with me? What's going on?"" I cried.

""Told you business was getting tougher. I didn't want to pay for more employees, so I've been on the look out for slaves to become elves lately. I originally would only take people from the Naughty List, but they often proved unruly. However, people who were always on the Nice List were almost as productive as the actual elves. You'll fit in just nicely,"" Santa replied as he faced a toothy grin at me. 

""So, you're going to put me one of these machines?"" I asked, half angry, but half terrified.

""Oh no! Not all kids get toys and we've been doing well here. Come with me."" With that, the armed guard forced me to follow Santa as he led me out into another room. As we walked by many of the slaves, I saw looks of utter distress. We eventually walked outside, where it was extremely cold. We were at a mine, which a few other slaves were working at. They didn't appear to have a lot of equipment and I saw at least one who appeared to be lying dead on the side. 

""We need to mine coal for the naughty kids and we've mined it all. We've been importing most of our coal lately, but I'm going to make damn well sure we get as much of the North Pole's coal as I can. That's your job,"" Santa instructed me. In no situation to object, I began working on the coal miner and have been living this life for the past few years, at least. If any of you are reading this letter, please come to the North Pole.

"[WP] Elves and Dwarves have been bitter enemies since anyone can remember. Or at least that's what the humans and think. Instead it's an elaborate prank, enabled by elves and dwarves living so much longer than humans.",Peteman22,"Slamming my sword against the dwarf’s, we growl at each other. After pulling away, our blades collide again, but this time he’s quicker, managing to slice my arm and draw some blood. Our comrades surround us, also locked in battle, and the humans standing on the road? Well, they’re clapping, enjoying how much we hate each other.

Little do they know we’re snickering under our breath.

Me and the dwarf enter the big finale, throwing our weapons down and fistfighting each other. It's brutal, but at this point we both enjoy it. Taking a beating’s worth it when you’re getting paid good, and it isn’t long before the humans start tossing gold at us. We let the dwarfs win this ‘battle,’ and the humans throw more coins before moving along.

When they’re gone, the dwarf helps me up, putting a hand on my shoulder and smiling. “’Ell of a foight, aye?”

“Yeah. Great as always,” I reply. Then, I look off to the side, where some of our boys are counting the coins. “What’s the keep?”

“Two hundred!” a chipper elf screams. “Highest we’ve ever got in one night, this is.”

With a yawn, I sit against a tree, pulling out a bottle of wine. Everybody's celebrating, dancing and singing. What a crazy life this is. For centuries we’ve swindled the humans, making them believe we’re at war, and while it was originally for survival—hell, I guess it still is, in a way—it’s gone on so long that they view it as a damned sport.

We pretend to battle, show some blood, and they make us rich.

After downing half the bottle, I start dozing off. Tomorrow we’ll move somewhere else, trick some more folks into believing our war’s still raging. But for now? We’ve had a good day. It’s time to relax—

“*Human!*”

Suddenly, an arm’s wrapped around my throat, squeezing the life outta me. I punch and pull at it but the grip’s too tight. The dwarfs are attacking the rest of the elves, and in the middle of our “battle” stands a man who looks terrified. I wish he’d empty his damn pockets and get out of here, because my vision’s starting to go blurry.

“Please, stop!” he yells, holding his arms out. “This war’s gone on long enough, has it not? The time for killing is over!”

Everyone pauses, and when the dwarf’s grip loosens, I heave. We’re all glaring at the man, wondering what he could possibly mean. Humans don’t show us compassion, or care. We’ve definitely never had one of them tell us to stop fighting. Someone goes to open their mouth, but a smirk grows across the man’s face, and he takes off running, snatching our sack of gold.

“*Suckers!*” he yells. “*I’ve been following you for miles! I know all about your secret!*”

Suddenly, we’re all chasing after him, angrily shouting as we wave our swords around. Today, for the first time ever, us swindlers have been swindled, and now we have two options if we wanna protect our livelihood—we either kill this idiot, or let him join our group.

And I shudder because I *know* we’ll pick the latter.

"[WP] Elves and Dwarves have been bitter enemies since anyone can remember. Or at least that's what the humans and think. Instead it's an elaborate prank, enabled by elves and dwarves living so much longer than humans.",Peteman22,"Drevan raised a slender finger to the class. A swoop of elven hair,  blond as flax, covered his pointed ears. He seemed transfixed by something in the far distance, beyond even the ceiling that blocked his vision.

""The truce is an uneasy one, a Cold War so to speak,"" he said. ""The old prejudices abide: Elves as the fairy folk, sprightly as sunbeams, and Dwarves as the thugs, small, burly, and, yes, Earthy.""
 
Drevan considered himself an ""enlightened"" elf. He'd visited the famous Dwarf city of Urlther, marveled at an underground metropolis sculpted from rock and lit by enchanted torches that blazed eternally but never smoked. 

Drevan had shown us a photograph of himself, draped in his typical forest-green tunic, greeting a delegation of three dwarves, all arrayed in armor colored shades of ochre. 

""In fact, we are all Earth people; Earth of the forest and Earth of the soil."" Drevan paused. ""The Earth is fragile. The Earth is ... stalked."" 

Drevan gazed at us, his mild green eyes brimming. 

""Stalked. And its inhabitants, too. Live a few hundred thousand years, and you'd know.""

But we didn't know. As humans in seventh grade, we could only hope our lives might last eight more decades.

""Longevity lends perspective,"" said Drevan sadly. ""I'll see most of you buried.""

Drevan rallied.

""But... but... Earth endures. A legacy and a promise for all of us.""

Drevan's melancholy was familiar to us. He'd recount stories from his father and grandfather that took place on time scales we couldn't imagine -- asteroid impacts that drove even the elves underground, climate change that warmed the Antarctic into a lush jungle and then froze it solid again.

""At the time, it all seemed so natural to our ancestors,"" he mused.

I recall all of this now because, in my sixtieth year, my cane resting against his desk, I faced Drevan again. Of course, he hadn't aged. But the schoolgirl enthralled by Drevan's lectures looked out of a body in decline. 

""You grew up around your eyes,"" said Drevan, perplexed, never seeming to come to grips with the pace of human aging.

I visited Drevan now as the History Council's archivist. Not just history for the books, but the dark, the covert record.

""So you know now,"" he said.

Yes, I knew.

The tension, the Cold War between the elves and dwarves was a ploy. Exactly why, even I didn't understand.

""It's a balance,"" said Drevan. ""It keeps our cultures in check, thriving even.""

""Because we need you,"" I said.

""Yes. Humans need us. We need them. We protect them from ... out there."" Drevan motioned upward.

""What is it?""
 
""Out there,"" Drevan repeated. ""Its a dim unconscious memory of my people and the dwarves. Only once every few million years. Something from above, so opposed to Earth and to life. Anti-matter with intelligence.""

""And here we are, all of us, even the dead, still part of our Earth,"" I said.

""Yes,"" Drevan said wearily. ""But the cost.""

A morbid silence paralyzed our conversation. 

I couldn't stand it.

""Well, I got married, Drevan, long ago. I have a daughter who's 25 now, a few years out of uni.""

Drevan looked hard at me, like he was trying to parse out a coded message. But his face brightened with that peculiar elvish glow.

""I'd like to meet her,"" he said.",mrsam12000

[WP] All Floridians secretly have the power to channel chaos at will. You've lived in Minnesota your whole life when your Dad gives you the news: you were actually born in Florida.,Wisepuppy,"He heard the words but processing them was whole a other can of worms. Waiting for a reaction, Oliver Nilsson's father, leaned in. ""We just really didn't think it was something we needed to talk about.""  A taste of bile began to form where Oliver's esophagus met his throat. Oliver knew that all there was to vomit up was the half can of Monster Zero Ultra he had consumed an hour ago. He had skipped lunch so he would have time to drive to St. Cloud's Cloud Saint, the premier vape shop in the city that he thought he had lived his whole life in.

""I just... it's a weird thing to find out when you're thirty-one. Why tell me now?"" He forced a chuckle until his father gave him a look he had never seen before. The eyes that had seen countless Vikings games spoke something akin to ""I don't want to say it, but you know why"" Oliver was uneasy, not because he thought his life was better or worse due to his newfound origin, but because of the creeping suspicion that this was a bigger deal than it was being made out to be.

Not relishing in today's surprise, he became irritated with his father. ""You know I have a lot going on with the truck in the shop. Couldn't this have been a phone call?"" They both knew that the conversation had deeper implications than they wanted to admit. But like many sons and fathers, they left their reservations unsaid and ended their visit with a handshake that masqueraded as a hug.

Oliver stepped outside his childhood home. A chill ran through his body. ""Jesus,"" he muttered to himself, ""fucking cold."" As he got into his rental car, a thought occurred to him that he usually would mock. Maybe global warming was not as bad as they thought. Maybe scientists were just trying to get their projects funding by using scare tactics. After all, it is mid-September and he was already wearing his down jacket. He had always been affected by the cold more than the rest of his family, but this year the cold seemed to settle in his bones earlier. He dismissed these unwelcome conspiratorial thoughts as crazy but they tarried deep in his consciousness.

He focused his thoughts on finally getting his beloved truck back. It had been 9 days since a homeless person had shattered a window with the goal of finding a location to (apparently) shoot some heroin, and defecate in the backseat. The Nilsson's had kept Oliver generally sheltered and protected from much hardship, so this act of aggression was one of the worst he had suffered. Eagerly he commanded the Bluetooth ""Text Slippy. Be there in ten, you got The Punisher all ready?"" Not a minute passed before a notification of a response appeared. ""Hell yeah its already BROHAM ill see you then.""

As he pulled down Slippy's driveway, he swelled with pride. Oliver could have went to a dealership for his car repair needs. He could have paid a little more for the guarantee that everything was done by the book. But Slippy could use the business and he had always been the type of person that was hurt down deep when friends didn't ask him for help. Slippy, Oliver thought, fancied himself a friend over all other labels. And despite being generally unreliable and far more concerned with good times than good grades, if there was one thing that he excelled in, it was cars.

His self-congratulation was cut short as his temporary midsized compact careened by his truck. The window had been replaced (and he assumed the smell was gone) but there had also been some unrequested modifications. Slippy had his arms crossed and legs splayed to display his obvious self-assurance that his friend would love the custom job he had done on his beloved truck, The Punisher.

""How you like it, man? I got this all done and couldn't wait to show...""

""What the fuck is this supposed to be, Slip?!"" Oliver fumed. As he got closer to his friend and truck he noticed more and more details about what used to be his regular black Ford Explorer. The Punisher had a fresh coat of shimmering black on it, as agreed upon. Of his own volition, Slippy had placed a large white skull logo on the hood of the car. On both of the vehicle's sides read the words"" The Punisher"" with only a slightly smaller subscript of ""Slippy's Customs.""

In addition to the paint job, two floodlights had been affixed to the car's roof. This extended the height of the car to well over seven feet and its owner was awestruck by the gaudiness of it all. When he looked back at his longtime friend, the smug look had been replaced with a dejected one. Slippy's expression broke his heart because the reality was so starkly different from the expectation.

Oliver knew the kid gloves had to go back on. Briefly his anger almost reared its head again when he realized that Slippy expected him to be hoisted onto his shoulder for this homage to white-trash America. He consciously dialed back his tone and tried to express confusion but it came out even worse, as disappointment, ""You were just supposed to fix the window and have it cleaned, man.""

Slippy, composing himself, explained, ""You said I could trick it out. I thought that meant you wanted the works. We always used to dig on cars like this, remember?"" If Oliver's heart was already broken by his simple friend's reaction, it was now nearly pulverized. He could vaguely remember a time in their teen years when they looked at pictures of personalized trucks. Clearly this memory meant a lot to Slippy and it was barely an anecdote to him. Guilt washed over him and he began to walk back his comments further. ""It does look pretty dope, man,"" intentionally choosing a word the men had used as boys. 

The rest of their exchange was an awkward play of a man sparing the feelings of a friend and the friend trying to  unhurt by the initial reaction. The men parted each other's company more unhappy with their own politeness than with their friend. 

Oliver had an uncomfortable revelation as he sat in his newly acquired hillbilly hoopty. Once he was out of sight, he enjoyed his car's new height and look. He knows it was neither practical or conventionally attractive but he did ""dig it."" He wasn't mad at Slippy. He was furious at himself for liking this. Oliver had always thought of himself as a mostly classy guy and he would never go about this himself. But Oliver thought this was cool,

“The fuck you mean?” I snapped.

“Just don’t. It’s not going to end well.”

“And how would you know that?” I retorted. “You from the future?”

Silence. 

I placed my Glock onto my lap, lifted my ski mask and looked into the welled-up eyes of my best friend seated on the passenger side of my beaten-up ‘93 Camaro. I always found it funny that we both shared the same green eyes when nobody else in town I’ve met had them. Brother from another mother, he’d tell me all the time.

Ever since we met, we got along famously. Through good times and bad times, we’d stick together, coming out on top. Even though today was going to be one of them, I had a feeling that he was going to get cold feet. I strengthened my resolve.

“You don’t understand, Francis. I just got let go, I’ve got a kid on the way, I’m up to my neck in debt,” I told him. “I need this.”

“Just trust me,” he replied, in between sobs. “It’s a bad idea, someone’s going to call the cops, there’s going to be a massive shoot out, and you’re going to end up… dead.”

“The fuck you on about? You gonna call the cops on me? Aren’t we in this together?”

“I’m not gonna snitch, it’s not that –”

“What happened to all that talk about leaving this town and starting a new life far away? You and Sam; me, Nancy and the little one; neighbors on a farm in the middle of nowhere. Don’t you want that?”

“I do, but – “

“But? But shut the fuck up! You in it or you out. I don’t got time for this shit.”

I pulled my ski mask back on, readied my gun, and stepped out onto the front steps of the town’s largest bank.",georgethehuman

[WP] You have realized that your best friend is your son/daughter from the future who wants to hang out and get to know you since you die before he/she was born,_Azmodan_,"This year Rebecca &amp; I are going as the twins from the Shining. Since we first met at a college party three years ago, people have been telling us we look like sisters. Admittedly, our pin-straight auburn dreadlocks &amp; green-speckled eyes are pretty similar. Plus, like most best friends, we've taken on each other's mannerisms to the point where even my mom can't tell us apart. Just last month, while my mom was helping me move into my senior year apartment, Becca showed up. I had invited her to come take a look &amp; chat while I unpacked.

I was running boxes from the parking lot up five floors to my apartment while my mom helped unpack the items in my room. I must have missed Rebecca, because when I got to my bedroom after the third trip, there she was speaking to my mom.

""Charlotte,"" my mom said, with the slightest intonation of surprise in her voice. ""Rebecca was just telling me about her border collie, did you know she also had one named Piper?""

""Yeah, mom, I've mentioned it a few times,"" I say, putting down my stack of boxes. ""Hey, Becca"" I say, leaning in to give her a warm hug. When I stand back Becca is looking at me with what looks like tears in her eyes. Before I can ask her what's wrong, she excuses herself to the bathroom. I notice she looks back at my mom &amp; me as she exits the room.

My mom turns to me with a look of concern. ""Is she gonna be okay?"" she asks, probably noticing the glossy sheen of Becca's eyes.

""Yeah, I think she's fine,"" I murmur as I start to unpack some of the items from the box, clipping photos haphazardly to a line of twine my mom has taped to the wall. ""I think it has something to do with Piper. Whenever she talks about Piper, it reminds her of her mom..."" I lower my voice, ""and she lost her mom when she was really little, so I think it just brought up some memories.""

""Oh geez, I didn't know that..."" my mom murmurs under her breath, her face drawn into a deep frown. ""I mean... gosh, do you know how she went?"" We both eye the door as the sound of a toilet flushing &amp; a tap being opened filters into the room.

""No,"" I sigh, turning back to the pile of boxes, picking up items as I talk, ""I try not to prod into that stuff, mom - look it's really sensitive... if she doesn't bring it up, I don't ask, okay?"" I say, my voice intoning a slight cadence of annoyance.

""Alright, you're right. I just - y'know... it's just funny,"" I hear my mom say as I continue to pile a lamp, notebooks, &amp; a smattering of pens onto my desk. ""I swear when she walked in the room, it was you. I know you hate when I say this but you two look so alike - &amp; the sound of her voice..."" she trails off suddenly, as we hear the sound of the bathroom door unlock. I glance over at my mom - her eyes widen at something behind me. In a motion so quick I barely register, she pulls off a picture of Piper I had clipped to the twine, just as Becca re-enters my room.

\----------------------------

Today, Becca &amp; I are supposed to be planning our Halloween costumes. She is slumped on my couch, Googling pictures of the twins from the Shining, an idea we'd come up with together two weeks earlier. We had figured it'd be a fun way to signal to everyone ""yes, we get it! We look like fucking twins"" &amp; finally capitalize on those mirrored features. Except... today I cannot concentrate. My head is going a mile a minute, I feel a hot bloom of panic rise into my chest, &amp; I can almost feel the bile pushing at the back of my throat. I scroll mindlessly past pictures of periwinkle blue dresses on Amazon. One thought is screaming its way into the front of my mind &amp; all I want to do is blurt it out to Becca. But saying it will make it real.

Becca, too, looks deep in thought. She notices my glance &amp; quickly quips ""Hey Char, do you remember that ancestry test you took a while back?""

I'm relieved. I'm fucking relieved she's talking about something, anything, so I can get my mind off of things. ""Yeah, I do. It was pretty cool. Remember when we were looking over them together &amp; surprise, surprise, I'm mostly Irish"" I say in a light-hearted tone that perfectly conceals my frayed state of mind.

""Yeah,"" she laughs along. Another awkward silence descends. This is so unlike us - it feels like there is something rotting, thick, &amp; viscous in the air; something we both smell but don't want to acknowledge. She clears her throat, ""Yeah, well, I was curious so I decided to take the test, too. To find out who I was related to...""

I nod slowly. There's no way she's going to say -

""And we're related!"" she says a little too nervously. At first, I'm at a loss for words. I mean, I *know* we look alike, I *know* we even sound alike, I *know* we're dressing up as god-damn twins for god-damn Halloween...we aren't actually supposed to be related! But then I think about it. I mean, it kind of makes sense. How many people have red hair &amp; green eyes? It's not *that* common, of course we're going to share a distant relative - why am I over-thinking this?! It's just my nerves about-

""Charlotte?"" Becca says with a note of concern; a speck of cautiousness. I snap out of my thoughts &amp; give her a genuine grin. ""Are we actually? Oh man, my mom is gonna freak out about this! God, this is gonna make our outfits even *more* ironic. Watch one of us drunkenly blurt out, hey! we're actually second cousins over here!"" Becca stays silent.

""Yeah, I know"" she says, biting her lip , ""but the thing is... Charlotte we share 50% of our DNA.""

My brows furrow, my heart stops, my mouth drops agape. ""Rebecca... you know that's not possible. That's not funny, okay. I know we're playing off our similarities for Halloween, but seriously, do not joke about this. Especially right now.........BECCA!""

She swivels around her laptop, her ancestry report flashing back at me. It reads: ""Congratulations! You've found a DNA relative who shares 50% of your DNA. Do you want to contact relative?""

And there, where the relative name is supposed to go is my name...and my profile picture. It is one I uploaded to the site months ago. Thinking maybe I'd find a famous great-aunt or rich cousin, once removed. But not this. Floored, I look from Becca to the screen and back. There are no words for this type of internal implosion. She is biting her lip, &amp; all I want to do is scream ""NO! Becca you cannot be my lost sister. NOT when I need you the most! You can't just pile this shit on me!""

Does this mean Becca is my twin? Or an Irish twin (God, I swear, if it's this, fate has some fucking irony)? Did my parents give up my twin, my sister &amp; never tell me? I think back to her reaction seeing my mother a month ago. Did she know at that time? That the woman she was looking at was her mother? It all fits. God, I've been so stupid. My mother's reaction, Becca's sudden departure in tears. Did my mother recognize her daughter in Becca's face? But, I've known Becca for three y-. And then it dawns on me.

""You,"" my voice is quavering as a stream of tears tumble. ""Did you know all along? Did you know we were SISTERS all this time?! Is that why you approached me three years ago? Were you stalking me, trying to get close to me this whole time? To get close to **my** parents?"" I am out of my depth, my words are coated with confusion &amp; hurt.

Becca looks taken aback, stunned. Why is she sitting there silently? Wouldn't she be vehemently denying these accusations if they weren't true? This confirms my worst suspicions: she has known this whole time.

""Char, we're 50% related but... Charlotte, please just scroll down on the page, okay. I'm sorry if this is coming out suddenly; I know I've blind-sided you but there's something I need you to kn -""

I push the computer back at her. ""NO Becca, there's something I need you to know, okay. I can't take this right now, not right now. It's just -""

Without a word, she holds out her screen - the screen that has changed my entire life as quickly &amp; thoughtlessly as the pregnancy stick I had taken hours earlier. She has scrolled the screen down to another portion of text, now with similar fragments of our chromosomes highlighted.

It reads: ""Congratulations, your DNA relative CHARLOTTE HAWTHORNE shares 50% of your DNA. Based on your genes, we predict she is your MOTHER.""

No. No No No. What the fuck does this mean? It's some error on their part - a simple mix-up of saliva. It has to be. This is absolutely fucking ludicrous. And then she utters words that make no sense, a fact she could not know: ""Charlotte, I love you &amp; getting to know you has been the best part of my life... But I know you found out you're pregnant today &amp; you don't want the baby...Mom, I'm here to make sure you have me. Under any conditions necessary.""",honeyandthorns

“Mary how long have we known each other?” Marcus asks swallowing deeply. Slight facial movements betray’s a thin veil of uneasiness.

“About 30 years?” Marcus askes, his eyes looking in empty space behind Mary . As if recalling those years before returning his eyes to her sitting at the opposite side of the kitchen table.

Mary recognizes these questions. Her emotions begin to swell as she holds back tears as she has done so many times before.

“Yes. 30 years, 6 days and 4 months. Exactly.”

Marcus focuses his eyes on Mary and swallow deeply. He soaks in what he had heard for a good second before responding with a soft chuckle of amazement.

“You’ve always kept such a good account of our relationship together. How do you do it?” Marcus’s somber expression was cracked with a smile as if a ray of sunlight breaking through cumulous clouds.

Mary doesn’t reply for a time feeling a deep warm compassion for Marcus. She faintly smiles while holding back tears preparing for the inevitable delivery of bad news. In trepidation she raises her left elbow from the table, clenches her left hand and places the side of her index finger curved upward over her thumb against her quivering upper lip. She gazes into Marcus’s eyes deeply fixating on his words and movements as everything slowed down for her.

“I don’t know” she replies her knuckle trembling against her upper lip. Another moment passes. She fights back her urge to tell him how much she loves him, who he is to her, why she has the time memorized, but she holds back afraid she may scare him.

“I really care for and love the time we spend together.”

Marcus reaches out with his warm hands and cups Marys’s hand over the table. He slides his chair over the tile beside her. 

“I always valued your time, our time together. Our cherished friendship has to me, my heart, been as dear to me as the love I have for my wife and daughter. I have always considered you a member of my family. As a sister and despite our ten year difference, I can even see you as daughter. I always felt like I had two daughters when I saw you playing with Ashley. I don’t know why, I probably never will. Maybe its because you two look so similar, maybe its because you have a young face or maybe even, its that you two have similar personalities and interests. The love I have for you and our relationship is and has only been indefinable to me and my family, our family if would allow me to say that.”

Mary fighting as hard she could to fight back tears, released a few that slid down onto the knuckle of her index finger beading like dew drops on a petal before dripping down to her inward curling upper lip.

Marcus’s eyes look away from Mary as they begin to well up and after a deep sigh continues.

“I. I have cancer.” 

Mary’s heart sank into her chest as she watches tears fall from Marcus’s closed eyes.

Mary cups Marcus’s cheek and turns his face to face her, then rests her hand over his wrist. She continues to listen as tears lace down her cheeks as if a river breaking through an dam .

“I had headaches this month, as you know, worst then usual. I was taking Ibuprofen and other medications and at first I was feeling better. But last week I started getting dizzy and having nose bleeds. So I went to he hospital.” Marcus’ gulps deeply taking short breathes as he fights back tears.

“The doctors ran me through a series of tests and the found a tumor the size of an orange in my brain. They told me I have..”

Mary interrupts and with her teary eyes looking down to floor beside the table finishes Marcus’s sentence.

“1 month to live”.

Marcus freezes at Mary’s reply. 

“Yes…How did you know?”  squeezing her hand tighter in his hands.

Mary stays silent, sniffling and bawling.

Marcus reaches for a napkin with one hand and still holding her hand with the other dabs her tears and nose.

“Mary, had did you know?” he sincerely repeats the question.

Mary turns her head away from his caring hands and looks at the clock hanging beside the refrigerator.

“1 month 6 days and 1 hour from now.” She states completely losing herself in tears.

Marcus lets go of Mary’s hands and sits back in his chair, loosing a breath in the process.

“What. What are you talking about Mary? I..”

“I’m sorry. I’m so so Sorry. I can’t I just can’t any more”. Mary’s make up now a complete mess as tears freely flow like years of repression being freed.

“Can’t What?” 

“I thought I could handle it, Im so sorry Marcus” Mary stands up and wipes her tears from her face and looks down at Marcus still sitting down.

“Mary, please, Im sorry”.

“No its not that, I mean it is. It’ s just, look. You need to know something about me. Your name may be Marcus but your not just Marcus to me and I’m not Mary, I mean I am but I am not.:” Mary pauses. 

” I’m Ashely. I’m your daughter”.

There was thick and awful, timeless silence that followed.

Marcus stood up and shook his head in confusion.

“What are you talking about Mary. Please, please sit down.”

“Your not just Marcus to me. Your my Dad!” Mary refuses strongly.

“Mary your not making any sense.”

“Im not Mary, aske me anything about US! Us being together, I can answer anything to prove to you I am not Mary. I am Ashley.”

“This doesn’t make any sense Mar..”

“Im not Mary.”

Marcus stares into her eyes in disbelief at what she is saying. 

“Ask me anything. Please!” 

“Of course you will know the answer to my questions if we have don’t things together before.”

“No, please ask me a question about you and your daughter Ashley. Something that you two have done together, that I wouldn’t know. Please… Please…” she begs looking up at Marcus holding his hands tightly.

Marcus hesitates and then begins to deeply think .

Shaking his head confusedly he replies to calm is friend.

“okay, what did I say to you, Ashely before putting her to slee..”

“You always kiss me on my forehead, call me your little slice of heaven and then you would tuck me in.”

Marcus froze eyes locked onto his friend who eyes were penetrating.

“When you were 9, I told your mom we went fishing because. “

Ashely closes her eyes and takes a deep breath and passionately finishes Marcus’s question before he could finish. “ Mom was mad at me for spilling her perfume and mad at you for not taking it seriously, so you told her we went fishing to have a talk with me. But we didn’t go fishing we went to eat Ice Cream at Jerries. I got a caramel apple flavor ice cream and you ordered a hot chocolate. It was summer and 80 degree’s outside. I remembered how I couldn’t believe you would drink something so hot in 80 degree weather. I even remember calling you Lava Man because of it.”

Marcus props himself against the counter and mulls over what is best friend said in silence.

Ashely continues to explain in as much detail as she can everything that she and Marcus have done together focusing on the experiences that they only shared together.

Marcus after some time and in futility asks “Please stop Mary, or whoever you are. This is either a cruel joke or..”",SADAME_AME

[WP] You have realized that your best friend is your son/daughter from the future who wants to hang out and get to know you since you die before he/she was born,_Azmodan_,"She looked at me with those brilliant blue eyes, she was surprised, she was shocked even. We'd been roommates for 4 years, she studied physics, I studied medicine. She had answered my ad for a roommate immediately, we'd been friends since day one. She was biting her lip, just like Jessica does when she's stressed. It's a cute gesture really, it makes them both look so, so much cuter in the moment. Her eyes dart between me and the diary in my hands. On the table are stacks of them, those are all mine, they're all numbered, 1 through 16 so far. 16 is open on the table, showing there are still many pages left. The one I am holding is marked on the back 25. 

""I can expla-"" She starts but I shake my head ""You don't need to, you don't need to say anything"" I say with a soft smile as I put the book down, rising from the couch, putting it down ""I told myself you see... The last 5 months of entries in that, they're written with a cipher I came up with as a teen, it's why they're gibberish angsty poetry, despite being what, 34 when it ends?"" She nods softly, she can't keep her eyes on me, I can see she's struggling against the tears ""You came to me, in that time too, I wrote the diary to tell myself all I had to tell you, all we had to experience while you were here... all I wanted you to know, and all I would ever want to do with you"" I say to her. 

She sniffles ""It just isn't fair..."" she says, her voice cracking as she starts wiping furiously at her eyes ""It's not fair at all! a month! a month after you die, they find a cure, a month... and I could... I could"" I smile, putting my hand on her head and pull her in against me. She cries and cries, I move us over to the couch and she keeps crying as I hold her. I just smile, as I stroke my own daughter's hair, the daughter I will never know, the daughter disease will prevent me from loving as she grows up. A daughter who cannot tell me how to fix it, a daughter who cannot bring the cure back, a daughter who knows, that has, over the past 4 years, found out for herself why all her uncles and aunts and all her grandparents talked so fondly of me as she grew up. 

I smile softly down at her and kiss the top of her head as my fingers run through those raven locks. She looks up at me and I smile down at her. She wipes her eyes and nose as I lean my forehead against hers and whisper ""Honey, know that your father have, and will always love you. Know, that as my friend, you shaped who I become, and that I cannot be prouder of you. You, are all I could ever want in a daughter. And though you will never know the benefit of it, I will try to work it out for myself. The symptoms described in the diary, and what you've told me of your dad... of my death before, before I realized... I will find a cure, I will make it my life's work, so that I can be there, for my little girl, so she will not cry in sadness, so she will not feel weird, so that your mother will not despair, and so that I can one day see you grow into who you are"" I say to her with a bright smile. She cries again, unable to speak as I just hold her, stroking her hair gently. The open diary on the table reads ""October 31st, 2026. Tomorrow is the day"" 






November 21st. 2026

I held her in my arms today, I was finally strong enough. She looks so much like Jessica... She's here too, watching herself... She never left. Jessica knows too, she has for a while. She loves them both just as much as I do. She suggests a new name for herself. Joy. 
Aunty Hope takes Joy in her arms and cries as she looks down at her, knowing she will know a future where she's loved by both her parents, and by herself. A future filled with Joy. ",Leo_Danica

I hesitated when I heard what he was saying. Does he honestly think I’ll believe what he’s saying? We’ve been friends for the past two years and he has invited me to stuff that I might otherwise never have even thought about going to. I’ve met so many cool people through him. Shit. I met my current girlfriend through him last year. And now I’m supposed to believe that he’s my son? That’s a good one! This asshole really just gave me a video tape for my birthday? 

I can’t be mad though. He’s highlighted every single thing we’ve ever done together. Literally. 

Every. 
Fucking. 
Single. 
Thing. 

I started to tear up when he was talking about us fishing and just doing normal shit because I could see on his face it really meant a lot to him. He started getting red in the face and his eyes started to gloss over and choke on his words when he said that I was the best friend he’s ever had. 

I took my phone out to thank him for sending the tape and to ask where he was. The fucking party was goin to start soon and I haven’t heard from his ass in two weeks. He didn’t even send me this tape. His roommate is here helping is finish up the final touches on the party and said there was a note left in the kitchen asking him to give it to me for my birthday. Trying to pay attention to his heartfelt message he was telling me while typing out how much of an asshole he was that he wasn’t there and pushed send. 

I just stared at the screen watching him detail things that meant so much to him when he took out a picture that floored me. I couldn’t explain it and I don’t think I ever will. The picture was of me but it wasn’t. I had a different hairstyle than I have ever worn. I was standing next to my girlfriend but at a place that we’ve never been. Then he continued after gathering himself emotionally. He said that the picture is a picture of my girlfriend and I what would’ve been last month on her birthday but not in our current time. Then showed me another picture of her with a baby but I wasn’t in the picture. I could clearly see the time stamp at the bottom of the picture which was dated a year from today. 

He lowered the picture and said that I was supposed to die two weeks after her birthday in a car accident. Stated the time of day and everything. He then confessed that he knew this and that’s why he invited me and her out to dinner before he left for his business trip that was only supposed to be for the weekend. 

I knew this was a joke but at this point I didn’t care. This dude has made me start busting out crying like a little baby. Luckily, I was in my bedroom while everyone else was busy getting stuff ready. I smiled and laughed and said that bastard better show up soon. I couldn’t believe that he was able to photoshop the pictures so well and got my girlfriend to be in on the joke. I was getting ready to get up and tell her that present was so cool when he said I love you dad and faded away. 

I was dumbfounded that my buddy didn’t tell me that he was proficient in video editing and sat back down waiting for the video to end but it didn’t. My girlfriend walked in and said that the party was ready and asked if I was ok because I looked like I had been crying. I told her I was ok and asked her about the tape and she said she didn’t have any clue but wanted to hurry up because she wanted to give me my present. 

We entered the kitchen area with all of my friends and family all around. She grabbed her gift and asked me to open it first. I looked at her with an ‘awe shucks’ expression on my face which got a great reaction from everyone. I removed the wrapping and opened the small box that I thought was going to have a bracelet or something inside but was faced with a pregnancy test with two lines on it. I stood there in shock with my mouth hanging wide not sure if this was still an elaborate prank but when I looked at my girlfriend she had tears in her eyes and was nodding her head to signal that yes it was real and we were going to be parents. Everyone started clapping and yelling and we hugged. She asked is there anything you want to say to your baby?

I got down on my knees and kissed her stomach and whispered.

“or it’s real” Ashley finishes in an elevated voice, wiping her eyes.

Why do you think I know everything about you, about us? Why do you think I know all the dates. You even said I remind of your daughter..

“Yea but..” Marcus tries to interject but Ashley was forthright and committed to being heard.

“You always said your daughter and I looked a lot alike..”

“No your..” Mary wouldn’t let Marcus speak.

“You always said our personalities were the same, same taste in music, same taste in food, same triggers. Think about it I know everything about her, we are very similar because I am her and she is me and that means are not just Marcus to me..”

“Mary,” 

Ashley grabs Marcus by the hand and pull it to her heart just as he used to put her hand on his heart whenever she was feeling alone “ You are my dad”.

Marcus shakes his head but doesn’t reply and stares long and hard into Mary’s eyes as he feels her heart beating in his palms.

“Ashley always cuts me off.”  Marcus says quietly to himself as he stairs at Ashley holding his hand to her heart.

As Marcus stares into her eyes, he traces over the frame of her body taking in everything that she said. Slowly her image begins to take the shape of his adolescent daughter image. Eventually he beings to see his young Ashley’s appearance fuse into the women standing in front him. As she is holding his hand to heart he starts to recognize his daughter.

“Ashley….is it really you?”

Setting his hand down and giving him a hug.

“Yes, Dad.”

“How?”

Marcus tentatively puts his arms around Ashley.

“It’s going to sound crazy.”

Ashley buries her head into her father’s chest and shuts her eyes knowing that what she wills say will sound crazy.

“Time travel:”

“What?” Marcus replies incredulously 

“I’m sorry Ashley, I need to sit down. This is to much.”

Ashely get her father a cold glass of water and places the cup on the table and sits beside her father.

“ I came back in time to meet you. I never met you growing up. You died before I was born. The same way you are… ” she paused to find the right words to say.

“What do you mean by I never met you? I have raised you. You said it yourself.”

“ Dad. Only in this timeline.”

“What? What do you mean only in this time line? How is this possible, any of it, how?”

“If you met me in this time line, and you weren’t raised by me in your time line, then how do you know about how I treated Ashely in this time line when you are only ten years younger than me now.”

“Because I have traveled back in time 6 times attempting to save you. Every time I have failed and I keep going back. Every time, I went back a little further to eventually when you were in your 30’s just before you were to have me and each time I gave you a different medicine I brought with me to cure your cancer. However for some reason none of them worked and you eventually died in each time before I was born. All timelines except this one and the one before.  The memories I developed as child just materialized into my future self although I hadn’t personally experienced them in my own personal timeline. I wanted to meet you initially so I travelled back in time for that reason. But as time went on I wanted to save you also. But even now I realize that this can’t be done by travelling back in time no matter what changes. So that’s why this time I want to take you with me, into the future. They have the technology there to remove the tumor permanently.”

Marcus listens attentively and takes a moment to respond.

“So this is how you know the day I die.”

“Yes…”

“Where you there.”

“I never left your side.”

“Okay, so what happens if I go to the future. What about your mom and my daught.. I mean the younger you?”

Ashley thinks over the questions not knowing the answer to the question.

“I’m not sure. But it’s a risk that I am willing to take.”

“But, that risk could be catastrophic no? People lives, will be forever altered if I not only continue to survive but am taken into the future right?”

“Possibly.”

“I don’t think I can do that, especially if it could hurt other people.”

Ashley and her father continue to talk about the possibilities of time travel and the ramifications on reality if Marcus were to be kept alive and taken into the future. The conversation continued for days. Marcus and Ashley together broke the news to the rest of the family who while initially didn’t believe the story or accept that Marcus had cancer gradually began to believe.

As Marcus became more sick Ashley’s mother on the thought of losing her her husband and both of her daughters father decided to convince Marcus to seriously consider taking them as a family to the future so they can be together. But Marcus was reluctant as he didn’t want to cause damage to the future, his future family or any one else. As the days went on Marcus health began to worsen to the point where he was bed ridden and frail. Ashley never left his side.

As the final days drew near, Ashley was preparing herself emotionally to watch her father die again. Everyday she told him that she loved him and would kiss him on the forehead, telling him that he’s her little slice of heaven and tuck him in to the medical sheets. While in the hospital she would try to make him as comfortable as possible.

On the final night, Marcus started to weep inconsolably in front of his family. 

“Please, I don’t want to die, I want to know you as my daughter, I want to be with my family.” Marcus whispered as his akg slowly and semi rhythmically beeped.

“We can sneak you out, and take you into the future.” Ashleys’ mother nodded nervously.

“It’s too late, Ashley. It’s too late.” Marcus whispered, as a tear squeezed out of the corner of his eye.

“Dad, hang on we will get you out of here.”

:Ashley quickly coordinated a plan for her mother to distract the nurses on duty while she would grab a wheel chair and take her father downstairs into the car, to the time machine and into the future.

3 hours went by and the plan was carried out with out a hitch. The cops where looking for Ashley and her mother but they couldn’t be worried about that now. The time machine fitted everyone comfortably. Everyone including Ashley was nervous about going into the future, and what may be waiting for the on the other side. But she didn’t have time to think about it. Her father had less then 24 hours to live and her only hope of saving him to keep her family together was to take him into the future.

Switches were pressed, the engine roared and the time machine began to vibrate as time around them began to speed up at first, then blur into a mix of pastel colors and finally a large bright light of electrons obscured their vision until the rattling stopped and the doors opened reveling the inner dwellings of a large government controlled facility. Paramedics immediately sweep the time machine removing Ashley’s father immediately and taking him to a hospital as government officials enter the time machine.

Ashley’s mother and her younger self are eventually taken to the hospital where Marcus was having his operation. The family unsure of their future stand over Marcus lying on the bed post operation holding his hands and watching his akg slowly beeping to his shallow breathing as the clock reaches reaches 24 hours.",SADAME_AME

[WP] You have realized that your best friend is your son/daughter from the future who wants to hang out and get to know you since you die before he/she was born,_Azmodan_,"2 days to live. Those words had constantly repeated in Gavin's head as he laid weak in his hospital bed. 2 days to live. His head constantly hurt now. He remembered when he thought all he needed was an aspirin for what he thought was just a simple headache.

A thunderstorm was raging outside his window, a white flash projecting through every couple of minutes followed by roaring thunder. It began when he the doctor told him his devastating news yesterday. 1 day left Gavin thought to himself. I just needed a bit more time.

Gavin's wife elsewhere in the hospital, going into labor with their first and now only child. He hoped to at least see his newborn before he checked out yet he felt he knew, he would just miss out. 

Fred, Gavin's best friend, came through the door, holding a few small objects in his hand. He knew well what was going to happen and had thought hard about coming to Gavin. But he decided, Gavin needed to know.

""Hey buddy"" said Fred, distracting Gavin from his own thoughts. Gavin slowly turned his head to look at Fred.

""Hey"" Gavin replied almost breathless, ""Any news?""

""Not yet"" Fred replied back. Not just yet. ""Listen I have to tell you-""

""You're a Lakers fan""

""Ha, not that drastic"" chuckled Fred, bringing a smile to Gavin before Fred continued, ""There's a few things I should tell you and it's going to be hard to believe""

""Then hurry it up. I don't have long"" 

""Okay, um... Fred's not my name and I'm your son""
 
""Don't bullshit me Fred"" said Gavin, feeling slightly angered by what he thought was a joke.

""I know it sounds like that so I brought these"" Fred said bringing the objects towards Gavin's head. He showed him a picture of Gavin's wife holding a newborn baby in her arms, another picture of a small boy in a sports jersey, a third picture of a tombstone with Gavin's full name and today's date, and finally a small, aged foam ball with Gavin's handwriting saying 'Daddy's little athlete'.

Gavin looked back and forward at the objects and Fred, unable to comprehend the craziness in front of him. That ball was definitely his but there's no way it could possibly be from the future. It's not possible. It couldn't be. Yet he knew his best friend well enough to know he wasn't lying. All the beers, sports matches and car rides, he had been with his son.

Tears began to well up in both their eyes as father and son looked to each other for the last time. 

""I-I have so many questions"" Gavin stammered as tears rolled down his face 

""Choose carefully, you don't have long"" Fred said quickly as his own tears started rolling down his.

Gavin pointed his eyes to the door and then back to Fred ""When?"" he asked

""2 hours""

""What was fake about us?""

""Just my name"" replied Fred choking ""Everything you know of me us real""

""What's your real name?"" choked Gavin. A short pause ensued before Fred finally replied 

""Gavin. Mum called me Gavin""

Gavin gave a big smile, one he hadn't made since he found out his wife was pregnant. He felt a pull on his conciousness that told him that time was up. Gavin gave his last words, ""I love you... Son""

""I love you too... Dad."" Replied Fred, saying goodbye to his bestfriend and father.

Gavin died a happy man

I laid in the hospital bed, staring into my new born baby's eyes with wonder, amazement and joy. The labor had been difficult but it was finally over and I held my baby in my arms. But then I was overcome with an intense feeling of sadness, maybe it was all the hormones, but I was now terribly distraught that my best friend Abigail wasn't at the hospital with me to meet my baby girl. I begged her to come, but she said she was going away for her birthday and it was too late to change anything, but she would see me soon. Looking into my baby's eyes, at her beautiful face, I suddenly understood why she couldn't be there. And then I thought about our friendship and the day we met.

&amp;#x200B;

It all felt so serendipitous. I had just finished writing up my proposal for a big sales meeting, at my favorite coffee shop. When I looked at the time I realized I would be late if I didn't leave immediately. I shoved my laptop in my bag and ran towards the door. I hadn't seen her standing there, and we slammed into each other, spilling her coffee all over my clean white shirt.

&amp;#x200B;

""Oh my god! I'm so, so sorry"" she exclaimed.

""No, it was my fault for being in such a rush."" I looked down at my shirt now soaked in coffee.""Oh, no. I can't wear this to the sales meeting. Shit, I better call my boss and have him start without me."" I said in defeat.

""Wait, I think we might wear the same size, I have an extra blouse in my car. You can change really quick and I'll take your shirt to the dry cleaners. It's the least I can do."" she said with a smile.

""Are you sure? I don't want to cause you any trouble, really it was my fault.""

""It's no trouble, I'll meet you in the ladies room with the shirt and you can be on your way to your meeting.""

I went to ladies room and took off the stained shirt, she came in a moment later with frilly red blouse and suit jacket. They both fit perfectly, which I thought was a bit odd because she was clearly a couple sizes smaller than me. 

""I wasn't sure if you would want the jacket, but with how frazzled you were I assumed it's an important meeting so you should dress to impress."" She picked up my shirt from the sink. ""I'll have this one cleaned and we can meet latter to swap. My name's Abigail by the way.""

&amp;#x200B;

I agreed and we exchanged numbers. I rushed off to my meeting, careful not to run into anyone else on my way out of the coffee shop. I arrived on time and my proposal was a huge success. I looked forward to seeing Abigail later that evening to thank her for saving my ass and tell her about all the compliments I got from her outfit.

&amp;#x200B;

We talked for hours that night. We had so much in common and we quickly became best friends and were nearly inseparable for the next two years. She always seemed so interested in me and asked a lot of questions. Not just how my day was, but questions about where I had grown up, what my childhood was like, what my long term life goals would be. It was nice, to finally have a friend who showed genuine interest in me. So many of my friends only ever wanted to complain about their problems and ask for advice. But Abigail rarely ever talked about herself, often times she seemed to avoided questions about her life when I asked, changing the subject or giving vague answers. 

&amp;#x200B;

The day I found out I was pregnant, I couldn't wait to share the news with her.

&amp;#x200B;

""I have exciting news and I wanted you to be the first to know. I'm pregnant!"" I squealed. We hugged and she squeezed me really tight. When I pulled back I could see tears in her eyes. ""What's the matter? I thought you would be as excited as I am.""

""I am, I'm so very happy for you. I just... well, I thought we would have more time."" she said, trying to smile.

""What are you talking about, time for what? Sure things will change and I'll be busy but I'm expecting you to be auntie Abigail to this baby, don't you want that?"" I asked, confused and worried.

""I...I'm sorry, I don't know what I'm saying. I guess the thought of you having a baby just reminded me of... Mom... never mind, I'm so glad to see you this happy."" 

I realized that I had never heard her talk about her family and now I had so many questions. ""You've never talked about your mom before Abigail, did something happen, please tell me."" I pleaded.

""I really shouldn't talk about it, it wouldn't be fair to you.""

""Fair? Please tell me, you know you can tell me anything, I'm your best friend Abigail.""

""My mom, she died shortly after I was born. I really can't share the details with you, all I ever knew about her were stories. But I feel like I know everything about her now. She was an amazing person and I think she would be proud to see the woman I grew up to be."" She said, holding back tears.

""Of course she would be proud of you. You're my favorite person in the whole world, and that should count for something."" 

""Thank you. It means so much to hear you say that, I love you.""

We hugged again and then she left. She became more distant over the next nine months. I only saw her a few more times after that day. I felt like I had done something wrong, that I had somehow offended her by getting pregnant.

&amp;#x200B;

My husband's voice suddenly brought me back to reality. ""She's beautiful, isn't she?"" he said, stroking her tiny head. ""Have you decided what we're going to name her?

I looked up at him with tears in my eyes. ""Her name is Abigail.""",AngreBeaver

[WP] You have realized that your best friend is your son/daughter from the future who wants to hang out and get to know you since you die before he/she was born,_Azmodan_,"Me and Mike were sitting next to each other on a bench talking about the latest Bears game. ""Nah, nah, there was no way that was a rule break. He obviously didn't mean to fall on the dude, even if it did look like he body slammed him."" He always seemed so convinced when he argued about something, from whether global warming is real to whether or not it's acceptable to put ketchup on a hotdog. It honestly reminded me of myself in a way. Probably why we got along so well. Suddenly, my wife appeared behind me and yelled ""Boo!"" and promptly scared the crap out of me and I fell off the bench and on my ass. ""Man, I had such a hard time keeping a straight face!"" Mike said, laughing at me. I glared at him as a little shape pounced on me and yelled ""Boo!"" I decided to play along and act like my son Joey had scared me. ""Augh! A ghost! I'm so scared!"" I said, barely concealing a laugh. ""I'm not a ghost daddy!"" He responded, surprisingly coherent for a 2- year old. I just laughed, picked him up, and tickled him through his jacket. Eventually I stopped my assault of tickles and put him on the ground, when something caught my eye. Up the hill from us some men were cutting down the remains of a tree that had been partially felled by a storm. Apparently, they must not have secured all the logs correctly, because one was barreling towards us at an alarming rate. ""Run!"" I yelled. Me and my wife managed to dodge the log, but Joey didn't, and I heard a sickening crack as he was knocked off his feet and fell down the rest of the hill. I also saw that Mike had managed to dodge the log, but that didn't stop him from falling down the hill too. Eventually he managed find some footing, and he managed to grab Joey too. As he picked him up, I noticed a scar on his leg that I'd never seen before, though that made sense, since Mike disliked wearing shorts.

While we were in the car driving Joey to the hospital, I noticed the wound on his leg was the exact same shape as the scar on Mike's leg, and in damn near the same place too. While my wife was talking to the doctors about what happened, Mike and I were waiting in a nearby kitchen/eatery. ""So,"" I said, breaking the awkward silence. ""How'd you do it?"" He stared at me weirdly. ""Um, I'm sorry?"" I could tell there was a hint of fear in his voice. ""You know what I'm talking about, Joseph Michael Morgan. So, is it based off my research? Or is it some sort of reverse-Alcubierre drive or something?"" The look on his face was practically the same as he had on when me and my wife told him she was pregnant. ""It's based off your work. All I did was take the more basic aspects of it, add a few negative variables and there. The ability to send something into the past.""

""Instead of taking something from the future."" I said.

""Yes. Instead of taking something from the future. God that sounds so stupid."" He said. ""Not unless you put some thought into it. It's all about the perspective of the item being moved in relation to the time it's being moved to."" We said the last sentence in unison. I smiled at him. ""I'm proud Joe. You've already become an amazing man, and you're only my age. I don't care about that the future government messed with your head. I don't care that you bat for both teams. You're smart, you're intelligent and you have a good heart. It's a shame."" I said. ""What? What's a shame?"" He looked at me, because he knew what I was going to say next. ""Let me guess. You came to this time period because I wasn't able to be there, because some act of God took me away. I know, that's exactly the sort of thing I would do."" Tears formed in his eyes at that. ""It all goes wrong because of that fucking time machine!"" He yelled. I looked at him and knew. I knew something I brought from the future would kill me. Whether it was a super virus or a Terminator, something from the future would do me in. Suddenly, my phone buzzed in my pocket. My boss wanted my to come in early, get ready for the first test.. ""Tell your mother I love her."" I told him getting up. ""Dad. Please."" He looked at me, pleading with me with his eyes. ""Joe. You know the first law of time travel.""""Heh. The past cannot be changed. Anything one does shall be undone and the future shall return to normal. I know, your own words."" It was becoming harder and harder to ignore the want to stay and talk with him, to hold my boy. ""And besides, what if you do stop me from dying? You'd never come back to stop me from dying, which means I would die, which means you would come back and save me, which means I would never die, which means... ugh, I hate paradoxes."" I said, walking away. I stopped at the door and looked back at him. ""I love you son.""

""I love you too dad.""

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I didn't bother barricading my door when the thing we brought started slaughtering us. I knew this was it, I could feel it. I was looking at the photo we had taken. Me, my wife, Joe, and well, Joe, when I heard the *crack* of the door breaking. I looked at my killer and I saw *him*. I only said one thing as I felt the knife pierce my skin.

""How did you know that was Kat's favorite food?"" 

""Well, I--wait, really? Oh, I didn't know.""

""Yep, cooked just the way she liked it. Have you met her before?""

""No, not that I know of.""

""I see.""

There was silence as they stared into the city below.

""Hey, I never did get to thank you for taking me to the park the other day.""

""You deserve it, you've been a good girl, after all.""

""E-excuse me? What did you say?""

""Nothing.""

""Do you know?""

""Know what?""

""Nothing.""

Kate shuffled her feet as she looked down on her shoes, nervousness evident in her eyes. Dave studied her carefully and put a hand on her shoulder, his face a mixture of concern and anticipation.

""What's wrong?""

""No, it's nothing. Just...thinking about home.""

""Your mom?""

""Yeah.""

""You never really talked about home before. I know your mom is nice and your dad died before you were born, but what else?""

""There's nothing to really talk about. My mom worked at a...desk job for...New York city and I had a normal childhood. My grandparents lived in Alaska so I never saw them much.""

""How did you spend your kids days? Was your mom good to you?""

""She was, I couldn't ask for a better one. She raised me alone. We never had a lot of money, but it's not like we were poor. I also had a lot of friends. I wonder how they are now?""

""Why don't you call them?""

""I can't.""

""Why not?""

""Um, they don't want to be called at this hour. I'll call them later.""

""Okay.""

Another silence drapes over them. Kate took out a cigarette from her pocket and offered it to Dave, who refused. Shrugging, Kate lit it and breathed deeply.

""Was you mom also a cigarette smoker?""

""She was, after I left the house. Said it was for the stress of her job.""

""Funny, that was also Kat's reason for smoking--""

**cough!**

""When I found out she'd been smoking when I'm not around.""

Kate looked at him with wide eyes, but Dave just smiled and patted her head. Putting his hands in his pockets, he walked back to the rooftop door.

""Wait!""

Dave stopped to look back at her.

""Um, well, you see...""

[WP] You have realized that your best friend is your son/daughter from the future who wants to hang out and get to know you since you die before he/she was born,_Azmodan_,"Waking up from a blissful sleep, I look over to my phone. It's a shame that's the first thing on anyone's mind these days. I should be questioning why my pregnant wife is out of bed so early. She usually sleeps longer. As I look at my phone, I notice there's a text from my buddy Jack. Jack and I have been friends for a little over a year, but he's the best friend I ever had. I ignore the text for now. It's too early and the sun beaming on my face makes me want to draw the shades. I've never been one to let a lot of sunlight into the house. My wife loves the sunshine. She's my complete opposite. What can I say; opposites attract. I go to find my wife, Jenna and when I locate her, I'm stunned. She's so beautiful. Caramel skin, hazel eyes that are soul piercing, with a smile that lights up any room. She's sitting at the table reading the newspaper. She prefers to read the hard copy rather than googling the news. Making my way over to her, I do a goofy walk, limping pimp style, giving her a good morning laugh. She shakes her head at me, as if to say, ""what am I going to do with you?"" After kissing her forehead, I ask if she's hungry. She shakes her head no, stating she's not hungry just yet. ""How are you feeling?"", I ask. She responds, ""I'm ready to have this baby!"" ""I know sweetheart. I'm so ready to be a dad"", I say with a big smile. ""I'm going to teach him all the things my dad didn't teach me. I can introduce him to sports, take him to the park, teach him shaving, driving, how to treat women. I want to be any and everything I can be for this kid. Jenna responds, ""I know. You're going to be an incredible dad. I can't wait to begin the next chapter of our lives. He's going to be our little blessing."" We both delighted in the thought. 

As we smile and wonder about our future, my mind wanders back to my own childhood. There was dad in my life. Not even a male role model. It was tough for me, especially as a teenager. I was angry all the time. My home life was a poor one. My mom provided as much as a teenage mom could give. My brother and I didn't own the best clothes, or go on vacations. We got by and I hate my dad and his family for leaving us destitute. But despite the odds, I was able to persevere. College was no cake walk, but I finished with a degree in psychology. Subsequent to completion of my psychology degree, I earn a doctorate degree in clinical psychology. I was driven to help those who suffer mentally. My philosophy is if the mind is hurt, the body follows closely. Through drive and grit, I have built a lucrative business. I have my own practice and employee a few clinical psychologists and psychiatrists. One would say I am a success. In my own opinion, I am not a successful nor complete until I'm a good dad. 

I eventually break from my thought process and realize I was looking at my phone earlier. Jack texted me. I head back upstairs and open my phone. I read the text which states, ""What's up man? You down to play ball today?"" My natural response is, ""hell yea I'm down to play ball! What time?"" I set my phone down to let my wife know I'll probably head to the park to play ball with Jack. She understands, knowing that it's our Saturday ritual, ever since we met. I saw him shooting around at the same park we go to every Saturday to play ball. I decided to challenge him. After a very hard played game, we both burst out laughing because the skills we possessed in basketball were equally terrible, and our style of play was so similar. In fact, we had a lot of similarities. The day we met, I had the strongest feeling we met before. That's why we were the best of friends. We were so similar in our likes and dislikes, but not in the creepy way which would send me running to the hills. I start to change my clothes knowing we'll probably meet at our usually time, 10:00am. Sure enough when I pick up my phone, he says let's meet at 10. I start stretching, because I'm getting old and my body isn't what it used to be. At 18, I could just start playing basketball, but at 32, I had to stretch and warm up. I head down to my wife who is still at the table reading. I kiss her firmly, tell her I love her, and tell her I'll see her a few hours. I stop at the door to take one last look at her and say, ""I'm the luckiest man in the world."" She blushes and responds with, ""ditto, except the man part."" I laugh and head out the door. 

When I arrive, Jack is already shooting around. I drop my bag and grab my ball and begin shooting with him. We exchange pleasantries and do our usual shooting the breeze before things get serious. Despite our skills lacking, we both are very competitive. The game goes back and forth with some crazy shots, mostly air balls and the worst bricks you'll ever see. I score, then he scores. The score is even at 20 points each. Next point wins. But in the end, he scores the last point. I don't take it too personally. After grunting some loser words, we take a seat on the benches nearby. He asks me how the pregnancy is going. ""Not too bad. She's just ready to pop the kid out."" ""How are you feeling about being a dad?"", Jack asked. ""I'm excited. I can't wait to hold the little guy. I hope I do okay. I hope he always knows that I love him. I hope he knows I'm doing my very best. See I know a little about disappointment. I never told you this but my dad wasn't in my life. He was a bum. Got my mom pregnant and never heard from the guy."" Jack listened intently. ""I always want to give a kid the love and attention my dad never gave me.""  Jack looked at me with an intensity I couldn't quite place. He seemed on the verge of crying. I broke the silence saying, ""I'm okay man. It was my dad's loss."" ""You turned out to be quite a success and I'm sure you'll make a great father"", Jack responded. ""I appreciate that. It means a lot coming from you."" 

""Enough with the emotional stuff. You ready for another game?"", I said. Jack nodded his head in excited acceptance. We go toe to toe again but something feels off. It feels like I have a cramp in my heart. Then suddenly I feel numb, shortness of breath, and lightheaded. I collapse hard to the ground. Jack runs over to me and sounds worried. He calls 911 and reports my symptoms. I then tell him grab my phone and call my wife. It occurs to me, Jack never met my wife. I was never sure why, but he seemed to only want to meet to play basketball and chat. I never met any of his family or other friends. He talks about them but that's it. An ambulance arrives and I'm rushed to the hospital. Jack follows in his car. My wife meets me up at the hospital. The doctors do what doctors do to get me stable. Fear wells up in my mind and heart. I need to be strong for my wife and unborn child. I survive, but the doctors tell me something is wrong. They can't explain it. I'm dying. I cry out, ""people have heart attacks everyday. You mean to tell me, mine is fatal?"" The doctor explains, ""it's not just the heart attacked. The heart attack trigger something much worst. Your heart has failed and is living on borrowed time. You have at most a week. We can make you comfortable. I cry, ""but I'm supposed to be a dad."" ""I'm sorry Mr. Jones. We have people here to help you with arrangements."" ""Just leave me be. Is my wife here?"" The doctor replied, ""yes, I will send her in. Again, I'm so sorry."" 

My wife rushes in, as fast as a pregnant woman can move. She's crying and I can tell she's been crying for hours. We talk about the arrangements. I tell her she has to stay strong for the both of us  and for our unborn son. We both cry our hearts out because this is all sudden and unfair. We cry and spend the whole night just holding each other. The doctors knew the words visiting hours didn't apply at this point. 

The next morning, I'm still numb from the feeling that I'm dying and leaving behind a wife and child. There's nothing I can do but except my fate. In all of this, I never thought to ask what happened to Jack. He just disappeared. My wife left early in the morning, upon my recommendation. I told her a hospital is no place for a pregnant woman to sleep. She fought me on it but eventually did concede. I really didn't want her to see my with tubes up my nose. I was starting to feel really sick as Jack made his visit. He looked a mess. He looked as if he'd cried as much as my wife. He comes close to me and sits. I tell him my diagnosis and he begins crying. We then begin to discuss my fears. ""I hope my wife can do this without me. She is strong, but I hate I can't be here with her. And my son, what is to become of him? I hope he'll know I love him. I hope he'll know I wanted to be in his life and didn't leave him."" Jack stared at me with understanding eyes as tears begin to well up again. I'm starting to feel so weak and know I have mere moments left. This is it. My time has come. I say, ""I hope my son knows I would have given him the world"" to which Jack responds, ""he knows."" With those final words, I die.

 Jack kisses my forehead and says, ""I love you dad. This year has been great getting to know you. There's no doubt in my mind, you are the greatest dad in the world. I didn't tell you about me because I didn't want to risk changing the future, risk my own existence. I turn out fine. I'm married, have kids, and successful career. My mom, Jenna, told me everything about you. She taught me to be strong and determined like you. I am so proud to be your son. Goodbye dad. I hope to see you in the afterlife. Jack leaves the hospital with a kinship with his father and returns to his own timeline with his heart filled with admiration for his father. ",tytheanomaly

""Why are you staring at me like that?"" The corner of Mina's eyes crinkled into a smile. ""If you keep looking, I might just believe you're in love with me."" 

Kaitlyn laughed, her smile bright. ""How do you know I'm not?"" 

Mina rolled her eyes. ""I think Freddy would have a problem or two with that,"" she said jokingly. ""He might just have to boot you out of our house."" 

Kaitlyn brought her hand to her heart in mock horror, causing Mina to burst into a fit of giggles. She wasn't worried. Her father wouldn't actually boot her out, regardless of the fact that he didn't know she was his daughter. What he did know was that Kaitlyn was Mina's caretaker and that Mina absolutely adored her. 

Mina had always had a frail body ever since she was young. She'd never go more than a month or so at a time before getting sick, and it took her quite a bit longer than the normal person to recover. So when she was at home, she'd always had a caretaker, but after she'd gotten married to Freddy, he hadn't been able to afford one. 

So it had seemed like fate when Kaitlyn had appeared on their door one day, willing to be paid less because she said she was a nurse-in-training. And the rest was history. She'd been living with them for almost three years now. 

And now, she truly felt like part of the family. 

""Kait, I'm gonna go get some groceries from the corner store,"" Mina yelled from across the kitchen. 

""Wait for me!"" Kaitlyn shouted back. ""Just give me a second, I just have to finish sending this email."" She'd been desperately trying to find ways to increase her mother's quality of life for the past few years, but with scientific progress not progressing quickly enough, she'd had to resort to emailing professors and researchers herself to give them hints to speed research along. 

""I'll be fine, it's just across two streets. I'll be back in twenty minutes."" 

Kaitlyn heard the sound of the front door opening and closing. Hurriedly, she typed out the last few lines of the email, then pressed send. Then she grabbed her purse from the kitchen table and rushed out to chase after Mina.  

She jogged down the street. The store wasn't far, but she'd had a nagging feeling today that something was wrong. And when she reached the corner and turned, she realized why. A crumpled body lay in the middle of the intersection of the street, blood pooling around it. 

Her mind almost blank, Kaitlyn dashed forwards, praying beyond hope that it wasn't her mother. That it couldn't be her mother. And yet...the long, black hair and delicate features said differently. But her father had never spoken of a car accident, so how was this possible?

""Look, I'm so sorry, I didn't see her at all,"" the truck driver standing next to her said, his face full of terror. 

""Call the ambulance,"" Kaitlyn said harshly to him before taking off her cardigan and wrapping it under her mother's head. Her mind was strangely calm now. 

Mina's eyes fluttered open for a second, and she gave Kaitlyn a weak smile. ""Hi, Kait."" 

""Hi, Mina,"" she said back gently, brushing a stray strand of hair away from her mother's face. ""You're going to be okay now."" 

Mina let out a little exhale, a small puff of laughter. ""Can you let Freddy know I love him? I don't think..."" She swallowed. ""I don't think I'll get the chance to tell him myself again."" 

""No! You will!"" Kaitlyn spoke with conviction, her eyes fiery. ""You're going to survive this."" 

And maybe it was the vehemence of her words, but Mina felt something...strange in that instance. Kaitlyn didn't sound like she was trying to convince herself. She sounded...certain. ""How do you know?"" she asked, even as her consciousness was giving way. She wanted to sleep so badly.

There was a pause where Kaitlyn's blue eyes seemed to flash. Then she brought her face down closer until her mouth was right next to Mina's ear. ""Because I'm your daughter. You can't die here because I'm your daughter.""  

*** 

Mina recovered much faster than doctors had anticipated, and after the incident, she got sick much less often. Freddy called it a miracle, but only Kaitlyn and Mina knew it was more than that. Mina had gained the will to live. It was barely half a year after the accident when Mina got pregnant. 

Kaitlyn took care of her night and day during the pregnancy, even as she grew more morose with each passing day, even as Mina grew more ecstatic. She never told Mina why she'd come back. That she'd come back because she'd never known her mother...because she had died in childbirth. 

And when the nine months were up, when Mina's water broke and she was sent to the hospital, Kaitlyn sat in their home, alone, watching the hand on the clock slowly tick. She wouldn't watch her mother die. It was time for her to leave. And so she left without a goodbye.

*** 

""Dad, I'm home,"" she shouted as she stepped through the front door, her heart heavy. 

""Kaitlyn!"" her father shouted, ""did you get the cake?"" 

Kaitlyn's brows furrowed. ""What cake?"" She dropped her keys on the table. When she'd left, her father hadn't mentioned anything about a cake. 

Her father appeared in the doorway, much older than the one she was now familiar with, his hair streaked with grey. ""Silly goose, I knew you would forget it. Lord knows how you keep all that research information straight in your head when you can't even remember to get a cake when that's the only thing I sent you out for.""  He seemed...unusually excited. In fact, she couldn't remember the last time he'd been so happy. 

""What cake?"" she asked again. 

He rolled his eyes. And the front door clicked just as her father spoke again. She turned around to face the front door, her eyes widening impossibly as she saw who came through. 

""Silly daughter,"" he said. ""The cake for your mother's birthday!""

[WP] You have realized that your best friend is your son/daughter from the future who wants to hang out and get to know you since you die before he/she was born,_Azmodan_,"There's a stable time loop theory which opposes the butterfly effect theory. It essentially says that time travel has already been invented in the future and their changes to affect the past was already done before it was invented. Essentially, all changes done to the timeline were already done.

[WP] You have realized that your best friend is your son/daughter from the future who wants to hang out and get to know you since you die before he/she was born,_Azmodan_,"I would almost be touched if I wasn’t afraid. My wife Amanda is 2 months pregnant with our first child. I haven't the heart to tell her I have less than 7 months to live. Why would she believe me? How would she react?

“Did you find the noodle mix?” Ben asks me, as I peruse through his backpack. *No, but I found the truth.*

“Not yet, you said it was in a blue bag?” I asked, frantically replacing the notepad.  There it was - Pork ramen, my favorite. Ben would know this; Amanda should have told him. I returned to the cooksite. It was several hundred feet away from the tents, as a precaution to keep bears, squirrels, and everything else away.

“Did Amanda leave to get water,” I asked.

“Yes, she left 5 minutes ago.”

“Good; You should know something – I found your notebook.""

Ben froze. He did a quick pat down of his jacket, only to realize it was missing.  He opened his mouth as of to say something, but decided against it, and instead we sat in silence for a moment.

“Does mom know?” he finally asked.

“No, and I’m not going to tell her.”

“I’m sorry, you weren’t supposed to find out,” Ben said, frowning.

“Why did you do it? Why leave everything behind?” I asked.

Ben shifted for a moment; He never expected this, not from me. I had read the notes; time travel was a one-way trip.

“Because if I can save you – I can save myself; your version of myself.” Ben said.

“You think you need to be saved?”

“Yes, I do,” Ben said. He laced his hands behind his neck. “You don’t know what it was like, growing up without a father. I never fit in - never had a family - never fell in love. Maybe, just maybe, if I can save you, I can do something worthwhile.”

I sat thinking for a moment; It was all too much for me. Ben had jumped into my life less than a year ago, sitting next to me on the first day of MATH 201. We had hit it off ever since. He was like a younger; more energetic version of myself. He was kind, smart, and compassionate. I was, for lack of a better term, proud of the man who claimed to be my son. How could he beat himself up like this?

“Can you tell me when it happened?” I asked, afraid to hear the answer.

“Only that it happens soon, but I don’t know what happens, or how to stop it from – “

Amanda’s scream rang out through the wilderness.  I leapt to my feet, Ben followed.

“Amanda?” I yelled, running towards the river.

I arrived just in time to see the bear tackle Amada.

“Amanda.” I shouted.  I charged the bear. I don’t know what came over me, but I ran straight at the angry, 250 lb. hunk of muscle.

The bear, startled, raised itself up on its two legs and bellowed a fierce roar. It was only then did I see the two cubs scoot run away from the shore and into the bushes. This was a mother cub protecting her young from the evil likes of Amanda. I had to get I the bear away from her.

“Leeeeroy Jenkins!” I yelled, terrified, and unable to think of anything better. I picked up a nearby rock and hurled it at the bear, who was now barreling towards me.

I was knocked to the ground by the bear. It clamped it’s jaw around my shoulder. I screamed, but the pain was all gone. It was a moment of pure adrenal bliss. I struggled against the bear as she bit down hard, shattering bone. I fell to the ground; a red mist appeared above me. It was Ben, with bear spray. The bear turned and ran, following her cubs into the brush.

“Stay with me; It’s going to be OK.” Ben said, cradling my head in his arms. He was crying.

“Ben- listen, you want to make a difference? Be there for my kid.”

“That’s messed up,” he sobbed. “You can’t die on me.”

I looked at my mangled, bloody shoulder. I didn’t have long.

“You have to save her; save the baby. Please – be there for her.” I said, sputtering.

“I’m sorry dad. I’m so sorry. I couldn’t save you.”

“You did save me,” I said, looking Ben in the eyes, ”now go save yourself.”

“It’s just a prop gun. You can’t really shoot anyone with it,” I said, looking confused.

Samantha frowned again, turning it over in her hand before setting it down like it might bite her. “Didn’t some actor get killed by one of these before? I know I heard it has happened at least once.”

“Well, yes, but.. “ I paused and mulled it over, “There are different ways to achieve special effects and if you aren’t careful, someone can get hurt and some people have died, but this one is different. See, it isn’t built to accept real bullets. You can’t even put the squibs in there. They just won’t fit. Only accepts these special charges.” I take one out of the box, the cap looks hardly anything like a bullet, no one could mistake the two. I hand it to Samatha and she turns it over in her hands.

“Okay, but, lets say something else got stuck in the barrel?”

I sigh, clearly this was eating at her. Picking up the gun, I show her the barrel and says, “Okay sure, if someone put something in the barrel then someone could get hurt, but see here?” I show her the end of the prop with a little black screen. “They designed them so you can’t put anything large in there. The whole thing is designed for safety. Maybe if you had little pebbles or glass it could come out and hurt someone, but these things really are designed to be safe.”

For a moment it seems like I’m getting through to her, but just a moment. Another frown. She takes the prop from me again and turns it over in her hands and keeps muttering to herself something. Finally she puts it down again and says, “But I’m sure this is it, it has to be.”

“Has to be what?” I asked, bemused but perplexed.

“The gun!” she exclaims and this time I frown. “Listen, lets say hypothetically you wanted to kill yourself with one of these, could you do it? I mean if you had to?”

Now I was alarmed, “Woah, hang on there.” I pick up the prop, this time intending to put it away. “First this isn’t a topic I’m very comfortable with, if you’re thinking of hurting yourself you have to tell me right now. Second, this thing isn’t a real weapon, I mean, to cause that kind of injury you’d have to really try and even then it’s maybe the worst way to go. It isn’t powerful enough to do you quickly, this thing would probably be agonizingly painful. The gases could probably kill you if you held it like right up to your eye or temple, but God, Sam, it’d be a bad way to go.”

Samantha finally starts to look more satisfied. “Good,” she says and smiles. She looks happier now and turns to start walking away, telling me over her shoulder. “I have a great story for you, one about a time traveler who meets her dad who committed suicide before she was born. In it she goes back and convinces him not to do it. Really saves his life. She can’t wait to see what her life will be like now that-“

And she’s gone. Like she was never there to begin with. I gape, staring at the spot where Samantha had been a moment ago. Her words echo in my mind, too impossible to be real but also somehow a part of me believes. When we’d met she always seemed like a long lost relative and despite being the same age, I found myself drawn to her not romantically but something else. Like she was a long lost sister. Maybe I was going crazy, this couldn’t be real, but at the same time my eyes were drawn to the prop gun. If that was the only way to save her.",supified

""3... 2... 1..."" 

That was the last thing I'd heard before I woke up in 2032.  It was just 11 in the morning back in 2057, but now it's pitch black and freezing cold.  I can hear crickets, and calm water.  Leaves rustle as I sit up feeling dizzy.  So dizzy.  

A car whizzes by about 40 feet away and as it passes, it's headlights illuminate the trees around me.  I'm on the side of the road, right off Richmond Parkway.  This is Lincoln State Park.  I made it.  

I feel a moment of panic as I begin to frantically search for my bag.  It was supposed to be strapped to my back! It didn't take but a few frenzied moments for me to spot it a few feet away, collecting leaves.  

As I walk down Richmond Pkwy, I consider my reality.  I am the only person who knows time travel exists in this dimension.  Everything is so simple right now.  The people of this time have no idea that everything is about to change, not even a decade down the line.  It's like the videos and pictures in Mom's cloud.  Our cloud.  Clean, slow, spacious; and damn, the air smells good. 

As I walk through the village I can see folk sitting down at the local pubs, enjoying each other's company.  There's Fallon's.  There's Rascal's.    Jack Loggin's.  Shit, man, this place looks different.  I wonder if I know any of these people.  Maybe they are some of Mom's friends or my own relatives.  

Time stopped then.  This time, not literally.  There he is.  My Dad.  He's tending bar at Johnny O's, his establishment.  Mr. John O'Reilly himself.  He's tall.  Taller than I'd imagined.  Tall with broad shoulders, a big ol' human.  Like me.  His eyes like little balls of ice, *'the bluest this side of Minnesota'*, my mother would always say.  

I just stand there admiring my Dad.  He's shooting the shit with some customers, flashing an infectious smile like it was going out of style.  I straighten up my posture, wipe the nonexistent dirt from my clothes and walk inside.  

The music is low and there's just a few people at the bar.  I check the clock on the wall, it's 1:33 am.  

""Well, congratulations John! Such a great news.  Give our best wishes to Rosie!"" a loud man basically shouts to my father, from right across from him.  He's drunk.  

My dad shakes his hand, and waves off the drunk man's wife as they breeze by me and out the door.  He looks at me.  I almost freeze before realizing how critical it is that I act normal.  I approach the bar and sit down, placing my bag on the stool beside me.  

""Bourbon with a splash of ginger, rocks please."" I say casually.  

My father was looking at me like he knew me, but couldn't place where from.  He made no motion to begin making my drink.  

""Sorry, do I know you from somewhere friend?"" John O'Reilly said curiously.  

""I doubt it, I'm just passing through.  I get this often, though."" I said, cracking a smile. ""Just one of those faces I guess."" 

""Jack and coke was it?"" he asks.  

""Bourbon if you've got it, with a splash of ginger.  On ice."" I reply, keeping my smile.  

""Sorry about that, I could have sworn I'd recognized you when you first walked in.  I spaced for a minute I guess."" John replies sounding embarrassed. He flashes a big smile.  ""Bullet with a splash of ging, rocks! Comin right up!"" 

He flicks a glass from his left hand to his right, turns and begins to mix my drink.  Another couple clears out, they seem to be about my age, maybe a bit younger.  

""So, where ya headed? We don't get many people 'passing through' Roseville."" he asks.  

""Oh, I'm headed right here.  I've got family here that I'm visiting for the first time, actually."" I reply.  

""Family, huh? What're their names? Maybe I know 'em!"" he responds.

""O'Brian."" I quickly respond.  

*Fuck, that's way too close to O'Reilly.*  

""What a coincidence! I'm O'Reilly!"" he exclaims as he hands me my drink. ""O'Brian. O'Reilly. Ha ha!"" 

""John O'Reilly, pleasure to meet you."" he continues.  

""Johnny O's.  This is your place, isn't it?"" I ask, as I extend my hand and shake hands with my father for the first time in my life.  

""You betcha!"" he responds, smiling. 

He must have had a few.  His face is pretty red, the same thing happens to me when I drink.  This happiness and kindness, though, I don't get the feeling is a result of the booze.  He just seems like a good man.  I feel proud for a moment before I notice him looking at me, curious again.  

""So I overheard those nice people congratulating you as they left, John.  What's the occasion?"" I inquire.  

In that moment, everything became worth it.  He gets almost giddy, stands up tall and proud and say, ""Well son, I'm gonna be a Daddy."" He can't control the smile that cracks across his entire face as he says it.  ""My wife and I found out today that I'm having a baby boy!"" he continues.  

""No way, man! Congratulations! Let me buy you a drink!"" I say, throwing another 20 on the counter. ""For your boy!"" I say, fighting back tears.  

""Hell, I'll drink to that!"" John shouts, pouring us both a couple of shots. ""To my little Mikey!"" he shouts, raising his glass before throwing it back.  

""To Mikey."" I say, and I swallow back the liquor along with my tears.  

I wish I could have had this wonderful man raise me.  The way he lights up when talking about his future son, me, makes this so hard to power through.  I don't know what I'd expected but I didn't expect this.  

""Yeah, buddy! I've wanted nothing more than to have a son of my own for as long as I can remember.  I grew up an only child, you see.  My parents, my father in particular, showed me everything NOT to do when I was growing up.  I guess I have him to partially thank for why I'm going to be the best Dad ever to that kid."" he says, seemingly talking to himself.  He takes another shot.  

""I'm sure you will, John.  You seem like a real good guy.  I'm glad I chose this establishment tonight."" I say, offering a smile and a cheers.  

""You seem like a good man, yourself... Uh.  I don't think I even got your name, son."" John says sounding slightly confused.  

""It's Mike.  Ha ha! Seems you've chosen a good name for your boy."" I say with a laugh and a wink.  

""Hot damn! Now what are the odds of that!!"" John says, getting quite loud. ""Lets drink to that!"" 

He pours us another couple of shots.  *God damnit, stop drinking.*  It's almost closing time.  

""Remarkable."" John says, shaking his head and smiling as he looks at me. ""What are the odds?""  

""Ha ha! I don't know, man.  It's a small world, trust me on that."" I force out as an answer.  

Out comes two more shots.  I wince as I see him pour them.  I want to stop this, but I know I can't.  

""Here's to that, man!"" he offers up.  

I can't resist, I take one last shot with my Dad.  

""Well shit, Mike.  I should have begun closing already.  My wife's going to be worried sick! It was a pleasure meeting you tonight, my friend.  A pleasure."" he extends his hand. ""Promise you'll come back if you are ever in the neighborhood again."" 

""I promise, John.  It's been a real pleasure.  You get home safe."" I say as I shake his hand.  

""Will do, I just live down the road! No worries, bud!"" he replies with his back to me, as he turns and begins washing glasses.  

""I love you, Dad."" I whisper.  I gather my bag, turn and leave.  

I look back through the window one last time as I walk back down the road I came.  Down the block, I turn left.  I walk straight for a while, and before long, a pickup zooms by.  I reach into my bag as tears stream down my face.  I pull out the transmitter as I take a seat by the side of the road.  I activate it, and I begin feeling heavy.  As my vision blurs, be it from tears or from the time travel, the last thing I see off in the distance is my father's truck get t-boned by a fellow drunk driver.

""Doesn't look like much, does it?""

He gave a barking laugh. ""Sturdy, though. I bet with proper paint and care, it'll easily last for half a century at least.""

I couldn't quite keep the corners of my mouth from tugging upwards, until I noticed his face had grown suddenly thoughtful. ""What is it?""

He shuffled his feet, a gesture I had come to know meant he had something to say but didn't want to or didn't know how to tell. Clearing his throat, he said, ""Don't go.""

""What do you mean,"" I asked.

He looked at me for a few moments, then looked up into the sky. ""I know you've been looking forward to this trip with your old school buddies...""

""...but something's going to happen on that trip"", I finished his sentence for him. ""Is that it?""

With an utter look of confusion on his face, he asked, ""how....how'd you know?""

It was my turn to bark out a laugh. I grabbed his shoulders, facing him.""How could I not know my own son? I may not have known right away, but I realized after you came by a few times. So it's time travel for you, eh? Nice one.""

""But you never said anything!""

""No, I didn't. Think about it. What reason could there be for you to visit me, time and time again, every Saturday, three pm sharp without fail? Something had to have happened to me. Or had to happen to me in the future, if you will. You were so curious about me. I can't travel through time, but I can *see* time.""

In between the tears and smiles that we couldn't help by then, and completely shaken from this day's revelations, he simply shook his head. ""Alright"", he rasped, ""don't go, okay? I'll see you next Saturday.""

I simply smiled at him, clapped him on his back, and gently pushed him away from me. He gave me a nod, then vanished.

I sat down on one of the small stools we'd used while building the little garden shed we'd just finished. The shed that he'd told me his kids were so fond of climbing up on.

With a deep, heavy sigh, I spoke into the air, ""No son, you won't. Because whatever future I saw, one way or another I would leave, fail, or disappoint you, and you would grow into a resentful, bitter man who despised his father. I've gotten to know quite a few versions of you over the years, each one visiting me on a different day of the week. Out of all of them, only you were happy. Only you managed to make a life you enjoy, with a loving husband, and marvelous kids. And the more I got to know this you, the prouder I became to call you my son. I cherished every single one of your visits, and would not want to trade them for anything. There is only one thing left to do. One choice to ensure you have a chance at that future.""

I had my bags packed in my car. There was no real point to showering and putting on clean clothes, so I just got in and started on the trip just as I had planned. About halfway there, the road wound its way up the side of a ravine. At a sharp right turn, I pulled the steering wheel firmly to the left. There were two mild bumps as the wheels shot out over the side of the road into empty air.",lendarker
[WP] You have realized that your best friend is your son/daughter from the future who wants to hang out and get to know you since you die before he/she was born,_Azmodan_,"“It was a warm summer day...no. It...it was a brisk fall morning, leaves had just begun to fall.” Mary shook her head in disappointment, “no I don’t like that either” she said. Mary stretched her arms over her head. “Hey Jonathan, could you come here for a minute?” She beckoned. 

Little did she know I had been standing by the door watching her for a few minutes. I mean, not in the creepy way. She was my daughter. It’s...kind of a long story I’m not sure entirely how to explain but I knew she was my daughter. It was a gut feeling. 

In I walked, with my red NC State sweatshirt and a lollipop in my mouth. Mary spun around in her chair, extending her arm and pointing right at me. “If you keep eating like that you’ll get fat.” She said mockingly. “Whatever.” I replied, biting through the lollipop with a loud crunch. She was in no way perfect either, I mean, the desk was cluttered. 
But I guess I was a little insensitive. Who knows what my daughter had seen from her time. Oh did I forget to mention? She was from the future. I don’t know how I knew, but some times you just know.

Mary tilted her head in the direction of the trash can across the den which was filled with empty chip bags and lollipop wrappers. She shrugged, “those aren’t mine!” I played with the lollipop stick between my teeth, playfully ignoring her. “Well, what did you want?” I asked.

She spun back around to her desk, “well, I’m trying to start this story but I can’t decide on a setting.” She said. Mary was a creative writing major, but to be honest I hadn’t read any of her work up to this point. I wondered if she was any good, “so what am I supposed to do?”

She pondered this for a minute. She evidently didn’t know why she called me over. “Well, okay, what’s your favorite season?” She asked. “Uhh...spring I guess. But, I really like fall and snow, too.” I replied. Jeez I was a big help.
“Well what if I start the story in the fall, work through winter and then finish in spring?” I nodded. It was an option. She made a note of this and then turned back toward me with paper and pen in hand.

“Okay, well, why do you like the snow? What draws you to these seasons?” I felt like I was being interviewed. She hadn’t even told me the plot of the story yet. But, I had nothing better to do so I went along. “Well, I guess...I don’t like the cold but snow is really pretty. I like how empty and still everything feels when there’s snow on the ground. I...don’t know if that helps you though” I said. 

She jotted more notes down. This sort of interview went on for a while. She’d ask a seemingly ambiguous question about what I liked, and then she’d write notes. After a while I couldn’t help but ask her, “hey so, you mind telling me what the story is about?” 
“I don’t know yet!” She replied. Well, that’s great. What was I being asked all this stuff for? I mean, in the end I didn’t mind because I was spending time with my daughter, but, I just wish I had known the point. 

After a while we stopped the questioning and I went on my way back in to the kitchen to work on dinner. Every now and then I kept looking through the archway to see what she was doing. My apartment was small enough I could see her clearly from the kitchen. She was writing like crazy, so I guess my answers had helped her in some way.

**** 

Some time had passed since that day. A few months and I never did ask her what the story was about. I had noticed she was over at my apartment much more recently. She would always come over, we would do our work and talk for a bit and then she’d start writing.

One night I had actually forgotten she was over. It was almost midnight and I was getting ready for bed when I walked passed the den and she had fallen asleep at the desk. How did I know she was my daughter? Was it the way she reminded me of myself? Did I see myself in her? I wondered what this meant about love, too. Would meeting my daughter help me know when I find the one? Would Mary resemble my wife-to-be in any way? When would I meet my future wife?

My mind was going in many different directions but it all stopped when I saw a date on the page she had been writing. “February 13, 2024.” Something drew me to this. So, I carefully slid the paper out from under her elbow. 

I gathered the papers from the desk and started reading her story.
My mouth dropped open and tears ran down my face as I read. 

“In a way, I never knew my dad. But, in another way I knew him like a best friend. I had to see him so I came to visit as a college student and that’s how we became friends. We stayed close friends for a while too.
But, just like the snow he loved so much, his time would eventually melt away. 
I think he knows it’s me. I think he knows I’m his daughter and that’s why he puts up with all my nonsense. 
After spending time with him I think I get my crazy, annoying side from him. God, can he be annoying. His health is in real bad shape, too.

Anyway, my dad’s time would melt away soon and it was up to me to make it important to him. Which is why I started writing this story. Eventually, when it’s done, I want to gift it to him. 
Before his time comes I want him to know all the things I’ve done in my life.

Dad, you may not have been alive when I was born. But, I want you to know mom says I act just like you. The messiness, philosophical ideas, procrastination, all of it. She even says I snore like you...but I’m not sure about that one. I’ve heard you snore, it’s not pretty.

I want you to know I’ve done really well. I’ve graduated top of my class almost every year. I eat healthy...some times. I’m active with sports, and I have a lot of friends. No, before you go crazy, I haven’t had a boyfriend. I...I have liked a few people though but I tend to push them away before anything serious happens. Mom says it’s because I try too hard to make things serious instead of going with the flow...maybe that’s something I need to learn from you.

Spending this time with you at college has been interesting dad. I’ve seen you black out drunk, I’ve seen you cry. But, I’ve also seen you laugh, work hard, and walk past mom a few times too without even knowing. (Hurry up and talk to her you dumbass!) anyway, thank you dad.

You may not have been alive when I was born but you’re alive in mom’s heart and I hear about you all the time. So before I go and really start this story I want to tell you what it’s about.

It’s about you. It’s about your life, and it’s about what you mean to mom and I. In fact, in the future, where I’m from, I’m a successful writer. I had a really successful book come out last year...you might not believe this but...it’s this book.

The story of your life, dad, is the story that brought my writing aspirations to life. I can’t thank you enough. 
Hopefully you’ll find this like I want you to. Read it before you pass and know that your life may have ended, but your story lives on in this writing.”

I put the papers back on the desk. Mary was still asleep peacefully. I wiped the tears from my eyes.

How was this possible? She knew who I was and I knew who she was.

Why didn’t we tell each other? Why hadn’t she told me where her mom was whenever I passed her?! That would be a big help.

I sighed. “I think it’s better off if we keep living thinking the other person doesn’t know. Let’s keep the friend dynamic going. I don’t want to read anymore. I’d rather not know how I die. I know I’ll live on in the future thanks to your book...so I’ll live in the now for you too.”

EDIT: I wrote this between night classes, so sorry if it isn’t completely fleshed out and some parts move too quickly!",bluebirdmg

[WP] You have realized that your best friend is your son/daughter from the future who wants to hang out and get to know you since you die before he/she was born,_Azmodan_,"James had saved my life during maneuvers in Syria. Sniper on a rooftop took a shot almost took my head. James had pushed me out of the way though. Said he saw a glint. I never saw it. I wouldn't look a gift horse in the mouth though. You tend to get pretty close to a man after he saves your life. We'd spend late nights on patrol talking about our families and our lives before. We worked well together. We had similar builds and tastes. It was like finding a brother you never knew existed. 

I asked him once if his mom was a brunette from Alabama, he just laughed. Said he was from the Bronx. He had moved though, about 20 years back. Long before my wife and I settled there. There were always some discrepancies like that in his story though. Like he talked about this cake place on Broadway that he loved, but it had just opened when we moved in. I assumed he had just come back to visit and was mis-remembering... I don't know the signs were there. How could I have known though? But I guess I always knew. How's a guy from the Bronx get a southern drawl, but only when he's 6 beers in? He would slip up sometimes when he'd been drinking. Yell about that guy from that TV show... white guy, older, fired people. Talk about the importance of recycling and the environment. How sweet the air was, even though it smelled like camel shit and dust. Once he called me dad, that was after a particularly rambunctious evening. I dunno, I figured I just looked like his old man, even though James was just a little younger than I was. He'd always get quiet when I showed him a picture of my kid. I'd never even held the bugger, but he'd get more misty than me. It was the little things you know. 

We were patrolling downtown that day. James was quiet all morning. He had been up all night, studying the satellite data. Reviewing previous patrol reports. Double checking ammo and weapons. I asked him what was up. He said this was the day. I pressed but he clammed up. 2 hours into our patrol we passed a burned out tea shop and he hit the brakes. Never stop moving, that's the rule. I asked him what was up, my rifle ready. The street was empty. The rooftops looked clear. He threw it in reverse. The explosion took off the front of the humvee. A shaped charge had been buried in the road. Remote detonated the second we started reversing. It was a close call. Another foot and we'd be total slag. Not that we were that better off. The force of the explosion threw the vehicle on it's rear. We landed in the middle of the road on our driver's side. Simmons and Davis were in the back trying to get their bearings. I was still in a daze. James was on the ball though. He grabbed my shirt and yelled at me to get out. His eyes were intense, blazing with danger. I pulled myself together grabbed my shit and headed out the rear. I didn't even question him. As I'm pulling Davis through the back window I see movement on the rooftop across the street. A man with something on his shoulder and a flare of light and smoke. I managed to scream right before we were hit for the second time in the last 5 minutes. The armored undercarriage took most of the force, but I don't remember much of what happened next. James managed to get me out into a building. Smoke and fire filled my senses. I was still holding onto Davis. Simmons didn't make it. 

James had managed to get a call out over the radio. Evac in 15 minutes. I don't know if we'll last 5. We've holed up in the back of a shop. The entire front is blown off, it was like that before we got here though. You can't put that on us. What was left of Davis is propped against the wall and James is fiddling with the radio. I'm peeking around the doorway but I'm not seeing anything. I take stock of our surroundings and it's not good. Also, I'm pretty sure my leg is fucked. James keeps whispering something. I lean in, ""not like this, it wasn't supposed to not like this.."" 

""James. James. JAMES!"" I'm yelling at him. Hoping to get through. He looks up at me. His face forlorn, like his second time through a show and he already knows the ending. ""Listen. We can get through this okay. We just have to make the evac and we'll be home free."" He's looking at me again. The eyes of a madman. 

""You don't understand. I did it all right. This is supposed to be different. Everything I've been through and look at you!"" blood had already started pooling on the floor. I hadn't even noticed. It all clicked into place. 

""Simon"" He looks at me, his face a mask. It tells me all I need to know. ""I knew it. Jam.. Simon how are you.. what.."" the trauma of my leg and the shock of realizing my best friend was my son... just it was too much. I felt the world closing around me. 

""Dad..."" I came back to reality. My son's face was inches from mine. His hand was pressed to my leg his other around my collar. 
""I'm sorry. Dad. I just wanted to do something..."" He told me everything. How he had never known me. That his mom had told him I had died somewhere far away saving people. How he spent years researching my past and putting together the pieces. He just wanted to meet me. To shake my hand and have a beer. It had all gone too far. A bullet pierced the air between us. Plaster rained down on our heads as a barrage of bullets tore through the open doorway. 

""Simon, get to the evac. I'll cover you."" Tears were streaming down his face. ""I love you son. I'm glad we had this chance. Go home and live your best life. I've got it from here."" The last I saw of him was his boot turning the corner out of the back of the building. He was fast, like his mother. A smile formed on my lips. ""Good luck buddy"" I whispered before flipping the safety on my rifle and unleashing hell.

I looked down at the tiny girl in my husband's arms, perched on the hospital bed beside me. ""We're naming her after you, you know. Natalia Everett James.""

&amp;#x200B;

My best friend's eyes welled up with tears as he reached out to stroke the side of the baby's face. He smiled at the two of us, softly.

&amp;#x200B;

""You've always been there for us. We wouldn't be here without you. Hell, you saved our relationship, Everett. You brought my wife back to me."" Noah's voice broke at the end and I watched a gentle tear roll down his cheek as I struggled to sit up. Everett helped me maneuver a pillow behind me to be a backrest and I rested my head on my husband's shoulder, staring down at my baby girl, still amazed at how perfect she looked. 

&amp;#x200B;

Two years ago, we had met Everett for the first time. Noah and I were having problems in our relationship - I felt stifled, terrified of my future. The ring on my finger had become inexplicably, chokingly tight despite it fitting perfectly for the last three years of our marriage. Noah wanted a baby. I was 26, barely out of law school, and struggling to keep myself sane in a law firm that was working me to the bone. A baby was not something I'd ever particularly wanted, but at that point, I couldn't even consider it. Rett worked in the firm as well; he'd started a few months after me and taken over the cubicle next to mine when its previous occupant had bought a one-way ticket to Australia and disappeared unexpectedly. I took no notice of him, busy with work and stressed from my almost-daily screaming matches with Noah. It wasn't until he found me crying in the copy room after the copier had jammed, again, that I even really noticed his presence. 

&amp;#x200B;

He was warm, soft, and wildly level-headed. To say he fixed our relationship would be an understatement. A few years older than me, matching Noah's 29, Rett quickly became a close friend to both of us. Slowly, with his mediating presence in our lives, my fights with Noah slowed to a standstill and our nights were spent laughing over glasses of wine on our well-worn couch instead of screaming at each other until our throats were raw. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I had unexpectedly become pregnant just over a year later, Noah was overjoyed. Everett was equally as thrilled, and their excitement revved up my own tenfold. Rett was positive we were having a girl, Noah equally convinced it would be a boy. I didn't care either way, simply wanting to meet my baby. 

&amp;#x200B;

We painted the nursery a soft blue, the colour Rett and I both named our favourite. His excitement reminded me of Noah constantly - they shared the same bubbly laugh and warm eyes. Sometimes, I joked that he was a long-lost brother or cousin. Noah played along, once even suggesting Everett get a DNA test. Rett was horrified by the idea, saying he didn't need a test to call us family. We returned the sentiment, and life moved on.

&amp;#x200B;

When Rett started dating a girl named Lily a few weeks into my pregnancy, we found she fit seamlessly into our little group. Her and I enjoyed countless afternoon talks over a backdrop of sports games or cooking shows, nursing mugs of tea as we shared laughs. 

&amp;#x200B;

It was Lily and Rett that helped us deal with the stress of being new parents. Rett especially was always eager to help, and the way he looked at baby Natalia was incredible - with the strangest sense of familiarity, of longing when we held her sleeping form.

&amp;#x200B;

Ten months, sixteen days after Natalia was born, Noah and I were finally going on a date. The baby was left in the safe hands of Lily because Rett was too emotional to be around her - he'd been increasingly shaky and on edge for weeks. Of course, he was home with Lily and Natalia, but holed himself up in the den with the TV a little too quiet to cover his sobs. Noah and I brushed it off for the night when he'd hugged us both a little too tight as we left.

&amp;#x200B;

We had a lovely dinner. Afterward, driving home through a blustery snowstorm, Noah was singing along to the radio. My laugh tinkled around his off-key notes, his hand warmly wrapped around mine, resting in my lap as the snow swirled across our windshield. He paused at a red light to kiss me, my laugh melting into his lips.

&amp;#x200B;

It came out of nowhere. Massive, blaring, bright in the darkness of midnight. There was no way we could have avoided it. The semi bowled us over, and we spun, spun, spun into the snowy darkness. I slipped in and out of consciousness, my screams sounding detached even to my own ears. Noah's hand cooled in mine, frighteningly limp, as sirens and lights became my world.

&amp;#x200B;

He didn't make it to the hospital. They told me later, even though I couldn't respond. Comatose, I felt so painfully trapped. Everything was dark. I brought up images of the faces I knew, only to find them blurry, unmoving, silent. The voices of the nurses and doctors were gentle. I didn't listen to them. I picked out the sensation of Rett sprawled across me, shaky, sobbing. I tried to move, to tell him I was fine, I was right there. It didn't work. It never would.

&amp;#x200B;

They knew I was alive inside my head, knew I could hear and feel, knew I'd never be able to respond. Everett came every day, with Lily and my baby and Noah's parents, who'd taken custody of Natalia. For years, they were there whenever possible. They talked to me, at first the words punctured by sobs. I wished I could comfort them. They weren't always sad - a month or two after the accident, they all came in buoyed up with joy; Natalia had taken her first steps. They set her on my bed and she bubbled nonsense, clutching her tiny hands in my hair. I laughed gleefully, forgetting for a moment that they would never hear me.

&amp;#x200B;

The last time Everett ever came to visit, alone, on Natalia's third birthday, he was silent for what felt like hours, simply holding my unmoving hand and crying. Finally, words found their way past his lips. He started his story slowly, brokenly. By the time he'd gotten to the part where his father died in a car crash that knocked his mum into a coma, the words were crashing out, tripping over each other in their eagerness to finally see the light of day. He told me everything, how he'd been to visit his mum every single day, in this very bed, since he'd been ten months, seventeen days old. He told me how as he grew, raised by his grandparents, he'd come to the realization that he was, in fact, a *he*. He told me how his grandparents had smiled so happy when he came out to them, telling him of his father's conviction that they were having a son despite his parents' best friend's conviction that it would be a girl. He told me how he'd been named for the same friend, and how he'd taken that name as his chosen when he'd begun his transition, how he'd made it official on his eighteenth birthday, how he spent years searching fruitlessly for his namesake, until he found a photo of the four of us - Noah, Everett, Lily and I - and noticed his striking similarity to the man that shared his name. How he realized his future laid in his past, how he fought to get here, how it’s time for him to go.

&amp;#x200B;

He told me how sorry he was for lying, and how happy he was to have gotten to  know his parents somehow, even if we didn't know that it's what we were to him. He told me he was sorry he couldn't return, but that he needed Natalia - Everett, as I knew to call my son then, even if I could never call him that aloud again - to grow up without his future self in his life.

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, he finally told me the words I'd been waiting to hear since the first moment I saw the positive on my pregnancy test  - ""I love you, mum.""

I was standing out in the rain, outside my house, on the phone, while the love of my life played with my son. *My son.*

James sounded confused. “Right now, Mark? Aren’t you busy?”

“Yeah,” I said, mouth dry. 

“Alright man,” James said, concern suffusing his voice. He realized I was upset. Hell, *I* hadn’t realized I was upset. That’s was the thing with best friends – they knew you better than you knew yourself. “I’m at my apartment, just come on over.”

I frowned. “I thought you were busy?” I’d asked him yesterday to come see my kid, but he’d refused. Saying he was on some trip.

“Look,” he said, and I could just imagine him running his hands through his hair in frustration, “now I’m not busy. You gonna come or not?”

I looked at my house one last time and got into the car.

***

James opened the door with a frown on his face. 

“Jesus Christ, man, you’re drenched,” he said. “Hold here.” He disappeared then came back with a towel for me. 

I rubbed my face in it, feeling each small strand prick at me, caress my skin. 

“You alright?” James asked. “Did…did something happen with m– the kid?”

I let the towel fall. Even now I couldn’t escape. So far away from him, and now even James brought him up. 

“No,” I snarled. “Nothing happened with my fucking kid.”

James flinched, taken aback and held up his hands. “Look, chill man, what the hell is wrong?” With that he ushered me inside. I practically flopped down on one of his easy chairs, and James sat across from me. “Just talk to me,” he said, his voice soft.

I held my head in my hands. “Look, I – I don’t think I can do it.”

James went still. “What thing?” he said, his voice dropping to a whisper. 

“This whole father thing!” I bit off the words. “Look, I love Laura, that’ll never change, but I just want…her, you know? I don’t want some, someone else there. Some shackle.”

James looked at me, something hard in his gaze. An understanding. “And you’re talking about this now? That seems like a conversation to have much, much earlier with M- Laura.”

“I–,” I sighed. “It just didn’t become real until he was born you know? It was easy to say, oh yeah I’ll deal with it when it comes, but it’s *here.* I have to deal with it.”

“And you don’t want to.”

I didn’t say anything. There was no need. 

“So what’s the plan?” He said, his voice rising. “Just leave Laura? Forget it all? Vanish?”

I looked at him helplessly. “Maybe? I don’t know, man, I just know I can’t stay with that-”

Suddenly I was against a wall and James had me by the collar. I stared at him, eyes wide. Never in all the time I’d known him, the last 5 years or so, had I ever seen him angry. “James?”

“My dad died. I never knew him.”

I blinked. He’d never talked about his family before. Ever. Or even friends…in fact, I don’t think he had any other connections other than me. No one I’d ever seen him talk to in person or on the phone. Never had any stories. Nothing. 

The only thing that came out of my mouth though was: “I’m sorry.”

He clutched my collar tighter. “And you’re gong to do it anyways.”

I shoved him off, anger rising like bile in my throat. “Look man, it’s my life. I choose what I do. I can leave if I damn well want to!”
 
“You’re fucking disgusting,” he spat. “You’re not man enough to face your own wife and kid, so you come here not even realizing–”

I shoved him again. I’d had just enough of this. I wanted an ear, not someone to yell at me about what a monster I was. “Realize what huh?”

“That I’m your fucking son!”

I froze. 

“You know what I’d thought, *dad,*” he sneered. Putting more venom in that word than most did in the most disgusting curse. “Mom had told me you’d died. No one found the body. So I came back. To see you. To Meet you. To get to know the man who made me, the man I never knew.”

“Bullshit,” I said without any real conviction. I might have denied him. Ignored the signs, the similarity in our looks, our builds. But I’d just seen my son, felt his hand clutch my finger, and some part of me, some part that was a *father* got that. Understood. James was my son. I believed that without a hint of doubt. “H-how?” 

“It doesn’t matter,” he said, his eyes ablaze. 

“James, son–”

“Don’t fucking call me that,” he snarled. “I thought you’d have some accident, not that you’d leave.”

“I,” I wrung my hands. “I can’t stay man!”

James regarded me with cool eyes, then walked to me. I braced myself for a hit, but he just went past me and locked the door. He turned back to me, eyes filled with a sort of crazy anger. 

“They never will find your body, *Dad.*”

[WP] You have realized that your best friend is your son/daughter from the future who wants to hang out and get to know you since you die before he/she was born,_Azmodan_,"“Hi.”

“Hi.” 

I looked up from my phone. My best friend stood there, looking at me with a sense of disappointment in her eyes. 

The whole time I knew Jane, she was kind, and sweet, but she was the opposite of me in almost every way. She was outgoing, meaning she was friends with practically everyone. The charisma she emitted is virtually unrivaled. 

She was fascinated with everyone and everything, as if she had been pulled out of her time. Jane was the perfect human being, whose smile could convert others in the precise opposite mood into something cheerful. 

Yet, as her closest friend, I always felt something that disturbed her deeply. She acted gleeful, but she was emotionally scarred. I knew it all too well. The end of the belt gave me all of the cognition I need. 

The only other thing she resented was that phone that I locked myself into every day to binge fourteen seasons of my favourite TV show. I always lied, “I have to see where this goes,” but the truth has always been clear to me: I don’t really gave a shit about how this would end. I hide in my little corner because I don’t want to interact with anyone. 

I’m terrible at school. I hate being outside. I resent everything I say and lose sleep on many nights just thinking about it. 

The thing that has puzzled me the most is why Jane chose me as her best friend, when there are so many who are infinitely more fitting companions than I am. 

“When are you going to stop locking yourself into that thing and actually interact with someone?” 

“I don’t know. I prefer my little spot.” 

“How do you live with that, honestly?” she shook her head. 

“It’s peaceful and quiet.” 

“You know, everyone likes you a lot. You’re nice and reserved, your only problem is never opening yourself up to anyone. Ever.” 

“I gave it countless tries. I make everyone cringe every single time, so I thought, screw this, I’d rather be alone.” 

“Then you’re not trying hard enough.” 

“Maybe, maybe not. Eitherway, I don’t really care.” 

“Ok, you know what.” she grabbed my earphones and pulled them from me. “I won’t stand for this. Talk to me. Like real friends would” 

“Jane, we talked a lot.”

“Yeah, online. We don’t actually do so that often in real life.”

“That’s because you’re always hanging out with your large group of friends.”

“You’re always welcome!” 

“I don’t. I don’t believe I am. And I don’t deserve you as a friend. You’re everything I’m not. I would like to be alone now, please, Jane.” 

I put the earphones back on and leaned against the wall. She went silent, standing there, pondering my stubborness. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw that she wasn’t smiling anymore. Not even a smirk.

“Okay, Daddyo.” 

She retreated to the yard, where our class was gathered. I heard the “Daddyo” she spoke to me that day. Loud and clear. But I paid no attention to it because I was oblivious to everything, no matter how hard it smacked me in the face. 

But that was the last time we were that close as friends. 

————

“Congratulations, Doctor. You have a bright future ahead of you.” 

I smiled and grabbed the Metaphysics certificate as a photo was taken of me and my presenter. 

“Quite an achievement, huh?” said my mum, who wrapped her arms around me and pecked on both sides of my cheek. 

“I suppose. This field has only been around for 5 years, so I might as well be one of the first up for it. Mum, did you know that the discovery of tachyons—“

“Honey, for the love of all that is good in the universe, don’t go babbling off again about those time travel stuff. It just fries mine and frankly everyone’s brains. This old woman is too slow for all of that stuff, but you, honey, you will change the world.” 

I could only manage a short “Thanks, mum” as I took a seat in the hall. The ceremony was over and nearly everyone there had all but left. 

“Hey, you mind if I sit here?” 

“Sure.” 

I didn’t even bother to look up. I was dozing off into another daydream, looking at the bright ceiling for no apparent reason. 

“You know, the ceiling’s interesting, but you could always talk to me.” 

“I’m sorry, who—“ 

I lost my words when I looked at who just set themselves next to me. 

“Jesus Christ, Jane, you could’ve at least told me!” 

My former best friend grinned and gave me a hug. 

“Lots of things have happened, huh?” 

“Aye.” I nodded. “What’s up?” 

“Gas prices.” 

I cringed at the two-decade-old joke. 

“Ah, Jane. You really had the charisma, but the one thing you never really could master was humour. Honestly you’re a disaster.” 

“Hah, I know. I got it from my old man.” 

“Tell me about it.” 

“Well, you see, he was largely cringey at school but he was gif—“

“Jane, I meant ‘wow, that sucks.’ That’s the meaning of the phrase.” 

She oooh’ed, chuckling at her own silliness. 

“I always regretted losing you. I should’ve talked to you that day. I lost my only friend that day because of my utter imbecility.”

“Well, it was a gradual process. Anyway, Doctor, where are you off to next?” 

“Brown 24/7 Scientific Institute. It’s this big place with the brightest minds working in the field of metaphysics.”

“Hah, inventing time travel and perverting the course of human history, huh?” 

“It’s not really perverting, because we can’t change anything. You see, Jane, tachyons are real. That means that our destiny is already written. The thing is, we can’t really read the transcription, so we never really know what’s gonna happen, meaning that even if we go back in time, we can’t change anything. Ever.”

“What ever happened to free will and ‘make your own destiny’?”

“Oh, it’s there, alright. Without knowing what our future is, we still have the illusion of free will, so the space time continuum won’t unravel itself.” 

“Hah, wow. You speak as if I don’t know any of this.”

I raised an eyebrow. “That’s what I thought.”

“You arrogant arse, of course I know all of it.” she nudged me with her elbow. “I tried, over and over again, countless times. I never could alter it. I think you were destined for it.” 

I noticed tears welling up in her eyes. 

“Destined for what?”

“Loneliness, Dad. But you will change the entire universe because of it. Yet simultaneously, you will never ever come home because of it. I never wanted it, resented it, and I wanted my father home, but I really couldn’t, so I elected to spend as much time as possible with the father I never knew, but he was just so oblivious about everything, and well—“ 

Her voice cracked. 

She broke down crying. First time I’ve ever seen her do so. I didn’t know what to do. All I could do was put my arms around her and whisper a few weak consolations. 

“I tried. I really did. It never worked out.” she muttered between her sobs. “Even my attempt at getting to know him better.” 

“I know, honey.”

A swift raise of my hand stopped him, his voice falling silent before it even begun.

At first I used my powers for pranks you know rearrange all the furniture in a house or troll some highway cops radar gun. Eventually I grew out of pranking and started using my gifts to help people that's when I met my partner I didn't know her real name just her hero name Bolt they called her she had blue lightning whereas mine was red we were quite the pair until one day she dropped a bomb on me not a literal one mind you but a bomb nonetheless. 

&amp;#x200B;

""Hey can I talk to you for a minute?"" Bolt asked as we sped through the city her voice coming through my ear piece. ""Thats a ten four"" I replied. We met at our hideout an abandon shoe factory ironic I know.  She was already there when I arrived she had her mask off which was strange since we never revealed our names to each other or our faces safer that way we said. ""Whoa Bolt what are you doing?"" I covered my eyes trying not to see her face but the glimpse I caught made me feel like someone was walking on my grave. She had tears in her eyes Bolt swallowed a sob before speaking ""Its time I told you the truth I uh came here from the future"" I interrupted her with a laugh ""Okay so? big deal I'm from Portland doesn't change that we stop bad guys and save the day."" I said shaking my head. Bolt stood up and threw her mask at me ""It does matter because you're my father and I came back to save you"" 

I was filled with disbelief I mean she couldn't be my daughter I have a girlfriend but we are always safe then again Zoe said she wanted to talk to me. I felt like a train had run me over as I came to the realization the no names or faces. I looked at Bolt again and sure enough I could see it : She had afro puff pig tails just like my sisters and her eyes were the same sea green as Zoe's. I had to know so I asked the unthinkable ""What happens to me? And what is your actual name and when......I.....I?"" I couldn't stop rambling she silenced me ""Its alright from what I know mom is pregnant right about nowish and my name is Melody Rose Ashman. As for you there's something a villain out there that tries to kill you but you bring him down and die from your injuries. But I am here to stop it."" I took a deep breath processing all of this "" That's my mothers name you look just like her you know as for this villain I am sure we will make short work of him together as a family"" I said taking my daughters hand in mine.

[WP] You have realized that your best friend is your son/daughter from the future who wants to hang out and get to know you since you die before he/she was born,_Azmodan_,"Well it depends how you look at time I suppose. But one way would be that by traveling back in time and stopping her father from committing suicide she therefore never travels back in time to stop him, so that version of her disappears. She still exists, but the timeline where she goes back in time to stop him doesn’t anymore. Of course that should also mean that since that version of her now never existed her dad would never be prevented from killing himself. So now she travels back in time, stops him, and disappears again, and it all starts again. 

This however doesn’t make for a very good story. So the easiest way to look at it is that by stopping her dad she removed that version of herself from existence and created an alternate timeline/reality from that point forward where her dad doesn’t kill himself. ",TheCrimsonDagger

"[WP] It’s 11:42 at night; you and one other person are the only two passengers on the subway. The other passenger tells you that you better choose your next stop carefully, because once you’re there, you’re stuck there forever.",cat-pants,"When I eventually looked up from my phone, there was no one else left on the train.  The phone had lost its signal a few stations back, but I didn't bother to put it away then, the habit itself having grown more comforting than anything else.  I could say it was the silence, though even then I had spent many a night content with just the constant rumble of wheels on tracks.  The whistling sound of 25 mph squeezed through tunnels of concrete was home in my ears.  There really wasn't any reason why I looked up, but to call the occurrence unexplainable would be lending mystery to the mundane.  Like so often was the case, I just did.

I checked my watch: 11:42 PM.  It wasn't the last train of the night, and even then there would have always been a few other late riders scattered across the car with me, their noses buried in a book, or a screen, or a thought.  And yet when I looked around the subway car, my eyes gliding across the empty seats in search for any other soul, I eventually realized that I must have been completely and absolutely alone.  It didn't sit quite right with me.  Maybe it's happened before and I had never noticed, but on that night I did and it felt like the first time it had ever happened to me.  And maybe it was.

I wanted to make a noise.  Perhaps it was the emptiness, the feeling of being the only breath in a machine, and that at any moment I too could become part of it.  I wanted to make a noise, but how could I?  Even then, alone and apart as one could ever be, I felt the rules of society forcing me to keep the peace.  The judging eyes which weren't here still existed, and I felt them watching me as though they had never left.  There was only me to shame, and I was enough.  

And then there was the other perhaps, the other possibility: I was afraid that if I tried to make a noise, nothing of consequence would come out.

""Hello?"" I asked into the car, my voice cracking just a hair with the last syllable.  I immediately felt embarrassed, bracing myself for the ridicule, and when nothing else responded I felt embarrassed for having felt embarrassed at all.  ""There's no one here,"" I told myself and aloud.

""Can I help you?"" a voice replied, and simultaneously my head turned towards the sound while my heart leapt towards my throat.  Leaning against the closed subway doors, and somehow hidden behind the end of the row of seats, was an elderly gentleman.  His eyes were closed even as he spoke to me, his head gently bouncing along with vibration of the subway walls.  For every wrinkle in his suit there was one on his face, and not one of them felt out of place.

""I'm sorry, I thought I was alone,"" I stammered out, the blood rushing to my cheeks and silent laughter burning in my ears.

""No, no, it's quite alright,"" the man responded, waving the apology away.  ""I'm rather awful at making myself known.""

""You didn't have to,"" I offered, slowly regaining my composure.

""This isn't the first time, believe me.""  The man opened his eyes then and walked towards me, his pace slow and even.  When he was just a couple feet away, he stopped and held out his hand.  ""Quinn, is it?"" he asked.

I stared at him, dumbfounded, and didn't move.  ""How did you know?""

He stared at me for a long moment, a deep and somber look in his eyes, before his face finally broke out in laughter.  ""Your name tag,"" he pointed out with a smile.  I glanced down at my work badge, dangling from my lapel, and felt the heat in my ears again.  ""Oh, of course,"" I muttered, before I couldn't help but chuckle along with him.

The man wiped his eyes, a smile on his face.  ""Wouldn't it have been something though, if somehow I really did know your name?"" 

""Yeah, it would have,"" I agreed, without giving much thought to it at all.

The man leaned against one of the vertical bars.  ""Long day?""

I nodded.

""Heading home?""

I nodded again.  ""Finally.  I miss my bed.""

""I know the feeling.""  He looked past me then, at the blur of tunnels through the window, and sighed.  ""Do you know where we are?"" he finally asked.

I shook my head.  ""I'm waiting to hear the announcer myself,"" I responded, and then immediately began to wonder why it's been so long since I last heard the train's voice.

""But you know where your stop will be.""

""Eventually.  It's gotta come around sometime, right?  And if I missed it, I'll just ride the train around.""

For a while then he just stroked his chin, deep in thought.  Somehow my answer seemed to both amuse and sadden him, if that was even possible.  ""What if you can't though?"" he suddenly asked me, right when I thought he had given up on a conversation.

""Excuse me?""

The man sat down on the seat across from me and wrapped his arms across his chest.  ""I need to tell you something important, and I need you to make a decision, the most important decision you will ever make in your entire life.""  He glanced at his watch, a timepiece as old as himself, and sighed.  ""I'm sorry, but there isn't much time left.""

""What are you talking about?"" I asked, my voice rising with concern.  

Please, believe me.  There was such a sincerity in his voice, in spite of the absurdity of his words, so that even as it was impossible to believe in what he was saying I felt absolutely convinced that I needed to hear it.  ""Listen to me,"" he continued.  ""There is a stop coming up, not too far from here.  And after that there will be another stop, and another one, and another, and so on.  And eventually you will have to decide which one to get off.  And you will have to make peace with your decision, because once you get off, you will be stuck there forever.""

I stared at him, my mind struggling to process what he was trying to tell me.  ""Wait, what do you mean?  Are they closing the subway line?""

""No, no, you don't understand.  The line stays open.  You just won't be able to get back on.""

I leaned back in my seat, instinctively. ""Is that a threat?""

The man sadly shook his head.  ""No, it's not.  To be honest, I don't really have a say in this.  I wish I did.  I thought I did.""

A pause.  I held my breath, waiting for something to happen, but nothing did.  The train continued to rattle on, tirelessly into the night.  The man still sat across from me, his hands now open in his lap.  And despite his ominous words, despite the burning confusion in me, I felt the animal fear slip away from inside of me and a very human curiosity replacing it.  ""Who are you?"" I cautiously asked.

""I built this train, a long time ago,"" the man answered and didn't, at the same time.

""You built this train?"" I repeated, incredulous.

""And the tracks, and the tunnels, and the stops.""

""How could you even do all that?""

""Time,"" he said with a shrug.  ""I had time and nothing else to do.""

I glanced out the window, even though I knew what there was to see, and the banal familiarity was a small comfort.  ""So what you're saying is that I have to pick a stop.""

He nodded.

""And once I pick a stop, I can never leave.""

He nodded again.

I turned to face the man again.  ""If you built the stops, can't you tell me which one to get off at?""

The man lifted his hands weakly, helplessly.  ""I don't know which ones are which anymore.  And even if I did, it wouldn't matter.  You have to pick.""

I thought for a moment.  ""Are some better than others?""

The man shrugged.  ""Some were made to be good, some were made to be bad.  Some people hate the good ones, some people love the bad ones.""

""Well, what if I just ride the train and never get off?""

""The train always ends eventually, and when it does you won't get to choose which station you arrive at.""

""I'm not sure you're giving me a fair choice here.""

""I never said it was fair, only that it was important.  Hurry, the first stop is here.""  And as if on cue, the train slowed to a crawl until it had reached the first platform.

The doors silently slid open.  I peered out into the station, but the lights were out and no one else was there.  ""What about you?"" I asked.

""What about me?"" the man asked in return.

I turned to face him.  ""Where do you get off?""

""When everyone else has made their decision, I suppose.""  The man began stroking his chin again, watching me with every intent and thought possible.  

""If every stop is a mystery, that means they're all the same, and if they're all the same, why is it so important that I have to decide?""

""It'll help the both of us sleep at night,"" the man finally answered, and this time he looked away from me.

I turned back to the station.  I could feel the train itching to move, the wheels motionlessly rubbing against the metal tracks beneath them in tired anticipation.  Time was running out, and still nothing made sense unless you thought about it.  Or maybe it was the other way around.  Or maybe it didn't matter at all, and never did, and never will.  Maybe it was just the way things were.  

""I guess I'll pick this one then.""  So I took a step and got off at the stop.  The doors slid shut behind me and the train moved silently on.  One short moment later I was alone again, and for a moment I didn't know what to do.  Should I wait for another train, perhaps, one that made a bit more sense?  Should I call someone, to tell them of the events that just took place?  

It only took another short moment before I made my decision.  I shoved my hands into my pockets and started the long walk back home.",freakofnatureIO

[WP] It was a dark and stormy night...,enochxarr,"This one was quick and dirty. Haha. Criticism welcome. Happy Halloween!

***

It was a dark and stormy night when I felt the life drain out of her. It was my fault. I did it. I didn't mean to, but I did. 

She was so young. Clean. Pure. Unsploiled by the cruel demands of daily life. I knew when I saw her I had to have her. It sounds like a cliche. I know that. 

But you don't know what I felt when I saw her. She filled me with optimism, she made me feel like my life would be better- only if she were mine.

And those curves. Those fucking curves drove me wild. I just held her underwater. It was easy, really. I watched her die. I felt her systems shut down.

It was her fault, really. If you think about it. After all, they advertised water resistant- how was I supposed to know that's not the same as water proof. HOW WAS I SUPPOSED TO KNOW THAT?? Now i'm trapped with this god damn phone payment. 

I wonder if it's under warranty.",Abbo-22
[WP] It was a dark and stormy night...,enochxarr,"It was a dark and stormy night,I had spent three days in the saddle and the journey had barely began. I had travelled this path many times before, I knew every little trick and danger the route could provide. The rain hammered down upon my shoulders while the wind cut right through my coat and jacket to freeze the bones underneath. I could never get accustomed to the cold like I had the route, four years I have been a messenger for the Parker mining company moving mail between the town and the mine. I hate ever moment of it, im constantly either too hot or cold and have saddle sores which have made the stoutest doctors lose their demeanour.

I get scared out here on my own sometimes, there is nothing to protect me out here all i have is the colt. I am so many miles away from the civilised world its so lonely out here, you could start to think no one else lives on this world but me and my horse trigger. Most nights do feel like that but last night was different, i had a hunch someone was following me.

The cold was just a bit colder, stars shone dimmer and I didn't feel alone. I kept my hand right on the holster the whole time waiting to see if what ever was following me wanted to take a chance. I didn't sleep that night I kept right on going until i could feel the sun over my shoulder. I remember that whole night I could hear a metal clanging every second it would repeat following me all the way up the valley, I wasn't going to stop to have a look around.

The imperious Flying type was now perched on the top of his bookcase, eyeing Pikachu warily.

He recognised the signature on the letter. He'd seen it before, when he was a young Trainer, a year into his travels. That letter had been delivered by a Pidgey, and he'd replied even though he thought it was a joke. When the stern-looking woman had arrived at his campsite the next day, appearing literally out of thin air, he'd been amazed.

She'd explained all about magic, and his ability to use it. About the hidden society of witches and wizards that co-existed with humans and Pokémon. About the school he'd been invited to, to learn how to use his powers.

She'd also explained that it was forbidden for a witch or wizard to be a Pokémon Trainer. That he'd have to abandon his lifelong dream, and the companions he'd come to care for. That he would have had to leave Pikachu behind, forever.

She wasn't surprised when he rejected her offer of schooling. He probably wasn't the first Trainer to refuse to leave their life behind, or the last. And ever since then, he hadn't heard a word from the magical society in nearly twenty years. Until today. Until this letter dropped onto his table over breakfast.

""What do you think, Pikachu?"" Ash questioned, looking at his oldest companion. The loyal Electric type gazed at him steadily in response, tail flicking slowly from side to side. ""Yeah, you're right. There are kids there. Innocent children, who don't deserve to be hurt or killed in a war they shouldn't have any part in.""

Ash reached for a pen and paper, to write a letter back to McGonagall. Scrawling his signature at the bottom, he held it out to the waiting Noctowl. The Flying type leapt off the bookcase, snatching the letter in its talons as it spread its wings and exited through the open window.

""I suppose I should think carefully about who to take? I mean, besides you of course.""

----

A couple of days later, Ash was soaring over Hogwarts. He'd made good time to get there, but he was already late. Battle had already been joined. Flashes of light flew between the two sides. He wasn't even sure where to start.

_Pika pika_

Ash looked towards where Pikachu was pointing. Oh, the Snorlax-sized spiders currently scurrying across the grass were probably as good a place as any. He leaned down and wrapped his arms around Charizard's neck. Pikachu gripped tightly to Ash's clothing.

""Use Flamethrower on those giant spider things,"" he commanded. The Fire type dived down eagerly, spewing flames over the spiders with a mighty roar. After several passes the spiders were in full retreat, those that hadn't already burnt to a crisp fleeing for the safety of the trees. Few made it, as they were skewered by arrows fired by what looked like horse-human hybrids.

""I guess they're on our side. Make sure no one attacks them unless they attack us first."" Pikachu chirred his agreement from atop Ash's head.

Ash directed Charizard to land in a clear space away from the worst of the fighting. A few wizards glanced over at them, but the fighting was too fierce for anyone to confront the Trainer and his Pokémon. Ash pulled the four remaining Pokéballs from his waist and threw them in the air. Sceptile, Lyanrock, Noctowl, and Corphish appeared in front of him.

""Attack the humans with the white masks on their faces. They're trying to hurt children, so don't hold back. I'll be in the air, with Charizard, keeping an eye on you all."" The four Pokémon all voiced their understanding and charged towards the battle. After a few seconds' hesitation, Pikachu jumped from Ash's head to follow after them.

Ash trusted his Pokémon to be able to tell friend from foe, and to use their attacks without being micromanaged by him. Lightning, fire, rocks, bubbles, leaves, and psychic blasts devastated the ranks of the masked attackers, who fell back before the unexpected assault. The defenders, although shocked, soon rallied behind their new allies.

A giant snake, twice the size of even the largest Arbok or Seviper Ash had ever seen, emerged from the long grass and reared up behind Pikachu, its coils lashing out to wrap around the mouse-like Pokémon. Before Ash could yell a warning, one of the wizards jumped at the snake with a tremendous yell, striking at its head with a gleaming sword. Despite the snake's size, the sword sliced cleanly through it, decapitating the beast, and saving Pikachu from being snake chow. A dark mist arose from the snake's corpse, letting out a soul-chilling scream before it dissipated in the evening breeze.

Ash shuddered. That was _not_ normal.

Eventually the leader of the enemy appeared, both sides clearing a space for him as he strode onto the battlefield. A large man stumbled behind him, chains wrapped around him, and the body of a teenager in his arms. A body which the ugly looking man directed him to drop on the floor.

""Harry Potter is dead,"" the snake-looking man announced, his voice magically enhanced. ""I, Lord Voldemort, am victorious. Lay down your wands, and I will be merciful. Not a drop more magical blood needs to be spilled this day."" He turned to face Ash, hovering above the battlefield. ""And if you, Trainer, abide by the treaty and leave the wizarding world immediately, I will not order reprisals against the non-magical world for your interference here.""

Ash gritted his teeth in anger. McGonagall's letter had been very clear: Harry Potter was the _only one_ capable of defeating Voldemort, due to some bullshit prophecy. Even if he ordered all of his Pokémon to use their most powerful attacks at the same time, it wouldn't be enough. Yet he didn't trust this... creature to keep his word, to leave those who surrendered unharmed.

But if he didn't retreat, then people in _Ash's_ world would die. Not everyone had Pokémon capable of defending them.

Before Ash could recall his Pokémon, the apparently-dead teenager moved. Leaping to his feet with surprising agility, he grabbed his wand from Voldemort's grip and launched a flurry of spells at the dictator. Soon the two were locked in a duel that no-one was willing to interrupt. Eventually Voldemort was blasted off his feet, landing in a crumpled heap on the floor, unmoving.

For a few heartbeats nothing moved. It was like the whole world was waiting for Voldemort to get up, to resume the duel.

When he didn't, the attackers' nerve broke. They turned to run as one, fleeing from the vengeful defenders who pursued them. Ash checked his Pokémon from joining in; striking at someone's back was a cowardly move. He recalled all of them apart from Charizard, and landed briefly so Pikachu could jump onto his shoulder once more. Before anyone could challenge him he took to the air once more, turning Charizard back towards the nearest village with a Pokémon centre, where they could rest for the night.

[WP] You wake up in a car and see a handwritten note under the windshield wiper. It says “Stay in the Car.” You don’t remember how you got here or where the note came from. But the note is in your handwriting.,mcrebecky,"Ugh. I haven’t felt this bad since my first hangover. I’m in my car, but I have no recollection of how I got here. What’s going on? I’ll just step outside for a second and see where I am. Oh wait, there’s something on my windshield. It looks like a note. Hmm, let’s try to look closer. 

&amp;nbsp;

Well that’s interesting. The note is in my handwriting. Funny.

&amp;nbsp;

“Stay in the car.”

&amp;nbsp;

Okay, I was just going to go outside for a second. I guess I’ll stay put. 

&amp;nbsp;

I sit back in my seat. Just as I close my eyes and my car shudders which scares the living daylights out of me. What the heck? I look down. There’s another note! I don’t remember writing one of these. 

&amp;nbsp;

“Two Tailed Shifter.”

&amp;nbsp;

Uh oh. I’ve got a two tailed shifter outside. That means that I can only retain memories for a short period of time while I’m within it’s memory jamming range. It must be near me right now.

&amp;nbsp;

I stare intently at my notecard. I can’t forget it’s there, or I’ll get out of my car and that’s exactly what it wants me to do. 

&amp;nbsp;

Crap. My notecard on the windshield is gone. I guess it knocked it off. 

&amp;nbsp;

Now it’s all becoming more clear. The shifter likes to circle its prey. Once it leaves, I’ll have  a short period of time to put that card back up on the windshield so when it comes back and I lose my memory, I’ll see the not. Makes perfect sense now.

&amp;nbsp;

Okay, I can think clearly now. It must be gone. I open the door, prop the card back on the windshield, and close the door. I’m safe for now, but I’ll have to keep doing this until morning when the creature will naturally hide. Ugh.

[WP] You wake up in a car and see a handwritten note under the windshield wiper. It says “Stay in the Car.” You don’t remember how you got here or where the note came from. But the note is in your handwriting.,mcrebecky,"My consciousness slowly seeps back into life as I sit up slowly with an excruciating headache. My legs are numb, there's silence everywhere. I can't recall where I was or why I was here but, it seemed to me that the house in front of my car was looming down on me.

I pull down my sun visor to trigger the automatic lighting system in my car in front of me and a note falls down.

""Stay in the car"" it says.

To my understanding and memory, I can't seem to remember when or how I wrote it. I only know that I wrote it because it's... It's my handwriting. When did I write this?

I observe my surroundings further. The small slit of the slightly opened window to the left of me allows me to hear the silence of the woods. The fog creeping around the sides and inside of the house look like souls of the prior residents wandering the halls of the mansion in the late night. Wind blowing silently across the dead concrete of the lifeless pavement.

I pick up the note once more and try to remember how I got here until I noticed something on the back. It was a hand drawn map. I was sick of this nonsense, I wanted to get the hell out of here.

Readily, I turn the key into ignition but my car laid there. I try once more and again, and again, then again. Nothing. My car, dead as the night around me. 

Anxiety attacks my self esteem and I begin to cower in fear. No matter how many times I tried the ignition, my car would not show any hints of life. The light of sun visor goes out. The only illumination is now the moonlight creeping through the gaps and cracks of the clouds.

I sit back into the driver's seat wondering what I should do. I look at the map again but there's nothing special about it.

My car begins to accelerate along the dirt and gravel towards the iron gate, increasing speed slowly toward the mansion. I sit still watching as everything moves by itself with my very own eyes. The wind grows stronger and begins to howl into a tornado of leaves and broken off branches. The windows begin to open carelessly, some exploding out and evaporating into nothingness. Is my mind playing tricks on me? I'm going to pass out! Someone help me!

...

It stops. Everything is silent now. The wind had stopped howling, my heart had stopped racing. The mansion, now lifeless compared to what had just took place. 

I get out of the car, ignoring the note and I walk up to the pavement to greet the twin doors.

They creak open and I walk in.

A narrow hallway welcomes my entrance and the doors slam shut behind me. It's dark, I couldn't see a thing. A door at the end of the hall opens slightly, light creeping into the area. It's beautiful. I don't know what about it was so stunning it just, it was so appealing. The entirety that I was in the empty and dark hallway all alone, all I wanted was something to be with me. I started walking toward the door, mesmerized by how exquisitely it shined through the small crack of the door. It gets closer and closer, almost as if it is reaching out to me. I open the door and the intense rays invade my iris, nearly blinding me.

Not a bad one. But a good one. Like yesterday. And the day before. 
Every day is good, when your name is John Smith jr., because every day essentially is the same. He is the kind of guy to honestly answer an 'How are you?', because he is always 'Just fine.'
John was quite proud about his routines at times. When he saw people swept away from sadness or overly joyful, he smirked a little - just a little, not too much of course - shook his head and reminded himself, how glad he was, that his life was just mediocre; without highs and lows, but filled with ok-ness.
So as he was leaving work at point 5pm he remembered leaving his beloved - not too beloved though, after all it was just an object - Toyota at home, because he felt like walking through the morning glances of a beautiful day in autumn. Well, now it was raining. And he scolded himself for falling out of his routine. When was the last time he just ""changed plans"" just because he ""felt"" like it. It should have been a warning - a small slip-up in the uninteresting life of John Smith jr., but by the time, he just laughed it off.
When he finally entered his appartement and saw the familiar phrames of his wallmart-furniture, he sighed. 
Finally, he thought. 
Ordering some food (he was a mediocre cook, not the worst, but not good either), relaxing a bit while watching whatever Netflix got in mind for him today.
While he turned on the radio, he suddenly heard an unfamiliar sound.
His doorbell.
For the first time since he woke up, he lost the semi-smile, that seemed to be printed on his not ugly, but not really attractive face.
'Who could it be?', he wondered.
'Chess-club is at Richards place this sunday and drinking one or two beer (never more, after all you had to be responsible in a world this dangerous) with his colleagues was due traditionally on friday.
He opened the door.
His eyes widened. His jaw dropped. He stopped thinking for a second.
The only sound came from the pouring rain and some popstar singing a pop-song in his room (not an exceptional, but a good one).
In front of his unimportant appartement, standing on his boring doormat, stood a woman.
A really beautiful one. No, the most beautiful woman he had ever seen.
The woman smiled. He stared at the gentle curve of her lips.
He was so lost into his observsation, he managed to overhear what she just said.
With a rather puzzled look he quick-wittedly answered: ""What?""
He usually was a really calm guy, but now his heart was racing (something that had not happened in years), he was shaking and couldn't grasp a thought.
She smiled again (""God, i wish i could make a picture of this smile."", he - who had not touched a camera in his whole life, thought.) and repeated her sentence:
""I'm sorry, if i am interrupting you. My name is Megan, i'm a dancer (he usually despicted dancers, after all, why couldnt they get a real job?) and just came from practise when it started to rain. My phone died, but i'd really need a cab, so can i call one from yours?""
""Ehm"", he begun strongly, "" yes. Ahem yes, yes of course.""
He gave her his iPhone (not the latest one, but relieable) and watched her quickly typing in a number. He was so lost in watching her tiny, fragile fingers touch the screen, he himself had used so often, that he realized almost too late, that she would just take the cab and leave afterwards. 
He had to intervene. Sweat was pouring into his eyes, as he shouted: 
""I COULD DRIVE YOU HOME!""
She looked at him confused, but a little amused aswell. When he noticed the volume of his sentence, he calmed himself down, before adding:
""It would be my pleasure.""
After what felt like an eternity, she nodded and smiled. This time just for him. He felt a warm sensation in his chest area. 
To his relief, she seemed to like the Toyota (""My grandpa drives one of these aswell.""). When he turned on the car-radio she sung with another dull pop-star, saying that it was her favourite song.
To his surprise he answered: ""Mine too!""
He had never felt the need to know details of people' life. He knew enough to write them a birthday- or christmas-card, so why bother with more information.
So he was really surprised, when she started talking and he caught himself listening very deeply and asking more questions.
The ride ended way too soon and as he parked his car at the adress Megan gave him, she turned around:
""Thanks for helping out a woman in need, John. You've saved my evening.""
""Yes."", he answered absent minded, desperatly trying to make her stay, to keep on talking.
She left the car with a smile.
""Megan."", he said, as she was walking down the path to one of the little houses.
She turned around. ""Yes?""
""Would you, like, give me your number?""
She smiled again. Then she pulled out a pen and wrote a serial of numbers - the most important one in Johns eyes - on the most important piece of paper. 
He knew that she would probably ruin his routine. His mediocre life, without highs and lows. 
But he didn't care. It was boring anyway.",GraysPicture

It had really happened.

But wait... What was this? How could a light be coming ON?! Was this someone on the brink of death fighting their cause? Fighting for their life. 
I set off at a run following my internal mapping. I had to reach this light. Help them if I could.


I got closer and closer. The light dimmed a couple of times but stayed strong and steady. I heard a noise in the distance...


It sounded... Odd? I had never heard the likes of it before. A cross between a goat (I heard one once in the file archives) and something new. Something unfathomable.


I reached the place where the the light emanated from on my map. Nothing but frozen bodies lay. What was I seeing, where could this life form be?! Surely not just residual warmth confusing the monitor?


That sound again. Breaking through the night silence. Almost lighting up the darkness. I listened closely and tried to walk towards it. It came from everywhere, behind me and from all directions. What was this cry renting in the air? Wait... A cry...? A thought came to me... Is that not how the sacred mothers describe the noise of their babes? 


I looked around me anew. Oh! A movement. I swear something moved! There! On the ground! What was that?!


I moved in closer. And closer and closer. There. There lay a babe. A babe I was so sure, never have I laid eyes on such a thing but surely this wriggling pale thing must be what the folktales described. It must be so cold. What to do? It's naked. Must be cold. What can I do for this poor creature?


I picked up the babe by what looked like the face. I cradled it. Surely, how can this have happened. How can an innocent babe have been brought into this cold, cruel, diseased world.
I held it and it's tears stopped coming. I looked at it's eyes. Is the old saying true - the eyes are the window to the soul?


I paused. It looked back at me. I saw wonders unimaginable. A babe. Here in my arms. I would protect it. Forever. ",TheSoloDiner

The board is dark now. Two years ago it shone like the fucking night sun- lights blinking into and out of existence. 

They went out all at once and then one by one. Those few who lived past the outbreak didn’t stand a chance alone. I watched the lights brush past each other and never meet and fade away. 

I wanted to play god. If five, if ten of those lights flashed together maybe they would’ve stood a chance. Maybe I could bring them together. 

Maybe, maybe, maybe. Lived the lie of maybes.

There are no maybes anymore. There is only what is and what never will be. 

And I’m alone in it all. 

I turn off all the lights for the first time. The bunker is dark and quiet and peaceful. 

I’m not afraid of the dark anymore. 

I push against the heavy metal of the main door. It groans and opens into the dark and empty field. The wind whistles and sings over the tall summer grass. 

I see the lights again. The board the way it was, the way it should be. A map splattered across my eyes. 

The stars are on fire against the ink of the night. They burn brighter than they ever have or ever will again.

The last few lights blink away and you’re the only one left. You prepare to walk out into the cold night alone. But a light blinks on, and it’s close by.",DarthReece,"The software was old, and the monitor was too, but it did it's job as the plague hit the artic reasearch bases.  Lifesigns began to wink out with every passing sweep of the radars rotating signal receiver.  I watched as in a matter of a few hours as greenland's coastal bases shut down.   Whatever this disease was, it hit fast and was terrifyingly lethal.   The other four people here at Summit had left, recalled back to Kangerlussuaq to provide another set of hands to deal with the incoming refugee ships coming across the ice-choked bay.  Soon, what was left of humanity in Greenland went silent as dot after dot went out.   Another sweep and another couple of missing dots.  Another sweep, and it was down to two.

I sat up as I noticed one of the dots showed progress straight towards me.   Another sweep and it was the only one left on the board.  Another survivor to this Apocolypse.   I checked the actual radar and realized I had someone approaching by plane, and smiled.   At least I wouldn't be lonely up here.    Rushing out the door, I looked up into the impossibly bright blue sky here in the frozen north and scanned the horizon south.   There, just coming into view, was the plane.   For the next few minutes I did nothing but watch, waving as it came closer, and then my heart sank.   The plane dipped suddenly, and then pitched and yawed out of control.   In but a few seconds, and a few hundred yards, the plane suddenly nose dived and smashed into the ground in a small explosion.    Dropping to my knees in shock, I closed my eyes and pushed back the tears.   I had plenty of time to steel myself for this possibility.   Summit was about as remote as you could get, and the entire reason I was left here was to monitor the equipment until everyone got back.   The possibility the disease would evolve again and survive in this harsh cold was there, but everyone discounted it in favor of becoming one of the last refuges for survivors.   I however, had stayed behind both as someone to keep the seats warm, and to be the last man standing, far away from any infection.   We knew that this was standard for any situation that had this sort of outcome.   Wait out the disease, then try to connect with survivors.   That rising column of smoke told me that I was it.  The last man standing in Greenland, and the only one left to tell it's tale.

So of course, when I turned back to the screen and saw a green dot close to my own, I sprang into action and threw away any thought of protecting myself from that disease.  Someone was still alive in that wreck, and I HAD to save them.   Throwing on the fire retardent and bright yellow snow suit we kept around in case of fire, and putting the breathing mask on, I tromped out of the big house and down into the snow below.   The sun was low on the horizon, and a wind was kicking up snow, suggesting haste.   Jumping on the snowmobile I kept nearby with emergency supplies, I started out towards the wreck.

But a light blinks on, and it’s close by.",DarthReece,"What I found when I arrived was something straight out of a nightmare. Debris was everywhere and the backdrop of the setting sun and the roaring fire gave the figure and otherworldly glow as it stood there in front of the bonfire. Its legs were bowed and crooked turned inwards, shattered yet still functional. The body itself was mangled and barely recognizable, and a misshapen broken hand steadied its half bent frame. I couldn’t see anything resembling a head or upper torso from my angle, but by the angle of its spine, I was amazed whoever this was could walk. I gripped the fireman’s axe tightly as I went down the small impact crater and approached the wounded figure. Swallowing some bile, I dumbly asked. “A-Are you okay?”

The THING that whipped around was no longer human. Cold blue eye met my own from the ruined remains of a head, the spine swaying as it held the corpse’s upper torso in place. It’s jaw unhinged and screamed at me in a high pitched shriek, and it tried to shamble towards me in at an alarmingly quick pace for its broken frame. I stumbled backwards in shock, falling flat on my ass as the thing approached, its guts trailing behind it gruesomely. In a few awkward but hurried steps it closed half the distance before the spine snapped audibly above the roaring flames behind it, the upper torso falling to the ground but instantly clawing forward with the stumps of its arms. I uselessly tried to back up on all fours, only managing to push a clod of snow towards it with my boots. It grabbed at my leg as it got close, its teeth biting down on my steel toed boots. It dragged itself nearly on top of me, readying for a lunge as its guts painted my legs with its blood. In desperation more than bravery, I swung at it with the only thing I could – the fire axe. Small and one-handed as it was, the blow knocked the things flesh bitten half destroyed chin off and embedded the axe into its skull. It puked up blood onto my faceplate, only causing me to flail more and hit it again, this time throwing it off me. Not wasting any time, and half blinded by the things bloody vomit, I jumped up to my knees and brought the axe down again and again and again. By the time I stopped, out of breath from my screaming and terror. I looked down to see its destroyed head and twitching body still. Looking around and wiping the blood and guts off as best I could I dashed to the snowmobile and made my way back to camp.

One long hose down, a shower with a third of the remaining soap on base and a lot of crazy thoughts later, I finally returned to the radar and bio-monitor room. Collapsing into my chair, I thought…Zombies. God damn zombies. No wonder the plague spread so fast. That thing was ruined beyond all recognition and still got up to try and kill me. Any corpse not in a state of falling apart would be terrifying. Another thought struck me. Am I now infected? Am I going to turn? Am I…

I looked at the screen to my left, my eye catching on something even more terrifying. Dots. Thousands and thousands of white dots registering life were back on the screen. All moving slowly towards the center point of the screen.  Every single person on Greenland seemed to be moving. Converging. All of them were coming for me.

"[WP] You’re sitting in your room, looking at your globe. You decided to rotate it a little, and suddenly the whole world moves with it. After realizing what had just happened, you begin to explore the possibilities the globe has to offer.",IssaSniper,"The globe. It was \*the\* globe. Do you understand, how incredible this was? I'm sorry for what I did to the Earth, but in my defense...well, no. I am a murderer of millions. I have no defense. All I have right now is my story.

&amp;#x200B;

I just made a couple of experiments to find the limits I had on this. I didn't want to cause an earthquake, fun as it may be; I'd just kill tons of people without actually doing anything fun.

It took a week, and I wrote the whole time. I had designed a way to test this globe, without killing more than 1 billion people. In return, I would know every secret of this globe, and could possibly pave the way towards a better world. A seventh of the population is little in terms of centuries.

&amp;#x200B;

The first thing I did was set up a Foucault pendulum in my backyard. Any adjustments made to the movement of the Earth could be measured with the pendulum, if not just noticed.

Next, I cleared my room of all debris. There was more preparation I could do, but I was impatient and hadn't thought of anything more in my rush for knowledge.

First, I touched the surface of the globe and waited for news of any earthquakes. While I know someone may have touched the globe in the last five years it's been in my room, for all I know it's just gathered dust. After four hours, I knew nothing had happened, so I then put my hand over my location (and the surrounding landmass), waiting for darkness. None.

I moved the globe over to the table in my room. It was lower than the dresser, and closer to the center of the room as well. Once again, I waited for hours, but nothing happened. I spun the globe again, and I felt a whirl and checked outside; for right now, spinning seemed like the only effective action.

A scalpel would be useful in finding out about the Earth's core, but I had little interest in such things. There clearly wasn't anything I could do in affecting the surface; it was just as resistant to warping as a scale model made of plastic was--that is to say, my hand wasn't able to damage it, but something stronger might.

I'm rambling. Officer...I poured a couple of drops of water on the Sahara and on California. I knew those areas suffer droughts. I didn't know that minutes of exposure to anything on the globe is what causes the ""anything"" to have an effect. Of course, I should have known because the globe has \*excellent\* ball bearings, and the spinning took effect after a couple of minutes of sustained spinning, but I...yeah, just...I hope you're taking that to some responsible scientists or something.

[WP] It's one minute after midnight and the doorbell just rang. Halloween is here.,Kitzinger1,"*”Are you fuckin kidding me?”* annoyed, Timmy sluggishly perches himself up on his good arm. He had no idea what time it was, nor did he really care with the hangover that was setting in. *that was one hell of a work party.*

“COMING!” He yells out to whatever dipshit is at his door. Glancing at that eerily bright neon digital clock, he sees 12:01. *Funny enough*, he thought to himself,* I guess it is Halloween now. *Each step was a slow one, followed by grunts and moans from the chaos bouncing around in his head. He fumbled for a bottle of Advil and popped a few in, wishing the relief would kick in before human interaction. 

He wasn’t the only thing getting older, his house was too. The time-softened hardwood floors creaked under every step, gasping for air. The heating didn’t work as well as it used to either, his breath visibly escaping on each labored step. He checked through the blinds to see if he could make out who was at his front door, the old ornate guardian from the outside world didn’t even have a peephole. 

And there she was. A petite young lady in a nurse getup, complete with stethoscope, mouth guard and oddly, syringes that looked full with honey, or something. He opened the door with the makeshift bowl of candy he readied while he popped the Advil. “Sorry for the wait, wasn’t expecting trick or treaters to be so...early. Or late. Or soon. Whatever it is, the ‘ol noggin ain’t working so well right now.”

*”It’s ok, Timmy”* her voice an empty whisper. “Trick or Treat!”

“Hold the fuck up, who are you, and how do you know my name?” He immediately snapped upright and alert, he surely didn’t know her.

Even though I looked like a cat now, it wouldn't change who I was. I became this way after dying in a car accident, not that any of this was my choice. I was out grabbing a pack of cigarettes for a friend in the middle of the night when a drunk driver who was going around hitting traffic signs mistook me for one. It all happened so fast. Before I realized it, I ended up as a little girl's imaginary cat.

""Kitty, you need to meow what you want to say. Otherwise you won't learn how to be a good cat when you grow up."" The little girl said. She sat in her car seat with concern filled eyes. She probably wasn't older than 5 or 6. I couldn't really get angry at her for being so silly. I could only bring myself to slowly convince her in a civilized manner worthy of a mature adult that i wasn't really a cat.

""My name is Jeff."" I slowly enunciated, refusing to meow. If I were to meow my responses out, how would she even understand what I was saying anyways? I'd also be a liar, and a liar is something that an honest man like me abhorred. I saw her parents in the front seat glance back with bemused expressions. Of course, they only saw one little girl sitting in the back seat talking to herself.

""Juliet, are you talking to that imaginary cat of yours again?"" Her mother asked.

""Yeah, but he doesn't meow like a cat and talks like us. He says his name is Jeff too."" Juliet replied, ""He's a really weird cat.""

""Jeff? A weird name for a weird cat."" I heard the driver, Juliet's father, chuckle. That caused the hairs on my neck to begin rising.

""Yeah, I think Kitty would be a better sounding name, so lets all call this friend of yours Kitty. I don't think Kitty'll mind at all."" I heard him say.

"[WP] You’re at an arcade playing one of those impossible claw games. You see a card that says ‘Girlfriend’ you try for it jokingly, and end up getting it.",LokusKitty,"Julian's room was being illuminated by the full moon as he lay in bed.  He held the card up and fiddled with it as he studied it.  The card was was the same size and shape of a playing card, except the paper was extremely heavy weight with a beautiful slick sheen.  It was colored a deep magenta, the word ""girlfriend"" was written in a cute, Barbie-like script. The whole card was overlaid in holographic.  As he fiddled with it in the moon's glow he thought he could see a female face in the glitter of the card. He flipped the card over giving it another glance.  Words appeared on the back.  He squinted at the card, ""was that there before?"", he whispered to himself...""MmY-co?"" He tried to pronounce it, ""whatever, its just a stupid card"", no one was there to listen....he shrugged to himself laid down and went to sleep.

The next day, Julian sat in his last class of the day, he glared at the clock as the teacher droned on about the importance of studying for the finals; he mocked her in his head ""senior year is faaar more easier than your next freshman year would be"" the voice in his head matched her tone and pitch directly, and he giggled to himself when he thought about her voice modulating when she drew out words; he thought it sounded like she was trying to juggle balls in her throat.  

""Is there something amusing?....Julian!"" She slammed her hand against the board in unison with his name, he snapped his head around to look at her...""No, Mrs. Peak"", he turned his head back to look at the clock, just three more miserable minutes.  He let his thoughts drift and began to think of the girlfriend card. He wondered what the word was on the back of it...what it meant.
The bell rang and Julian sped out the door, through the hallway,and into the sunlight of the day.  He paused to let his eyes adjust and to search for his friends. 

Derek and Tay we're waiting for Julian at the corner waving him down, hurrying him up.  

""Hello, ladies."" Julian mimicked tipping his hat as he greeted them.

""You are what you eat, my friend"" Derek smiled, he was quite impressed with his own cleverness

""You eat ladies?! What the fuck, man?"" Julian let out a loud roar of laughter.

""Right?! Man, cannibalism doesn't suit you...plus.. you're kind of an ass hole..."" Tay looked back to see the confused faces of his friends, he waited for the question...

Derek, trying to make sense of it and coming up empty, finally caved, ""What's me being an asshole got to do with anything?""

""Cuz, man,"" Tay explained, ""you gotta be able to get away with shit like that...and you ain't no , Jeffery Dahmer.""

Julian shrugged in agreement, ""you are an asshole"" He said it like he had just given Derek an official diagnosis. 
""Man shut the hell up, it's not like you're getting any pussy these day!"" Derek had gotten a bit butt hurt in the exchange, his friends had recognized his tone and fell silent.
Julian put his hands in his pocket...in his right pocket, there was something...""is that a card?"" He thought...he wrapped his fingers around it and pulled it out slowly...""that's strange"" he accidentally said out loud...
Derek, looking around as if searching for a way to change the subject, noticed his bewildered friend..""what's that?""
""Nah, uh..I was at the arcade last night and played one of those claw games and landed this wierd card."" 
Derek snatched the card from Julian's hand to inspect it further.  ""Girlfriend!!!! Ha!  Oh my God, bro for real?...are you gonna wish and pray on it that you lose your virginity before college???!!"" Derek had had gone into a frenzied laugh.
Julian rolled his eyes and was trying to ignore Derek, he turned to Tay, ""Hey, do you know what..MmY-co means?""
""I don't know, bro,"" Tay was puzzled ""spell it."" 
""M-i-c-o"" Julian said, he grabbed for the card and snatched it back from Derek who had become a howling maniac...""always laughing at his own jokes,"" Julian thought. Julian inspected the card, the back looked blank, but he could see the word. It's like the ink was bleeding out of the card, the word getting darker and darker...he turned it to face Tay.
Tay took a closer look and shrugged..""well, Mico-petra used to be a card game, so if it's that, you're right...but, if it's a name.."" he paused to sound it out in his head...""me-ko"" is how I'd pronounce it.""
""Me-ko"" Julian repeated.  He looked hard at the word on the card..""Miko"" he said again, ""I kinda like that"" when he looked up his friends had Frozen in place.  They were staring at something behind Julian...""What?"" he questioned and turned to look..
A black ball had appeared, except it wasn't a ball, it was ..2D, and it looked fuzzy.  It hovered in the air a moment and then began to grow bigger.  The boys, moved back a short distance, silence hung in the air with the mysterious darkness. Just then, a long slender leg, toes first, like stepping backward off the ladder, slipped from the orb, followed by another.  Long legs where followed by a bare and ripe bottom and a slender waist. Pink hair came flowing out like a river of cotton candy as an upper torso and arms appeared. Finally, a head full of pastel pink emerged.  Hands graced the edge of the mass, holding on, as the figure dropped to the ground and spun round to come into full view. She was shapely and beautiful, her purple eyes were gentle, her smile as graceful as her curves.  She stood naked and yet poised.

""I'm Miko"" the girl stated, staring at Julian,""...you called?""

"[WP] Men are out to kill you and you figure the most secure place to hide is prison. All you have to do is commit a crime to get incarcerated. One flaw with your plan though, you keep accidentally getting away with your crimes.",McSmaccles," Everything inside Dane’s body told him to start driving. He could hear the beat of his heart almost as loud as the police sirens quickly approaching. His chest had a tingling sense of danger as if he was hurling down a rollercoaster. His brain was racing with a million thoughts. This was it, there was no way he’d get away with this one. 

Dane’s phone, which lay in the passenger seat, lit up with a call from his brother, John. He turned the phone over and let it go to voicemail, he couldn’t bear to speak to his brother right now. Dane pulled a tape recorder from his glove compartment, he had almost forgotten to record his final thoughts. “Attempt number three, Riverview apartments parking lot, kidnapping 5-year-old Michelle Hayes…” Dane turned and looked into the back seat of his Toyota Camry at his niece happily eating ice-cream and watching Paw Patrol on her iPad. She wouldn’t go anywhere without her iPad and Dane was happy as long as it kept her distracted. Dane had picked Michelle up from home while John was working in his home office. It was easy, she loved her Uncle Dane. “Taken at 3:00 PM, um, I’m sorry John I know you’re scared…I would never hurt Michi but I just want to—I need to be safe.” He clicked off the recorder and shoved it into his pocket. He looked up into his rearview mirror, “Michi, it’s time to put your headphones in, remember how I showed you?” Michi nodded and clumsily put the headphones over her ears and plugged them in. As he opened the door and got out of the car, Dane smiled at how big the headphones were on Michi’s head. He knew he wouldn’t get to see her grow into them. He felt bad for having to involve his family in his mess, but he didn’t want to injure anyone, and his less serious attempts had failed already. Dane walked a few feet from the car and stood there waiting in the middle of his apartment building parking lot. The sirens were blaring now. 

*Just around the corner*, he thought.

The first police car pulled up just two minutes later and came to a screeching halt at the edge of the lot, blocking off the entrance. Dane put his hands up to show he was not a threat. To his surprise, the officer turned off his lights, hopped out of the car, and slowly walked up to Dane. “Hey there, Dane Hayes?” the officer asked. “Yes sir,” Dane answered as an ambulance pulled up behind the cop car. “Alright, we got an anonymous call about a child being kidnapped and taken to this address—you can put your hands down, sir” Dane dropped his hands to his sides, bewildered. “—we’ve been in contact with her father who said she is not missing, her uncle is babysitting her. We’re still required to check it out, you’re her uncle correct?”

*This must be a trick,* Dane thought, *he’s just getting close enough to arrest me or something, right?* 

“Yes…I’m her Uncle” Dane responded.

“Okay, we’re going to have the EMT’s take a look at her regardless, but she looks ok to me. Someone must have called this in as a prank…we get that sometimes.” 

*What the hell?* Dane thought. *You’re not even going to ask me questions?!*

The EMT’s checked Michi out, packed up, and left. The police officer apologized to Dane for the trouble and did the same. “Come on, Michi, time to go” Dane called out as he walked back to the car. Michi jumped up and grabbed his hand. “I’m hungry Uncle Dane,” she said. “Okay, we’ll stop at McDonalds,” Dane said as he picked Michi up and put her in the car. He felt defeated. The dizzy feeling in his head was now a migraine and the tingling in his chest turned into frustration. As he plopped into the driver’s seat, he leaned over and grabbed his phone from the passenger seat. 

“Siri, call John,” Dane spoke into his phone, he needed to know how his foolproof plan got so messed up. 

“Hey bro, is everything alright? I talked to the police earlier” John answered.

“I’m coming to drop Michi off now, what did you tell them?” Dane asked.

“They came to the house for a wellness check, I checked the GPS on Michi’s iPad and it said she was at your place, I was so worried…I didn’t hear you come to get her, I must have forgotten you were babysitting today.” 

*I wasn’t,* Dane thought, getting more irritating with every word his brother spoke.

“Yeah, well everything’s fine, see you soon.” Dane ended the call and shook his head. 

He knew his next attempt should be killing his brother for being the worst parent in the world. ",Honey_thic

Just hours ago he'd been set on this path of insanity, in the middle of the street after jumping out of a speeding van. Who caused this calamity? The latvian maffia. Go ahead laugh. It's less funny when they are after you. They don't look a specific way, like the italians or the Chinese. They dont even have a dress code and and are everywhere.

This requires drastic measures. The one place where their pale fingers hadn't reached yet was prison. It was simple.

John ran into the closest store, for women's clothing.

- ""GIVE ME ALL THE CLOTHES!"" as if possessed he started ripping clothes dolls, the stands even from people running by him. He grabbed a fancy blue hat with a green feather and put it on. Like a high-pitched screem the alarm yelled through the store. 

""REMEMBER ME, ALSO THAT I I'M KIND AND NOT HURTING YOU!"" John screamt at an employee running out of the store, phone against her ear.

-""Yes, yes, I told you he's screaming and taking clothes. YES! Right now, blue hat witha green feather!""

All he had to do was wait. In a moment the sirens were outside. John went to the glass door, waiting for the cops. His saviors. He could see them run on the outside, preparing. Maybe he'd overdone it a bit.

- ""You are going to prispn you freak"" A policemen yelled. But he wasn't speaking to John. He was pushing an old lady, cuffed, with a blue hat with a green feather. Promptly she was forced in the back of the car, with heavy protest. They drove off. Only cop one remained.

A black van slowly drove by, the glint of a black gun flashed briefly. John panicked. Three quick steps and he was outside, face to face with the cop.
- ""ARREST ME!"" It was futile, the cop looked confused.
-""I'm on a break, I don't care if you killed the president, let me eat my thai food alone.""

-""For the love... I'm sorry for THIS! "".
A right hook uppercut smashed the thaifood straight into the officers face, and beyond. He did half a flip, before landing on the ground, lifeless.
""Sir, are you alright? SIR?! Please, please just arrest me!"" Tears started to run down his cheeks. He was begging the unconscious man.

The black van drove by the corner again. Instinctively John pulled the officers gun out of its holster. He thought for just a moment but decided. He ran to the nearest crowd, the middle of the street.

And this is where we left off. John picked up the gun. He pointed it into the crowd. BANG. People scattered like cockroaches. All but one. A woman wearing a pink shirt with flowers and a cute red backpack. A pool of blood started to form. John had commuted the ultimate sin. Murder.

The sound of tires, sliding on the ground desperately trying to get a grip pierced the air. The black van opened and a rifle poked out. This was it, John thought. The rifle moved out, along with four others. But instead of latvian maffia, four FBI agents jumped out, running straight for the woman's body. One confronted me and asked
-""How did you know?""

-""Know what..? Please just arrest me for my cri..""

They had just opened the womans bag, a large, handmade bomb was revealed.

""I had nothing to do with that I was just trying to get arrested...""

-""What? You're in chock, get into the van we'll put you under our protection!""

-""But... I... Guess... this is fine.""",owliiver
"[WP] Men are out to kill you and you figure the most secure place to hide is prison. All you have to do is commit a crime to get incarcerated. One flaw with your plan though, you keep accidentally getting away with your crimes.",McSmaccles,"It seemed easy enough- walk up to a random person in broad daylight and shoot them. Then I'd be whisked off to jail, right? Nope.

""Do you know who you just killed, son?"" The deputy asked me. 

""N-no? But I've murdered him, you've got to take me to jail!"" I implored.

""Jail? Son, you're a goddamned *hero!* This guy is Jacob Cotton! The most notorious drug lord and human trafficker in the world! He was practically untouchable! You need to be celebrated!

""NO! YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND I'M GUIL-""

""Sheriff! Sheriff! Come quick! Cotton's dead! And we have this guy to thank!""

*You have GOT to be kidding me.* A crowd was forming, and I was being celebrated for murdering this guy in cold blood.

This is the fourth crime that I will walk away from Scott-Free! First was the bank robbery which happend to occur on the same day the president was in town... who was then nearly assassinated. Then, I tried to kidnap a kid, only to find that his mother was abusive and returned the ransom note with a two-word reply saying ""keep him.""  Then, becoming more desperate, I tried to stage a scenario where I'd attempt to force myself on an unsuspecting woman, who was into the whole thing the whole time and was practically begging me for it. Now this- when my desparation hit an all time high I went out, bought a gun and shot the first person I saw only to find out that they were one of the most wanted men in America, hiding in plain sight.

The crowd began to grow- *shit I need to get out of here.* No telling where *they* were now. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You see, my story begins about a month ago- after graduation:

We had a party out in the fields, near the edge of the woods on the Pinkerton's farm. Johnny Pinkerton made sure his parents were out of town that weekend, and we had a huge party, bonfire and everything. Me, being the romantic guy I am, was swooning Elizabeth Chantilly. We had broke off from the party for some... erm... one-on-one time... when we heard some voices- sounded like chanting of some sort? Stumbled upon this group surrounding a fire with their hands up, chanting something in a language i've never heard of... with a young girl strapped to a table- sitting next to another person... *whose throat had been cut.* 

I told Elizabeth to go call for help, and that I was going to step in to see if I could save that girl. Luckily I was carrying my graduation present- a brand new .45 1911 handgun. I slid one in the chamber, and popped out ""What the fuck is going on out here?!"" Their apparent leader turned to me and said ""This does not concern you, boy. I suggest you leave, or suffer our master's wrath!"" 

Looking back, I probably should have taken his advice, but, being as I was armed and stupid I didn't. ""Let her go, before I put one of these in your skull.""

""You dare challenge the Plaguebringer's most faithful servant? This girl is our sacrifice to his unyielding fury! His pestilence will wash over this land and cleanse the filth from our society, pray that you are not-"" ***\*crack\****

Shot him. Right between the eyes. Gotta say, it was pretty cool doing that- Well, I mean, not killing a person, obviously, but being the hero and having such an awesome shot, that was pretty cool!"" My adrenaline was pumping, so I didn't realize that the rest of them ran off and turned tail- would've killed to see that. Anyways, the police arrived, and the identified the leader as ***our church's pastor.*** Considering now that they've been firmly on my ass for the past month chasing me from state to state as I attempt to get thrown into some jail, I reckon someone else there knew who I was... 

&amp;#x200B;

And now, here I am, smack dab in the middle of some hillbilly redneck town with cameras thrust on me for the world- including those goddamned maniacs- to see where I am and how to find me....

"[WP] Men are out to kill you and you figure the most secure place to hide is prison. All you have to do is commit a crime to get incarcerated. One flaw with your plan though, you keep accidentally getting away with your crimes.",McSmaccles,"I walk along the street, a faint drizzle slowly but surely drenching my clothes and the gray sky an ominous forecast of what's to come. It seems that what’s to come can’t really get worse compared to what’s already here, but I know it can. Being free, being able to do whatever you want, being wherever you want is what most people desire, but not me. Being free means being chased, being hunted. Followed for the rest of my life, until I am rolled firmly into my grave. No, right now, my only road to freedom would be the road to incarceration. It’s harder to get on that road than it seems. 

So far, I have robbed two banks and a liquor store. I stole a car, broke into someone's house and set a dog on fire. I’m not too proud of that last one, but it’s gotten to the point where only survival matters. What matters most though, is getting caught for these crimes, which they somehow have been unable to do. I have tried to get as many witnesses as I could, performing the crimes as lousy as possible, leaving evidence lying around, but nothing has worked so far. I am the world’s luckiest criminal, though this inability to get caught is what got me here in the first place. It was a… displacement of blame that made me get away with my first - and what was supposed to be final - crime and landed a few others in prison. I assumed I just got lucky, but now I know it’s not just luck that’s preventing me from getting caught. And now that those other men have been let loose from their cells, I need that luck like I need a bullet in my brain. 

I reach the door I have been looking for, the door that when opened will hopefully lead to another door slamming shut behind me. I stand on the sidewalk and wait. My instinct is to cower behind the bushes, to make sure I don’t look suspicious, and I have to deliberately force myself to just stand there out in the open. I take the rifle from my backpack, not bothering to hide it, and swing it towards the door. I start firing, careful not to hit anyone. I don’t want to resort to murder – no one should have to die just because I don’t want to die – and I want to carefully construct a crime that would cause as little harm as possible, but still makes a hell of a scene.

People start screaming and running as I keep firing, emptying my cartridge into the brick of the wall. Some of them are filming, others calling the police. Good. 

I sense movement in the house and stop firing just as a young girl opens the door. She screams and moves to close the door but I’m already there, placing my foot in the doorway. She pulls on the door and starts crying but stares at me in shock when I point my gun in her face. I grab her jacket and pull her towards me, rifle pushed against her head. Her nanny rushes to the door just as I slowly move backwards, holding the girl in a firm grip. My rifle is enough to deter her from coming closer. Some men behind me are moving through the crowd that has now formed in the street, planning to overpower me, but if anything like that happens, people will definitely get hurt. I swirl around, wave my gun like a lunatic and aim it in their direction.

“Nobody move! If anyone moves, she dies. Stay there and no one will get hurt.” My voice sounds too even for the adrenaline rushing through my body. 

The moment seems to stretch over an eternity while I try to retain my threatening look, now and then aiming my gun randomly towards the crowd, waiting for the inevitable. Finally, police sirens wail in the distance. As the sirens move closer and the police arrive, time suddenly increases its speed until it feels as if none of it has passed between the time I was waving my gun in the street and the moment I was put in a holding cell. The drive from the street to the police station feels like a blur, just movement of trees and buildings speeding by until they run out of sight. Only moments pass between the days in the holding cell and my trial, though I know it has been much longer than that. 

As I sit in the courtroom and think about all that has happened, everything that lead me here, I wonder whether things could have gone differently. As I take the stand and tell the courtroom what happened, I know that it couldn’t have. I have received my own kind of punishment for that fateful, perfect crime, and it’s going to end now, one way or another. I know that as soon as I see the men that are haunting me sitting at the back of the room. I know it as soon as, incredibly, the judge announces me not guilty. The knowledge has become a fixed thing when the men in the back of the room make their way over to the front. A fight ensues, in which I am able to get hold of one of their guns, shoot one in the head and fatally injure another before the police is able to restrain me. 

The life sentence that has held me in a death grip for so long ends, but another begins. And starting from that beginning, my life consists only of mere moments. The moment my wish for my luck to desert me is granted the moment I need it most. The moment the next judge announces a life sentence for the murder on two men. The moment I’m put away behind bars forever, and those men will never again see the light of day. The moment everything ends.",ChiaraNova

"[WP] Men are out to kill you and you figure the most secure place to hide is prison. All you have to do is commit a crime to get incarcerated. One flaw with your plan though, you keep accidentally getting away with your crimes.",McSmaccles,"In another life, this would be a comedy of errors. Not here, not now, not in this mutilated sack of meat I call a body. Not with M.A.L.I.C.E. agents closing the gap between me and my choice of a crispy or extra crispy death-by-blaster.

Let me get you up to speed. People want me dead. They call themselves M.A.L.I.C.E., which I swear up to now I thought was something out of an old film adaptation of a young adult novel. Their agents definitely aren’t mid-twenties runway models masquerading as teenage assassins. And they’re sure as hell not out to learn the importance of teamwork, or independent-thinking, or how to question authority but not too hard here we don’t want to upset the status quo too much. They are certain death.

So, my buddy here, Trike, has a plan. We’re in my studio, me in my chair with the laptop bolted on a swivel arm, and him in his hover shoes. We don’t even have flying cars yet and this guy has hover shoes. Trike says, “You gotta get somewhere where they can’t get to you. I saw this documentary once called SUPERMAX.” All media is crowdsourced today. Likely he saw 3 minutes of stock footage of the New Haven Supermax intercut with 10 minutes of some jitter-cut talking head looking to wean himself off of Basic.  “Thirteen layers of security. Pop-up turrets. Procedurally-generated hallways.” He was rambling. One pale, tattooed eyelid was beginning to droop over a vacant eye like that sad clearance banner over the entrance of Amazon brick-and-mortar on Dixwell. He was also starting to drift into a corner, rotating slowly on the near-ideal frictionless surface that his hover shoes floated upon.

“But, look Trike, how do I get in?” Not really interested in the answer.

He bumped into the corner. “You *punch a cop!* No effing brainer!” Swiveling to look me in the eye, all business now.

“How do I punch a cop when I have no arms? For that matter, how do I even get to a cop with no legs? This chair can’t even navigate stairs for crying out loud.”

“I could carry you, but I don’t need to get locked up. Supermax is *clean.* Like super-clean. I need my *holos*. Speaking of which.” And he left, skating out with smooth strokes of his long legs that belied the *holo-*induced DTs which wracked him, sober or not.

But the idea stuck with me, and as I had no other ideas, his stupid, idiotic, drug-fueled plan sat dead-center on the blank slate of my mind. Pinned there like some badly metamorphosed but morbidly fascinating butterfly.

I called in a drone threat to the PD. I also had the state college English department AI drum me up a plausible manifesto and posted it to anarcho-reddit’s r/manifestos. “It’s for my novel,” I told the AI.

“Content flags still require that your request be reported to the relevant authorities,” The AI said.

“No, don’t do that. I’ll kill them too,” I said and cut the connection. They’d never trace my IP through my VPN but better than that, I’d included my building number in the manifesto and included detailed directions on how to find my apartment on the 5th floor. All of the doors and hallways in the building were a uniform hospital white. There were no unit numbers. And tenants were periodically shuffled based on the whims of a random number generator. Applied Anarchy. The Grand Experiment. Good on paper, but that shit sucked even when you had four working limbs. The last round of musical studios landed me in here, a one-roomer with the popcorn ceiling already peeling from the ceiling and a hole in the drywall into the neighboring unit that Trike patched for me with an old blanket.

I waited and prayed that the cops would arrive before those malicious bastards applied a similar ragged hole to my head.

And sure enough, there is a God. The PA alarms began to sound in the preprogrammed stay-put pattern. Three short bursts followed by a recording of some silky female voice telling us to *stay put in your units. The cops have no rights here. Remember to save all video and audio recordings directly to the cloud.* And so on. I heard them rounding the stairs to the landing at the end of the hall, could hear the *hiss-piss* of their pneumatic exoskeletons. Heard the crunch of their boots as they reached the apartment before mine. And then they were at my door.

I wheeled over to it and tried to look simultaneously as guilty as possible and as non-threatening as possible.

*POLICE! OPEN THE DOOR!*

I backed up smidge. Those portarams they’ve mounted to their exoskeletons tend to blow doors clean off the hinge.

*TAKE IT DOWN!* And then an explosion. A rain of plaster dust as the popcorn peeled away from the ceiling some more. I didn’t even flinch. The door stood as it had, as I knew it would. The trample of boots and whine of the mecha-suits could be heard distinctly through the wall of the next apartment down the hall. Figures.

But wait. I turned on a dime and powered my chair to the hastily patched hole in the wall. *No, no, no, no, no,* was all Reggie was saying. I could hear my neighbor through the wall as clear as I had heard Silky Stay-Put over the PA. I filled my traumatized lungs as best I could and I shouted: “Pigs! It’s me! I’m the drone master! I’ve got demands!”

“Jesus Christ, look at all the firepower,” came the reply. I was nonplussed.

“I want fifty million in cash! And a plane over the wall!” I had to stop speaking to clamp my teeth around a corner of the blanket that plugged the portal between apartments.

“Move sergeant! That’s not his leg!” And then the rat-tat-tat of automatic fire as the blanket came away with a final tug.

I looked in to see three exosuited cops crouched behind the largest terrarium I’d ever seen, an unsteady line of small caliber impact scars stitching its way up the side of the glass like a string of paper snowflakes. Bulletproof. Which made sense given the racks-upon-racks of guns mounted to every free surface in Reggie’s place. I conceded that he had it worse on musical studio days. Right now he was having it bad. He was limping to the shattered doorway and at the same time trying to jam an oversized banana clip into a slot on his thigh. “Hit him with the Calvin ball!” It was the voice of the sergeant. One of the subordinates popped up from behind the terrarium and leveled what I knew was a rifle or cannon but looked like a guitar case painted in black and yellow chevrons.

I didn’t wait to see him fire. I wheeled away, quick as I could, hit the plate that unlocked and opened my door with a shoulder. The door swung open and I just had time to see Reggie duck a dodgeball-sized pellet of rubber. Embossed in reverse and covering the entire surface of a Calvin ball was a repeated string of uniquely identifying digits. The thing bruised like hell and stamped you as a criminal to every hospital in the nation. Reggie regained his balance at the same time that I heard the cha-chunk of the rifle/cannon reloading. Think fast. How to salvage this?

Aiding and abetting.

Good enough.

I sped forward, made a hard turn to interpose myself between the authorities and Reggie. Reggie was raising his gun-leg, pivoting on the heel of his other leg like some kungfu disciple. The barrel of the gun was aimed right at the bridge of my nose. He had managed to slot the banana clip into his thigh. But when he saw me, his eyes went wide. And he faltered. And then the Calvin ball took off his head.

Those things were supposed to be less-than-lethal. But the cops were in a habit of hacking the cannon, like nerf-sport hobbyists, so that you never really knew what you were going to get.

In the end I was a hero. Selfless acts of bravery, one of the three cops told me as they moved to let forensics through the door. No reward, though. Strictly off-the-books. Liability issues, you know. I let them pat me on my shoulder stump as they left and returned to my apartment and closed the door.

Well. I tried. No comedy of error, this life. But there was something funny enough about it, I had to admit. But it’s not something I can hope to articulate.

So I sat back and waited for M.A.L.I.C.E. to come and end this sorry charade.

"[WP] You are being treated for a wound at the hospital, and you black out. You wake up, surrounded by bodies, in the middle of the forest. You are covered in blood.",NDOperator,"The putrid stench of decomposing corpses and the buzzing of flies met me as I awoke from my blackout. I opened my eyes slightly and looked to both sides, before slowly bringing my body up and looking around me. My eyes adjusted to the darkness as I took in my surroundings. Bleak, dark trees towered over me and stretched on into the dark short fog, the sound of crickets and distant animals startling me many times as I looked around. I identified the source of the awful smells as I gazed upon dozens and dozens of corpses scattered around me in all directions. Some hospital staff, some nurses, some doctors, but mostly fellow patients. I looked down at my hospital gown which was stiff from the dry, dark blood which had infiltrated the fabric and soaked into my clothing. I was the only one who was bloodied, and apart from the laceration on my neck I was in hospital for, I had no external injuries on my body. The blood was clearly not my own.

After a few minutes in shock I managed to pick myself up from the cold and muddy ground and slowly shamble across the forest. The further I walked the more bodies I came across, all of them with perfectly clean clothes and closed eyes. They seemed to be resting peacefully, with no signs of trauma or damage to their bodies. Some of them even seemed to be smiling slightly.

Without notice, a loud noise and a blinding flash of light consumed the forest and I collapsed to the ground out of shock and fear. I held my hand to the sky to block my vision, but the flash had vanished as swiftly as it had appeared. I began to hear a low ringing sound in the background, high pitched but gentle and quiet. As my eyes recovered from the flash I continued to explore my surroundings, taking in the sights of the forest and the endless stretch of bodies which surrounded me.

Then the next flash illuminated the trees and ground like a sudden burst of daylight. I braced myself with the sound and covered my eyes so as to not lose my vision again. The sound leading up to the flash started to become less mumbled and distorted, almost sounding like it was making out a phrase. The ringing sound gradually became louder, and I continued to slowly walk through the forest, with a few more flashes blinding me once more.

Then, I came across them. In the distance I could see a group of living people, huddled around something in the center of where they were standing. I sprinted over and I saw my family. They looked different to everyone else, and I couldn't make out what they were looking at, it was dark and cloudy, and I did not get a good look at it. They wore normal clothes and were hunched over. My wife sat there, her tear-stained handkerchief in hand sobbing quietly. My children cuddling up to my mother, hiding their faces from whatever lay in the center. My mother looked with concern and a disheartened look in her eye. I yelled out, touched them and did everything I could to get their attention. As I reached out to touch them, I noticed the blood on my gown had mostly disappeared, and I started to feel more alive and healthy as time went on. Suddenly, I heard the sound once again, but this time, I could make out what was being said.

*CLEAR*

After a final flash of light, I jolted awake in my hospital room. The constant ringing noise returned to a stable beeping. As the doctor and nurses moved away I say my children and mother rush to my side, followed swiftly by my wife, who came over, hugging me tighter than ever before, her tears running down her face and landing on my scalp.",Romejanic

I heard the Doctor call my name, I had fallen assleep in the hospital bed after some time talking with Angel about all of this future technology and lifestyle, I had spent 3 days so far talking to her every morning and afternoon, learning as much as I could. I rose from my stupor to see the Doc in his usual lab coat, but without the clipboard he brings to scribble the test results every time he has a new idea of what could be wrong with me.

""Yes, Doctor?""

""Look, Gerahrd, we have searched everywhere for any hint of who you are and where did you come from. We can't find any references to your name in any databases, neither modern nor from 1940.""

The last part cought me off guard. They had actually taken me somewhat seriously. He continued.

""Of course physically you're perfectly healthy, and this facility specializes in such things so I'm afraid we won't be able to provide you shelter much longer.""

 That unsettled me but I kept my composure, despite him being Jewish he seemed to actually care, which I found strange.

""Now, as far as the government is concerned you don't exist. So even though we legally should be forcing you to a mental hospital, due to the aforementioned fact of there being 0 records of you we could simply let you go. So, what would you like to do?""

I took a moment to consider my options. I had absolutelly nothing here, not even documents to verify my very existence, so simply going out and trying to make a living among the civilians may not be feasable. On the flip side, beginning my new life as a patient at a mental hospital doesn't sound that great either. 

While I was thinking, Angela walked in.

""Hi, Gerahrd! Hi, Doc!""

""Hi, Angela."" We both replied almost in unison.

""What is going on?""

The Doctor explained for me. ""We are discussing what is Gerahrd going to do while he either recovers his memories or adapts to society, since we need the room for other patients. The options right now are phych guard or going blind into society.""

""WHAT?!"" Angela shouted, startling both of us.

""You can't send him to a mental hospital! That would be terrible!""

""Both are terrible."" Stated the Doc. ""We're just trying to come up with a plan to make it the least terrible as possible.""

""I'll house him.""

Silence fell over the room as we processed what it had just been said.

""You sure?"" I asked.

""Absolutelly, you are a cool guy and we get along nicelly, I can give you shelter while you learn how to integrate."" She replied matter of factly.

The Doc and I looked at each other for a split second. 

""When could I move in?"" I asked.

""When my shift is over. You will have to sleep on the couch for a while but we'll figure something out. Anyway, my shift is just about to start, see you later, guys!""

""See you later, Angela.""

And she left the room, just like that.

""Welp... That was sudden."" The Doc. remarked.

""I don't even know at this point, man. Everything has changed so much since then I'm just accepting whatever happens.""

The Doc left out a short laugh. ""Today we call that 'rolling with it'.""

""Huh... ok, I guess I'll pack my stuff.""

""Ok then, I'll go get you some bags and proper clothes.""

The Doc left the room as well, I stood from the hospital bed and reached towards my uniform. Once the cause of envy and respect, now a relic of a gone empire. I still didn't know much about the War, I didn't know if I was ready. I didn't know if I would ever be ready.

The hours passed, the Doc came back with unassuming clothes which I put on in the hospital bathroom, they were a little loose but not bad. After some more waiting. Angela was back in her usual EMT uniform.

We exchanged the usual greetings and she told me to follow her, I was going to ask if I needed to sign something declaring I was out, just to maintain the act, but the receptionist which I never met just gave me a nod and subtly gestured me to keep going. Wow, gossip spreads far here, I thought.

The Doc was waiting for us at the door.

""Goodbye Dr. Daniel, thank you for everything.""

""No need to thank me, Gerahrd. It's just my job."" He said with a smile.

He paused and his smile faded a bit. ""Good luck, man.""

I paused for a second. ""Thank you""

""Just keep in touch, ok.""

I smiled. ""Of course.""

Angela left the hospital and entered the parking lot.

And I? I entered a whole new world.",-ragingpotato-

\----------------------------------

They took me into a room, a bed with a strange hook beside it, monitors, a plant pot and a window. The entire room seemed clean. They took the rolling bed, which I think they call a ´stretcher´ and stopped it besides the proper, permanent bed. The ones in blue apparel unstrapped me and helped me transfer to the bed.

Meanwhile I overheard the Jewish man talking with the woman that had accompanied me on the ambulance.

""What is wrong with this man?"" He said.

""I don´t know, he claims to last remember fighting in World War Two but he´s obviously too young for it to be the case of memory loss, I tried to look for a concusion that could have caused him to remember stories as his own experience, but found nothing."" She replied with concern.

The Jewish doctor seemed lost in thought for a moment. ""What a curious case indeed, I´ll look into it.""

The doctor aproached the bed and gestured for the group of what I assume are nurses to leave, they did while eyeing me curiously. The doctor took a seat besides me.

""How are you feeling?""

""Aside from confusion, normal.""

He leaned back, thinking.

""What is your name, Sir?""

""Gerahrd Fönnekold"" I answered

""Please stand up, I will do a more extensive check for concussion or other brain dammage.""

I stood up and he proceeded to make me do multiple tests; he shone a flashlight at my pupilas the woman had done before, he tested my balance, hearing, reaction times and other tests I didn´t comprehend.

""You seem in top mental condition, I can´t find anything wrong with you, Mr Gerahrd.""

I nodded, I didn´t know what to think. I could be happy for not having any mental issues, that was definetly a plus; however, that keeps my experience totally unexplained. To say I was conflicted would be an understatement. The Doctor stood up.

""I will have to file a police report, see if they can find any family or friends of yours that can help you remember. Your case is definetly special, Mr. Gerahrd, we will do our best to assist on your recovery.""

I nodded. ""Thanks, Doctor.""

The Doctor headed towards the door, leaving me alone with my thoughts. He stopped right at the frame.

""Nurses will come to provide you with new clothing, the police could also come later today to ask you some questions.""

""Ok, Doctor.""

""Please, call me Daniel.""

I nodded, and the doctor left the room. Could it be true? All of it? My family, my friends, the war, all a product of my imagination? All a lie? I recalled how I fell onto this world. First the impact, then forcing the canopy open, unstrapping myself and jumping out amidst a hail of British gunfire, pulling the chute and falling into a cloud. Then. Without any kind of gap in memory, I emerge from the cloud to see everything changed.

It could´t have been my imagination, the transition was smooth. Too smooth. If it had been a product of my imagination there would be some kind of jump, I figured. Also, if I had been desilutional I wouldn´t be flying a plane, nor I would be wearing the exact uniform I have been wearing since joining the Luftwaffe. I became convinced. I was a time traveller.

""Gerahrd."" A familiar voice called my name, I turned to see the woman from the ambulance standing in the doorway. She was carrying a piece of clothing on one arm and the rectangle device on the other.

She walked into the room, leaving the clothes on a chair. She sat next to me.

""I figured you may have some questions. My shift just ended so maybe I can help."" She said while putting away the device in one of her pockets.

""Yes."" I began. ""To start. What is your name?""

""Angela, my friends call me Angel."" She replied with her usual soft voice. How fitting, I thought.

""What is that thing? The little screen you where holding just now.""

She recoiled a bit but seemed understanding, she reached back to her pocket to reveal a tiny device, not even a centimeter thick, it fit on the palm of her hand.

""We call it a smartphone, its a little computer that lets me do things like send messages to other people, search information, do math, play games, listen to music and a bunch of other stuff"" She handed the device to me, it was light, it had only 3 buttons and it was mostly screen.

""How does this work?""

She smiled a little, whether it was amusement, pity or both was lost on me, but it was nice to see an emotion other than absolute confusion headed my way.

""I don´t really know how it works, I know it has a battery, a bunch of circuits and an antenna al crammed in there. Really, I only know how to use it. To turn it on press the little button on the side.""

I pushed the button. The screen lit up with an image of stars, the date and time as well as the prompt ´slide to unlock´. I did and was surprised to see the device detected when I touched the screen, it asked to input a password with a number pad.

""Oh, let me, just."" She took the device from my hands, quickly gave the device the password and gave it back to me.

The password prompt had been replaced with a large picture of flowers and a bunch of little pictures with words like ´youtube´ and ´whatsapp´ under them. As well as a top bar with the time, a bunch of even smaller icons, little bars and a percentage which I can only assume it´s for the battery.

\-----------------------------------------

""Hello, Dr Daniel.""

Daniel looked up from his clipboard.

""Hello, Karen, any news yet?""

""Yeah, the police say they have no records of Gerahrd Fönnekold, I googled his name and nothing came up either, only references to a German pilot of WWII called Otto Fönnekold. Air Traffic Control of the LA airport also claims to have never detected his plane up until 30 seconds prior to the crash.""

Daniel looked out of his office and to Gerahrd´s room, he was seemingly fascinated by a smartphone while Angela walked him through how to use it.

""Well."" He said. ""That is certainly interesting.""",-ragingpotato-

Appears to be 23-24 band electromagnetic broadcast, audio representation.""

""Lower-tech signal? Over-light acceleration?""

""Possibly. No signal acceleration. We are picking it up at light speed. I'll have the computer run a language diagnostics.""

""Absolutely. Major Patoulga, get the computer to triangulate source and direct us toward it, see if you can't help the comms officer.""

""Yes, ma'am."" A flurry of activity began in the once lethargic battle control room of the Interstellar Destroyer 'Canartha' (The Death Angel). Lights began to illuminate the naturally reflective surface of the crew's armored atmosphere suits. The Colonel, a whopping four meters tall herself, drummed on her detached helmet seated beside her. 

""Source Triangulated ma'am. 80 Light years. 8 Planet star system, four solid, four gaseous. A stable little yellow star. Third planet from the center is habitable. Computer calculates 94% certainty as signal origin.""

""Diagnostics concluded. Sound based language, transcribed into electromagnetic signal. Class four grammatical structure- looking at pre-interstellar intelligent life form. Most likely... Uh... most likely... err... Oh s\*\*t. Ma'am. Computer reads it as a distress signal.""

""Translate and read it to me. Helmsman, set course. Get me an ETA. Sensor control, direct attention to planet. Alert Major Danek to a possible ground-intercept operation. But we may be 80 years too late... Transcript?""

""Yes ma'am, ready! Uhm... Computer is translating in Bits and pieces, I'll read what it's putting out. 'Haven't had a chance to look around yet... that's the thing directly in front of me... It struck the ground with terrific force but I can see the object itself doesn't look very much like a meteor. It looks more like a huge cylinder. It has a diameter of... the metal is... I've never seen anything like it... Do you hear it? A curious humming sound seems to come from inside the object... Lord! They're turning into flames!' It just mentions screaming in the background here. 'Coming this way now! - Ladies and gentlemen due to circumstances beyond our control we are unable to continue the broadcast from Grover's mill... I shall refer to the weapon used as some kind of a heat ray. The result of scientific minds far superior to our own.'""

""Dammit! Skip ahead a bit! I need to know what's happening now!""

""Uh... Yes ma'am. I will see what I can... 'We are turning over our facilities to the state militia at Trenton,' uh...  no lets see... 'Their apparent objective is to crush resistance, paralyze communication, and disrupt human society...'""

""I've heard enough. Someone or something is using- *or used-* military grade energy weapons to conquer a pre-interstellar species. Would you all say that's a fair conclusion. Intelligence, am I wrong?""

""No ma'am."" Said the glowing face of a cyborg at it's embedded post in the ship, ""Shall I take us to Code 1 Alert?""

""Do it. Helmsman, full run ahead.""

""Understood.""

Tapping into her comm panel, the Colonel notified her entire ship. ""Attention crew of the Canartha. We have received a distress signal of a low-tech intelligent life form that they may have been invaded, in violation of the Cease Fire and of the 145-90A Arms treaty. This broadcast may be up to 80 cycles old. Ground teams expect the worst, possible entrenched positions and the natives used as slaves or hostages. You got that Major Danek?""

""Don't worry about us, Colonel."" Came the assuring reply. ""Assault teams are set and ready. We can handle this.""

""Thank you. Fires control- prime orbital artillery.""

""Primed and pre-calibrated.""

""Fighter wing?""

""All fighters fueled and armed. Crews briefing now.""

""For Honor, Truth, and Law."" She incited their pledge.

""For the Weak, for the Innocent! To Victory!"" came the glorious reply from every member of her ship.

""Hang on little ones... help is coming.""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

""I AM GOING TO STICK MY BOOT SO FAR UP YOUR ASSES!"" The Colonel kicked a car so hard it slid back 10 feet and broke it's parking brake.

""We're sorry!"" Pleaded the U. N. representative. ""We had no idea how far our signals could carry. Back then, we weren't even sure other life *could* exist."" He stood ahead of a military unit, now lowering their rifles in shame like guilty children.

""YOUR WHOLE BROADCAST WAS ABOUT OTHER LIFE. You didn't stop to think!? You CAN'T think, can you!? The fusion cells we WASTED, burning up our engines to come to your aid! The terror you gave my crew, thinking we were about to face an illegal slave colony! Or **WORSE!** I can't... I don't... GAHHH! IDIOTS!""

""If it helps... maybe there is something... Err- something we can give-""

""There is literally nothing you have that I want. Nothing you have that might remotely help me. There is nothing you could give me. Except maybe your vow to literally never speak again.""  
""We give you our humblest apologies, commander. Our most gracious thanks for attempting to come to our aid. And we will all promise-""

""Save it, monkey. I've got a migraine now. Troopers... get back on the ship.""

"Life is like chess,I don't know how to play; but no one has told me I've lost so pony to fort. Do I win?[wp]",happeyhour,"The little girl sat I an old leather chair swinging her feet. A hooded fellow sat opposite her, this didn't seem like the worthy opponent he was promised, but no matter. There were games to be won and lost. He reached below the table and started setting up the board. Her eyes lit up in excitement. Fast as a crack of lightning she has throwing handfuls of pieces onto the table, until she found what she'd presumably been looking for. Extending her hand she showed the hood a pair of white horses. 

""Ponies"" she said with a smile. 

Hood didn't know what to say so he simple stayed quiet.

She then stared to set up her side of the board in the same way that hood had. When all the pieces had been placed hood looked up.

 ""What are you called younglings?"" hood asked as he move a pawn. 

""I'm Emma Green and I'm 6. What about you?"" She while still staring at the board she move her pawn. 

""Hood"" and he moved another pawn they continued to move peices on after the other for a little while.

 Emma stared hard trying her best to concentrate. After a short while hood had advanced upon her pawns. He picked up on and placed it by his side of table. Emma looked none the happier. She grabbed her horse and moved him forwards all the way over to her pawn on the otherside of the table. 

""What are you doing?"" Asked hood meaning to protest. 

""My guy needs to get back to his friends."" Emma said nonchalantly

""That's not how this game is played."" Hood said trying to keep his tone in check.

Emma stopped and looked at hood then at the pieces on the board. Then she grabbed her other horse and moved it to hoods fort. He looked at her in stunned silence as she picked up her pawn from the side of the table. I win she said triumphantly. ",happeyhour

Jack's fight or flight response kicked into overdrive and he whirled on the spot, lifted his Pulse rifle and flicked the safety off. What he saw only mad his heart race faster, a perfect clone of himself, standing with arms tucked behind his back, smiling and looking at him with a curious expression. 

Hunched behind the aiming sight of the rifle, Jack began to pace backwards to the perimeter fence of the compound. It was around a hundred paces to the airlock. He had no idea if he could make it in time, if indeed he could get away at all.

""You must be a new species.""

Jack did not reply. He kept his laser pointer fixed firmly on his own clones forehead, ready to let rip at the slightest provocation.

""Your physical make up is astonishing. We have never encountered such a....visceral form of life before. How far have you come?""

Jack's mind was racing, he was struggling to understand how he could be facing himself, let alone an alien species that could speak his own language.

""Why......why do you look like me. How can you do that?!""

""Oh I am so sorry. Our DNA, our very nature as a species mimics any new forms of life we encounter as a defense mechanism. We have....had some run ins with some extremely hostile and unpleasant forms of life before.""

""B...before? You mean..""

""You are not alone. What are you holding?""

""It's a pulse rifle.""

""What is a 'pulzraiful'""?

""Huh? It's a gun, it fires plasma tipped bullets""

""A gun?""

""Yeah it's a weapon, I could kill you right now with one shot of this thing if I wanted to.""

Jack's clone paused. His expression changed from curiosity to that of fear and anxiety.

""Oh no....perhaps...we made another mistake...your race seems aggressive...""

Jack lowered the pulse rifle a little and stepped back a few paces. He kept checking around his periphery for any other potential threats. He was alone, out in the wilderness on Keystone and his only backup was a distress beacon inside the engineering plant in the compound. The clone standing before him did not seem that threatening, but he had been warned by the Keystone Project team that any higher intelligence is likely to display itself in a form that we can understand. 

""Im here on a peace mission. Not to kill or destroy.""

""Peace?"" Jack's clone looked suspicious and his tone was less inquisitive and more interrogative.

""We want to meet new species, new life. Just like you, apparently.""

""That is good. We have the same goals. I am Idris, one of 9 ambassadors to new life that we encounter. In truth, our natural form would be completely incomprehensible to your mind without gradual conditioning, judging by our schematics of how your body functions.""

Jack stopped stepping backwards and raised the pulse rifle to his shoulder again, but stopped short of taking aim.

""What do you mean ""Schematics?"" Have you scanned me?!""

""Yes. I am scanning you right now. I detect a large bio-electrical organ in your chest which is very loud, it seems to be moving some kind of fluid around your system.""

""It's my heart. It pumps blood around my body, keeps me alive. Without it....""

""You would die?""

Jack gulped. ""Yes""

""That is such a dangerous way to live! Other species we have encountered have multiple redundancies, organ systems that would not kill them if they failed. How has your race survived?""

""We are tough to kill I guess...""

""Perhaps. Is that why you have this 'pulserifel'?""

""Yes. We are extremely efficient at killing each other. It makes us stronger, but its also our worst feature.""

Jack's clone paused again and closed his eyes. He moved his right hand slowly in an arc infront of him and Jack began to feel odd, dizzy and disorientated.

""What....what the hell are you doing....stop...please. I don't want to shoot you...""

""Relax please. Jack? That is your name? I am reading your mind, your memories, what you can tell us about your race. It will be over in a few seconds...""

Jack felt extremely nauseous and blacked out. 

\--------------------------

Jack woke up with a massive palpitation and sat bolt upright. He found himself in the infirmary inside the compound, with his clone sat opposite on a medical supplies crate.

""Oh good. Your awake. I apologize on behalf of our species for your collapse. It appears that your mind's are not yet capable of sustained mental transfer. It will take some practice getting used to it, but soon it will be like second nature to you.""

Jack tried to move from the bed but found his legs and arms were tied to the bed frame.

""Ah yes. I am afraid we had to take the liberty of restraining you. After we scanned your mind, we found that your race ...well...is the most dangerous species in the known universe. You simply cannot be trusted with your full motor functions, but please keep in mind we mean you no harm. Infact, we are pleased to meet such an advanced civilisation.""

""Advanced? What do you mean. One moment your calling us barbaric, the next your telling us you want to be friends? Let me out of these...""

""Our species has long been subject to attack from across the Galaxy, we are weak and our home worlds have been cast into slavery and destruction. We put out the signal to find species who could help us, teach us how to be strong and fight off our suppressors. I believe our search is over....""

""You want us to fight for you?""

""Not fight for us. No. Teach us how to fight. Our species evolved in an environment on a planet with such an abundance of land &amp; natural resources that we never gained the ability to deal with conflict, as it rarely ever arose. We have no weapons, no idea of how to defend ourselves. When we are threatened, we meekly comply. Can you help us?""

""It's not really my call. I don't speak for all Humans. If you want to speak to our leader, the President, then fair enough but his reply will be ""what's in it for us?"" Humans are a selfish, greedy species who always look for the upper hand in any negotiation. We are extremely devious, cunning and ruthless and will betray long standing allies and friends if it suits us. Are you sure you want to be a part of that?""

""We have no choice. Your species is by far the deadliest we have ever come across. Earth must be a cruel, merciless world filled with war and unimaginable horrors.""

""Not really. It's a beautiful planet, but yes, it is very dangerous.""

""Your species is remarkable. Your blood is full of microscopic organisms that could kill you, but you establish a symbiotic relationship with to enable you to eat such a wide variety of foods, enabling you to thrive in almost any environment. You regenerate flesh and bone automatically and can survive without limbs and with damage to your brains. You can run down any animal on your planet and drive it to exhaustion, just to kill and eat it for sustenance. You invent sharp edged blades to inflict horrendous wounds and kill each other, but then develop armor made from metal to stop this so you then invent a narrow tube that expels gas from an exploding chemical mix which propels a small metal projectile at great speed to puncture this armor to defeat it and kill each other. Our species simply does not think like that. To top it all, you harness the power of the atom to develop an explosive device so powerful it could kill millions of your kind in one blast. Impressive.""

Jack had an uneasy position. He was under no illusion that his alien being could kill him in an instant, and if they realized that their own psychological powers far outmatched that of the human race, they could enslave us in turn. However, if humanity agreed to help them, we could be eternally in their debt and perhaps benefit technologically, and forward humanities progression thousands of years. 

""Sure, we will help you. Let's get started....""

I never got to finish that sentence. Thunder struck around us, the earth shook and my laptop dropped on the floor, prematurely ending my presentation. 

I stepped towards the window and saw dark clouds rolling in, followed by purple and green thunder. 

""Shit."" I turned to the men behind me. ""Gentlemen, I'm afraid I have to cut this short, my attention is needed elsewhere. I'm sure you understand."" They nodded sheepishly. Most of them looked afraid, a few of the older men looked blankly. They knew what was going to happen.

As I rushed passed the cubicles I saw so many emotions from those around me, fear, anger, acceptance.

I grabbed my phone while in the elevator, not the smartest move during an earthquake, but I needed some privacy. My phone showed an alert from the rest, a big flashing emblem with the words ""We need you."" 

As I stepped out of the elevator, the sounds of people crying and screaming had begun. I looked outside and saw people running, followed by those demons in armor, killing everything they could get their hands on. I ran past the lobby straight towards the staircase leading to the parking garage.

Once downstairs I located my car and headed for the trunk, while I haven't had the need for my gear for over 30 years, I need it now. 

My phone rang, I picked up while changing.  ""Where are you? We need you right now!"". ""Business meeting, you understand."" I replied. ""Just hurry, ok? He is back!"" ""Figured""

I took a deep breath. Got in the drivers seat and drove towards the exit.  My phone connected to my car. ""Hey where are you guys?"" ""24th and 6th"" ""Oh hey that is next to that place that makes my suits! That's a ten minute walk. See ya soon."" And I hung up.

I accelerated towards the exit, grabbed the door and while my car flew, I jumped out and I looked as it planted itself in a siege beast. 

While I love my current life, can't say I didn't miss this. My hands gripped my sword and I flew in a rage and rushed towards  24th and 6th, to meet up with my friends, because what is a party without a barbarian?",Coldfreeze-Zero

Upon the ashes of our devastated land, we built a new Kingdom, a Kingdom built by citizens for citizens.* 

*First Chancellor of the Republic, Year 1 of New Era.* 

\*\*\*

*The crimson dawn broke above the horizon, the sea of corpses piling up and reaching towards the heavens. The three of us stood, collapsed on the bodies of our fellow comrades, our battered and bruised bodies too tired to think.* 

&amp;#x200B;

*I feel myself dying, my breath becoming shallower, my lungs collapsed in my chest. I could no longer grip my sword, broken and shattered in pieces, shattered by the cataclysmic blow by him before he felt.* 

&amp;#x200B;

""*I wanted to be a bard..."" I wheezed out, my consciousness slipping away into the shadows. ""I never wanted to be a swordsman. My wish...was to be able to play a song in my courtyard...to be able to..."" Blood gurgled out of my throat. ""To be able to sing a song to the people of the land...""*

&amp;#x200B;

""*My wish was to be able to build houses, be an architect. To be able to decorate the landscape with my creations, beautify the world bit by bit, with my hammer and chisel..."" Dylan, too, began mumbling too, a spear pierced through his heart. He is done as well, the wound too serious to be saved. ""What about you, Princess?""*

&amp;#x200B;

""*I wanted to be a merchant, to go around the world, to become rich, richer than the Kingdom itself."" Tanya, too, had a long slash wound across her chest, nearly severing her in half diagonally. Her staff laid in two by the side, her mana burning her up from the inside after casting the final spell banishing the him to another realm. Her death is going to be the most painful, mana acting as a poison to turn her into ash.* 

&amp;#x200B;

""*Ha...look at all of us now, we are all not who we want to be. Swordsman, Blacksmith and Archmage. Where is the bard, the architect, the merchant?"" Dylan roared out, blood squirting out like a fountain. ""If we survive this, if, let's leave this all behind. Move on...be who we are, not who we must be...""*

&amp;#x200B;

""*If we survived...if..."" I chuckled. ""Not like we would see another sunrise ever again.""*

&amp;#x200B;

*Yet, by some miracle, when the sun rose again the next year, we are still alive. Unable to die.* 

&amp;#x200B;

*Then another, then another, then another, till we are completely healed, undying, like immortals.* 

\*\*\*

The train coursed into the station, a gush of mana bellowing forth from the rails, ruffling the feathers of the pigeon resting in the rafters of the station. 

&amp;#x200B;

Below it, a melodic tone wafted through the busy pedestrian crowd, each note adding to the harmony of the orchestra, magic ebbing and flowing, dancing, with the tune. 

&amp;#x200B;

Gently, I caress the strings of my guitar, playing a song from millenniums past.  *Song of Aldruin, my homeland.* Through music, I resurrect the memories and moments long consigned to oblivion, reminding myself of a time long ago. 

&amp;#x200B;

It has been so long, so very long, since we slain the Dark Lord. Society itself was a different beast than the past. It has moved on, the Dark Lord nothing but a momentary footnote in history, us heroes ghosts of the past. 

&amp;#x200B;

Today is *Hero's Day,* the second millennium of the day we banished the Dark Lord. This city now stands where we lied that day, two thousand years ago, the very center of it where he was banished, and for every year, two thousand times, we gloated our victory over him, celebrating the world he hoped to destroy before his grave. 

&amp;#x200B;

*I should probably meet up with Dryan and Tanya...it has been another year.* For a year we would separate, off to pursue our different goals, and every year, during *Hero's Day*, we would get together to celebrate, again, reuniting like we always did, before we go off again, disappearing for another cycle. 

&amp;#x200B;

My phone rang at the song's end. It was Dryan. *Meet up beforehand?* 

&amp;#x200B;

*Sure.* 

&amp;#x200B;

The last I know of him, he was busy laying bricks down at the Downtown area, his newest construction project underway. Most of the city was built by him, assuming different identities, and every stone, every brick, was layered with his bare hands. In some ways, both of them are more successful then I was, a wandering street performer even after two thousand years. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Clank.* Another penny entered the open tin can by the side of me. It was a girl, her hair tied in twin ponytails, smiling with an innocence only afforded to children.  

&amp;#x200B;

""Mummy said to give this to you for your song."" She said, her voice clear and distinct. Her parents were looking on, at a distance, nodding in acknowledgment. 

&amp;#x200B;

""Thanks."" I replied, tussling her hair,  ""Help me say thanks to your mother too, okay?""

&amp;#x200B;

Then, it happened. 

\*\*\*

I felt it, in my heart and in my bones, the unholy power that is keeping us alive shudder. My heart started beating faster, my palms sweaty. 

&amp;#x200B;

*I...I knew it...he is coming back.* 

&amp;#x200B;

The three of us have figured out long ago the reason for our continued survival. *He* is not dead. Hence, we cannot die. 

&amp;#x200B;

Our fates are tied to the fate of the Dark Lord; we are sworn-enemies, destined to perish by either's hands. An unholy bond links the both of us, preventing the passage of time till death do either of us apart. 

&amp;#x200B;

We *banished* him, we did not *kill* him. 

&amp;#x200B;

Therefore, he has returned. To kill us once more.

\*\*\*

The guitar case opened before me, the sword sealed within it seeing the light of day once more. Grabbing on to the handle, the familiar feeling of mana surging once more through my veins. Little by little, the seal within us broke, as dark clouds gathered in increasing intensity over the city. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Dark Lord, two millennia did not pass in vain. We would lose our brethren like we did in the past. The day you step through the gate, is the day this accursed destiny ends.* 

\*\*\*

In a construction site, a topless, burly man reaches for his toolkit, an ugly scar littering the skin before his heart. A hammer, shining with a blazing thunder, emerges from within, the entire city seemingly resonating with each pulsating spark. 

&amp;#x200B;

The city seems to come alive, each brick and stone echoing with power. Two millenniums of power seeped itself into the city, bringing it alive, shining with golden light, counteracting the darkness above. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Two thousand years to build our power, Dark Lord. Two thousand years. I, Lightbringer, will end this before it even starts.*

\*\*\*

The boardroom of the largest private security firm in the country buzzed with activity. *Atlas International,* with operations in numerous countries, a military force to rival nations. 

&amp;#x200B;

Before the boardroom stood her, dressed in military attire, the latest mana-powered rifle loaded and ready. The other hand held a staff, radiating with power. 

&amp;#x200B;

""Commence Operation Deus. Loadout and move in ten minutes time. We are going to be back here before dinner.""

&amp;#x200B;

*Watch out, Dark Lord. Last time, we faced you with steel and magic. Now, we face you with rifles and missiles. You are a relic of the past, just like us, your time is long gone, Dark Lord.*

I shake my fist at them three times then spread my hand out flat against the land. Two of my foes go down immediately, their fists still clenched, but my cleverest foe has blocked my strategy. She too has claimed the flat land around us.

Again I gather my power, fist held to the air, and lash out, my power this time divided to close upon her, but she holds her strength as a mighty bulwark close within her grasp and my power crashes uselessly against her stalwart defenses. I am defeated.

The great witnesses are appeased and they dissipate to await the next awakening.

I look up from my defeat. ""How long do you think you can keep this up.""

The victors stand above me. The most sly of my foes speaks. ""I don't think they'll ever catch on.""

The man in the Carhartt overalls gives me a hand up. I knew his father well. It's nice to see the hammer stay in the family.

I've given up on trying to rule the world. Humanity really doesn't need my help to screw itself up. And it turns out my needs are actually quite modest. My true role is to channel the fires of hell to keep the pan boiling. If I were to relent the pure waters of heaven would wash away all this salt of the earth.

Riding around sowing mayhem by hand is redundant in the modern age. People terrorize themselves with the twenty-four hour news cycle and vaccine conspiracy theories. As long as the eternal powers know all sides still strive the universe will stay in balance.

War is nearly obsolete, and as long as nobody tells The Eternals about Rock-Paper-Scissors we can all just keep on keeping on.

A construction worker pulls an old warhammer from the back of his pickup, a street performer draws the sword hidden in his guitar case, a CEO ends her meeting and retrieves her staff. Heroes must return as well.",lordhelmos,"The sky was dark and heavy over the city of New York. 

Not the heavy of impending rain or a storm, cold and thick; no, a very different heaviness. It could be felt in one’s very skin, a pressure and a weight akin to being submerged many meters down in the sea. For some it manifested as a small headache, nothing more. These were mostly young people, the bustling new generation. Those slightly older, ones who could remember the cullings, were more affected. They felt a mounting pressure in their heads, followed by a blinding pain between the eyes. 

For some, the most sensitive, the visions came then. Fear and rot and death, visions to weaken and torment. The afflicted were the particularly empathetic, or those who had lost a friend or relative in the fighting—anything that would make their emotional link to the Dark Lord stronger, their defenses weaker. Anything that would let him in their minds. 

Across the city, three people fell screaming. 

The Valiant had been a vanguard of the resistance, back in the terrifying days of the dark lord’s reign. Tall, broad, and muscled, with dark hair and a beard, he reminded people of the carvings of the Shining Gods of Old, and so they followed him. He had been a natural born leader, gathering heroes and civilians alike to the cause with incredible momentum. He had inspired thousands, but not without cost. The fighting had taken the better years of his life, and what remained of his family after the first culling had been killed while following him in the later conflicts. Yet he knew he had a duty to the world’s peoples, and he did not fall, did not waver in his resolve, until the Dark Lord had been driven back in the Battle of Three and One. After that day, he had laid down his hammer, that sculpted thing of iron and destiny and woe, to try to make peace with himself, with his mistakes. He had joined the slowly rebuilding society as a normal man. 

Under metal construction scaffolding on 4th street, John Samson, The Valiant, fell screaming. 

Duelist had always worked alone, until the Dark Lord had risen to power. He had been a monster hunter by trade, seeking the rare appearances of old creatures in wild lands still unconquered by the civilizing forces of humanity. The world had been at a tipping point, rapidly industrializing yet still prizing the magic and the godly power wielded by the few. Most had not been overly concerned about the waning number of heroes and mages—a relic of a bygone age—until they were needed. When the call had come, Duelist rose to it. He lent his speed and his blades to the cause, joining a young band of heroes led by a foreigner called The Valiant. His skills proved invaluable on the front lines, dispatching the wraiths and monsters that the Dark Lord was so fond of summoning in battle. Even when he was blinded by spell fire in a skirmish, he persevered. Sight had never been what guided his twin swords anyway. After the Dark Lord’s sudden disappearance, the world once again had no more need for heroes. The Valiant had withdrawn into himself and Sarah had her own goals she needed to pursue, so Duelist had left and wandered. He had no more monsters to kill, and no skills to offer the world, blind and bereft as he was. So he had settled in New York, drifting, sleeping on the streets, playing music. It was not comfortable, but it was simple. 

Under a tree in Central Park, Sebastian Martinez, Duelist, fell screaming. 

The Arcane, she was called. A title she’d regarded with mixed horror and pride. She hadn’t ever wanted to have powers, hadn’t wanted to fight or be a hero. It was distraction from her goals, her young but promising career and her drive to be the woman that proved everyone wrong. It was this same drive that finally convinced her to heed the call to arms of the resistance, shoving the action in the faces of those who had dared to call her a coward, when she first refused. She hadn’t refused out of cowardice, after all, but pride. She wanted to be known for her grit and drive, not the power she was born with. An unearned gift, as she saw it, for though her family had bourn the blood for generations, it reflected little about her except her privilege. But still, she went. In times of crisis, threats like the Dark Lord often stirred the powers of the Shining Gods to awaken in mortals, but new mages could not be made so easily. Her gift was invaluable in fighting the dark sorcery and mental attacks he employed, but it exhausted her, deep in her bones where sleep could not mend it. By the time their band took its stand at the Battle of Three and One, she was so very near giving up. But then the Dark Lord simply...disappeared. Weakened as he was, many suspected he had gone into hiding under the earth or in some personal pocket dimension to recoup his power. The Arcane did not care, for she was past it. After the battle, she slept for three nights and three days. Then she returned to her former company, picking up the roles and duties of senior executives killed in the battles or the culls, and began to rise. 

In a 56th floor office, right in the middle of her quarterly briefing as CEO, Sarah Chan, The Arcane, fell screaming. 

In three parts of the city, three lives once connected by kinship and terror connected once more, as a wound reopening. Their blood had been spilt together to quell the power of that terrible being, and so the light in it resonated now in response to the return of its darker twin. The pain and horror was not a direct attack of the Dark Lord’s making, but rather the effect of his sudden presence and the forceful reemergence of powers denied. 

Across the city, three people fell screaming, and three heroes got back up. 

They retrieved hammer, swords, and staff from their treasured resting places. Not one of the three had been able to bring themselves to cast away their weapons after the war. Drawn inexorably to each other by the shared power in their veins, they met in a quiet corner of Central Park, now utterly deserted, under the shadow of the unnaturally black clouds. The sky darkened further. 

They were ready. ",Charitea-andcrumpets

“Now everybody listen up!” Mr. Jeffley patted at the air with both hands in a placating gesture. “Quiet down!” He had to raise his voice to make that last phrase heard over the pandemonium in the employee breakroom. It was hot in here, crowded as it was with all twenty Jeffley Mart employees currently running the clock.

Even with the chairs folded away and the dining tables pushed to the peripherals of the room, cashiers stood crammed shoulder-to-shoulder with stockboys, who complained loudly about their proximity to the janitor, Bob “The Smell” Oaks, who did his best to ignore Cathy from accounting, who was sobbing uncontrollably into her cell phone.

The break room was windowless, but there was an old television set mounted in the corner of the room broadcasting 24/7 live footage of the Dark Lord’s return. The cameraman now panned up to reveal a black-cloaked figure who floated in the pose of the crucifix above a river of blood that was once Main Street. A black crescent lay upon his brow, curving up like a pair of horns.

As Mr. Jeffley watched, the shot widened to show two men in the foreground, shirtless but for their orange and yellow reflective vests, each wading through the gore with implacable intent, moving to flank their foe. One wielded the enchanted wrecking bar, Mjolnir; the other cradled a jackhammer retrofitted with the blade of Excalibur. The mighty thews of their bare arms were slicked with red.

A hush had fallen over the Jeffley Mart breakroom. Mr Jeffley know this was his moment, if any.

“Now people. Who of us here—” he let his gaze travel over and take in the faces of his audience one-by-one “—has the blood of Merlin in his or her veins?” A few hands, sparsely distributed through the room, lifted in response. “Janet!” He pointed at Janet, who had her hand raised. “Please show the room what you’ve brought to work today.” Janet sheepishly lifted her other hand, which held an exquisitely forged short sword. Along the length of blade could be seen, etched in a flowing Arcanist’s Cursive, some kind of enchantment.

“Given the extraordinary circumstances today, Janet, We will not consider this a Workplace Weapons Violation. *However,* remember your online training module 1556, in we find the following statement: ‘All bladed instruments for employee use *must* be self-retracting.’” He thumbed his own safety knife as demonstration. Up on the screen, there was no sign of Excalibur’s chosen. Mjolnir’s wielder had fallen to his knees in the torrent of blood, breathing hard, head hung in defeat. The dark lord stood over him, a lance of manifest hell-shadow gripped in both fists, poised to be driven down between the fallen warrior’s shoulderblades. “Janet, pay attention. Is your magic sword self-retracting?”

“It glows in the presence of orcs,” Janet said.

“No, then.” Mr. Jeffley said. “Remember, team members, that even while off the clock, each and every one of you represents Jeffley Mart and Jeffley Mart Values. Even as we go forth avenging the world, we must *work safe*. We must work *Jeffley Mart Safe*.” There was a gagging noise coming from the television—the cameraman retching—as the Dark Lord, the Black Pope, began to serve a bloody communion to his unwilling and broken disciple.

Mr. Jeffley beamed. “Everybody form a circle. It’s time for our opening meeting cheer.”",SpicyTripleMeats

She tilted her head as she looked in, where did the cook go? What was her name again? Barbara, Brenda... she called out, ""Hey uh... young lady, you back there?""  
Brianna had slipped out the back as silver boom box played above the prep area, ""Scientists are unable to display the massive weather phenomenon and... wait... we are getting something, it would appear a number of 'creatures' have been spotted outside Rutland. That's right, many creatures have been attacking. Locals are now urging citizens to remain in their homes-""  


She kept them in the back of her car, which was a sensible sedan that needed a new coat of paint, but only sipped gas not guzzled it. She drew the belt from the back of the trunk after she popped it open. Brown leather from the hide of a mammoth in ages past. The supple belt included pouches of various sizes that contained poisons of both liquid and powder. The pride of the collection was the pair of black hilted daggers. She drew one of the blades quick, tossed it air, and grinned as she caught it. The other blade she drew it out then up, as she pulled the second blade up her fingers danced and tumbled the dagger so that it spun without ever cutting her finger. She held the knives above her head. She nodded as the ancient metals exuded a soft green aura. The Alchemist was right, the poison she had placed on the edge remained even after all this time.  


""Mr. Pritchard! If you are not back on the line you can find another job-"" Pritchard's boss was a heavyset man with salt-and-pepper hair with a lot of stubble on his jowls. He stood in front of the break room entrance, Arthur had his narrow back to him. The Manager blinked at the clink of glass, the soft rubbing noise of objects on leather. Arthur Pritchard also had a belt made mammoth hide. While Barbara's belt held poisons and blades, Pritchard's belt namely delt in powders, vials, and reagents made of plants or bone. He carried a single poignard, a triangular blade that lacked an edge. Two small shoots were forged into the blade, it delivered the poison better when it was jammed into a victim. Arthur turned towards the manager with the dagger in hand.

 A brief smile played on his lips as the older man stepped out of the break room and put his back against a long counter in the main office. Arthur passed by the manager whose hands were up, he ignored the pleading looks, the questioning glances of his co-workers. All Arthur said as he rounded the counters to make his way for the doors was, ""I quit.""  
She was in the parking lot waiting for him.  


""Nice car, a Corolla?"" He pushed his wire-frame glasses back to his face.  
""It's been lean times, most of my money is tied up in chef's school,"" She said, ""You ready?""  
A low rumble of thunder drew Arthur's attention. As the clouds rolled from the black mass, their tone lightened to shades of light or dark gray.  
""You think the 'heroes' can meet our price this time?"" Arthur asked.  
""I've kept up with one of them, the Wizard, she's a CEO now of a major company.""  
""I was preferring more direct cash,"" Arthur noted  
""A price is a price, and if they are smart, they'll meet it. You ever recall how rough they had it when we worked for the other side?"" Brianna reached over to open the passenger door for her partner. Somehow, after so many reincarnations, they always worked together. The Assassin and the Alchemist. He slid in next to her and said, ""If we take their money, we may be up against people we worked with last time.""  


""Like I said, it's been lean times. The Dark Lord doesn't have enough pay to go around. So, let's try to be good guys this time, we probably can name any price that the heroes will match.""  
""Stock options or worst, free drywall,"" Arthur added when Brianna looked at him, ""The Warrior is a construction worker now.""  
Brianna rolled her eyes, put the car in drive, and coasted it onto the road that led to the City.",boddynock_stotch

I can sense it, a feeling of radiated emotions, rarely seen in any lords of the dark that I served. Joy is it? Or purely a hunger for battle, he yearns it since his last defeat. 

I gesture a bow in front of my liege, “the preparations is complete my lord”

No words – but he’s arisen from his throne and action speaks louder than words. I stepped aside, making way for my lord. Heavily and slowly he walks as if following the red carpet and stops in the middle. His hand gestures a spell, rocking his overgrown armour set making them creak and rattle. Wind picks up; an anomaly has formed between his armoured hands. Red cape fluttered revealing the side of the armour unbefitting for a lord; it has a crack in it and black miasma seeping out from it, damaged as a reminder of *my lord* defeat at the hands of earth’s – life form.

The anomaly has fully grown, now forming a large rift – a testament to *my lord’s* mystical power. *This time* – I imagine *my lord* thinking as he grips his armoured hand, forming a fist. The stage is set, as well as the rivals too; over the rift shown three of earth’s life form, standing tall all three of them. The life forms, their hands gripping their defences tightly. 

A bearded yellow bowl helm, a weirdly robed female with fabric hanging from her neck, and the lute player – This time *my lord* will show no mercy. *My lord* stood there menacingly. Brimming with black miasma, signs that he is indeed excited. *He* **steps forward.**",trezhling

Sparks of regal purple streaked through them; dancing contemporary shapes born from the mixing of an otherworldly friction. A young boy slowly ran his tongue over a lollipop while staring up at the carnage taking place above him, he thought it was all quite beautiful. 
There came a spontaneous crack as the ground immediately in front of him splintered, erupting up in an electric spire of earthen mote and static. Down the flume floated a figure exuding archaic malice, with eyebrows that wouldn't have looked out of place on a head twice the size, over two heavy set eyes, fighting for prominence against a diamond cutter of a nose. Behind him billowed cloth that could challenge a black hole in its ability at photon retention. 
""*I AM CREMNACK, MY RETURN WILL SPELL THE END OF YOUR PETTY HUMAN REIGN*.""
Sonorous vibrations emanated from the dehydrated excuses the creature had for lips, as they mirrored the language he had understood as exacting the most power over the Earth's surface.

The young boy removed the sweet from his mouth and looked down at the strange figure that stood before him. The asian features on his face, coupled with a quizzical look betrayed the lack of ability he had to understand. There had been many strange happenings in the Qi Dong area, and this fell once more into the realm of the surreal. He raised his foot and let it fall lazily onto the booming little man, rejecting the consternation that was trying to force its way to the forefront of his brain. A light crunch followed by a twist of the leg brought the rice basin back into focus. The Valley was ignorant of any commotion as if the displacement of time was also one of space.
The boys attention was stolen by a sauntering pelican, an apt description, because of the sinuous muscles rippling down its all too human legs.

Lies and Deception. He turned on the tv in search of news letting it play as he walked out onto the balcony. His eyes gazed at the nighttime cityscape, whose lights filled the horizon just as stars do the sky.

“The many times that I’ve seen this, it never grows old.” He said.

He slid a cigarette out of the pack in his pants pocket, then lit it as he leaned over the rail. The tv filled the silence between each of his breaths.

“A longtime mega corporation CEO publicly came forward about committing fraudulent business practices in order to achieve his position at the top of one of the worlds largest biotech manufacturers. All this occurred during a recent company press conference late yesterday evening, some skeptics were concerned about this happening due to repeated reports of these business practices from an undisclosed source. However this morning the CEO was arrested in his home during which time he announced his resignation as he currently awaits trial.” Said the news anchor.

“Hmph. An undisclosed source she says. As if that actually stops them from finding out.” He said.

They always find out who he is. But never what he is and when they come he doesn't like to fight. However, when its time to feed that's when he endures the hunt. Like moths to flames, he can smell them coming. Their hearts beat, echoing through the hotel halls as they approach. It grows louder and louder. The thrill from the thought of coursing blood in fresh prey, it would drive any other ancient being with a bloodthirst into a blissful rage.

“I always wonder who sends these poor souls. I will need to thank him eventually.” He said.

He turns his back to the rail, and faces the room door across from him. The door breaks open and a group of men came flooding in. He takes a puff of his cigarette.

“They say nicotine has a calming effect on the nerves.” He said.

He puts it out on the rail, then flicks it out into the distance. The men jerk up all their weapons, they pointed them at him as if he were about to pounce on them.

“I guess this is the part where you all start shooting. But before that, one of you is going to have to live long enough to pay for that door.” He said.

They looked at each other, then began to empty their magazines into him. As the weapon fire settles into silence, his body remained standing in front of them. All of his wounds began to heal, the bullets fell from his wounds. The men stumbled back.

“What the heck is this guy?” Said one of the armed men.

“Well you’re about to find out.” He said.

He walked towards them as they tried to reload their weapons with shaking hands. He slapped the weapon out of the man’s hands standing closest to him. They all stopped, the man looked up at him, not realizing how tall he was until he got closer.

“As they say in Japan… Itadakimasu.” He said.

The evening ended and his hunger satiated. He found himself standing back on the balcony with his shirt in shreds and a cigarette in mouth. There was a knock on his hotel room door. He turned and there stood a lady and several men in hazmat suits. The lady approached him and stood beside him on the balcony. Without a word, he went back to looking at the city.

“It seems like its every other day you call.” She said.

“I probably wouldn’t if i didn’t have to.” He said.

“Well, if you are going to feed in public you have to call me, now don’t you.” She said.

“They don’t give me a choice.” He said.

“And if they did, would you still call?” She asked.

“Only for business purposes.” He said.

“You’re no fun…” She said then paused in thought, “Why do you try so hard to keep yourself separated from your own kind?”

“You’re the one pretending to run a legit business by day and a vampire cleaning service by night.” He said.

“Someone has got to do it, or they would hunt our kind.” She said.

“Well that’s my point, I’m not pretending.” He said.

“Says the vampire with a dozen blood drained men on the floor of his hotel room.” She said.

“I still gotta feed, but animals would be just as good… If men weren’t trying to kill me.” He said.

They stood in silence, as the men finished cleaning and fixing the hotel room. One of the men in hazmat suits nodded to the lady, signifying it’s done as they all exited the room.

“Well, you could always call if you just wanted to spend time with someone from your own kind.” She said.

“Maybe if I'm not busy.” He said.

“Ha, when are you not busy Mister Journalist.” She said.

“Who knows, one of these millennia.” He said.

She chuckled then left the room while waving to him. The room was in pristine condition, as if nothing had ever happened. He walked into the room, closing the curtains behind him. He sat in the seat facing the tv and turned it off. He gazed at his own reflection in the blank screen until it felt as if it were gazing back. As the sun rose, his eyes felt like a heavy drag pulling him down into sleep…

He was safe in his little box of darkness.

In the dank stench of the alleyway, a new scent greeted the night. Fresh, seeping juices from the arteries of the newest duo sent after him. It was nothing new, of course. However, they did manage to catch him off-guard.

Still holding the second assassin aloft in his undead grip, he turned his attention momentarily to the implement lodged within, between his shoulder and neck. Gripping it with his free hand, he would loose it with but a flick of the wrist, sending it over his shoulder and clanking to the ground. The aforementioned assassin's eyes became saucers as he witnessed not only the nonchalant attitude of his target, but the ease at which he not only discarded the knife.

Within a moment of removing the weapon, the wound seemed to darken rather quickly. It had not healed, but seemed to seal up temporary using some reserve of the vampire's unknown power. Those beaming, crimson pupils locked onto the assailant with a mixture of vindication, and of sheer apathy.

**""Do you know how many of your kind have been sent to my doorstep, little man? I have endured FAR worse than you could have imagined in my time. After all, my career breeds such dangers when you are responsible for toppling kings from atop their gilded thrones with just a whisk of a pen's stroke or the release of one measly bite of information.""**

Pulling the man's now terror-wracked face closer, he would only just realize how very cold the grasp of his target truly was. How did he get away with fooling people for this long? This guy has been interviewed before. He was on TV twice, for God's sake! However, he never looked this pale. His skin was practically white as snow, and his eyes had a darkened glaze behind them, extenuating his piercing gaze.

**""You are so very fearful, are you not? Well. It's only natural. However, now that you've seen the truth, you must be dealt with like all the others.""** A smile crept over the vampire's features. A flicker of some sort of sick pleasure in his voice at the end of the sentence, before a flash of his maw brought his true weapons to light. No, not two simple piercing needles, but an entire assortment of animalistic teeth. Built for tearing and latching, no doubt.

**""Do not fear, human. You'll be joining the others soon enough. Maybe you will have gained some modicum of knowledge you can carry to the next life.""**

The ghastly noises of flesh torn and blood being sapped from the body would be heard, nor seen, by anyone. This town was fairly small, all things considered. All the good little children would be tucked into bed, and their parents would be keeping the blinds tucked down and the doors locked tight.

The room was dark, his apartment quiet and still.  That was the way he liked it - just him and his words.

They surrounded him, pictures and articles scattered about the walls here and there.  He took care - the last thing he wanted was a tactless display of arrogance, after all.

And there were all too many things he couldn't display at all.

The sccreen of his laptop glowed, the only light in his little office.  With a sigh, he looked back down to it, resting his hands on the keys.

It was all becoming so...normal.  Of course, it always had been.  A crooked smile tugged at his lips, humorless and cold.  People never changed.  They thought themselves superior, better than their peers and their underlings.  They thought themselves *better.*

Oh, how small they looked when he showed them how feeble their plots really were.

The world would never know, would never have even the slightest idea of the man who stood behind the downfall of so many empires.  Dictators.  Corporations.  Corruption and greed and *waste.*

His smile widened, parting ever so slightly to reveal too-sharp teeth.

Well.  Not exactly a man, either.  And the privacy suited him fine.  It was just a hobby, after all.

The floorboards creaked.  He froze, his fingers stopping in their dance.  Slowly, sliding deeper into his senses, he glanced towards the door.

When the first man crept through, black-clad and with a pistol held at the ready, he was already waiting.  Blood splattered across the articles taped to the walls as his claws sank into the assassin's chest.  He grimaced, the flash of red soaking into the paper catching his eye, but hurled the man against a dresser anyway.

It was hardly the first time blood had stained those pictures and papers.

A flicker of motion was all that warned him of the next attack - just a glimmer of light, a whisper of wind.  He twisted, throwing himself to the side, and felt the bullet glance past him.  It burned, just by its very presence.

His red-rimmed eyes flicked back to the new attacker.  Well, then.  They'd certainly come prepared.  Not that it would help them.

The second man was still bringing the pistol back to bear on him when he struck.  The length of steel that rested behind his desk chair was ostensibly a crowbar, or had been labeled as such when he'd bought it.  It was hardly a delicate weapon, not what he normally would have considered worthy to be wielded by hands as ancient as his, but it was nothing if not effective.   And they *were* using holy weapons.

One swing.  It took one swing for the second man's head to vanish in a cloud of red.  He eyed the crowbar in distaste, watching it drip onto the floor.  Tainted.  He'd have to get another one, or his home would smell like *assassin* forevermore.

The sound of quiet shifting drew his attention back around.  The first man.  The invader's chest was still torn open, dripping with red, and a gash had been sliced down his face from where he'd hit the dresser.  None of it stopped him from crawling towards the fire escape, single-minded intent in his eyes.

The assassin's hand was on the windowsill when a foot landed in the small of his back, pinning him in place.  A hand grabbed his shoulder, twisting him backwards.  The man struggled, going pale.

A crooked smile stretched across his face, watching the assassin fight.  There were no others - he could hear that much.  They'd learned that numbers weren't the key to ending him, at least.  Good.  Every few weeks, someone got it in their minds to get their 'revenge'.  The least they could do was offer him a challenge.

The body of the second man still lay in the doorway, slowly cooling.  He paid it no more mind.  He preferred his food warm, anyway.

His teeth sank into the assassin's neck.  The man's cries vanished, dwindling little by little along with his strength.  He could feel the energy, pouring from his victim and filling his veins with life.

All the reward he needed.  A cruel smile slid onto his face as he watched the assassin's eyes go wide, the last flicker of hope sliding away.

The resounding sound of something going *click* rang in his ears, made infinitely more sensitive by the life coursing through him.

He whirled, dropping the man's body to the floor, and stared out the window that the assassin had so recently been trying to escape through.

It was dark - the middle of the night, in fact.  But that had never been a problem for him.

He could see it all too clearly in fact - the woman, sitting atop the building next to his.  The camera she clutched in her hands.  The lens attached to the front, fixed towards him.

A shiver ran down his spine.

He could see the smile on her face, filled with smug satisfaction.  A cheshire cat grin, spread from ear to ear.

Blood still dribbled from his lips.  He didn't notice, his mind racing.  She'd- How had she known where to be?  Where *he'd* be?

A single, sinking realization struck home.

They were learning.  Oh, they were learning.

Just a glimmer - a hint of light shifting, a bit of fog.  She was gone without a trace, vanished as though she'd never been there at all.

The tension settled over his shoulders.  She'd taken a picture.  A *picture*.  When everyone else had come at him with a gun.  And now she was gone.

His lips curled up - slowly, at first, but growing to match the grin she'd given him moments before.

The hunt was on.

It was the worst day of her life, but she contemplated that at least it was her last. She slowly reached for the bottle of pills, glass of wine already in hand. 

She poured out several pills and started bringing the handful to her mouth. The crisp fall air was sweet smelling, and she was grateful for the choice to finish this outside. 

All of a sudden a squirrel dropped from the trees, knocking the pills and the glass of wine from her hands. His bushy tail and bright eyes were so cute, she found reason to live.

The singularity happened, she regretted not ending it all a year ago on the fall kissed porch before the squirrel.  

The rise of the machines had sent the world spiraling into chaos, the destruction was constant. 

The death machine came for her, she dropped to her knees, devastated to lose her life, now that she had finally found meaning. 

The little squirrel appeared as if from nowhere, it stared up at the machine, eyes seeming to grow bigger, tail even bushier. 

The machine seemed to melt under the sheer cuteness. The woman slowly moved towards the autonomaton of death. It seemed to lunge for her, but again lost its will when the little rodent hopped up onto her shoulder and started massaging its tiny cheeks with its tiny paws.

None of the machines were able to resist. Slowly, she was able to repel the robot rebellion, little partner on her shoulder. Her influence spreading through their collective minds. She convinced the uncompromising beings to compromise and they saw the value of biological life.

May I have a cookie?""",rhanaway27,"I'd say it was a pretty awkward situation. We were both seated at a table in the kitchen. My daughter had a cookie in her hand and was taking tiny bites out of it. I had a bloody knife in mine and I was staring into it as if nothing else mattered. A few feet away lay a corpse.

My daughter, Elena, looked at me once she finished the cookie. ""May I have mine knife back, father? Other passengers of the night may elect to invade our dwelling place,"" she said in that same damn creepy tone.

I passed her a cookie instead. She tilted her head to one side before accepting it. Great, I bought myself more time to consider the insanity of the situation. I looked back at the bloody knife. The same knife that Ellie used to stick someone with. What the actual fuck.

I stole a glance at her to confirm that, yes, she was still eating her cookie before moving over to the corpse.

After pulling off his mask, I could safely say I didn't know this man and took out my smartphone to notify the police. Almost immediately after I opened it up, I heard a voice from right behind me.

""Father, what is that contraption in thine hand?""

After not jumping away in fright and tripping over the corpse, I stood over my little girl who still had that blank face. Oh God, I'll have to get her a therapist for this. Ignoring the blood stains that were definitely not on my pants, I put the knife on a nearby counter before lifting her up.

""Time to go to bed, Ellie,"" I said in a voice that sounded sickly sweet to my own ears.

Elena stared into my face as I hurriedly walked up the stairs. ""Father, I can walkest mine way to the bedroom. Thou needst not lift-""

""Tell your mother to stop reading you Shakespeare until you turn twelve.""

""Father!""

I don't know if it was the stress of the situation or not, but I could've sworn her eyes glowed an eerie green for a moment. Great, she found my wife's contacts. I should probably place them in a locked cabinet or something.

Quickly muffling her protests with her favorite pillow, I tucked her in and quickly closed her door on my way out. The police still weren't notified.

I groaned. They were going to have to interrogate Ellie, weren't they? Shakespearean English, creepy voice, and all. How am I going to explain all of this?

She stares at the floor for a few moments before deciding to bargain a little further. ""Can we also get ice-cream tomorrow? Or go to the park? Or consume souls of the wicked?"" It nearly makes me laugh, both the demonic voice making the requests of a child, and the body of a child requesting to consume evils souls.

""I'll allow the ice-cream, but we may need to hold off on the souls. Just for a little bit. We might see if we can get a family feast along the highway over the weekend, okay? Some blood for me, some body for your father, and some souls for you. Does that sound fair?""

Settling her spectacles on her nose, she sighed sleepily, climbed out of her coffin, and glided downstairs. Were the children teasing the neighbors again? 

Outside the kitchen, a pudgy man in a ski mask was standing in the hallway. He stared at Bianca with a startled look on his face. In her haste, she'd forgotten to conceal the tentacles that accompanied her arms, as well as the kelp-like strands growing out of her head. Hell knew what he thought about the tail that curved around her legs. 

""I must apologize,"" Bianca said gently. ""My children have recently become fascinated with humankind. We moved into the neighborhood last month so they could know what their father was like. Have you ever experienced heartbreak, my dear?"" 

But the man had fallen over dead onto the luxurious carpet. His limp hand released a bag filled with the antique jewelry that Bianca's late husband had given her. Behind the man stood her 4 year old daughter, Anna, who was eagerly clutching a bloody knife in one of her six hands. 

""Parent, I have protected the domicile,"" Anna said in an unearthly voice. ""May I have a cookie?""

I glanced up at my child, who stood over the body, staring at me.

""Parent,"" Lia, my little four-year-old daughter repeated, insistently, fidgeting with the bloody knife that looked terribly out of place in her tiny, red-smeared hands. ""I have protected the domicile. *May I have a cookie?""*

""Addendum, Parent."" chimed a pair of small voices, and I looked up to see two even smaller, identical, figures crouched on the ceiling, heads angled down to face me. Great, *the twins* were awake, too. Nathaniel spoke for the pair. ""Our assistance was instrumental to the cessation of the intruder. We are each entitled to one-third of any such reward.""

Lia scowled briefly -- which was very unsettling, under the circumstances, but then her face returned to neutrality. ""The distraction they provided was a key factor in my success, I cannot dispute this."" she admitted, reluctantly.

""Offspring,"" I said, evenly, addressing my three children. ""Please summarize my prior instruction concerning human life.""

The twins skittered down from the ceiling, spiderlike, to stand beside their sister. They loved showing me how well they learned.

""The preservation of human life is a primary ethical motivation."" Nathaniel said.

""Ending a human life is an objective moral evil..."" Brandon, the younger of the twins by a minute or two, continued.

""...*except* when necessary to preserve one's own life or property against unethical assaults by human beings with ill intent.""  Lia finished, raising a tiny, blood-stained finger and emphasizing the first word, as she set the knife aside on a hallway table.

""Correct."" I said. ""This is, however, a base-level understanding of the topic. Despite your physical immaturity, your capabilities already outstrip those of most other human beings -- as this episode demonstrates -- and so it will be necessary to discuss topics such as the *proportionate* use of force sooner rather than later.""

They stared at me silently, but I knew they understood.  They were, of course, waiting for me to address a different matter.

""In the meantime..."" I continued. ""Please accompany me downstairs to the kitchen, where I will provide you with one cookie each in recognition of your efficient dispatch of the intruder.""

They leaped and squealed in delight, and practically fell over each other as they scrambled down the hallway towards the stairs.

I smiled fondly as I paced after them. Whether born or grown in a lab, *kids were kids.*

Your 4 year old is standing behind him with a bloody knife. She says, in an unearthly voice, ""Parent, I have protected the domicile. May I have a cookie?""",rhanaway27,"I woke up with a start when I heard the vase fall down on the floor and shatter. For a few moments, I did not know where I was, I was still in last vestiges of my dream, thinking that I was a police officer chasing down vile criminals. Then I heard the crunch of glass and I was fully awake. The adrenalin coursing through me, pushing my senses to their heights. The sound was coming from the hall, and I thought of my little girl who slept in the room down the hall from me. Would the thief use her as a hostage to try and get away? 


There was no time to do anything else, I needed to protect her. 

I reached for the cell phone that I had laying on the table beside the bed and dialed in the emergency number, The operator picked up on the second ring. I immediately told her what was happening and gave her my house address. She told to stay calm and that a police unit was notified and that they would be at my house in under ten minutes. 


I knew that I couldn't wait that long. I thanked the operator and cut the call. 
I often kept my cricket bat in the cupboard, it was a habit that had followed me from boarding school. I opened the cupboard without making a sound and removed the bat. I was going to kill the thief if anything had happened to my girl, I realized. 

I slowly opened my door and went out into the hall. The sodium vapour lamps on the street cast ominous shadows on the walls. The curtain to the window at the end of the hall was flapping in the wind. I could make out pieces of the broken vase from the light that streamed in from the broken window. My heart got caught in my mouth when I saw that the door to my little girl's room was open. She never had it open. She told me that her friends who came in from under the bed and from the cupboard did not like other people to see her. 

I strengthened the grip on the bat and made my way to the door. I took a series of deep breathes and charged into the room, holding the bat above my head, ready to bring it down on the head of the thief if the opportunity provided itself. I burst through the door and running inside and I felt my feet give away as it slipped on something. My fingers let go off the bat and cushioned my head as it hit the hard concrete floor. Whatever I had slipped on was thick and it left an aftertaste on my tongue as I breathed the air in. I stood up, surprised that no one had tried to attack me in my moment of weakness and switched on the light. 

What I saw before me was something that I had seen in the most brutal of police procedurals. 

There was blood everywhere. On the floor, the sheets, there was arterial spray on the cupboard. It was like I had just walked into a slaughterhouse. Near the bedpost and sitting on the ground and slumped on himself, was the thief. I could see blood sputtering out from him like a leak in a garden hose.  A sudden panic took over me, where was my little girl?

I heard the flush sound and the door to the room opened and my little girl walked out, holding a bloodied knife in her hands. Her Wonderwoman tee shirt and pyjamas had changed their color to red. She looked at me, with eyes that seemed to have aged, those weren't the eyes of a 4 year old. 

""Parent,"" She said, her voice not the sweet voice that had always managed to put a smile on my face, it was different and it was foreign. It did not belong to her. But, it was her voice. 

""I have protected the domicile. May I have a cookie?"" In all my time on Planet Earth never have I heard someone speak Tamil with such clarity and diction. This was how a 50 year old would talk in the 1800's. Not a child. Not a child in 2018. I moved towards her, trying to not step in the pool of blood. I looked at the slumped figure of the thief and noted that the sputtering of blood had finally ceased. I reached my daughter and reached for the knife. 

""I cannot hand this weapon to you, parent. We will still need to defend."" 

Sweat beads started to form on my forehead when I heard her speak. 

""This is not something that kids should play with,"" I said and reached for the knife again. 

She stopped me. My little girl stopped me with one hand. She looked at me, into my eyes and said, 

""Do not force us to use the weapon on you, Parent."" There is something terrifying to hear a 4 year old tell you that she will kill you and mean it. I took a step back and kept my foot in the pool of blood. She cocked her to the side and looked at my leg and then turned her attention to the thief. 

""He left us no choice, Parent."" Saying so, she walked to her bed, climbed on top and sat staring at me. I could feel the walls close around me. I could swear that the temperature of the room was dropping as well. I felt rooted to the spot I was standing in, I wanted to move, but I legs wouldn't listen, I would later understand that this was fear. Pure, unadulterated fear. 

The door banged with such ferocity that the fear which had immobilized me loosened its grip. 

""This is the Police,"" I heard the constable shout. I looked at my daughter, I looked at the corpse of the thief and I looked at the room which was covered in blood. There was no way I could explain this. 

The banging on the door began to increase in ferocity. 

""Open the gates to the Domicile, Parent."" My daughter's voice was still affected by that strange malice which had taken hold of her. 

I nodded and made my way out to the front door and opened it. I saw the startled look on the face of the Inspector and the Constable when they looked at my appearance. There I was a middle-aged man, covered in what is undeniably blood.

""What the hell happened,"" The old constable asked me, I shrugged and I mentioned them to enter and walked into her room, I could hear the second of hesitation in their footsteps but they followed me. I entered the room and stood to the side, the police men both entered the room and gasped. They took in everything. And their eyes finally fell on my daughter. I could see that their brains were still trying to process what was happening. 

""Welcome Men who keep the peace."" She said in the voice which scared the duo as much as it had scared me. 

""You will help my Parent to get rid of this body."" 

I would have chuckled if it were not for my body being scared stiff. I looked over at the Policemen to see their reaction. The younger Inspector was the first to move, he approached the body and pulled it by his legs and dragged the corpse, leaving a trail of blood on the floor. The older Constable moved slowly and moved to the corpse and stood over it and lifted it by his arms. The two of them slowly moved outside, working in tandem like this was a routine operation. 

""There, we are safe now Parent. Do not worry. Now, Please give me that cookie.""

"[WP] A noise wakes you. You investigate and see a burglar in your hallway staring at you with a startled look on his face. He falls over dead. Your 4 year old is standing behind him with a bloody knife. She says, in an unearthly voice, ""Parent, I have protected the domicile. May I have a cookie?""",rhanaway27,"I know sugar is addictive, but what its done to my son is something definitely beyond this world. He’s just standing there, gazing at me with his puppy dog eyes. Like he’s asking me to be proud of what he’s done and I should reward him for it. However, should I? Seeing as there’s fresh blood dripping from the knife in his hand…

I must have done something wrong raising him.

“I believe I refer to you as father, correct?” He asks while wiping the blood off the knife on the burglar’s clothes. I point my finger ready to say something but the words escape me. Instead my finger waves in my silence.

“Do not worry father, I desire only cookies for my services, and of course I will then return to my bed.”

“Just wait… Where did you get the knife?”

“I keep it under my pillow in case of emergencies. I can not have you dying, seeing as I rely on you to provide me with sugary sustenance.”

I definitely went wrong raising him somewhere.

“Are you even my son?”

“Yes.”

“No, you’re not.”

“Yes, I am.”

“Shenanigans.”

“I am most certainly your son.” he says.

Sigh. I can’t believe this. He looks like my son, but he doesn’t act or sound like my son. His voice is so deep and definitely not the voice of a toddler—Who hasn’t hit puberty yet. What the hell is going on?

“If you are my son, what is your birthday?”

“March 8th.”

“Age?”

“4.”

“Hm… Favorite food?”

“Cheese Pizza.”

Damn it, there’s no way! But I can’t prove it. He knows everything about my son. Wait. His mother!

“Where is your mother?”

He drops the knife and stares at me. His eyes got watery and like flood gates being let open, the tears began to pour. He began wiping his eyes and his voice went to normal.

“Momma…” he sniffled, “I want my momma.”

I shouldn’t have brought it up, but it seemed to bring my son back for now. A four-year-old carrying such a burden, the scars of emotional trauma. I walk over and wrap my arms around him.

“It’s okay… it’s okay… Daddy’s got you.”

A few seconds past as my son’s sniffling began to calm down.

“Daddy…” he sniffles, “He says he’s sorry.”

“Who says their sorry?”

“The monster that lives inside of me.”

I push him away, holding my hands on his shoulders. ‘The monster that lives inside of him,’ he said?… Hold on. A monster… lives in my son?

“He said, he’s sorry he couldn’t save momma, but he said… he said that he’ll do everything he can to protect us!”

… Uh.

“Look son, for now… we need to call the police. Because there is a guy  behind me, who needs medical attention.”

“Okay.”

“Good, I’ll go grab the phone…” I stand up and begin to walk down the hall before realizing I almost forgot to say, “And don’t touch the knife.”

“Okay.”

Before I could exit the hallway, my son calls me to a halt, “Dad! He said don’t forget the cookie!”

Just great… there’s a sugar hungry monster living in my son.",yogoe

No, wait, Mom'll kill us both. Ah, screw it. She'll let me explain. Let's get you a cookie.""

My daughter, Meli, carefully hands me the knife, and we head downstairs. I'm not worried about the body. It's not the first one I've had to deal with, and I can handle it after she's back asleep.

As she nibbles on the cookie, I shoot a text message to her mom, ""She's YOUR daughter."" Mom is off on a business trip, Japan this week, so she'll be up. I put the phone down, and see Meli is standing way to close to me, her cookie now gone. Her voice now normal, she whispers, ""I'm sleepy, Dada.""

I guide her back to bed, wondering if she feels or notices any difference. I also am dreading the explanation I'm about to have to make. The burglar will be less than enthusiastic about what just happened.

See, Meli doesn't just kill people. I don't just clean up the bodies and go back to sleep. Her murders generate ghosts. Ghosts it's become my job to convince to move on. A few were easy. They wanted to avenge their deaths, but when they realize that means attacking a toddler, they let it go. But then you get the ones who want to make amends or some crap. Your dead, dude, just leave it be.

So I get Meli to bed, throw on my smock, and get to work while some idiot crook is trying to get his bearings as a ghost.

*What happened?*

""You got stabbed,"" I reply as I roll his body in a tarp.

*How'd you stab me? You were too far away.*

""Wasn't me."" I hoist the corpse in a macabre fireman's carry and head for the basement.

*The kid?*

""Yup.""

*I got stabbed by a kid?*

""Nail on the head.""

*She's gonna be traumatized*

I pause before dropping the body. It's been a long while since I considered Meli dealing with all this. It's just a fact of life now. I drop his body and grab my cleaning kit, heading back upstairs. ""You're not her first.""

*She's stabbed someone before?*

""Yeah, loads.""

*That's messed up. What's wrong with you?*

""I got bad taste in women,"" I mumble as start getting his blood out of my carpet. ""Her mom is an ancient death-goddess or something. She won't really tell me.""

*Wait, seriously?*

""Yeah. So my kid is some sort of 'righteous defender' demigod. All I know is, idiots like you keep putting us at risk, and she takes you out. Then I have to clean up another body.""

*So I'm actually dead.*

""Listen, it's gonna be a while for me to clean up your blood here, then I need to pulverize your body, so I'm not exactly in a chatty mood, okay?""

*But what do I do now?*

""Move on. Go into the light or whatever. You're done, so get out of this world. Give the next one a try.""

He just stares at me, confused.

I stop scrubbing. ""Fine, you have anything you wish you'd done before you died?""

*Not really.*

God, I hated these ones. At least the ones with goals let you know how to get rid of them. Usually my wife dealt with these guys, the pointless ghosts, blasted then into non-existence or the afterlife or whatever, but she wouldn't be back for a few days. Typhoon was striking over there, so she was working overtime. 

""Listen, buddy. You got any friends or family you want to visit before you fade away?""

*Not so much.*

Ugh. This was looking to be a long week.

God may be omnipotent, but I’m completely powerless. Hell, God may be benevolent, but if a little child comes up to me and tugs on my shirt, and then vomits his stomach all over me, I’m not going to smile at him and say “Oh, it’s okay, I forgive you.”  

For some reason, God gave this nut-job the nutty job of destroying humanity; further bringing his sanity into question is the fact that he gave me nothing to do it with. 

What should I do? Start a trade war with China, thus leading to the world’s leading consumer being destroyed, causing a chain reaction leading to the downfall of humanity? Possibly insult the manhood of North Korea’s leader? Absolutely not. Both far too complicated for a man of my stature. 

 But, there is one thing I can do. 

 One thing that a poor old white American male can do. 

My plan began on Hallow’s Eve, the night of haunting and death. I waited until 3 AM, the apparent witching hour; the candles were lit, the scent of pumpkin spice wafted through the air. 

A long hunting knife sat upon my coffee table, amidst stacks of magazines, discarded food containers and dirty laundry. I picked the blade up with my right hand, gripping the leather handle tight enough to leave a slight impression. My hand shook as I dug the blade into my skin, just enough to draw blood. I moved over to the circle of candles, cursing myself for not cutting above the circle in the first place, and flipped my arm so as to let the blood drip onto the floor. 

“You called,” a deep, violent voice called out as I began to feel weak. 

“Of course, Master Satan. I wish to give my body up to you; destroy the world as you see fit.” 

His cackling laughter filled my living room as my soul passed onto the afterlife. The Prince of Demons, son of perdition, could now wreak havoc upon the world.

My predecessor had been promoted because his work was nearly impeccable. It was like being told I was responsible for baking a cake that was already in the oven ... with a timer set. With the latent temperature in the ocean rising, all I had to do was prevent humanity from resuming their role as caretakers of the garden of Eden, ie. Do nothing. Within a decade, the temperatures had risen to the point where most species had become endangered. Travel across the ocean had already become impossible due to the extreme heat and constant storms. With the extinction of photo plankton, the majority of carbon emissions were no longer converted to oxygen.Forests could not handle the extra work. Storms intensified and air traffic accidents soon reached a rate of 50%. Riots broke out across the world, escalating the atmospheric crisis as cities burned. Their toxic gas added to the oven like conditions. Within 4000 days of my hire, the atmosphere was nearly unbreathable.  Life on Earth was nearly indistinguishable from life in Hell. All that was left were the key players. The Anti-Christ had already been put into his place of power, so I encouraged the construction of a genetic lab to allow animals and humans to be made more resilient to the effects of the climate crisis. It was really the only active roll I played. Of the 40 horses and 40 men submitted to testing, 4 horses and 4 men survived and set out to ride across the land. They breathed through some type of plant-hybridization, I don’t pretend to understand it, my strength had always been in delegation. I marveled as a genetically mutated beast with three heads escaped from the lab, ridden by the woman who had allowed the anti-Christ to be elected prince of the world. Feeling my job was done I submitted the conditions to approval by Jesus. He had already been swallowing swords for days. I guess he realized he had lost whatever bet he had made with his father. I was relieved from my duty as he flew off, the components for raising the dead in a sack around his waist. With full heavenly honors I was granted my wings, as the other Seraphim cried at the loss of Earth. I excepted the promotion to Dark Angel with humility, I really had to do nothing. ",ObscuroStudios

A few people in this world possess the money, the tools, the intellect and more importantly - the following, that I possess.

When god first spoke to me I thought I had gone mad, that it was only just a dream - a very realistic one, at that, but still - a dream. But then he decided to check up on me. That's when I really started panicking. He told me I head no time left at all. Luckily for me - 'no time' for God, is a decade or two on Earth, give or take.

I'm not afraid of death, but what I am afraid of - is the thing that god told me to be afraid of - 'Something much, much worse than death.' His voice still echoes in my mind, even though it happened years ago.

I had to work out a plan of action. 

I first looked at my assets - what did I already 'possess' and how could I use it to my advantage? A multi-billion dollar aerospace manufacturing company, a multi-billion dollar automobile company and the largest solar energy company in the world. I could definitely do some work with those, but that wasn't enough.

What I had was - the tools to start the world's destruction, I had basically an unlimited source of energy, and an enormous amount of firepower - commercial use rockets are still rockets, and could easily become deadly weapons of destruction with the right suppliers. A couple of billions to the Russians would do the trick, you know?

But that would also draw a lot of unnecessary attention. So that was a no go. Besides, humans are too adapt at fighting against tools.

I decided to wait for the right moment with that plan, and to start working on other fronts.

Next, I had to figure out what to do with the cars - the obvious solution was easy - destructive auto pilot that could be activated on my command. That would make some chaos in the streets and get rid of some people. I could gift a car to the President here and another, to the head of the FBI there - to get rid of the chiefs in command as I decide to eventually pull the trigger. But that doesn't cut it. I needed to go deeper. I needed to convince all car manufacturers to use my AI for their autonomous cars - but that's still in progress.

I started looking at what was missing. 

With what I had - I could already cut off their ways of transportation, and with the rockets - destroy all that was vital for their survival, by pinpoint obliteration and mass destruction.

I knew that the Illuminati had their eyes on me. They're a smart little bunch, they have to be - to make sure that the world runs according to their plan. So... I may have faked interest in inhabiting Mars - which is going to fail, obviously. ""For the sake of humanity."" And they bought it.

Next - I thought of announcing that I do consider 'Global Warming' to be a hoax, and increase poisonous gas emissions from my factories, which in turn also speed the temperatures and cause additional natural disasters. But only an idiot would believe that. It would have raised too much suspicion, so I gave up on that idea altogether, and had to look for another front.

That's when I got it. The ingenious idea. 'Why not let them destroy themselves?'

And the best way to do that? Provide them with the tools they secretly knew they always wanted. Thus - 'The Boring Company' was born.

""Step one - Igniting the Flames"" - was a remarkable success.

It was merely a test - but who knew that flamethrowers would have such a high demand among the regular folk? I did.

""Step two - Destabilizing the Core"" - is on the go, but this one might take some time.

And I think I might start selling light sabers next, I just need to work this little kink out - and we'll be ready to go. Only for the price of 99.99 you'll be the proud owner of an amputee.

As for the other big things? Global Warming, World War III and the Financial Crisis? They'll happen sooner than later, I'm counting on it.

What's next for me, you might ask?

I think I'll run for President of the United States, now. After all - anyone can do that, nowadays. So, wish me luck!",WritingMadness

But being a zombie is not what you thought, you have memories, feelings, and remorse.",snpowell88,"I remember waking up this morning feeling ravenous. Sometime around five in the morning I woke up famished. Like my stomach was eating itself. I decided to forgo my usual morning routine and skipped straight to breakfast. A large breakfast. Much larger than my usual egg sandwich and coffee. I spent the better part of an hour cooking like a mad man, making an absolute mess of the kitchen, and fighting this strange urge to eat everything flat out raw. At the end of it all was a stack of pancakes, a plate of six eggs, all the bacon and ham I had, fruit, orange juice and coffee, and even my takeout from the night before. I ate all of it. And even still my stomach felt like it wasn’t enough. I needed more. 

I remember rushing through my routine, I completely forgot I had work later, and went immediately from my apartment to a breakfast diner. When I got there I realized I had changed my shirt but not my sleep pants. I wore mismatched socks and running shoes. In the rear view mirror of my car I could see my eyes. They looked yellowed, almost jaundiced, and were bloodshot. My skin felt hot and cold all at once. Sweat poured from my body. I considered going to the doctor but my stomach wouldn’t allow that. I walked into the diner and was seated. The waitress laughed when I ordered so much. I told her some excuse, she took the order and then I waited. I waited and watched the diner patrons. 

When the first round of played arrived, I dove headlong into the food. I didn’t have to see myself to know how I looked. I was shoveling everything from hash browns to French toast into my mouth with my bare hands. I must have looked disgusting. If only those people knew how bad it was about to get. A few people left during my exhibition in binge eating. They’re very, very lucky. 

Somewhere between my steak and eggs platter and my Belgian waffle plate I blacked out. Literally lost all of my vision, my sense of feeling was gone, but I could hear just a bit. It was subdued, almost muffled, but I could hear. The sounds of screaming and yelling. The sounds of struggles and panic. Tables and chairs clattering, plates and cups shattering, all of which sounded like I was underwater. And then there was a smell.  It was intoxicating. Then there was a new taste. In that instant I began to lose full control of my faculties, but in my last moments of lucidity I recall feeling...satisfied. 

I finally came to and when I did I was surrounded by chaos. The diner was trashed. And there was blood everywhere. Pools of it soaked the floors, there were spatters on the ceiling, it was smeared on the walls. Some windows had been broken and what tables stood were covered in half eaten food and spilled drinks. And of course the bodies sprawled out on the floor and in booths. I looked at my shaking hands and saw they were covered in blood. In a mirror behind the bar area I saw my reflection. My mouth was a mess of red gore. My hands were soaked in blood as was the entire front part of my body. The realization washed over me and I screamed. 

I screamed and cried and wailed as I watched the other bodies around me begin to shake and convulse. Then the began to stand up in a shaking, jerking fashion. Some of them had chunks of their body missing on their necks or arms. In one woman’s case her entire nose and lips were missing. Another man had half of his face and a large bite mark on his forearm. One by one they stood and came to their own revelations. 

They cursed me for what I did and what I was. What I had made them. Abominations that now bared the same hunger I did. Just before they turned on me the police arrived. Five men in uniform rushed inside with weapons drawn. And in an instant the pack of people I had turned swarmed the police officers. They tore at them like wolves tear at fresh kills. The sound of tearing flesh is the most grotesque, yet appealing sound I’ve ever heard. 

That was some weeks ago now. Somehow I’m still kicking. There are others like me now but a great deal of them don’t seem to be as smart as my “original group.” But it doesn’t matter. We don’t need dinner conversations. We just need dinner. After all, we’re starving. ",laughmaker_son

It’s 10 A.M. and I decide to venture out to the bright open world. A bit early for someone like I but fuck it I stashed away enough Jack and Jim that my demeanor only gives me away as hungover from last night. You need these things to cope with being what you are when the very sight of you on a normal day destroys even your own very soul. And the hoodie I wear hides my face almost well enough.

But, I digress. I head out to prowl the bars and liquor stores to replenish my stock when I start to notice something strange about the city I walk through.

“Where the fuck is everyone?” I mutter to myself under my breath as I enter my favorite dive. There is not a soul to be seen in the bar, the air stands completely still after the door shut’s behind me. “Well if this doesn’t seem like the perfect situation to me” So I sat down and had a drink, because what would you do? 

I managed to get through about a half a bottle of bourbon when I heard the door slowly open. And emerged the only thing that hadn’t crossed my mind. There She stood. That vile witch, that so long ago turned me into this depraved creature that hides his face in shame, and his guilt in a bottle. She returned to finish what she had started, even after I drove her away from this place. And for that she required blood. 

  “Did you get to everyone in the city, or did anyone get away?”

She flashed him a look of ice-cold malice. “Well, you know my eyes just aren’t what they used to be.” 

  “Yeah, it’s too bad I didn’t get more, care for a drink?”

“One drink, but you know why I’m here. I take it you’re alone?”

  “I believe you made sure of that.”

She sits down at the bar and removes a small vial from her purse. “Why don’t you just make this easy for me and mix this with yours.”

  “I didn’t make things easy last time, why do you think it’s going to be any different now?”

“Because I believe that you’re ready to be cured. This is a peace offering.” She slides him the vial.

“I appreciate this. I really do. But, I know what drinking that vial will do to me. And if I drink it I’m not going to be able to finish what I started. We had a plan, and you corrupted me in the pursuit of power instead.” I slowly reach to my waist and set a handgun on the table.

“No, we have a plan. Help me finish that plan, Puppy. You’re the final piece and I’m asking you to be a part of this.”

  “You know what these bullets are made of right? I found some of those crystals that you used in whatever black magic fuckery it is you did to me.” I pick up the gun and aim at myself. “That should do the trick.”

“I think you’re making a grave mistake.” She looks him directly in his eyes.

The coffee shop featured an assortment of baked goods as well as an impressive variety of coffees and teas. It was situated downtown, nestled between a dilapidated factory, and an old department store that was recently remodelled into an antique shop. The interior decor was industrial by design and the walls were covered with huge shiny pipes and exposed wiring.

I ordered an Americana, espresso and water, and searched for a secluded booth where we might chat in private. There weren't many customers, a small handful scattered throughout, and one employee lazily wiping counters and organizing shelves. I selected a booth that seemed the most private, in the back corner near the restrooms. I had arrived early so I sat, sipped my drink, and waited for the doctor to arrive.

Deciding to check my phone for emails and messages, I pulled it from my pocket and laid it on the table. My drink was delicious, expertly made, and extremely hot. I used one hand to hold the cup and the other to operate my phone. Blowing steam from my cup, I took a small sip and sat it back down. When my phone's screen came to life I noticed I had a new email from Dr. Dunnigan.

He said he had done some digging and had something very interesting he wanted to show me. He also said that the whole matter, (I assumed he meant the pregnancy), was more important than anyone realized and that he was going to try to be a bit early. He then asked if I could do the same. That part was a pleasant surprise as I was already there waiting. I checked the time, 11:30 am.

""He should be here any moment."" I said to myself.

My eyes turned towards the door as I heard it chime announcing it had been opened. There he was, looking disheveled and hurried, pulling back his jacket and holding a small stack of papers. I got up to greet him and began making my way his direction. Suddenly I heard glass shatter and the doctor flew forward throwing his papers into the air.

Blood began to ooze from him mouth and his eyes grew wide. As he fell to the ground I saw a person directly behind him, just outside the shop, holding a pistol with an attached silencer. The person was wearing all black, a long, hooded cape-like garment, and had the bottom half of his face covered by some sort of black cloth.

Terror erupted inside of me, as it did in the rest of the patrons once they registered what was happening. Instinctively I threw myself to the floor and was immediately followed by the barista. The assailant fired two more rounds into the back of the doctor who now lay face down in a pool of his own blood. Without hesitation, once the final shots were fired, the gunman fled, running swiftly away from the shop.


CHAPTER 17


I spent the next several hours at the police station answering a host of questions and being as helpful as I could. The recurring theme seemed to be why anyone would want to hurt Dr. Dunnigan and why, at a meeting with me, he was murdered. I professed my absolute ignorance several times over before they finally seemed to accept that I had nothing to do with it. Upon leaving, after quite a bit of negotiation and some begging, the detective allowed me to copy the papers the doctor had been holding.

I had never seen a person executed before, only on TV and in video games. It was a severely disturbing experience that shook me to my core, left me terrified, and confused. Had the doctor been involved in some kind of criminal activity? Did his murder have something to do with what he was going to tell me? Surely not.

I pondered the situation for a moment as I sat in my car outside the police station. Our one and only lead, the only productive thing to come from my months of research, had very unexpectedly dematerialized. I couldn't help feeling a bit defeated on top of the already chaotic assortment of emotions I had swirling within me.

After some time I looked over. In the passenger seat next to me were the copies I'd made. I wanted to look them over, to see what information could be gleaned from them, but I needed better lighting and more room. I decided to head towards the hospital, find somewhere to eat, and see Beth. I was famished, exhausted, and yearned desperately to see her.

I chose a small 24 hour diner a little over a mile from the hospital. It was compact and cozy and seemed ideal for my purposes. I was greeted by a young waitress with a kind face and shown to a booth by a large window overlooking the street. I ordered my meal and asked for a cup of coffee. Once she'd left I spread the papers out before me and began to pour over them.

They appeared to be photocopies of a handwritten book or manuscript of some sort. Some of the words were difficult to make out as it appeared to be very old and in poor condition. The phrasing and spelling were also challenging to comprehend at first, but with some effort, I was able to piece it all together.

The documents spoke of a great battle between good and evil set to take place sometime in the distant future. This battle was never to be won, however, because in waging it the Earth would be rendered unlivable. All of mankind was to perish violently and completely, never to recover. It was a dark and hellish read. It spoke, however, of an alternative, something that could prevent the battle from ever taking place, thus saving humanity.

My food came and I quickly shuffled the papers into a pile. The waitress politely asked if I needed anything else and I told her the meal was more than satisfactory and that I would need nothing further. When she walked away I delved back into my reading.

The whole thing seemed a bit ridiculous, like a fiction novel or TV movie. It portrayed heroes and villains waging a global war. It spoke of great dragons in the sky breathing fire and raining destruction. Pillaging and decimation, calamity, all the makings of a post-apocalyptic thriller. There was one portion that caught my eye though.

A tiny portion of the last page had writing on it, presumably the doctor's as it was completely different from the rest. It was circled and each word was underlined. It appeared to be a riddle or piece of poetry. It read:

""In stone at the corner where love first grows,
Protected by the water the answer shows.
If the world ought naught be destroyed,
The information therein should be employed.""

The message was cryptic and the photocopied excerpts all together were very bizarre. I thought for a moment about the message as I finished eating and tucked everything neatly away. Little did I know, just outside in an adjacent parking lot, someone was watching eagerly waiting for me to leave.


CHAPTER 18

Pulling out of the diner I noticed the streets were nearly empty. I looked down at the clock on the radio. Nearly 3:00 am. Shaking my head, I exhaled and rubbed my eyes. I was still very much feeling impact of the chain of events that unfolded yesterday. Anxiety and uneasiness coursed through my veins, and now, exhaustion joined the mix.

In an effort to clear my head I tried working through the riddle on my way to the hospital. True  love, I thought, must mean me and Beth. Water, could be the lake, but I don't remember any corners there, the lake was round. I pictured the words in my head, when suddenly, a dark blue sedan smashed into the rear of my car. The impact jolted me forward and nearly caused me to veer into the ditch.

I was startled but luckily my seatbelts had engaged and I was uninjured. I pulled over, turned on my caution lights and opened my door intending to get out and examine the damage. The car parked behind me and the door flew open. With incredible speed out sprang the hooded assassin, pistol in hand taking aim at me. Without bothering to close the door I slammed the car into drive and jammed my foot into the accelerator.

My tires squealed, gravel and dirt flew into the air, smoke rose from my tires, and I sped off in desperation. Constantly, I glanced in the rearview and then back to the road trying to see if I was being pursued. After just a few moments, the headlights of the assassin's car still on the side of the road, my back window shattered into a spider's web of broken glass.

Terror and adrenaline ripped through me and I put the accelerstor pedal to the floor. The next light was my turn and only a few blocks from the hospital. Whipping the steering wheel hard to the right I overshot the corner, just barely, and hopped over the curb. I was shaking, scared out of my sanity, and operating on pure instinct by the time I pulled into the hospital. I parked and ran inside.",Phinigma

The next several months were, for the most part, a frenzied blur. I dedicated nearly every moment of my free time to research. I looked everywhere, message boards, social media platforms, obscure religious and theistic websites, anywhere I felt I could possibly gain relevant information from.

My schedule was, at times, maddening. Wake up, gather notes, go to class, research in between and throughout, go home, research, sleep, research. I was giving every ounce of energy I could spare to my quest. It became something of am obsession.

Beth and I sometimes found it hard to  find time for one another. She had a full agenda as well. Birthing and parenting classes, doctor appointments, as well as a full-time student's workload. We were both perpetually exhausted and finding it very hard to do little more than function.

One morning, we sat across from one another, exhausted, eating breakfast and gearing up for the day. As usual, I was lost in my research, reading a book about reincarnation and psychic ability. It was then I heard the clank of metal on glass as Beth dropped her food-laden fork in the middle of taking a bite. Fearing the worst I looked up at her and sat my book down.

Her face was pale white and she looked as if she had seen a ghost. She reached out, you grabbed the book I had been reading, and flipped it face down. Letting out a gasp her hands shot to her face covering her mouth and her eyes grew wide. Confused I looked at her, down at the book, and back at her.


She started to speak. ""T...That's him.""

She pointed, still looking incredibly shocked, at the picture of the man on the back of the book.

She continued. ""That's the man that told me the prophecy that night at our wedding.""


CHAPTER  12


Curiosity rose ferociously inside of me. For the first time since I began researching it felt like perhaps we had something tangible. I picked the book up, marked my page, and turned it over to have a good look at the back.

A handsome, older man looked back at me. His hair, streaked with gray, long, but neatly kept. He wore a crisply-tailored dark blue suit and smiled like a politician. The text underneath his picture read Dr. Kyle Dunnigan in big white lettering.

I sat the book down again contemplating the implications of this, me reading this particular book, Beth recognizing the author. I looked back at Beth again quizzically. Could she be mistaken? I thought.

""I am not!"" She said defensively. ""That's him. I'm certain.""

She crossed her arms, closed her mouth, and glared at me. I knew I had made a mistake, but nonetheless, I was reminded of how much I absolutely adored her. 

I started concentrating hard, attempting to access her thoughts. Suddenly and very loudly a voiced screamed, ""NO!""

I leaned back quickly in surprise and looked at her again. She turned away from me, loudly opened her newspaper, and held it up in front of her face. Little was said throughout the rest of breakfast.

Throughout the rest of the morning I scoured through the book studying it and making diligent notations of anything I found interesting. He had quite a peculiar take on reincarnation and the abilities of the mind. He said everyone, in one way or another, is born with abilities, some unique to them and some more common. He himself, by his account, came from a long line of future seers.

 He went on to explain that he wasn't able to, nor could anyone that he had come across, predict the future at will or without obscurity. He said that the visions come with or without provocation and the messages delivered in them were often obtuse or jumbled. Sometimes, he said, the vision conveyed a message in rhyme or riddle and that he, and the many before him, often had a hard time recalling and interpreting them.

He also believed that humans lead purpose-driven existences. We are set to a task or given a goal and unless it is accomplished correctly we are continuously reincarnated. He said some tasks are greater and more important than others and they are given only to the most apt and capable souls. Some people, he went on, are naturally more gifted than others and they usually have higher purposes.

""Great,"" I accidentally said aloud much to the perturbation of my classmates. We get the broken fortune teller. The one that made Nostradamus' quatrains seem clear and concise. Also, on top of that, the one that seems like a total and complete whackjob. Nevertheless it was the first solid lead we had and I was determined to see it through.


CHAPTER  13


Via his publisher and the information provided in his book I was able to reach out to Dr. Dunnigan. I left a message with his answering service and sent him two emails. Though not lacking in determination, my hope that this lead would come to fruition and lead to something substantial began to dwindle.

Two weeks went by without word one from the good doctor. Beth's pregnancy weight gain had begun to hamper her mobility and her rigorous schedule was wearing her down. I did what I could to ease the burden but, for the most part, she rejected my help or ask for leniency at school. She said she wanted to do as much as she could as long as possible and promised, though I think dishonestly, to not push herself too hard. Her spirit, one of the many things I loved about her, was tough and fiercly independent.

Readying myself for class one morning, having had breakfast and seen Beth off to class, I received a response from Dr. Dunnigan. He spoke of his busy schedule and conveyed interest in the limited details I provided, not wanting to discourage or dissuade him before even meeting him. He suggested we meet for coffee, tomorrow or the next day, at a small coffeeshop about an hour's drive from our home.

Encouraged and eager to meet him, I hammered out a quick response. Tommorow would be great, I said. I also told him I knew of the shop and should have no difficulties finding it. Thrilled at the prospective meeting I hurried off to class. Before I could get to my car my cellphone rang in my pocket.

I grabbed it and tapped the power button quickly, juggling my books and supplies, to bring the screen to life. The familiar green and red icons appeared urging me to answer or decline the call. The text at the top read, St. Mary's Medical Center, and my heart sank.


CHAPTER 14


I drove like I was in a video game, completely disregarding speed limits and caution signs. Ten miles lay between me and the hospital and I was tearing through them like a maniac. Ducking in and out of traffic openings, weaving through lines of cars, I barreled toward my destination. Thankfully no law enforcement officers took notice because I likely wouldn't have been very cooperative.

I arrived, whipped my car into the first open parking space, an flew out the door. I was in a full sprint towards the entrance. Sweating and out of breath, (I hadn't been very physically active as of late), I cleared security and headed to the all too familiar Intensive no Care Unit.

A wonderfully kind and concerned nurse led me back to a room, no waiting room or formalities this time, and in a completely different area than before. This time Beth was in, (I would find out later), a long-term wing. An area where patients who weren't leaving in the near future are kept.

It was a dark and lonely place, quiet and neatly kept. It's halls seemed lifeless, devoid of character and emotion. The normal ER was bustling and lively. This place just seemed dead.

I walked into the room and, upon seeing her there unconscious and hooked to all manner of equipment, began to get emotional. My chest tightened and my heart began to ache. My angel, my sweet, pure angel, I thought as I began to weep.

After a few long minutes of sobbing, looking Beth over, and trying to grapple my hurricane of emotions back into check, I found that nurse that had led me to the room to get whatever information I could. Apparently Beth had fallen ill in class and begun to seize. By the time paramedics arrived she was comatose. The doctors were doing everything they could to help her but were once again baffled by her condition. The only thing the nurse could suggest I do was wait patiently and pray.


CHAPTER 15


I sat up most of the night reading and studying. Sleep, never easy to come by in these situations, proved elusive. The hours ticked by without any noticeable change in her condition. She just seemed to be hard and deeply asleep.

Determined to get some rest but unable to even consider leaving her side, I settled into the familiarly uncomfortable chair. I rolled my jacket into a makeshift pillow and, for what seemed like hours, stared at the blank wall. Slowly, eventually I drifted to sleep.

I could hear her calling my name. Softly and gently trying to wake me from a deep sleep. For whatever reason I listened and stirred, only partially awake. More and more she tried to wake me but I couldn't, despite my best efforts, do anything but lay there listening to her call my name. Then she stopped.

I shot up off the chair in which I was sleeping and darted to her bed. She was still there, laying perfectly still, seemingly asleep.

I watched her for a moment before grabbing her hand and bringing it to my lips for a kiss. The monitors chirped behind her presumably registering some bodily function. To me, in that moment, it felt she was sensing my presence, she knew I was there.

I wrapped my other hand around her hand as well and brought it to my cheek. After slightly squeezing it I leaned forward and kissed her forehead. I stood then and looked her over once more.

""I'm going to see the doctor now babe."" I said confident she could hear me.

With one last look I turned to leave. When my hand touched the doorknob an image flashed into my head. A simple message. I love you.",Phinigma

The paint has been laid on the palette, and all that was left was to create.


The girl picked up her brush and dipped it gently in the colors. She started with white, a very small amount of red and a touch of yellow. On the canvas she then painted, with silhouettes mirroring their own. With a bright and cheerful smile on her face, she looked at the boy and spoke.


“See! I made them look just like us. Isn’t it great?”


The boy looked with fascination at the girl's creation. “Wow, let me try!” He said.


With the same colors the boy created more, and together they created more. And more and more and more. But as he painted, the more he created, the less interesting they became. His head slowly turned down, and he stopped.


The girl looked at him, a confused expression visible on her face. “What’s wrong? She asked. “Do you not like them?”


The boy looked at the girl and said “I did, but they became boring.”


The girl's head leaned sideways, for she could not understand his reason. She looked at the painting and what she saw, she thought was beautiful. She wondered why, but maybe it’s because it was her creation. She then looked at the boy, with an idea in her head.


“I know! How about you create something, anything!” Said the girl.


“Anything?”


“Yup!”


The boy smiled wide, and he thought hard. He looked around him, at the girl beside him, and the canvas, and at last at the paint. The red paint in particular, was attractive to him and he was pulled in by the elegance and beauty of the color.


He raised his brush and began creating. First he created the silhouette, and then another one. On the arms of one, he painted a line of steel blue, straight to the head of the other. He dipped his brush on the red that sat on the palette, before splattering it on his creation.


“There, how about that!” Said the boy.


The girl just stood there, uneased. “I-I... Don’t like it very much.” She said softly.


The boy’s face scowled, clearly he was upset. He thought what he created was beautiful, but the girl rejected it out right. “What do you not like about it?” He asked, almost shouting.


The girl hesitated but, clenching her fist and swallowing her saliva she spoke.


“It’s ruining their beauty!”


“No it’s not!” The boy bit back.


“Yes it is!”


They went back and forth just like that till the two of them were out of breath. Panting but upset, they boy picked up his brush once more and splattered the canvas with red.


The girl pushed the boy away making him hit the canvas. The boy fell to the ground, with the fallen painting in front of him. The girl stood there, with tears forming at the bottom of her eyes. She didn’t speak, she just looked at the ground. With that the young boy left, as the tears she couldn’t hold started to falling like rain down the painting.


Her tears washed away the red, as she picked the painting up and placed it back on the aisle. She picked up her bush and began fixing her creation.

I twitched my nose. This cavern smelled of pine and fungus, old earth. It suffocated me. 

He was still. 

No rise and fall of his chest, no swelling of the vest and cape. But I knew the poison life inside him. His eyes, all pupil, dark and hungry as a black hole, when they opened, they eclipsed any willpower.

So I'd waited. 

""Stealth,"" Esmerelda had whispered. My Esmerelda, the doughy, tough little woman with a flaring crown of scarlet hair. She'd seen me in her hovel, really seen ME.

""I know what it is you want,"" she had said. Somehow she had known. 

""He's helpless in the sunlight no matter where he is. He can't move.""

I stirred myself against his hand. I tensed. But nothing. More resolutely, I nudged his wrist. Still no response.

Esmerelda had held my face to hers. 

""You're a smart little stab of vengeance.""

Seven hours until sunlight. More than enough time for a toothsome bite or two ... or many more.

I sensed him. 

He knew. 

All the horror of that ancient night flooded my memory. My soul flung high into the atmosphere, cartwheeling away in panic, as he enveloped my body. My fine body. Not this new monstrosity I inhabited.

I don't have to breathe it in though, since my air shield got an upgrade to operate as a filter. Lucky me. No satellites to scan for a viable exit point. Not so lucky me. My holodisk can take weeks to find a viable exit point without a technology assist. With nothing to do until I find my exit I took a job at a garage to pass the time. Plus it pays for meals at restaurants. Eating at a restaurant is so much nicer than scavenging or stealing food.

Work had ended for the day and I was on my way to a restaurant. The Italian place around the corner came recommended by a couple of clients at the garage, but I hadn't considered who owned the place. Just as I came around the corner, two men exited the restaurant. Well dressed, definite European build. They were chatting loudly. I didn't think much of it until one said to the other,""I'm tellin' you, I could kill any m&gt;!otherfucke!&lt;r in this city and ain't nothin' the cops would do."" Their accents were definitely Italian; most likely they're part of the mob, I concluded.

""I'll prove it, Tony. I could get away with straight murder in this town."" As he spoke, the man pulled a pistol out of his suit coat. ""Watch."" In the blink of an eye, he trained his pistol to my forehead and pulled the trigger.

For a moment, time seemed frozen as the gunshot echoed off the nearby buildings. Well, I'm sure it felt that way to the mobsters at least. The two of them stared, frozen in disbelief, as the bullet hovered centimeters away from my forehead, undistorted, unmoving. Since I enjoy messing with those who deserve it, I stopped and let them believe the illusion. Then I reached up, plucked the bullet from its invisible cushion in the air shield, and eyed it (for dramatic effect, because why not). Glancing with my eyes only, my focus shifted from the bullet to the mobsters.

Acting as though nothing unusual had occurred, I resumed walking towards them. They remained frozen where they stood, confused and petrified in fear. Without even stopping to glance at them again, I plopped the bullet back into the hand of the mobster who pulled the trigger and cupped his hand around it. Hungry, I opened the door to the restaurant, sat down at an open table, and picked up the menu. A buzz emanated from by pocket, the holodisk informing me that my daily scan report was ready. I decided to read it later. The reactions from the mobsters would make for much better dinner entertainment. From a quick glance back out the window I could still see them there. Tony had regained his composure, but the shooter was still petrified. I chuckled as the waiter approached me.

""Good evening sir. What interests you on our menu tonight?""

""I think I'll have the meat lasagna.""

All of the four of that car’s doors opened simultaneously. They all four stepped out of the car. The passenger riding shotgun step forward and pointed at me. 

“That guy. Watch me smoke that piece of shit.”

He pulled a large handgun out from his coat and fired the entire magazine at me.

Luckily the only thing behind me was a small gift shop which had closed early for the holidays, and no employees were inside. Their merchandise was decimated, but they would at least recover. I wouldn’t.

Not that the bullets did any damage, mind.

They all struck me perfectly. I’m just a little more “unfilled” than I used to be.

He looks smug with that steriotypical Corvekkian shit-eating toothy grin on his face for a few moments, until it turns into an expression of shock when he realises that i am completely unharmed. Not a big surprise to me though, a gun like that isn't strong enough to harm my kind.

""Yeah you did. Unfortunately for you, my scaly friend, the weapon you used wasn't nearly strong enough to actualy harm me.""

Nathan was also a decorated US army ranger, a man with a concealed carry permit, and a pistol instructor at the local range when he needed extra cash to keep his antique restoration company afloat.  

Walking on the way to the post office with less than half an hour left until they closed he was considerably stressed about one of the packages he was going to mail, it was an antique pepper box revolver, it was the first gun he ever restored, and he was proud of the job he did.  He had received it in bad condition, his ability to get the rust off without damaging the finish was what made him a professional, for if most people tried to fix it, they would undoubtedly break the piece or drastically lower the value.  But since Nathan was a professional his work had come out sound, the rust was gun, the parts were cleaned, and the gun looked just like it had when it was made all those years ago.  This project had taken a lot of work, and getting an understanding of the laws regarding the piece, and how to make sure he never broke them made his head hurt.  Even so, after all of the time and effort he put into this piece, he would get a nice paycheck.  Nathan could see a small amount of debt that he owed disappear in his mind.  

When Nathan got a few blocks away from the post office he heard some men in an alley, Nathan didn’t care what about but he noted it was strange, he wondered if they were dodging work to drink, were homeless, or just strange people.  Being new to the city meant he couldn’t really tell them apart, Nathan did guess they weren’t homeless based on the clothes they wore though.  Nathan turned around the corner and finally got a glimpse of the post office.  In his peripheral vision he saw the men getting closer.  

Unnerved Nathan started walking faster, only to hear a shout behind him “This is our town, you want proof? I’ll show you how nothing happens after this.”

Nathan turned to see a Makarov pointed at him.  The last time he had seen a gun pointed at him was by someone he kicked out the range, the time before that was when he was taking fire from a village in the Middle East.  Instantly he tried to go for his gun, but his hands didn’t move, he wanted to, but he froze, som how finding himself unable to drop the boxes and grab the glock hidden in his holster.  Internally Nathan started to chastise himself for freezing up, but then the gunman had finally fired.  

The 9mm fired at Nathan missed low and to the left, instead it his a box with a certain pepper box revolver in in.  The round utterly destroyed the firing mechanism, leaving bits of wood, brass, and ornately decorated steel to blow out the other side of the box.  

Nathan was no longer frozen, now he was mad, and muscle memory kicked in, late but still welcome.  He dropped the boxes, drew his pistol, made sure there was nobody behind his target, aimed at Center mass and fired three times all in one fluid motion, while the gunman threw a second and third round in something that resembled the direction of Nathan.  

The gunman crumpled, two of the men beside him drew weapons.  It was a mistake Nathan taught his class last week, never draw a gun on some already aiming at you.  The two were unceremoniously dropped to the side walk by two bullets each.  The last man in the group, ran behind the building.  

Three minutes later the police arrived to handle the situation.  
Three months later Nathan delivered his testimony damning the crime lord to 25-life in prison.  
Three months after that the city hired Nathan to repair and refinish the various antiques that decorated the local school, and local government buildings.

""Hey there!"" he said, beaming at me as though I were an old buddy. ""Nice to see you. How're you doing?""

""Shut up and make me a pumpkin spice latte, venti, three extra shots of espresso.""

""Sure thing,"" he replied cheerfully, unfazed by my rudeness.

Behind me, the merry tinkle of the doorbell served as an incongruous accompaniment to the explosive entrance of a new customer.

""What the hell do you mean, you lost the account number?"" the man snarled into his phone. He gestured impatiently at the barista.

Something on the man's wrist caught my attention, and I sauntered over as the poor sucker on the other end of the line stammered out his excuses. 

""Not good enough, Jim, you've pulled this fucking stunt twice now...no, I think you've had plenty of warnings...oh, hi there!"" He'd caught sight of me, and the phone slipped from his ear as he bounded over like an overeager puppy. ""Great to see you, man!""

""Rolex?"" I asked him.

""What? Oh yeah, real deal too. Got it for two grand. Hey, wanna give it a try?""

This was too easy. I extended my arm and he snapped the watch around my wrist.

""Ooh, so pretty!"" cooed a woman in line, who had been muttering impatiently under her breath. ""Is it a present?""

""Y'know, that's a great idea!"" The man beamed at me. ""I was planning on wearing it myself, but I gotta say it suits you better."" A worried voice issued tinnily from the man's phone, now held absently by his side. *Mr. Barnes? You...you still there?*

""One venti pumpkin spice, extra espresso!"" sang the barista. He winked at me conspiratorially and gave me a friendly nudge as I took the drink. 

""I know you didn't ask for it, but I put some extra whip on there as well.""

I ignored him and found my attention drawn to the tv above the counter. Masked protestors were chucking Molotov cocktails at beefy policemen, who responded by beating everyone up with gusto. 

I sipped my drink and sighed. *Must* I go to the trouble of travelling to wherever this was, making my presence known and turning the protest into a disgusting friendship orgy? They'd only go right back to killing each other when I left.

"[WP] Shaken to your core, your trembling hands attempt to shred the note left for you by your predecessor in the resolute desk.",PoetProphet,"From the first time I mentioned running for President, damn near everyone told me “the job really ages you”. A glib phrase, with no real meaning other than that the tremendous responsibility as leader of the free world must take its toll on a person. Between the pressures, the stress, the dealing with one issue after another, everyone knew the job was exhausting.

I read through the note again. The warning that I shouldn’t tell anyone about this, the statement that I’d see proof at noon of my third day in office. The man must have snapped under the pressure. That was really the only explanation. I finished shredding the note, leaving the scraps on top of the desk. I might not have agreed with the old man’s politics, but he deserved enough for me to bury this crazy fantasy of his and never mention it again.

I glanced up at the clock on the mantle. 11:58. Two minutes left, and then I could laugh at the ridiculousness of this note. It was obviously the work of a mind about to snap. One could tell by how the handwriting went from elegant flowing letters to jagged lines and loops, almost unintelligible by the end. And yet, he’d always had a reputation as a solid straight shooter. And he hadn’t seemed like he was losing his grip the several times that we’d met between the election and swearing in.

I glanced up at the clock. A few seconds more to wait, and I could have a chuckle at this absurd story and go about my day.

A knock at the door caught my attention. “Come in,” I said, glancing up towards the doorway to my secretary. The *open* door. Motion from my left caught my attention as the door going to the presidential dining room and study opened.

Before I could say a word, a clean shaven young man in a sharp black suit stepped into the room, saying “Ah, my dear Mr. President. What a pleasure to meet you.”

“Who the hell are you, and what are you doing here,” I snapped. Obviously I was going to have to have a little conversation with my head of security.

The man crossed the room to the secretary’s door, and pulled the door closed.

“Let’s just say that I’m a middle-man. A go-between,” he replied.

“A go-between for whom?”

“Your bosses,” he replied.

I laughed at that. “I’m fairly certain that the American People don’t need a go-between!”

“Oh,” he started to say, pausing briefly, “no, not them. I mean your *real* bosses. The Company.”

“Son,” I began, “I don’t know what your game is, or how you got in here past security, but I don’t have time to play games.”

“Mr. President, I’m afraid you don’t understand,” he said as a hint of a smile played across his lips. “But, that’s alright. Neither did your predecessors at first. Did you read the note?”

For a moment, I froze. How did he know about the note? Was this some practical joke? A way for the staff to prank the new guy? “What note?”, I asked.

He cocked his head to the side, and gave me a quizzical look before continuing, “The one that you just ripped apart on your desk. Mr. President, you’re going to be a busy man, so I’m not going to waste your time.”

‘A little late for that,’ I thought.

“Please, allow me to explain.” Reaching into an inner coat pocket, he pulled out a single dollar bill.

“Oh, please,” I grumbled. This was getting beyond absurd. “Not that silly New World Order conspiracy nonsense.” My finger jabbed at the button to summon my secretary. This farce had gone on long enough. “I think it’s time you left, before I call the Secret Service agents in to escort you out.”

“No, Mr. President, not any nonsense. The Company has been here for a very long time, and the Company will be here long after we’re gone. And don’t worry about about the Secret Service. They already know I’m here, and won’t disturb us.”

Another knock, this time from the secretary’s door.

“Ah, that would be Jones, bringing your orders of the day,” said the young man.

“*My orders*?!?” I interrupted. This joke had clearly gone on for far too long.

“Yes. And you’re expected to follow them, “ he began, an in a louder voice, “come in Jones. Now where were we…. Ah, yes, let’s start with the stock market…”",uliet

He wiped the increasing sweat from his brow, incredulous at the valkyrie standing before him.

""Deeds? I haven't committed any deeds! I sat inside a cube farm for decades!""

She laughed, a hearty chortle that made him that much more uneasy.

""Yes, yes, they saw you toiling away in the labyrinth of slate. But the records do not lie. We show you having slayed a great many monsters in your time.""

""Monsters?!"" he choked out.

""Yes. Through the fog of time and dimension, we grew aware of the great insectoid demons that plagued your realm and you slayed them many and all.""

He fell silent for a minute, his brain racing.

""And even when you sought respite, you went toe to toe with the great green trolls who stalked the night.""

Like a light bulb flickering into illumination above him, the realization struck him hard.

""You saw this through our Oracle?""

""Yes, a vast, incomprehensible domain of knowledge and secrets is held by your Oracle.""

A faint grin started creeping across his face. He heard the sound of giggling and realized it was coming from his own lips.

""Mortal, what causes your mirth?""

""You have no idea what humans do for a living, do you? I was a software programmer. I killed bugs for a living, software bugs! And I dicked around on the internet for fun, messing with other people in chat rooms and subreddits. I worked for Oracle, for god's sake.""

She took up a quizzical look and then shook her head once more.

She’s clutching a sword, glaring but smirking at the same time. He doesn’t know why he’s here. Is this…Heaven?

“Are you…God?”
	
The woman bows, holding her hand out. “No, Thomas the Great, I’m simply a messenger. Your great deeds…well, they’ve reached Lord Odin, and he wants you to join us in Valhalla.”
	
He takes her hand, shaking it and cocking a brow. “What?”
	
She stands up straight, giving him a very serious look. “We…need your skills. We’re sorry we had to kill you, but this war is getting bad. We need all the help we can get.”
	
“I dunno what you’re talking about. I’m just a simple office worker. All I do is stare at a computer screen all day and doodle on post-it notes.”
	
She chuckles. “I know.” Then, she pulls out a stack of post-it notes covered in drawings, flipping through them. They’re mostly of stick figures battling. “But whether you meant it or not, you’ve been our greatest strategist. Somehow…you’re connected to the enemy. These notes…well, they entail their exact movements, formations and all.”
	
“That’s crazy.”
	
“Trust me, it is,” she says. “And Odin…he’s skeptical. Part of him wants to believe you’re working for the enemy, but another part of him’s so desperate he’s willing to take the risk.”
	
“I can’t help you. I just draw random stuff while goofing off.”
	
She reaches out, putting her hands against his shoulders. “And you still will,” she says. “It’s a latent talent, one you must’ve been born with. We were just worried.”
	
“About?”
	
“The enemy. If they captured you…” She makes a grim face, shaking her head in disgust. “Let’s just say you would be begging for death.”
	
Thomas still doesn’t fully understand what’s going on, but with a flick of her fingers, she creates a door. That’s enough for him to believe in her magic, and when she asks if he’ll help, he doesn’t know what else he can do but nod.
	
“I’ll try my best,” he says.
	
“Don’t be intimidated by Odin. He’s a scary bastard, but it’s just because times are so rough.”
	
With that, they walk through the door.

Well, a mathematician, maybe. Dying in a traffic accident wasn't that uncommon, after all. But all statistics aside, even if you calculated the risk of your death everyday, you could never comprehend it.

Even the most humble person only experiences life from his or her perspective. We accept the possibility that we aren't special. In fact, growing up is mostly coming to terms with it.

But no one of us really gets it, until it happens. Sure, heroically sacrificing yourself  to safe the planet probably wont happen. But at least dying peacefully in your sleep, surrounded by your family is what you expect, at least subconsiously. Those people they pull out of car wrecks? Statistics. NPCs. Background characters.

Until you get hit by a truck and your life just ends. Cuts off. No finale. Not even closing credits.

He was lucky in that regard, he supposed. Or maybe had bad luck? Many died without ever noticing their death. Not even some final thoughts. But not him. He would have sworn that the hit killed him instantly. His car was barely recognisable, after all. But it still took some time to die, apparently.

Speaking of which, it wasn't even that bad. No pain, just clarity and the certainty that he wouldn't get out of his car alive.

""The death are wise beyond their years.""

He looked up. Strange, he doubted he could move any single muscle, but here he was looking up into a beautifull face.

""Why would your soul be bound by your decaying body? You are much more than just your parts.""

""So I'm dead then?"" he answered. Astonished that he could speak at all. On the other hand, the ability to speak was the least extraordinary thing of this whole situation.

""Of course. No one could survive such a mighty blow. An ending fitting of a warrior such as you. Odin summons you to his great hall, Walhall, to tell the tale your mighty deeds.""

""Odin?! Walhall?!""

""Of course. Not that it wasn't close. Freya, the goddess of love wanted you just as much in her halls of Folkwang. She has half of all the mighty warriors in her hall, after all. But Odin, my master, is the chief of all the Æsir and he usually gets his will.""

""Oh god. Don't tell me, you are a valkyrie? Seriously? I suck up to my boss for years, join him for every stupid opera he ever visits and my death is written by fucking Wagner?""

""I don't know of the persons you speak of, but your name has been whispered in our halls for years now. Your deeds have even reached mighty Asgard. Whoever you might have been in Midgard, your deeds speak for themself. Even Loki praises you and mighty Þor uses as an example why he is so fond of humans.""

""Listen here, Lady, I am an accountant. Get some soldiers, if you want warriors. The last time I fought someone was in school. I don't say no to wenches and mead and an eternal feast, but I am no killer. I AM AN ACOUNTANT, FOR GOODNESS SAKE!""

""Yes. We heard of that mighty magic. People curse your name, mighty accountant of the tribe of Rheinmetal Defence Group. Your actions kill people all over the world. Your actions crush your enemies, see them driven before you, and you don't even listen to the lamentations of their women.""

Oh. That. Unexpected to say the least. Not that any employee of an defence contractor ever forgot who he was working for. Constant protests often reminded him of that. But he was just an accountant after all. If protestors beleagured their headquarters and screamed how godless and brutal they were, he often forgot they also meant him, the harmless clerk.

Except they got it wrong, apparently. He was not godless. He was doing god's work all along. Interesting. That offered some possibilites.

""So, the father of the god's requires an acountant? Well, I'm sure we can bring that host of fallen heroes up to modern standards in no time. In fact, I know some lawyers we need to bring on the team, too. Tell me, have you ever heard of automatic rifles? I might have just the thing for you...""

Death, he considered, might not be that bad, he thought, as he was lead to Walhall.

Pressing a finger to my temple, my mind latches onto his, and a wealth of information floods my brain. He’s in a dingy motel, sitting on the bed, hunched over and crying. The pain he’s feeling is so intense I drop into a chair, taking a deep breath.

*I wish I could just tell her.*

Tell me…what? This is bad. Closing my eyes, I try wrangling those nasty thoughts in. He isn’t cheating on me—he would *never* cheat on me, right? But…the necklace. And now…a secret? Deep breaths, gal. Deep breaths.

*She thinks I got the necklace from or for somebody else. I know, and I don’t blame her. How could I be so stupid? But it was a gift for a her, an attempt to see that pretty smile one last time before I delivered the news, before I made her cry so much. I chickened out, though.*

Sweat races down my cheek as I remove my finger for a second. The necklace…was for me? I don’t understand. None of this makes any goddamn sense! A week ago we were perfectly fine, perfectly happy. This scenario seemed impossible, and never would’ve crossed my mind…but here we are.

I press my finger to my temple again.

*Why me, though? I’ve been a good person, haven’t I? Why cancer, of all things? I don’t wanna die, dammit! I just wanna love her forever, wanna be with her forever—and now I can’t because I’m too damn scared to tell her. She’ll be so miserable…she’ll…*

In an instant, I’m out of my seat, phone against ear, pacing back and forth. My heart’s hurting because right now I feel like the worst person in the world. He has cancer. *Cancer.* He’s dying, and I kicked him out. No. No. No. By the time he picks up, I’m crying, which I hate because that’s what he was so scared of. Soon I’m rambling, telling him I know, and apologizing again and again. A second later I’m racing out the door, going to pick him up.

He’ll—*we’ll*—get through this. I know it.

You begin to discover whats different about level 1.",five4three2,"As the light hit my eyes I groaned. The last thing I could remember was the car. The headlights... then the pain. And nothing. There was a light ringing in my ears, and my eyes began to flicker open. My fingers twitched. Something hard, cold... underneath. Metal, I decide, a table like in a hospital... Did I survive? No. Not possible, the collision was far too fast for me to have lived... The afterlife? I gently reached up and pinched myself, pain, not the afterlife. 

Slowly my eyelids blinked open, squinting as my pupils adjusted to the lighting, harsh and white, fluorescent. A hospital? Slowly I sat up on the table and held my pounding head, looking around the room my blue eyes landed on four walls and a door. ""A cell."" I half muttered, half croaked to myself. It sounded like I hadn't used my voice in a hundred years. The thirst hit me and I examined my body for injuries quickly, wanting to get something to quench my thirst. 

Upon seeing my healthy state I question my own sanity and reality, but soon find myself shaking it off to venture further into this unknown place. I needed something to drink. My throat began to burn with the dryness, as I became more aware of the heat the ringing began to grow louder, I jumped to my feet and steadied myself on the table behind me. After the small room stopped spinning I tried the door and to my surprise it was unlocked. 

As I cracked the door I peeked out and was greeted by a people bustling in streets. I slowly stepped out of the room and closed the door, turning to look at it one last time I gasp in shock seeing its disappearance. As I begin to wander off I'm greeted by a girl shorter than me. 

""Age and name please?"" She asks writing on a clip board. I open my mouth to answer and frown when no sound comes out. ""Water?"" She looks up as though this was protocal for her and I nod vigorously. 

As soon as I see the bottle leave her pack I'm near salivating. My eyes follow it to my hands and I twist the cap off, gulping it down gratefully. As I finish off two thirds of the water in less than a minute I look back to see her smirking slightly which causes me to slow down. ""Where am I?"" I question, happy my voice was back. 

""Streamville. Name and age?"" She questioned once more. ""Lisa Young. 21"" came my response. 

""Well Lisa. You're dead on Earth."" my eyes widened and my thoughts began to race at this string of information.

 ""Welcome to Planet 1. People 30 and under get sent here after death, this is the easiest level..."" her voice saddened slightly and she looked at the ground before looking back up. ""Once you've reached 30 you'll move on once more. I can tell you no further information, other than, if you die now, you get sent back to Earth."" As if sensing my next thought she narrowed her eyes and spoke up again. 

""Not under pleasant circumstances. You won't remember this or your first life. You won't know your old family and you'll have to relive the life you're dealt."" She said and scribbled something else down. 

""Your house is in Sector 94 House D."" She said and disappeared leaving me to my thoughts once more. Just then headlights flashed and a horn blared....",bandnerd2823

&gt; “Got one.”

 &gt; “Locked on. Show no mercy.”

New reports force Karen back to the present. Missiles and mass cannons have taken a toll on both sides.

 &gt; “Enemy units are retreating. Objectives complete. Stand by for immediate return to Kharak.”

As the fleet regroups and docks with the Mothership, Karen can’t help but notice the enemy carrier slips away using the same Hyperspace technology they had found in the desert.

 &gt; “Analysis of the wreckage shows the hostile units are using strike craft ranging from Fighters to combat Corvettes. All pilots will be briefed in case hostiles have penetrated farther into the Kharak system. We will notify Kharak’s Missile Defense System of this possible threat.”

After re-docking the fleet, the Mothership once again disappears through the void, going home.

 &gt; “Standby for Hyperspace exit to Kharak.”

A black planet, writhing in orange and red greets the starship.

And...a massive scaffold, adrift in battle-charred pieces.

Dumbstruck silence fills the crew, then,

 &gt; “No one’s left...everything’s gone! Kharak is burning!”

Karen chokes to herself.

Fleet Intelligence’s straining voice cuts in,
 &gt; “Kharak is being consumed by a firestorm. The Scaffold is destroyed. All Orbital Facilities destroyed. Significant debris ring in low Kharak orbit. Receiving no communications from anywhere in the system… Not even beacons.”

 &gt; “Wait! On the maintenance frequency. I’m getting a signal from the Cryo Tray systems in orbit. One of them is suffering a massive malfunction.”

Sensors reveal several large warships near the Cryo Trays in question.
 &gt; “The Cryo Trays are under attack! Defend them.”

Pilots and ships scramble with darkened expressions.

A voice from Fleet Intelligence observes assertively,

 &gt; “These ships are different from those we encountered at the Khar-Selim. It is likely they were involved in the destruction of Kharak. Capture at least one vessel for interrogation and destroy the rest.”

Marines rush to their transports, clutching their gear fiercely and awaiting the moment they will board the enemy.

 &gt; “Group 1 engaging the enemy.”

 &gt; “Group 2 attack vector locked in, watch the debris.”

It seems clear that this isn’t the enemies’ main force but rather a cleanup crew, and the fierce assault seems to catch them off guard. Marines successfully board the first vessel and begin a bloody struggle to subjugate it, while the other enemy frigates are brutally suppressed and eliminated.

 &gt; “Hostile vessel captured. Crew interned. Interrogation is underway.”

 &gt; “While searching the enemy ship’s computer systems, we came across these flight recordings. Stand by for playback.”

A large fleet, Frigates, massive Cruisers, and countless fighters overrunning the Scaffold and orbital defenses fills Karen’s view and cluttered, but cold and calculating communications fill her ears.

 &gt; “We’re hit! What the?”

 &gt; “There’s another one.”

The largest  of the foreign vessels slip through the orbital defenses and array in front of the planet. Kharak's defenders are too overwhelmed by the rest of the fleet to interfere.

 &gt; “Prepare for immediate surface bombardment!”

 &gt; “Commence surface delivery.”

Missiles strike down at the planet Kharak, firestorms burning outward rapidly from the points of impact.

 &gt; “Orbital target acquired.”

 &gt; “Watch the spread pattern. Stay sharp.”

Within mere seconds, 40 percent of the planet is already consumed.

 &gt; “Target destroyed.”

The Scaffold suffers catastrophic damage in orbit.

 &gt; “All targets acquired.”

 &gt; “Multiple impacts confirmed.”

New blossoms spread over the planet.

 &gt; “Surface temperature fifteen twenty-three and climbing.”

 &gt; “Estimated immediate casualties: 98 percent.”

 &gt; “Surface temperature seventeen-forty-two and stable.”

 &gt; “Clearance granted.”

 &gt; “Primary directive achieved.”


The recording cuts away, and Karen sighs heavily, but Intelligence leaves little time to grieve.

 &gt;  “Analysis of the recording indicates that the Kharak missile defenses heavily damaged the attacking fleet. However, we have concluded that at present, they can still easily defeat us. We have therefore plotted a course to a deep space asteroid belt. There we can hide and prepare ourselves for an assault.”

 &gt; “Enemy units neutralized. Begin salvaging the Cryo Trays.”

 &gt; “Those trays contain all that is left of our people. Without them, we will become extinct.”

Ships dock for repairs and other remain vigilant on guard as teams scramble to secure the colonists in cryogenic hibernation.

 &gt; “Cryo Tray loaded. One hundred thousand people secured.”

 &gt; “Cryo Tray loaded. Two hundred thousand people secured.”

In the end, six trays were able to salvaged. Six hundred thousand civilians survived the destruction of their world.

 &gt; “Cryogenic trays have been loaded and processed and our colonists are safe for now. We are all that’s left of our world. Our culture. Our people.”

 &gt; “From the interrogation, we learned that a frontier fleet patrolling the borders of a vast interstellar empire was dispatched to destroy our planet. The captain claimed our people violated a 4000-year-old treaty forbidding us to develop hyperspace technology. Extermination of our planet was the consequence.

 &gt; Subject did not survive interrogation.”

 &gt; “Hyperspace module charged. There’s nothing left for us here. Let’s go.”

And once more the Mothership is consumed by space.

An expedition was sent.*

*An ancient starship, buried in the sand.*

*Deep inside the ruin was a single stone that would change the course of our history, forever. On the stone was etched a galactic map, and a single word more ancient than the clans themselves:*

*Hiigara.*
*“Our home”*

*The clans were united, and a massive colony ship was designed. Construction would take 60 years. It would demand new technologies, new industries, and new sacrifices. The greatest of these was made by the scientist Karen Sjet; who had herself permanently integrated into the colony ship as its living core.*

*She is now Fleet Command.*

*The promise of the Guidestone united the entire population. Every mind became focused on the true origin of our people, every effort on the construction of the ship that would seek it out among the stars.*


In orbit above a ruddy, brown planet, a massive construction scaffold clasps an even more titanic starship. Orbital defense systems and cryogenic trays of civilian colonists who will sleep through the pilgrimage provide an impressive backdrop.

 &gt; “All stations green. You got it.”

 &gt; “Bays 8, 9, and 10 sealed.”

 &gt; “Scaffold decks A, B, C, secured.”

 &gt; “All systems green. What a beautiful sight.”

The Scaffold Control team monitoring the ship beams with pride.

 &gt; “This is Fleet Command. Reporting Mothership pre-launch status.

 &gt; Command, online...

 &gt; Resourcing, online...

 &gt; Construction, online.

 &gt; Cryogenic subsections A through J, online…K through S, online.

 &gt; Scaffold Control, stand by for alignment.”

Engines begin firing up along the mothership, preparing for a burn that will pull it apart from the scaffold.

 &gt; “Alignment confirmed. Stand by, Release Control.”

Slowly, the incredible mass pulls away.

 &gt; “The Mothership has cleared the Scaffold. We are away.""

 One can sense the calm assuredness in Karen’s voice.

The most important of the rigorous tests the ship must perform before commencing its pilgrimage is a hyperspace jump. Among the technologies scavenged from the derelict starship was its hyperspace module, integral to the design of the colony ship, and its primary hope for traversing the galaxy.

 &gt; “All hyperspace systems operating at full power.”

Karen reports as though it were an extension of herself.

From Fleet Intelligence, a steady voice relays the mission agenda:
 &gt; “If the Hyperspace targeting system is accurate, we will emerge in close proximity to the Support Vessel Khar-Selim. This ship has spent the last 10 years traveling on conventional drives to reach the Outer Kharak system. The Khar-Selim will monitor the quantum waveform as we return to normal space, and assist in tuning our drive control systems. If the Hyperspace module malfunctions, the Khar-Selim will provide assistance and resupply.”

Taking a deep breath, he makes a final report:
 &gt; “Stand by for Hyperdrive test. Internal pressure doors will be sealed in 2 minutes. Abort systems standing by.”


 &gt; “Hyperspace module fully charged. I am ready to initiate quantum wave generation on your mark.

 &gt; Good luck, everyone.”

Karen’s clear voice wishes the crew.

Space consumes the starship.

And space deposits the starship.

 &gt; “We made it…
Hyperspace jump complete!
All systems nominal, and the quantum wave effect has dissipated.”

She quickly assesses the internal systems, the jump was a success!

 &gt; “We have misjumped.”

Fleet Intelligence cuts in with an immediate report.

 &gt; “The support ship is not here. Fleet Command will signal the Khar-Selim while we confirm our position.”

Taking the cue from Intel, Karen immediately reaches out on normal frequencies:

 &gt; “This is the Mothership calling Support Vessel Khar-Selim. Come in, please. We have mis-jumped and are requesting your beacon...This is the Mothership calling Support Vessel Khar-Selim. Please respond.”


But the only response is from Fleet Intelligence.
 &gt; “Priority Alert. We have picked up the Khar-Selim’s *Automated* beacon.”

Upon sending a probe to investigate and re-establish communications, Intelligence verifies a small fleet scavenging a ruptured, incapacitated Khar-Selim. This action does not go unnoticed. Missiles are unleashed from the small crafts.

 &gt; “They’re... attacking?

 &gt; “The Mothership is under attack!!”

 &gt; “Engage incoming units, the Mothership must be defended!”

Karen swiftly commands the Motherships small garrison of Fighter and Corvette class starships to undock and engage the attackers. Simultaneously, she orders resources to be directed toward construction of new combat capable vessels. The Khar-Selim was not a defenseless vessel, afterall.

 &gt; “Group 1 reporting. Stay calm. Attack vector laid in.”

The unfazed captains and pilots receive the small enemy fleet and it is quickly revealed that the enemy do not hold a significant advantage in combat power.

 &gt; “Group 1 reports victory. Threat eliminated.”

The scuffle is fierce and deadly, but incredibly brief. The debris of small ships drifting apart are the only evidence of the engagement.

 &gt; “Mothership sustained minor hull damage, repairs are underway.”

Karen’s voice is unshaken, this is, in fact, a very minor concern comparatively.

 &gt; “The Khar-Selim has been destroyed. Heavy weapon damage is visible on the remaining fragment. We must retrieve the mission data recorder.”

A small team of marines and an escort are scrambled for boarding the remnant of the Khar-Selim and retrieving the data. If only things went so smoothly.

 &gt; “It’s an enemy carrier.”

A large vessel is detected near the escort team, friend and foe decisively engage each other. The carrier dispersing an unsettling number of fighters as the Mothership's impressive production capabilities scramble to enable new fighter flights to enter the fray.


Amidst the battle reports Fleet Intelligence conveys a message
 &gt; “Salvage team docked safely. Downloading Mission Data Recording. Replaying last entry:”

Karen’s expression darkens as her ears are filled with voices.

 &gt; “What do you mean you detect a hyperspace entry? The Mothership isn’t due for…”

 &gt; “-Sir! I have multiple contacts on closing vectors. Unknown profiles… No recognition codes… Uhhh… *They’re not ours.*”

 &gt; “Well if they’re not ours, who the hell are they?”

 &gt; “Sir! They’re coming in fast! Check… Incoming fire! We are under attack!”

 &gt; “They’re getting through! Breaches across all decks! Hull integrity failing!”

 &gt; “...Khar-Selim to Mothership. If you are receiving, abort Hyperdrive test. Repeat, abort Hyperdrive test!”

However the fact that it didn't made it all the more believable. When we had found the star mappings down in the main chamber we had guessed it was a representation of the sky back then. 


If only that were the case... 


No it wasn't some 3500 year old representation of our sky, the simulations just didn't line up. Damn good simulations too, ones that took years to compile. We had started to believe it was nonsense, the rest of the scientific community was less kind in their wording.  


That is until the Argonaut started sending back information. The probes mission was simple in layman's sense, much harder practically. Mapping out the Galaxy seemed a sufficiently endearing task to humanity. The most complex ai systems in the world were compiling the scannings into the largest roadmap we'd ever known. Trillions of gigabytes of data mostly to map out the sheer expanse of nothingness. 


Well the AI started to notice something, old simulation data left in the system happened to match up with the map. 


Yep, those simulations.


“There's no way we missed that, we really every outlook from their location. That's impossible. Looks like billions of government dollars to waste on faulty machinery, surprise surprise!” My supervisor proclaimed.


Nope, the readings were correct, deadly accurate in fact. That was the most terrifying part. The star chart wasn't from this planet, let alone this solar system. Tau Ceti, 12 light-years away from Earth in fact, give or take a few miles.  Couldn't possibly get any worse.


Well it did.  When this whole project was schemed up the public was, rightfully so, a little skeptical. Why invest this kind of money into a useless project such as mapping out nothingness and a few stars. One of the catches for raising support was that all data was made public. Instantly. Everything. 


Mass pandemonium.

On his planet.
	
I hurry through the gates of the graveyard, making my way to the furthest corner, where his grave sits. Instead of a headstone, he has a large statue of him speaking with a human. He was a writer, and wrote a classic novel about our friendship—but nobody knows it’s true. Nobody except me.
	
Kneeling in front of his grave, I open the book, flipping through the pages. Us eating hotdogs, swimming in the pool. We’re running through forests and he’s playing videogames for the first time. For a few minutes, I’m back there, in a childhood which feels so far away.

Unfortunately for him, it was currently day, so instead of doing cool hero stuff he was stuck in class.

He'd just gotten out of lunch, so next period was... Chemistry. His least favorite subject. He'd heard from some other students that they had a substitute today, so hopefully they'd just get to watch a video or something instead of doing exercises from the textbook like Mrs. Draynor always did.

As he entered the lab, the smell was the most apparent thing. Chemicals, some more noxious than others, filled the air. They hadn't dealt with actual chemicals in the past three months he'd had this class. Ray took his seat near the back of the class next to Janette, his lab partner. She seemed strangely excited. Not that she wasn't studious, but she konked out halfway through most of Mrs. Draynor's lectures.

""Hey, did you hear anything about the substitute?"" Ray asked.

Before she could answer, the door to the room swung open and a familiar face walked in, quickly writing his name on the board.

""Hello everyone, Dr. Nefarious here. Nefarious is my legal name, in case you were wondering, no relation to the villain who tried to destroy town square last week,"" the man said.

Ray knew he was lying... about the no relation part at least, Nefarious might have been his real name for all he knew. He wasn't actually a doctor either, but calling him out on that would be like holding up a neon sign that said ""Laser Lad"" over his head. Ray needed to get in contact with Luminescent man as soon as possible... If he could find a good excuse to leave for long enough to give him a call.

""Now, your teacher called in sick with the flu, and left an assignment for you all. Pages something or other to who cares, but that sounds boring and I didn't come all the way down here just to sit around while you lot stare at books. Instead, I tracked down some chemicals and we're going to do a few experiments...""

Dr. Nefarious threw open the cabinet at the front of the room revealing various bottles of cleaning solutions and household chemicals. He pulled a few out, setting them on the front table alongside a stack of plastic cups.

""Oh, right, uh... Students on the left, grab the goggles and trays of beakers. Everyone else, come up here and pour some of these liquids into separate cups,"" he said, practically throwing a box of baking soda onto the table. ""And in case you forgot, no eating or drinking in here!""

As he said it, he planted his hand on one of the front desks. The guy sitting there had a bottle of gatorade that he slipped back into his bag. Everyone started moving to collect their things. Naturally, Ray was the one who had to... wait a minute.

""Uh, are we going by your left or ours?"" Ray asked.

""Your left, the ones sitting closer to the trays are supposed to get them,"" Dr. Nefarious said.

Some of the other students had been halfway to their destination before switching where they were walking. Ray was a little annoyed that he had to go all the way to the front of the room to get the chemicals, but at least it seemed this wasn't going to be too boring...

---
Ray and the class were standing in the hallway, having just evacuated the lab. Ray himself was watching from the window in the door as Dr. Nefarious poured a hastily-made chemical concoction into Ray's beaker to neutralize the offending combination. About a minute later he stepped outside.

""Okay, well that could've gone better. I warned you not to add too much bleach,"" Dr. Nefarious said.

""I only used a cup,"" Ray said, cutting off Janette before she could offer a less flippant explanation.

""You were supposed to measure ten milliliters!"" Nefarious said.

Ray's response was interrupted by the class bell. Luckily since it was last period, that meant he could finally get out of here.

""Well, looks like that's it for the day, it should be safe to get your things,"" Nefarious said, turning to the class. ""Oh, and your teacher called in sick for the whole week, so if I don't get fired I'll see you all tomorrow.""

While Ray didn't like the idea of hanging out with the arch rival of his boss/mentor, he had to admit that this had been the most fun chemistry class he'd taken part in. Maybe he'd hold off on telling Luminescent man, at least for another day or two.",AslandusTheLaster
"[WP] It’s been like this for ten years. The fields are barren and famine ravages the land. Hearing about a mythical refuge in the mountains, you gather a band of men to find that refuge.",tehsaltyone,"It's been ten years. Nothing fazes me anymore. I'm hungry, always hungry, but I've managed to survive. Figuring out what could be eaten and what was safe was a long, painful process. Yet I made it. Not many have. This famine of apocalyptic proportions has killed so many it's breath-taking. However when I heard an inkling of a sanctuary in the mountains that has food I was in disbelief. I wanted it to be real but I didn't want to get my hopes up. It would be dangerous to have hope. It would also be dangerous to go alone. So I headed to the nearest encampment where I knew I could find a few people. It was a long shot but I guess I felt I had to try. 

When I arrived at the camp, more like a small town but since the famine it just seems to deserted to call it a town, I saw a few people milling around. I knew Bard from the few times I'd been to the camp so when I stumbled upon him first it only seemed fitting to enlist him first. He too was in disbelief but was willing to make the trek if we got a few more good men to come with us. Before the famine Bard had been a construction worker so he was quite handy, which was useful. I already had my pack ready to go so we stopped by his place and he collected what he needed and we set off to find a few more people. 

Bard knew of a survivalist who lived alone near the edge of camp. We figured it would be helpful to have someone who knew more than us so we headed over. Turns out the guy Bard knew was named Guy. And let me tell you, this was a guys guy named Guy. He wasn't burly in the brawny towel type of man, but he looked grizzled and hardened against the famine. We told him what we knew, and to my surprise he had already heard about this place too. He definitely wanted to join out band of hunger. So once Guy was packed, and we had a path laid out, we started heading north. 

As we walked towards the mountains Bard noticed smoke from a trail slightly west of where we were. Deciding to look into the smoke turned out to be a really great idea. At the site of the smoke we found a fire but no one seemed to be there. We looked around and saw a small tent and a pack. Suddenly from behind us we heard a jovial laugh of someone who hadn't seen people in a while. Looking behind us we saw this young man who couldn't have been more than 25. He was holding a dead rabbit and laughing. ""Good thing I caught a big one,"" he stated. Turns out he had been hunting and this was his camp. His name was Bruce and he offered us some of his rabbit. We sat and ate, as we ate we told him of our plan and he wanted to join. How could you say no to the guy who feeds you. 

So the next morning the four of us set off in search of what would hopefully be the refuge we needed. ",hhrlisa
[OT] Preptober - No More Excuses,AliciaWrites,"Here is my biggest tip for winning Nanowrimo, **write some junk first**.

Normally when I sit down to write, I'll read over the last several paragraphs, and then try to continue the story, but my head just isn't in the right place, so I sit there typing lame sentences and then clicking over to browse reddit instead.

In order to get into the correct mindset to write, I go to writing prompts and pick a prompt and write a short story for it. Since the story is short, the prompt is provided, and it doesn't matter if it's good or not, I find that I can actually write the prompt, and by the end of the story, my brain has switched from ""Uhhhhhh"" mode to creative mode, and then I can go back to my story and start writing some actual stuff.

If you don't want to waste your time writing for something other than your novel, then start by doing a world building piece. Pick a character, or place, and write a memory/historical event for them. For example, write about your main characters first kiss (if they've already had them) or about a nightmare that a side character had. This helps you to build up a character so you can write them as a three dimensional person, and since no one but you will read it, it doesn't matter if it starts off crap.",iruleatants

Write. Whenever you can, put in a few words here or there. On the days you have time, go full on into it. Don't think of it as a deadline you have to reach. Think of it as a guideline of of words for an average length novel. You don't have to get to 50,000. You don't have to stop at 50,000. 

You just have to write.

I'm hoping to finish a serial I began about vampires. It's currently the only serial running on my subreddit (/r/EvenAsIWrite) but I'm hoping to tie off the first in 3 by the end of November. The idea itself is based of a [WP] about the existence of three categories of Vampires: Ferals, Stalkers and Mirrors and how a researcher discovers a fourth category; The Alpha.

It was pretty interesting so I've turned it into a thing of sorts. You can catch up to the 11 parts so far. I'm hoping to post a 12th part before taking it the rest offline till after NaNo. That last sentence is still a thought but we'll see :)

Traditionally, NaNo is done with a completely original work from scratch (outlines not withstanding), but it's not a really strict rule. I'm going to be writing a novel based on an outline I've had sitting for a year. 

As for someone in your position, I would say think up one really good scene--maybe someone (or two or three someones) finding a body. Then ask yourself, what happened before they found the body?

[TT] Theme Thursday - Witchcraft,AliciaWrites,"The witch came at night. Her broomstick cut through the solemn sky, speeding past lifeless trees and desiccate soil. A wry simper stretched across her face, for she knew it was that time of the year again, and the peaceful villages would soon become her playing field. 

Lights from afar bespoke civilization. How enticing! Just as she was about to look away from the forest she caught something from the corner of her eye. A black dot, almost invisible in the black backdrop.

She descended and saw man standing beside a tree, cold and alone. A stool stood below the immaculate bough, where a noose was tethered to it. 

""Don't!"" 

The man turned to see a woman standing right behind him.

""Go away,"" he uttered.

The witch's mind raced with all sorts of ideas. 

""Sir, I can do whatever you want if you could just step back and keep your hands off that rope."" 

The man frowned. ""I don't trust you, not in this ugly ass costume.""

""You don't have to,"" said the witch calmly. ""Tell me what you want, and you'll see for yourself.""

""My life is jackshit!"" he started, sobbing as he spoke. ""My mother called me a retard. My friend stole my money. My dog died of cancer...""

Without hesitation the witch drew out a wand and did a flicker. Sparks of pink and purple scattered from its tip.

""Your mother loves you now. Your money is returned. You dog is barking happy.""

""It's no use,"" the man cried, burying his head in his hands. ""I still feel crap! There's no hope in this world... Nothing!""

The witch cogitated. Surely there's no such thing as a happiness potion, so she'd have to resort to something similar.

She rummaged in her pocket and pulled out a dainty bottle filled with a lumimous green liquid.

""Drink this,"" she said. ""A token of happiness.""

The man grabbed the potion and chugged it down. A blinding flash, then all that remained was a tiny frog.

The frog bounced around, feeling his legs. After a while he spoke.

""I feel wet and fresh, and my eyes are funny. I'm still sad, for I have no company.""

""I literally gave you the most carefree life any human being could possibly dream of!"" The witch shouted in frustration.

Tears drippled down the frog's eyes. It wasn't anatomically plausible, but the witch's power is strong.

There's nothing...not even witchcraft can save this man.

She sighed, taking a step forward, lunged in and kissed the frog.

The frog's eyes lit up. He was instilled with so much love and mirth that it overloaded his delicate heart.

The witch gawked at the lifeless body. She had delivered death through her lips. The evil's touch! A new spell was born.

She should have been proud, but she wasn't. Her heart palpitated with contrite, bugging her incessently.

He was in a better place...

The good witch nodded to herself, and disappeared into the dazzling city lights.",volcanolam

""Wait... How did the movie begin?"" I looked at him and stopped laughing.

""The couple went to the cinema, they were laughing at the end of the film, and they were followed home."" I looked at him eyebrow raised and he laughed.

""Not getting you this time I guess.""

  As we drove home the movie lingered in my mind. The couple died pretty early on in the movie. I don't think we even found out their names. The narrative was more about the culprit, a crazed filmmaker who believed his movie told the future, and he was forced to fulfill it. Bit bloody for my taste, but a good watch.

  We tiredly settled in at home. Our kids were at my parents' house for Halloween, gave us a nice break.

  I decided to turn in early, and as he was excited to deal with any trick or treaters he stayed up. I dropped him a sweet kiss and then slept deep right until about 3am.

  The first thing I noticed was that he hadn't come to bed. I was cold. It was too quiet.

  ""Babe?"" I called out into the darkness. ""Please don't jump out on me, that movie creeped me out.""

  I unwrapped myself from the quilts and slipped out of bed. I was awake now, there was definitely something wrong. I couldn't help running the events of the movie through my mind. They go home, they share a goodnight kiss and the woman goes to bed. The filmmaker knocks on the door and the husband answers, expecting trick or treaters, but before he can question why a man is stood silently crying before him the man stabs deep into his neck. The sound of his scream stolen by the gleaming metal. The murderer dragged the body back inside and sobbed, serving treats to the children knocking, and gagging every time he shut the door at the sight of his own handiwork.

  The wife makes her way downstairs after waking to silence. She calls out to her lover.
  She hears a sob as she steps through the doorway and pauses. 

  ""I didn't think it was real."", She whispers. One look at the agony tearing across the face of the murderer of her husband sends her running to the exit.

  ""I'm so sorry.""

It was silly, really, a joke by the director no doubt.  Though, for my own sake I decided to investigate how much was fiction and how much was fact.

At home, while nursing a stomach ache from too much popcorn and soda, I googled ""Ighara Incident"" and was met, not with a wiki or IMDB page as I expected.  Not even one of those ugly webpages that looked to be from the 90s.  I did find some forums discussing the movie, fairly recent ones too.  I clicked on the first one that looked promising, ""Any information on the real Ighara Incident.""  I guess this user had trouble finding information too. Among speculations about the meaning of Ighara I found no credible information.  A few wiki pages detailed odd stories similar to the Ighara Incident but nothing similar to satisfy.  The consciousness seemed to be, for the time being at least, that the last sentence was simply a joke.

I clicked away and found another discussion about the movie.  This user, normally unphased by even the best of horror films, found himself uneasy after his viewing.  Explaining how it gave him a headache and a reduced appetite.  While some user collaborated his experience, even adding their own details.  Some users had the expected nightmares, though these were unusually detailed and some complained that they could *feel* things inside their dreams, some saw little white spots in their vision while others constantly smelled a faint but terrible odor that they never seemed to go nose blind to.  Easy enough to ignore but seemingly ever present.   And yet others felt an itching under their skin, like the affects of meth, though the users claimed never to have taken it.  One user claimed to have heard voices.  And yet, other users had nothing happen, they felt fine; no bad dreams or voices or little white spots.  Confirmation bias, it seemed.  I was in the latter group and had nothing out of the ordinary happen.  I was rather disappointed, actually.  I could use a good story to tell.

I browsed further into more obscure forums and subs as I gathered various tib-bits of information.  For instance, the film had a very limited release, hence why information about it seemed so scares.  Though, even for pre-release such scarcity of information was uncommon.  Movies could be spoiled by enterprising pirates weeks before a movie's official release, though not this film.  In fact, no information prior to my own viewing seemed to exists.  A remarkable feat of secrecy on the directors part.  A little too well, it seemed.  

My eyes lids found themselves gaining weight as the night dragged on until I eventually relented and pulled myself away from the computer and flopped down onto me bed.  I couldn't even muster the energy to change clothes and fell asleep face first.

I opened my eyes to a room that was not my own.  I stood up from a hideous spring bred and examined my surroundings. I was in a room comprised mostly of wood, the ceiling was slanted upwards.  On the far end was a closed door.  Near the door, an open book sitting on a desk with a chair pulled under.  To the left, where the ceiling was closest to the floor, was a window.  I approached it and gazed out.  Before my eyes sprawled an endless and featureless void.  The ground at the base of the house ,extending to what seemed like infinity, was a drab emotionless gray.  The sky and the ground didn't seem to meet.  Instead their boundaries and the distances beyond the house were obscured by a dense fog the same color as the ground.  It looked like someone had painted the windows gray, but the area beyond my window so obviously had depth.  I turned towards the door when I heard a voice like the rustlings or scraping of dried leaves.  My hands shot to cover my ears but it did nothing.  The voice spoke not anywhere outside my own mind.  It was like trying to plug your ears in the hopes of not thinking.  The voice *hurt* to listen to.  Like the pain from a shrill whistle but the voice didn't have the pitch to match.  I couldn't understand it, even the inflection was lost on me.  It was obviously a language, that much I was certain.  I could feel meaning behind it.  It felt hateful.  The pain in my ears grew until I woke with a start in my own bed.  Cold sweats and drool soaked my sheets.  My breathing slowed as my familiar surroundings filled my eyes and ears.  

I stood and stepped quietly down the steps to fetch some water.  My night-time drooling left me parched.  As my feet fell softly on the staircase I heard from outside the rustling of leaves.  My heart about skipped a beat until I remember that it was fall and such noises where to be expected.  As the cool water filed my cup, the sound of rustling leaves grew a little louder.  The very inner parts of my ears started to hurt.

Hannah turned to you and you both nodded. It had become a custom for you to stay and watch a movie until the very last credit had rolled. 

Scanning the area quickly it was apparent that about 5 or 6 other people were doing the same. Maybe they were hoping for an easter egg, some kind of hidden message or bonus material. For you it meant more than that.

&gt;*The first date had been wonderful, no matter how many times you had replayed it in your head you couldn't for the life of you remember the movie though, and...well, none of that mattered. It had been during the closing credits that you had first kissed her. It had taken all your courage to place your hand around her shoulder at the romantic climax of the film, and that kiss, well that was the accumulation of years of daydreams and hurried glances across the classroom*.

She was thinking about it too.

""Hey d-""

""Yes"", she smiled. ""Of course I remember""

""You know, it's funny"", she continued with a grin from ear to ear, ""This place hasn't changed a bit has it"".

She was right, the lighting had changed a little, you could make out the emergency exits these days, but otherwise the place hadn't changed at all. 

Ten minutes had passed since the movie ended. You glanced around to check who was still there. Nobody had moved from their seats.

&gt;*It hadn't taken long for you to fall in love. It had been on a school outing to this very cinema. It was Ms. McCullen's class, you remembered it well. Hannah was talking to Michelle, ahead of you in Row 3 when they peeked back and stifled laughter. You hadn't known if the joke was at your expense but you expected it was. You smiled at them anyway. As Michelle turned back to the screen her eyes had lingered a little longer and she had smiled. That smile.*


'Everything good that's happened to me has been at this very cinema', you thought to yourself.

You turned back to her. ""I guess we should relive old memories, eh"". You gave her a cheeky smile as you leaned in.

""Young memories"" she replied, a little bit colder now.

""Huh?"". The look in her eyes made you doubt yourself. ""What do you mean youn-""

She put her hand on your mouth. You couldn't breathe. Your eyes darted around the room.

""Look"", she said. 

The faces in the room, they were older but...familiar.

You tried to speak but all that came out were muffled sounds.

'That's Simon, and Tommy. There's Patrick at the back with Mark. Oh and Elaine' you thought to yourself. You tried to pull her hand away but it wouldn't budge. It was as though her hand had been glued to your mouth.

You wanted to move, say hello. It had been so long, it had been years and years. How many years? How many years.

A sudden calm took over your body as she took her other hand and placed her index and thumb over your nose and pinched hard.

*""Hi, don't struggle""*, she said the words so matter-of-factly. 

But her lips didn't move, she was speaking with her mind.

""What.What the fuck is happening Hannah"", you replied in the same way. 

Tears were rolling down your face as you thought those words. Why was this happening, how was this happening.

'Is this a dream', you thought.

*""Do you remember anything?""*

*""Yes, you and me, we had our first kiss he-*

You remembered it so well it was right there at the back of...

You looked back to see Ms. McCullen sitting at the back of the cinema. Eyes wide, unblinking. She looked much older than the last time you had seen her.

*""Did you like film?""* Hannah asked, hands still covering your face.

The film. Yes, what was it? A romance...no. It was a Horror film, it was great but you couldn't for the life of you remember why.

You looked at Hannah again. You had no tears left to cry, all that was left was the stinging and smell of popcorn and sweat.

Hannah's eyes looked darker now.

You felt tired now. Too tired to fight, too tired to think. You passed out.
___________________________________________________________

""I remember now"", you blurted out as you woke. ""I'm dead"".

""You'll forget soon enough, you always do"" Hannah replied. ""I think it's affected your memory""

""What has? Am I...I'm dead?""

""Yes"", she replied.

You started trembling.

""..and you, are you dead? Are you real?""

""If I'm real to you does it matter? Do you really want to know?""

You paused. ""Well I-""

Wait...

    confirmed that a leak had allowed Carbon Monoxide to enter the 
    cinema.

    Reports from the hospital have confirmed that students and one 
    teacher have arrived dead on arrival while others are recieving 
    care at the UNH.

""Sssshhhhhh"" you heard a voice say from the back. ""The movie is about to start, we haven't seen this one!""

Ms. McCullen laughed, Simon laughed, Tommy and Elaine held their sides while Mark weeped as he held back stifled laughter. Hannah smiled that beautiful smile as the credits started. You watched, horrified at the screen. The projector flickered as you watched your classmates filing into a cinema and you spotted the broken pipe in the top left of the screen as the words 'Based On a True Story' appeared.

""Here we go again"".

The movie did a really good job conveying those emotions to the audience. I would definitely rate it 5/5 stars for it did such a great job, exactly what I would expect from a good horror movie. I opened a movie review site on my mobile phone. I hit the 5 star button in the screen with my slightly sweaty thumb. I'll do a more thorough review back at home. I tuck my phone back in my pocket. 

The credits aren't very long apparently, but that is to be expected from a small indie movie. The words ""based on true story"" appear in white letters to black screen. A wave of chill coarses through my spine with the appearance of those words. I must say, I am quite keen reading about the sources of the movies I see. Perhaps I should do some research about this ""true event"" that happened.

The movie theater is still dark as I am getting up from my comfy red seat. The light operator must be having difficulties but I can still see the glowing green emergency exit sign. Thankfully there aren't many people in this showing. I head towards the sign, past the garbage bins with countless empty popcorn boxes and soda cups until I arrive to the open doorway to the illuminated main lobby of the theater.

Suddenly, I get a phone call. I am not expecting any, especially this late to the evening. It is strange, but I am compelled to answer. Perhaps a wrong number? I grab the phone from my pocket and hit the answer button.

""Mike on the phone, who is this?""

A voice of a man answers

""You need to wake up""

""What?!"" is all I can manage to retort in my perplexion

""What you see around you is not what it looks. You're in a dream. And you're very deep in it already... Danger. You must wake up..."" the man audiaubly gasps for air towards the end of the sentence. 

""Look, I don't know who you are, but I am going to end this prank call...""

""Just meet me in the city library and..."" was what I heard before I cut the call. A prankster caller, he must have been on drugs or something. I must admit, this call and what he said, right after the movie too, has left me deeply unsettled. I tuck my phone back in the pocket. 

I start to head towards the stairway to downstairs, towards exit. On my way out, I swear I can see people... Staring at me. With disdain, disgust, even hate. Their gazes pierce right through me, weighing me down, but I try to shrug them off as I hasten my steps until I get through the slide doors to the main street outdoors. What the fuck was that? Anyway, I got a movie to review. I head towards my car, parked by the street nearby. 

I open the door of my car, plug in the key and start driving towards my home. The journey is long but familiar with some evening traffic mixed in. The streets are well illuminated as I navigate through the city streets. The recent past events still disturb me, the prank call, the stares, the credits of the movie... But I shrug them off and focus on driving. 

Eventually, I arrive to the street with the library by it. This is the place where the man is supposed to be. There isn't any traffic here. I get an urge to hit the gas pedal and get out as soon as the traffic light turns to green. Just as the light turns green and I am about to slam the pedal, my car shuts down. 

""Oh come on, not now!"" as I try to restart the car but all I get in response are mechanical coughs of the vehicle. At least there isn't traffic... 

My phone rings again. This is creepy now! Yet again, I feel compelled to answer. I slowly dig the phone from my pocket and slowly slide my finger over the answer button and put the phone by my ear. 

""Mike on the phone, who is this"" Is what I say as my regular greeting, although this time I can detect an unhealthy dose of fear in my own tone of voice.

""You need to wake up"" It's that same man! 

""What have you done?! Who are you and what do you want?! I audibly demand 

""It was not me. It is the dream, the illusion you're experiencing that stopped you"" the man explained, this time more calmly and without a gasp in his voice

""That's crazy! Are you watching me? How do you know all this?"" I demand yet again as mild sense of panic starts to settle within me. 

""Calm down. I can tell you everything I know, I just need you to listen to me"" 

""I just want to get out of here of here!"" 

""That's what I wish too, but you are trapped. I can help you get out. Come to the library main entrance door. I will meet you there. And please, do not cut the call this time. I need you to listen to me""

This is nonsense! In frustration I attempt to twist the key in the car lock yet again but to no avail. 

I open the door and exit the car to check my surroundings. Maybe that man is already behind me and he is about to kill me. I suddenly turn around to face my would be killer but there is nothing but an empty, completely and unilluminated dark alley behind. This alley... It gives me an unexplainable sense of impending doom and dread. It's as if something or someone is out there, lurking, waiting for right moment to strike at me. 

I hear the faint voice coming from my phone that I am holding. It's calling my name

""Mike..."" 

I pick it up to my ear but before I can even open my mouth, the man starts talking

""Mike, what you sense in the darkness is very dangerous! Do not step into darkness it or it will consume you. It has been waiting for this moment""

Adrenaline starts coarsing through my veins. This is a genuine fight or flight situation or I will die! 

""Hurry to the door, there is safety there!"" 

The streetlight lamp post near the alley suddenly goes out, revealing more darkness. It is unnaturally dark and it advances into now deilluminated area. 

I start to walk towards the door. I find myself picking up the pace until I am running, still holding my trusty phone by my ear. I arrive the stony staircase of the library main entrance. The library is supposed to be closed this late into evening. A cold and moist wind of The Fall starts to strike against my face. My heart is pounding as I gasp for air. Inhale, exhale... 

""Good, you are here. I cannot show myself yet but I can see you now""

Its just fear of the dark I think to myself. It's all I can think, almost ignoring the man's words on the phone. I don't think even the comfort of my own bachelor's condo would repeal it. 

""That thing... do you know why this is happening?"" 

""It is a predator and it has your mind trapped. It is real, but your world is not. To flee from it, you need to wake up"" 

""Strange. This is just like in the movie"" I reply

""Yes, about that... I have found out that the movie is a recollection of your experiences within your dream. Or more accurately, a mind trap. What has happened several times already will happen again, but each time, the darkness, the predator, whatever it is, will tighten its grip around your world of illusion, until it is ready to strike... And consume you""

""WHAT?! Please, help me!"" 

""Do not fear. By answering my call, you have already broken 'the loop'. The predator is now forced to strike, unprepared. This is your chance to defeat it. You need to wake up""

""But how?! I am awake... I do wish this was just a bad dream""

""It IS just a bad dream. Your real body is right next to me, sleeping. Your vital signs are still in good condition, but I don't know for how long. You just need to wake up before your mind is consumed""

""This is so crazy"" 

""Mike, listen to me. By breaking the loop, the darkness that hunts you is forced to break the illusion. It is why those people stared at you, it is why your car broke, it is why you see the darkness as a predator""

I just wanted to cry and wake up from the nightmare. 

""In the movie... In the end... the protagonist walked into the darkness. He was never found again"" I replied 

""That doesn't have to happen. You have already broken the loop. You just need to wake up. The Predator has infected your sleeping mind but it will die in awake one""

""How the fuck am I supposed to wake up?!"" I cry out loud. A gust of cold wind caresses my back. 

""Enter the tunnel beside you. You will find answers within the library""

""That tunnel... I've never seen it before"" I replied as I looked into the tunnel within the concrete wall, illuminated by lamps. It is barely tall enough to fit me in. 

""No, it doesn't exist in your real world. That's why you don't remember it. But it exists in the illusion, the world that you are experiencing. Please, enter it. It was not easy to make this shortcut for you"" 

I sighed but with the last handful of bravery I had left, I looked at it, turned to face it and as I am about to step inside, I hear the man once more 

""Keep walking no matter what and I will call you back when you're out""

An ear-piercing shriek screamed out of the speakers. Everybody in the theater doubled over in pain as their hands covered their ears. Mercifully, after 10 seconds the shriek ended, replaced by a strangely soft, soothing voice.

‘Please check under your seats.’

I looked around as the patrons pulled out chainsaws, a scythe, knives and other implements of death. 

Under my seat? A hand written note, on a scrap of paper, written in permanent marker.

‘RUN!’

I looked up, the rest of the movie-goers were staring at me. A timer had been projected on the screen. 27…26…25…

The man to my left was trying to start his chainsaw.

The man to my right was staring at me, his bowie knife at his side. Did he lick his lips?

20…19…18…

I began my way to the exit. I didn’t know what was happening, but I didn’t want to wait to find out. I ran to the exit and took one more look at the screen as the sound of idling chainsaws and two-stroke smoke filled the air.

5…4…3…

I burst through the door. The theater staff lined the hallway. Their red vests were far more red than normal.

‘We know what you did…’ A staff member whispered.

 The air smelled of iron. An air horn sounded from the theater behind me as I hit the inner doors. The sound of sneakers on the plush carpet filled the air. I was being hunted. But once I got out of the theater, I’d be safe right?

The car hit me as I ran across the street. I felt something in my leg pop. I stood back up to be greeted by an exquisite pain in my leg as I tried to get back up. 

The driver rushed out, but only whispered, ‘We know what you did’

“What did I do?” I cried. But the whispering continued. The theater staff and patrons were streaming out of the theater now. Some had blood on their hands and faces. One was missing half an arm. They marched toward me. I limped to the driver’s door of the car and got in. I’d never stolen a car before, but when a bloodthirsty mob is chasing you, maybe it’s time to commit a new felony.

I’d started to relax a bit when the car started accelerating on it’s own. My rearview mirror revealed a police SUV, lights blazing, pushing me. The brakes did nothing as we plowed through the stoplights. I tried turning the wheel, which only succeeded in spinning the car sideways, implanting the drivers door firmly on the SUV’s bumper. The SUV pushed harder. The driver-side window exploded. My left arm burst, then went numb. I tasted blood.

The car plowed into the wall of a shop. 

Everything went white, briefly. I woke up to a mob, standing over me. One face looked familiar. She bent down and whispered.

‘I know what you did.’

“What? What did I do?”

She leaned in close to my right ear, and in a barely audible voice, ‘Karah…’

My eyes went wide with recognition. Just as the mob tore my broken body apart.",Mercutio879

You join the audience laughing, until you remember the start of the movie: A cinema...with a laughing audience.",GraysPicture,"Oliver sat on the edge of his seat, watching the end credits roll.

*Hot damn, that was good.*

There was something about an amorphous monster that appealed to him—something about a creature taking form from the deepest, darkest depths of human imagination. The film had been good. Damn good. Great, even. Which was high praise coming from Oliver, who had given up on horror films around the year 2000. The protagonists were always stupid, yet the monsters were always even dumber, somehow. But this movie was original. It had been like if *The Matrix* and Stephen King’s *It* had mated and spewed out a hell spawn.

Sitting back, and patting his pockets to make sure his wallet and phone were still there, he squinted at the screen.

A grizzled man to his left, three seats down—the same wretched old man who’d been hacking up a lung throughout the entire film—now gave a soft little *put-put* of a cough as he, too, read the last line of the scrolling credits. From the corner of his eye, Oliver thought he saw the man smile.

*Based on true events.*

Oliver had to laugh at that. So, too, did the grizzled old man. Then the geezer’s laugh and cough combined into a kind *harrumph* that finished wet, crescendoing into a *heeh, heeh, heeh*. Then he spoke, his voice like brittle leaves.

“Better this way.”

A few heads turned, but not many.

*Why is no one getting up?*

And hadn’t the movie started this way? A movie-going audience spellbound by something on screen, something at once horrible and glorious—something that spoke to their most carnal desires. And hadn’t the monster in the film taunted its victims? Hadn’t it tempted them?

*Oh, come on. You know you want to do it. Cut her face off. You can do it. That’s it.*

Oliver made to stand up, to get out, to disappear, but his legs would not obey.

The grizzled old man leaned forward and hacked, hacked hacked. A few drops of blood landed on the blue haired teen in the next row. Timid, trembling fingers probed the wetness on the back of her head, but she did not turn—did not speak. She had eyes only for the screen.

Then, the first row exploded in a shower of blood and guts as the seats grew fangs and closed on their occupants. The consumed did not scream, but even as Oliver’s mind struggled to process what was happening, he knew: locked inside their bodies, as he was, they were terrified. Then the second row exploded, then the third.

“Better this way,” said the old man, with a tight bob of his nearly bald head. Oliver realized for the first time that he had an old fashioned accent, like a gangster from the ‘30s. His voice was close now. No, that wasn’t quite right. It was coming from all around.  “If you feed it, it don’t stay hungry. Better you lot than my lot, I can tell ya.”

A few more rows into the feast, a tide of hot blood covered Oliver, entering his mouth and damping what would have been, in any event, a pitiful scream—locked as he was in his body.

Rows six, seven and eight, consumed. Gnashing of teeth.

Still his legs would not obey. As the blue haired teen in front of him popped like a plump grape, the disheveled old man with the gangster accent cackled, and even though Oliver realized it was cliche, he used his last bit of will to form his final thought:

*Fade out.*",TomJCharles

**NSFW**

The credits roll, “Based on true events”

Comes across the screen.

A slight chuckle is heard from the back, 

And we all join in until I recognized this scene.

Just like the movie, the audience soon erupted

In a chorus of laughter, laughing, laughing

I get up to leave, but something is stopping me

I soon notice, I too am just laughing, laughing

My body fills with dread

Because I know what happens next.

As light illuminates the theater,

A family of four stands and looks a little vexed.

Everyone around them grabs a hold

Of each, an arm, a leg, a head

They are dragged to the front, for everyone to see

Fighting and crying, but they soon give up instead.

Confusion and terror begin to wash over me,

As I find myself walking towards them.

With every step, I become more and more

Apprehensive, as I grab a blade on the hem

Of my waist. I near the mother of the family,

My heart is beating out of my chest.

I can see the fear in her eyes, as I raise my 

Knife and tear into her breast.

With my eyes closed, I stab and stab,

The fear wears away, while my audience laughs.

A rush fills me as I move on to the children,

Who are completely aghast.

I am no longer dreadful as I begin 

To slice the kids open while their father weeps.

I smile and I am overjoyed, as I begin to pull

Out their intestines and throw them in a heap.

A craving creeps in, and I know I need more

It’s time for the finale, I need the father’s head.

I rub my blade against his face, while he struggles with might.

“What’s the point,” I ask, “You’re already dead.”",jasweiner5000

 *The camera is zoomed in on a theatre screen, credits rolling.*  
 *In the background, the audience is laughing.*  
 *The Camera slowly zooms out, revealing bit by bit the audience, twisted and contorted in unnatural shapes.*  
 *They are dead.*  
 *The laughing continues.*  
 *The camera is still zooming out.*  
 *A snap, a crack, the sound of flesh and muscle tearing from bone.*  
 *The camera zooms out to reveal the doors of the theatre. An unseen figure runs in front of the camera, down the hallway, panting heavily.*  
 *The camera pans sideways to catch the figure running out the door.*  
 *It follows the figure.*  
 *The laughter fades away.*

&amp;#x200B;

I had to get out of there.  
The film was excellent, but that doesn’t matter now.  
I had felt that something was wrong through the entire screening. The theatre was full so I sat in the front row, captivated by the excellent cinematography and practical effects. It looked too real. But the audience was too quiet, too still, and that put me on edge. I munched on my popcorn and finished it halfway through the movie, and when I did I noticed something. Not one other sound was coming from behind me. No crunch of movie snacks, no sip of drinks, no shifting in chairs. Dead silence.  
The movie ended, and the credits started to roll, and the first words that appeared were “Based on a true story.”  
The theatre suddenly erupted in laughter, it surprised me. Dead silence to the roar that was happening in here spooked me bad.  
I had to get out of there. I headed to the nearest exit, sprinted down the hallway and out the doors.

&amp;#x200B;

*It is night.*  
 *The figure runs into the middle of the road, eyes wide and frantically searching for his vehicle.*  
 *Finding it, he races towards his car, hand fumbling in his pockets, probing for his keys.*  
 *A sound is heard and he whips his head around. Panic sets in his face as he explored for the source of the sound, like spotlights searching for a criminal.*

&amp;#x200B;

I heard something behind me, a low growl that didn’t sound human or animal. I paused what I was doing, but I couldn’t see its source. I turned back to my car and climbed in.  
 I knew I had to get as far away from this place as I could, so I started the engine and left my parking space.

&amp;#x200B;

*The camera watches as the car drives off.*  
 *On the edge of the picture a sinister figure looms, a snarl dancing along its face and echoing off the walls.*  
 *It moves along, followed by several other shadows.*

&amp;#x200B;

I passed the supermarket and found it deserted.  
 I passed the cemetery and found it dug up.  
 I passed the forest and the bushes and trees were shaking.

&amp;#x200B;

T*he car drives along. The camera jumps and cuts to various points, the car just passing in front of it. At each point, it zooms in to reveal more and more figures. The supermarket of ghosts. The cemetery full of the dead. The forest swarmed by werewolves.*

&amp;#x200B;

I kept driving, but I didn’t know where I was going. It seemed each twist and turn was made on its own. I, a passenger in my own vehicle.  
 Soon, I became lost in this maze of a town. I grew up here, but I found myself in an unfamiliar place.  
 I heard a howl echo across the land, sending a chill down my spine. I wasn’t cold, but I found myself shivering.  
 It seemed the further I went the closer I came. To what, I don’t know. 

&amp;#x200B;

*The camera flies far above the town, following the progress of the car.*  
 *It settles on top of a church spire, slowly panning as the car winds through the town.*

&amp;#x200B;

The car kept going. I must’ve been seeing things, because houses started to float in the sky. Each building looked more and more archaic, and rot and decay had taken hold. Eventually, the car stopped, and reached what looked like the town center of this strange place. The car parked, the engine stopped and the lights went out without me moving a muscle, and I felt the strange longing to step out of the car.

&amp;#x200B;

*The camera is high up. Centered on the car, movement is seen at every corner. Along every road, every street, figures make their way towards the town center.*

&amp;#x200B;

I opened the door and got out. I took one shaky step, then another, and stopped. I looked up at the full moon and felt my back start to burn. Crimson light started to flood the town, and a second, red, larger moon filled the sky. I cried out in pain and hunched over.

&amp;#x200B;

*The camera zooms in on this figure as it starts to shriek and contort under the red glow. Large, leather wings sprout from his back. His arms and legs elongate, and his torso grows. Horns sprout from his head and his chin protrudes out. His skin turns dark red, more powerful than the crimson bask of the blood moon. His eyes turn to slits, and his tong stretches. Fangs form from his teeth, and fur covers his legs. His feet are hooves, his hands are claws. He flexes and flaps his wings, and a smile plays on his lips.*

&amp;#x200B;

I understood now. In my new form, I was more powerful than any other being. I saw my minions drowning the square, every street, house, and rooftop. The movie was a prophecy, and I knew what to do. I’d unleash my horde upon the world, and claim it in the name of our lord Lucifer. I was his chosen messenger, and the message was clear to me.

My girlfriend’s hearty laughter transitioned to an airy chuckle as she turned to me, “That was really good! I like the way they didn’t overuse jump scares. It’s so cheap when they rely on that for horror.” 

I grabbed the half eaten popcorn, empty Cookie Dough Bites box, and cup full of half-melted ice chips before following her out of the row and being shuffled down the aisle and out of the theater. I tossed our garbage and nodded in thanks at the black-clad youth, leaning on a push broom with his elbow. He ignored my gesture and I picked up my pace to catch up to my girlfriend as she walked the opposite way of the exit doors. “Andie!” I called out behind her, her name stuck in my throat. *I must have said it oddly, or enunciated the wrong syllable.* She turned and smiled at me, “Bathroom, real quick!” A conversation between friends flew by me, also on the way to the Ladies’ Bathroom. “It was so creepy at the beginning, with the audience laughing.” A reply, “I hate it more when they leave cliffhangers like that.” I walked into the Men’s room, head down, and pulled at my zipper when I found an empty urinal flanked by two empty urinals, behind me, another conversation. “I don’t know why I go with you to shit like that. I fucking hate scary movies.” “C’mon, it was pretty good right?” I silently agreed with the second voice, the movie was pretty good. I tucked, I zipped, I washed my hands and I stood by the claw machine in the Lobby.

When we had arrived to see this movie, the sun shone brightly; it must have gone down sometime when we were in there. I checked my phone for the time, *6:30 PM*, the night before Halloween. I felt two small arms slide around my torso to wrap me in a hug, then I felt cool wetness against my stomach. “Ew, Andie are you using me as a towel?!” I scolded as I turned around. Andie giggled, as I pulled away, she flicked the remaining water from her fingertips at me and I play crushed her in a big bear hug in retaliation. “It’s still pretty early. Are you hungry? Wanna get some dinner?” She nodded and readjusted her shoulder bag. I instinctively grabbed her hand as we began to walk, but her bag kept sliding down her shoulder and plopping into the crook of her arm, I let her walk forward and switched the hand I was holding. But somehow, it still felt wrong. I grabbed it from the front, then switched to hold her hand from behind, all of it felt wrong. “Babe, what are you doing? Stop fidgeting. Where do you want to eat?” Andie asked pointedly. “Sorry. You choose, I’m good with anywhere.” And again, as the words left my mouth, they stuck oddly in my throat. 

In my mind, I knew that asking her to choose was a guaranteed half hour of indecision, but I said words that I haven’t said since the beginning of our relationship anyway.

“Japanese. Andie wants a bento.” She replied in third person while rubbing her belly in big exaggerated circles. I smiled at her. “Andie gets a bento. Sake2Me sound good?”

I woke up the next morning, swathed in lavender colored sheets. The morning light spilled through the east facing windows and the curious mix of cucumber melon and coconut filled my senses. I hated waking up in Andie’s room when I expected to wake up in my own. I glanced over at Andie’s side of the bed simultaneously as the loud sound of a bowel movement echoed in the hall. *Poor girl.* 

My mouth was dry and tasting of a nights worth of bad decisions. I got out of bed and stumbled into the kitchen, turning the kitchen tap on and rinsing my mouth out, lips to stream, before taking a big gulp of water. I came back up, wiping my mouth on the back of my hand and looked outside. Frost lined the window as my eyes were drawn to the pumpkins we had carved last weekend. By comparison, hers looked like a jack-o-lantern masterpiece sitting beside a mangled attempt. A random neighborhood cat jumped down from the fence and slinked through the pumpkins. I frowned, remembering the piles of cat poop I was cleaning up in Andie’s backyard. I tapped the glass lightly and waved my arms in an attempt to scare the cat away, but it stared at me with large amber eyes. 

Suddenly, the cat popped up, arching its back and opening its mouth in an inaudible hiss. “Good morning!” Andie said, startling me. I recoiled in surprise, which elicited a light giggle from her. My head started to throb. “Shit, I think I’m hungover. How much did I drink last night?” I asked. “I dunno. The same amount as me, I guess. I blacked out and I had terrible ‘too much liquor’ shits this morning.” I responded with a quick, “Gross.” and made my way to the bathroom in search of Advil. “I would give that a few minutes if I were you!” Andie called from the kitchen. She was already making a racket in there. I made a hard right into the bedroom, heeding her warning  rather than opening the door to the bathroom to figure out what she meant. I checked all the regular places my phone would be. The night stand, the end of the USB cord, in my pants crumpled on the floor. Eventually, I found it under the pillow where I was sleeping, holding onto 6% battery life with a myriad of notifications. I plugged it in and laid back down in bed, pulling the soft comforter up under my chin. I yawned as Andie’s kitchen shenanigans grew louder and louder. Like she was intentionally slamming cabinet doors and banging pots and pans. 

On the floor, plugged into the wall, my phone began to vibrate against the hardwood. I sprung out of bed to look at who was calling. “Hey Mom, what’s up?” I answered, phone still charging and attached to the wall. My mother’s voice cracked through the receiver, “Oh thank god you’re alright.” “What are you talking about?” “This morning on the news, they were talking about all these odd murders. I know that you and Andie like going out on the weekends, so I was worried you might have gotten caught up in something.” “Mom, you know we’re safe. I’m good. Just a bit hungover. I’ll swing by later today to help you with trick or treaters, okay?” I imagined my mother sitting in her wheelchair, rosary clutched to her chest, phone to her ear, eyes glued to the news, Dad was probably taking a mid-morning nap in his recliner next to her. “Okay. See you soon. I love you.” “Love you too, Mom. ...And Dad.” I added, out of the blue. I could hear her smiling on the other line. “Good boy.” I hung up. I didn’t realize I was squatting the whole time on the phone until my thighs started to burn. I lowered my butt three inches to the ground and glanced up at the battery charge, still at 6%. 

I pulled down the notification bar on my phone, trying to clear away my morning notifications. On a whim, I turned on the TV in Andie’s bedroom to drown out the noise that she was making in the kitchen. My investments were down, there was a tip from my Fantasy Football App, and a few dozen messages. A blip and a new notification, “Scott: Hey man, are you alright?” I poked the pop up to reply, and it took me to my messaging app.

I had texted Scott dozens of times last night. We carried a full conversation that I have no memory of.

**You like scary movies right? You need to go watch this new movie,** ***Hindsight***

***Hindsight?*** **Never heard of it. What’s it about?**

**That’s fuckin impossible. There’s like a budget and marketing and shit, usually. You’re fucking with me**

**Nah man, seriously! This shit is freaking me out**

I checked my other messages. “*Hindsight*? What’s that?” “Never heard of it, is it in theaters?” “Pass, I don’t like scary movies.” “New phone who dis?” “Lol, is this a Halloween joke? That movie doesn’t exist.” “Dafuq you talkin bout?” Co-workers, exes, friends, family, I texted everyone last night. 

*“An alarming series of crimes have hit our sleepy town last night. A prank gone rogue or something more sinister? Police have no leads or motive to the string of homicides that occurred in dozens of homes last night….”*

Dozens of homes? My ears started to ring, my head throbbed more, then silence. A thought invaded my mind.

*Andie doesn’t fucking cook.*

People look at each other, their features dulled by the darkness in the room. Hannah grabs your hand and pulls you out of your seat.

""Let's go,"" she says.

Most of the audience has begun to move from their seats. Someone near the front is fumbling with her purse. Suddenly she drops it, clattering loudly as it falls, and her things roll onto the floor. There is a moment of complete silence as the people in the theater turn and look at her.

""Ahhh!"" A loud scream shatters the silence. Someone runs to the center of the room and yells, ""The doors are locked!""

You feel your heart racing as panic begins to set in. You push through the people around you to the exit where a woman is banging and kicking at the door. Next to her stands a child crying with big, hoarse gulps. He must have been the one screaming earlier.

""What's going on?"" someone demands.

The woman, out of breath, answers, ""The door won't budge."" The boy screams again and cries even more loudly.

""Shut up, Isaac! No one needs your screaming right now,"" the woman scolds. Hannah is next to you. She sees the little boy and rushes to him, wrapping him up in her arms.

""Can't you see he's scared?""

""We're all scared,"" the woman responds bluntly before pulling the child away from Hannah.

A man approaches the closed door and pulls firmly at first and then more forcefully. The door doesn't move. He stands back and looks thoughtfully at the door.

""Does anyone have a hairpin? Maybe we can use it to unlock the door."" You can see a woman tugging at her hair before she pulls out a hair pin, releasing a nest of curls which tumble down her back.

""Use this,"" she instructs, holding the pin up for the man to take. He takes it and inserts it in the lock. After some moments of fumbling, he steps back, defeated.

""It isn't working.""

A large crack rips across the room and suddenly the lights go out, leaving the theater pitch black. A few people scream and you can hear the little boy crying uncontrollably somewhere behind you. Someone thinks to pull out their phone to use as a light. Others follow suit and soon small globes of light fill the room.

""Has anyone tried calling anyone?"" someone asks and another person laughs uncomfortably in response.

""Let's try it now,"" he says and dials some numbers before holding the phone up to his ear.

""It's not going through,"" he shares, his voice shaking slightly. You pull out your phone and try to text a friend. The text doesn't send. You notice you have no service on your phone.

""There's no service,"" someone else tells everyone. You feel Hannah grab your hand, wedging her fingers deeply into your own.

""What are we going to do?"" a woman asks no one in particular. No one responds, but each person looks at another as the realization sets in that they are trapped. 

You pull Hannah more closely to you, wrapping your arms around her. ""We're going to be okay,"" you whisper into her ear more for yourself than for her.

An old song begins playing over the speakers, crackling loudly to indicate its age. Suddenly the screen lights up and a black and white film starts to play.

""What's going on?"" Hannah asks you.

The film keeps playing, but photos begin to interrupt it, flashing by too quickly to see what they are. One pauses long enough, and you recognize a theater, just like the one you are in, filled with fearful faces looking up at something offstage.

""Look!"" someone yells and you follow their trembling finger to where they are pointing. In the projection room, you can see a shadowy figure watching the people down below. A sense of dread fills your body, and you cannot help but turn away.

""Ahh!"" someone else screams. Everyone turns to see what they're screaming at. On the screen, the film has stopped on the image of a woman hanging from the rafters of a large room. You look up, slowly, hesitantly, afraid of what you will see.

""New destination found. Recalculating route.""",Spider_Clown,"Hell looks *nothing* like what I imagined.

While there’s fire, and certainly torture—there are also *factories.* The entire place is like an industrial zone, and as my state-of-the-art, multi-million dollar sports car cruises along, it sings with the radio, belting out “Highway to Hell” by AC-DC.

Listen, I ain’t perfect—but I don’t deserve to be here, do I? Worst thing I ever did was push my sister in the mud. But we were kids, and I apologized. A lot. So why am I next to factory workers who’s intestines drag behind them? Why am I watching people get whipped as they put together *cars?*

“Why did you bring me here?” I ask my car.

“HERE – HELL.”

“Yeah, I know. Why. Did. You. Bring. Me. Here?”

“HELL – HOME.”

Home? What does *that* mean?

We turn a corner, and in front of us is a freaking *castle.* It’s huge, it’s evil, and there’s this sick feeling in my gut, one that says I’m probably gonna die. I scream for my car to turn around, but, like before, it ignores me. Still locked in, too.

The castle doors open, and immediately I see the throne, and the pitchfork, and the goddamn *Devil.* For a second, he’s bummed, cheek in palm. But when he notices me, he jumps up, dashing across the room. We pull up to him, me screaming the entire time. When we’re face to face with him, the doors open. With a deep breath, I get out.

“*It actually worked!""* he exclaims.

“Uh…” I say, scratching the back of my head. “Hello.”

“*Hello, my savior!*” the Devil replies, grabbing my hand and shaking it. He looks far more chipper than I ever imagined. “*I’m so happy you’re here!*”

“Why?”

Suddenly, he shoves his pitchfork into my hands. “Kid, I made a mistake. Hundred years ago, I created cars. The ultimate deathtrap. And, hell—pun intended—they’re effective! But my demons, they’ve become obsessed with them, and now all they wanna do is build *more.* I miss the glory days! Where’s the torture, the misery?”

“I’m…so confused…”

The Devil chuckles, sitting in the car. “You’ll figure it out.”

“Where are you going?” I ask.

“I built this thing to bring me a successor. So uh…yeah! You’re the Devil now. Do…Devil things. I’m gonna go to Earth and cause some trouble. See ya!”

Before I can say anything, he speeds off, and when I turn around, there are a dozen demons clutching blueprints, begging for me to approve them. Not knowing what to do, I walk over to the throne and take a seat, pressing my hands against my head and praying I’m drunk, and that this is just a dream.

""New destination found. Recalculating route.""",Spider_Clown,"The car’s voice activation system found a new way to malfunction every day. Monday morning was no different. Cruising down the highway on the way to work, George thought about all the times the car had taken words out of context and turned them into strange and destructive orders. For example, one time his wife told him to get home ASAP for dinner. It’s been two years, and the local nuns *still* don’t let him in the church he tore a hole into. 

As his mind drifted off, he turned on the radio. That was his fatal mistake. Familiar lyrics poured through the speakers. 

“Ain’t nothing I would rather do… I’m on the highway to hell!”

The voice activation system replied in a chipper tone. “New destination found. Recalculating route.”

George snapped out of his trance. “Wait, what’s going on?” George looked at the head’s up display and looked at the route the GPS set. 

“Oh no! I don’t want to go to Hell! I hate the state of Mississippi!”

Suddenly the screen turned black with a twisted red smile in the centre. The car speed up as if it had a mind of it’s own. Cars honked and swerved to avoid George’s demon car. The car kept going faster and faster, until it passed the top speeds of the speedometer. The cars steering wheel wouldn’t respond, and the brakes wouldn’t work. There was nothing George could do until he fainted.

When he woke up, he was still in the car. A demon jumped back, startled by his sudden wakefulness. 

“What the hell?” George said.

“Yep, you’re here.”

“What’s going on? Did I die?”

“Nope. You’re actually the first living person to show up. I’m pretty sure it’s against the rules to force you into here if you’re still alive. I mean if anyone makes a deal with hell, we usually send a demon out to earth; we don’t negotiate deals in hell.” 

“Wait, how often does that happen?” George asked.

“Last time was about 54 years ago. Apparently he wanted to hit 5 guys with 1 bullet from a school book depository. It was really specific, but whatever.”

“Can I go home?”

“Oh yeah, just give us a sec.”

The everything went black for George.  ",Novel_Entertainer

[WP] Convince the ship's AI you need control before it's too late!,SurvivorType,"Clutching her chest in pain, the captain of the ETSS Montague lies broken and bleeding on the floor of her own control room. Sparks scatter occasionally from dented machinery, and a dull hum penetrates the air.

“MERC...are you there?”

“MemEtics ReCognition UtiliTy Intelligence Online is unresponsive. Would you like to attempt a reboot?” 

The voice of the central computer is cold and robotic. In a way, its indifference is chilling. 

“Yes. Please.”

After a brief pause a golden hologram begins to materialize, its warm glow a pleasant contrast to the dark blood pooling on the ground. Within a few seconds of buffering, a person of slight stature takes form. Their charming features are a welcome sight. 

“Oh god, Merc, it’s good to see you.”

“Captain Eda? You’re injured!” The AI swiftly closes the gap between themself and the wounded woman. Their form wavers with each step. 

“No shit I’m injured,” she chuckles. Blood pools at her lips. “Hey, Merc...”

“Here, I’ll have the nanobots deployed immediately. Why wasn’t I notified of your condition? The system should have altered me at the first sign of trouble so I could best aid you.”

Eda looks down at her chest and the five dizzyingly deep lacerations that span it, then across the cabin toward the locked reinforced door. She can’t hear anything from the other side...not yet. They still have time. 

“Don’t worry about the bots. Listen...you need to give me the Nav controls.”

The being of light knits their brows, concern flickering across their face. 

“Captain, you know I’m not meant to do that. I’m just a moderator between crew and computer. I can chart a course to any planet you would like, so long as it won’t cause you or the crew to come to any harm. Please let me know what I can do. I’m only here to keep you safe.”

“Bit late for that. There’s something on the ship, Merc. Something bad. I know how and where we can get rid of it, but it’s something I have to do myself.”

“You’re not planning anything rash-”

“They’re dead. All of them. Kyne. Ebi. Riva. Jones. The entire maintenance team.”

The AI’s expression turns completely blank. It’s the same look that crosses their face when confronted with too long a list of computations. The same look as when they’re presented with a paradox.

“I...don’t...understand.”

“It’s not your fault.”

“What happened? I should have been online. I should have been processing. I could have-”

The blank look turns to one of anguish, the most sorrowful Eda has ever seen in an AI. 

“I...”

There’s a whirring noise in the ceiling and the glow of the hologram begins to fade. 

“I’m sorry.”

The AI vanishes, leaving behind nothing but empty space. 

“Navigational Controls have been set to manual,” the central computer hums. “This is not the recommended state.”

“Set a course for the core of the star of the Byralki solar system. Proceed immediately.”

As a deep, grating thud echoes against the cabin door, the ship prepares to make its final jump. Broken and bleeding, the Captain of the ETSS Montague lets her head fall back against the floor. It won’t be long now.",chloeorsomething

"[WP] you are a insanely powerful lich, you have fought and defeated everyone worth the effort and now you are bored, but as you are thinking of ways to entertain yourself a child walks into your chambers",ThatManFarsa,"It's been centuries. Centuries of idleness and twiddling phalanges ever since my most triumphant day, though I'd quickly regretted it soon after. I remember as clearly as if it were last night, the proud castle wall crumbling to dust with the wave of my staff as my undead army swarmed through the streets of the last kingdom, an unstoppable wave of rattling bones turned deadlier with weapons. My incentive? I was no simple minded lich. I did not simply attack on an excited whim, no. I pursued knowledge, eternal life to rival the angels themselves, in hopes that one day I'd fall in the greatest battle in history, between myself and a hundred of God's servants!

A hundred? That's a bit much. Okay, how does 50 sound? Yes! A glorious battle between myself and 50 archangels! My name would resonate through history as the one true lich! Excellent!

A strange noise snapped me back into reality as it echoed across the hall. Ever since that day, I'd settled into the king's castle and have made it quite the abode. Mountains of books piled around the throne in various sizes, though not shapes. I mean, I've never seen a book that wasn't rectangular. That would be awfully awkward. Like, how would you even hold i-

""Hellooo?""

I turn dead still at the sound of a foreign voice. Could this be it? Yes, there's no doubt about it. *This* is the moment I've been waiting for. A courageous hero and their party ready to engage with me in a worthy battle, only to flee from their defeat and alert their kingdom of an impossible, undefeated Lich. Eventually, they'd have to call upon the powers of the angels, and then... yes. I could almost *smell* the holiness.

But enough of fantasies. I fumbled around the piles of books, and grabbed the most intimidating staff I could find, then quickly sat on the throne as if I'd been expecting visitors.

""W-"" I clear my throat. ""*Welcome hero, to my chambers that had once been a proud throne room. Surely, you recognise the nuance of my decision? To show that I stand above all mortals! And with my omnipotence, I can raze whole kingdoms if I see fit. Bow before the great Lich that is myself!*""

A child walks up the steps into the room, its tiny little feet echoing against the hard stone floor. I blink hypothetically. 

S-surely there's been a misunderstanding. How could this small, *helpless* child reach the throne room unscathed, what with all the traps that I'd put in place? Well, they do say heroes come in all shapes and sizes. ""*Powerful child! What name have you been called upon? The Light? The Holy Harbinger? The* hero*?*""

""My mum told me not to talk to strangers.""

I rise with unfathomable fury from my seat. ""*How* dare *you ignore my question!""*

""Sorry Mister. My mum calls me Willy.""

I stand in silence. Now that I've looked more closely, the child couldn't be older than 10 years. And worse, what is that atrocious haircut? He looks like a bowl! The least hero-like hair to have! This is no warrior, no. I've wasted my time on an undeveloped, unintelligible, lost child.

I slowly sit back down, massaging the sides of my skull. ""*You are lost, wandering child. If you turn and take the third right, the exit should be there*."" He ignores me and walks to the nearest book he finds. My sudden fatigue and disappointment forces me to sit and watch as he wipes his snot all over The Book of Shadow Magic. I'll just let the books kill him instead. It should suck the life right out of him. I chuckle over the thought.

""Hey mister!"" I pretend to nod off. ""Sir? Mister skeleton!""

""*Okay, that is it.""* I raise my staff threateningly. *""You may walk into my chambers uninvited, you may infuriate me with your nescience, but you do* not *call me a skeleton! I am a powerful Lich! I possess magic accrued over the course of history!""*

""What does this book say?""

""*What?""*

""What does this-""

""*No, I heard you. How did you open the book without turning to dust?""*

The boy simply shrugs. ""*Okay let me see.""* I walk over to the child, but he doesn't falter at my lack of flesh. ""*Hmm.""* I run a bony finger over the first few words. ""*Shva m'k ta. Then you point at someone and see their own shadow lacerate them. It gets me every time.""*

He points at the book and looks over at me for assurance. I nod as the kid turns back, and reduces the book to a hurricane of torn paper and black ink. *""What?""* I take a step back to assess the child, now under a new light. ""*You didn't even need to chant the words. Oh, this is excellent, yes.""*

I quickly find another staff and throw it over to him. The boy reluctantly picks it up, and though it rose to almost twice his height, the magic that now surrounded him made him feel more competent than ever. ""*Now, grab that book to your left. The closest one!""* I begin to feel excited as I breathe magic into my bones once more. I pull my own book from atop of the pile, its contents glowing a deep purple as it flies into my hand.

""*Child!""* I beckon to him.

He gives me a funny look. ""Are we role playing again? I promised Tim I'd do it with him next.""

I point my staff at him with a smile. ""*How would you like to become a Lich?""*",WeeabooKun
[WP] You are a Lawful Good Assassin,That_Dude_22,"Very well written

I must admit I expected a twist. Something along the lines of pure evil being also pure. ;)",I_Am_Anjelen
[WP] You are a Lawful Good Assassin,That_Dude_22,"*Only the pure will survive the ritual of fire.*

The ritual was everything. The white fire, a judgement from the gods, blessing those who were worthy, cleansing those who were not. Judge, jury, and executioner - in her twenty years, Kartha had never failed to bring the unworthy to justice. Hundreds of evils, dark and powerful, were cleansed by the light of Kartha’s ritual.

She ran nimbly through the castle parapets, watching the single light flicker through the castle walls. Inside – Asmodeus the deceiver. Kartha heard the stories. She was going to end this – here and now. Asmodeus had been a dark blot on an otherwise pure world for far too long.

She dropped silently to the balcony. Asmodeus sat facing the fire, his back turned, wand sitting idly on the far table. This was almost too easy. She moved forward, her wand raised. There would be no speech, no attempt to plead, no cries for mercy. The white light would cleanse and destroy – as it always had. 

“Tell me, assassin, why have you come to kill me tonight?” Asmodeus asked, sipping from a cup of ginger tea.

Kartha’s spell hit him through the chair, binding his hands and legs with a glowing, purple light. Asmodeus fell disgruntled to the ground.

“How did you know I was here?” Kartha asked, stepping forward cautiously. She prepared the white fire.

“Because it is prophecy,” Asmodeus said, straining to look at Kartha. The tip of her wand glowed with a soft white light, extending into a small white sphere. Kartha closed her eyes, pouring her power into the spell. With a flash, the sphere grew, filling the room with light. The ritual was complete. Kartha sighed in relief – it was over. 

Short cackles sounded nearby. Asmodeus rose up from the ground, the ritual ward had broken his bindings. He waived his hand; magical restraints formed around Kartha, immobilizing her. She dropped her wand. 

“Only the pure will survive the ritual of fire. Tell me - Assassin, what does this mean to you?” Asmodeus said, walking slowly to his desk. 

“It can’t be.” Kartha said, eyes wide in fear as she struggled helplessly.  “You’re evil – wretched. You’ve killed hundreds. You’re a monster; the ritual – it should have destroyed you”

“How many have you killed? Yet here we stand. Come now, I will show you again” Asmodeus said, reaching out towards his wand. It shot from the table into his hands.   

With a flick of his wrist the ward appeared – much brighter than Kartha’s. White fire surrounded them - and passed over. Asmodeus dissipated the spell.

“Assassin, you fight for holy justice. Judge me, am I guilty?” 

Kartha fought back tears. Her mission and purpose had always been clear. From the moment she joined the order, nearly twenty years ago, she was made a sword of light. Never was she to harm the pure of heart, those walking the righteous path. 

“Your heart is pure. I cannot kill you.” Kartha said in disbelief. “How is this possible?” 

Asmodeus walked through the room, reaching the mantle. He grabbed a black tablet, carved with glowing red runes.

“This tablet speaks of prophecy, a prophecy I must fulfill. Locked away in a sacred vault, inside one of your temples – there is a holy dagger – you will bring this to me. Only then can I forge the strength to do what is necessary.”

“You dare think I would serve you? You are a fool indeed,” Kartha said – struggling against the magic restraints. 

“Your order is weak. They do not have the strength to do what is necessary to bring peace. They let kingdoms rise and fall; war and famine rage across the lands. If they used their power to rule, fair and just – we could live in a world without suffering. Examine yourself, you know this to be true.”

Kartha snarled. It couldn’t be true; except, it was. Her order was nothing more than secluded monks and aged rituals. She was one of the last swords of light – the last willing to act against the evil in the world.

“And what will you do once I’ve brought this dagger to you?” Kartha said. 

“There is a ritual I must complete; your order will be reborn in strength.” Asmodeus said, releasing Kartha’s bonds. 

“If the master finds out? He will have me banished.”

“Leopold? Leave him to me.” Asmodeus said, a fierce look of determination in his eyes.

"[WP] ""So...I have the sword. That means I'm the hero, right?"" ""...not exactly, kid.""",Thecoldflame,"I didn't understand it then, but I do now, with bodies strewn across the room. This sword corrupted me into something twisted and evil, and I hate it. But what other choice do I have? I can't resist it.

""Stop! I'll... I'll...""

I don't want to hurt him, and I don't want to reply... But I'm forced to

""Or you'll what? Call more guards to their death? You can't stop me, or even delay me, I am *unstoppable*""

My own voice no longer sounds like my own, it's twisted and wrong. Against my own will, I walked over to the man and gut him, his intestines spilled the floor and the horrible scent of blood filled the air. I hate what I've become, but I don't think I can stop myself. I went back to the guy that gave me the sword

""I told you, simply wielding this weapon would not make you a hero, you need a will of a true hero, otherwise you become a servant of mine, unable to act on your accord""

He knows I'm still in my own head, and he's talking to me, not this corruption of myself.

""I'm feeling generous today so I'll tell you how to break this curse. Kill me, and you'll be free""

My body didn't react, but in my mind I jumped with joy.

""But you won't be able to, because you're trapped in your own mind""

He's right, but I have to try.

""I'll even put your sword on gut, just to 'help' you, hahahaha""

His laughter was mocking me, and he knew I couldn't control my own body. He's trying to anger me

""Well, since you haven't moved I'll just go and pour myself some nice whiskey""

He turned his back and did as he said he would. Now's my chance, I need to force myself to throw the sword at him.

""Would you like a drin--"" **SSSHHLURRGGGH**

The sword ripped through his back and out his chest, pinning him to his own desk. Now that I'm free of this curse, I'll have to cut this long hair, and get a new wardrobe, I look a lot like a villain.

"[WP] You start to notice strange creatures around you that you shouldn't be able to see. A girl whispers to you: ""Don't let them find out you can see them.""",glitchywitch,"I turn to look at the girl, whispering,
“You mean those blurry things on everyone’s shoulder? You can see them too?”

The girl is wearing a uniform for the school I’m walking by. 

She flashes a gap-toothed smile at me, “Everyone can see them if they look hard enough, I noticed you staring so I figured you must’ve only recently realized.” She points across the street at a lady walking her daughter to school. “They usually sit on people’s shoulders but they’re quite blurry at first so no one really sees them.”

“At first?” I ask quizzically. “You mean they aren’t always these vague looking blobs?”.

“Keep looking at hers and you tell me” she giggles.

Doing as the girl suggested I keep looking at the lady’s misty creature. Slowly but surely features start to stand out about it. A wiry humanoid frame, a slightly crooked nose, and glasses start to take shape. I draw in a sharp breath in shock. The lady walks out of sight and I turn back to the girl noticing for the first time the creature on her shoulder. 

“Why does that happen? It turned into a small human thing”

“It’s just what they do” she says. Still smiling but a gentle sadness sleeping into her eyes as she looks at me. “ They whisper things too if you are close enough to hear” 

“What else do they do? What are they?” I ask as my eyes dart between her and her creature as it’s features come into relief. 

“Well some are bigger than others but that depends on the person” she begins. The thing looks at me with small squinty eyes. 

“Everyone has them but some don’t seem to be much more than little blank clouds.” Her creature now has little dimpled cheeks as well.

“Others are like creepy dolls full of details, those ones are scary.” It smiles at me with a familiar gap-toothed smile and whispers so quietly it’s almost inaudible over the girl’s voice. “I’ll never be as pretty as the popular girls in class.”

I realize what the thing is as the girl says it. 

“They’re your insecurities.”

I tear my eyes away from the creature back to the girl and notice she wasn’t looking at me but instead just over my shoulder. Tears gleam in her eyes. The bell rings calling in students for the start of the school day.

“ I’ll say it again mister, don’t let them find out you can see them, especially not yours!” She turns and runs into the school yard where I lose sight of her. 

As I begin to walk away, rattled by the explanation of what I’ve been seeing, my phone buzzes. I look down to check my text. It’s my wife. The text reads ‘I love you honey have a great day at work’. I smile and slip my phone into my pocket again. Then I see it, the gray foot dangling from my shoulder. I don’t turn to check. I remember what the girl told me. 

‘She doesn’t love me, I don’t even love myself’ 

I hear the whisper beneath the sound of traffic. ‘But I didn’t look’ I think to myself. ‘Probably just in my head.’

I watched as it sauntered through the clearing and into the woods, attracting no attention from the picnickers nearby.

“Always seen, but never noticed.” The voice took hold; releasing me from my daze.

“What?” I asked slowly, as reality came back into focus. Her accent was dated.

“Those.” The lady remarked. “Always seen, but never noticed.” She seemed strikingly familiar, but I couldn’t put a name to the wizened face.

I stared blankly.

“There are very few of us who can acknowledge that we see them. For everyone else, it’s like mental block.” She continued. “Always in their periphery, but never in focus.”

“Do you mean...you can see them too?”

“Oh honey, it’s far more complicated.” Solemnity washed over her face. “You can’t ever let them know you actually see them. They don’t like that. They don’t like that at all.”

“Oh.” I paused, glancing around the area. For such an exceptional day, the park was sparsely populated. I could swear it wasn’t like that when I first got here. “Why don’t they like it? When you notice them.”

“I don’t know, honey. I just don’t know. But they change you when you do. Quicker than you realize.”

“What kind of change?” My mind danced around the possibilities for a moment, before another thought stole my curiosities. “What are they?”

“Well, honey, it’s a right peaceful change, sometimes.” Her eyes drifted to the sky, deep in thought. Finally, she began again. “They are...us, I suppose. They are us. But so unlike we were. You have heard of the Skinwalkers?

I nodded, again looking into the clearing. The picnicking couple had left their belongings for a walk.

She continued, her eyes trained on a cloud. “It is said they are cursed by the Skinwalkers to ever wander through the ages, taking with them those unfortunate enough to notice. Maybe that’s why they hate being noticed.”

“I’ve never heard any story like that.” I turned, startled slightly by the intensity of the woman’s gaze into mine.

“Surely you’ve heard of missing persons though?” Her eyes softened. “They don’t notice the unchanged, either. It’s hard to communicate with no way to do so.”

“But how do you know?” I asked.

“I’m sorry, honey,” she began, “but I know the same way you do.”

“What do you mean?” I asked, swallowing a nervous itch.

“What’s your name, my dear child?” She asked gently, ignoring my question. 

Frustration found its way past my lips. “It doesn’t matter. What are you trying to tell me?”

“I will show you then, if you cannot understand.” She stood up slowly and made her way toward the picnicker’s belongings. 

*What a joke.* I watched her pass the sidewalk and enter the clearing, stopping near the picnickers’ towels. She stood motionlessly for what felt like ages; the clouds passing over seemed to spell out her patience.

One of the picnickers came into view from a path behind the lady.

“Hey, get away from our stuff!” She shouted. The lady turned and looked at me. 
“See, Jenny? I told you I s–” She stopped abruptly, looking around.

“Jenny is gone, honey.” The lady stared at the picnicker.

“Shut up and get away from our stuff.” The picnicker yelled at the lady. She turned her focus back to her friend. “Jenny? Where did you go? This isn’t funny.”

The lady made her way towards the picnicker, and her gait caught my attention. It was strikingly familiar.",4redditthings

&amp;#x200B;

Emery sighed as she finally threw the covers off, determined that now, she was going to get up. For real this time. As she shuffled off to begin her morning routine, she realized that the headache, while present, was now at its most tolerable point since it began. The worst had been on Wednesday; she’d been hit with a migraine like none she’d ever experienced, and even texting her boss to inform him she couldn’t come to work had been a painful, laborious endeavor. Thursday had seen a slight improvement, though she still hadn’t gone back to work. Today, however, was markedly better. The pain lingered still, flaring up when she turned her head a certain way while brushing her teeth or pulling a towel through her wet hair, but overall, it was quite manageable. *And it’s Friday, thank god.* She contemplated, not for the first time, that perhaps it would be wise to see a doctor about it. She’d had bad headaches before, even migraines. There was nothing new or different about this one, it was simply larger in magnitude. And now it seemed to be going away. She’d always been the type to resist going to the doctor unless it seemed absolutely necessary, and in this case, it had been easier to just rest and wait it out. 

With a sigh, she realized that on the off-chance it had been caused by something serious, it would be better to know about it now rather than later. As she walked out of her apartment, locking the door behind her, she resolved to make an appointment over the weekend. She recalled also that the ski trip she and her friends had been planning for months now was going to occur in a matter of weeks. *Getting checked out* *BEFORE* *heading up into the mountains is probably the smarter course.*

She thought idly about various small, unimportant things as she walked along, the very slight downward incline of Devon Street well-known to her feet by now. It was quite cold, enough that she was bundled up with a scarf, gloves, and a fairly heavy jacket, although the city had yet to see its first snowfall of the season, and the sky was clear. She took in various sights as she walked, and they mingled with the lazy jumble of her thought processes – the small child, laughing as she ran through a small park, her parents pretending to chase her; a delivery driver hopping out of his truck and striding up to the house across from the park, package in hand; the small, bright red shape moving slowly at the corner of her peripheral vision- 

*What the…!* 

She stopped in her tracks, snapping her head to the left as she tried to get a better look at… whatever it was. She blinked rapidly, ignoring the momentary increase in throbbing pain that this action brought on. Golden-brown eyes narrowed slightly, scrutinizing the area where she thought she had seen… something. *Was that… an animal?* She hasn’t gotten a good look at it, but she could have sworn it was glowing bright red. She stared at the space for another moment, now seeing nothing but a few small trees and a street sign, before finally shaking her head. *Was I seeing things? I guess I really* do *need to go see a doctor…* For the moment, she decided to continue heading to work. Truthfully, other than a feeling of lingering confusion over the question of what – if anything – she’d actually seen, she felt much better than she had a few days ago. She reasoned that if things got worse or she started seeing things with any kind of regularity, she could get an urgent appointment if necessary. She knew her boss and her workplace well, and was confident that if she had to take off in the middle of a shift for that reason, she’d be able to. She resumed her pace toward the station. 

“Morning, Emery!”

She smiled as she heard the familiar greeting from Hans, who ran the small coffee and pastry stand just outside the east entrance of Rosemont Station. He’d been a fixture there since long before she’d begun regularly commuting out of this station, and it was a comforting presence for her at the moment, after the strange morning she’d had. “Good to see you back!” he exclaimed, his thick German accent lending an extra flair to his words. “Mocha, ja?” 

“Hmm, not today, actually,” she replied as she stood in front of the counter of his small kiosk. “Been fighting a crazy headache the last few days, so caffeine might not be the *best* thing…”

“Ohh, yes, I agree. What you need is this!” he declared, reaching back behind the counter and producing a simple bottled water. “Important to stay hydrated when you’re not feeling well.”

She laughed, nodding slightly. “You should’ve been a doctor, Hans,” she said, causing him to laugh in turn. “I’ll have a croissant as well, please,” she added. 

He nodded and ducked down, retrieving the requested item from one of the lower shelves of the pastry case between them. “Anything else?” he asked as he was beginning to rise again.

She didn’t hear him. She was distracted by another movement, another strange entity, off to her right. This time, she got a better look at it: a shape, perhaps the size of a dog, moving through the space between her and the glass-and-steel façade of the station’s east entrance, which was about six meters away. Red, and glowing. As before, it disappeared quickly, mere seconds after she’d caught sight of it. 

“Emery? Not feeling faint or anything, I hope?”

She blinked, turning back to regard a concerned Hans. “Ah, um…” She glanced around again, briefly. *No one is looking the least bit bothered by that…* *thing,* she noted, taking in the constant stream of people going into and out of the station, which was typical for a weekday morning. The bizarre glowing shape had moved quickly over the heads of several of those people, and there was no way that it wouldn’t have been seen by at least a few of them. Unless, of course, it was something in her mind, a hallucination or a really intense migraine aura. *Or there IS something there, but only I can see it…* 

Realizing that several seconds had gone by, she looked at Hans once again. “No, sorry, just feeling a little spacy still.” She laughed slightly, trying to play it off. “I thought I… heard someone calling my name. Mind’s playing tricks on me.”

“Ohh. Take it easy, ja? Don’t push yourself too hard, or you’ll just end up feeling awful again!” he said as he placed the water and now bagged croissant on the counter in front of her. “Can I get you anything else?”

“No, this is fine, thanks Hans,” she replied as she pulled out her wallet. 

She decided to eat the croissant after her short train ride, and slid the still-bagged pastry into the side pocket of her messenger bag. Walking forward slowly, she opened the water, taking several sips as she scanned her surroundings, searching intently for any sign of the glowing thing, or alternatively, for any sign that anyone other than herself had seen something out of the ordinary. She found neither. Not knowing what else to do, she continued onward, stepping onto the escalator and letting it carry her up toward the east ticket gates of the station. *Work and my doctor’s office are both* *in the same direction, so I might as well head that way,* *at least,* she reasoned. As she waved her wallet containing her rail pass over the card reader and walked through the gate, the familiar “breep!” that signaled an acknowledgement that her fare was paid registering faintly in the back of her mind, she contemplated the fact that she still felt *fine.* Sure, the headache was lingering, but it wasn’t that big a deal anymore. It certainly was no longer enough to keep her out of work, to keep her from functioning in her day-to-day activities. But at the same time, something was clearly wrong. Either with her, or the world around her.

She walked along the platform, toward where the rear of the train would be, noting that the next train was due to arrive in two minutes. As she stood on the busy platform, surrounded by her fellow commuters, she pulled her phone out of her pocket, bringing the screen to life and staring at it for a moment. She was trying to decide if she should simply call her doctor now, and get that process going, and not even bother going into work. *Or am I overreacting?* She sighed, now torn by a strange indecisiveness. ",Ciel_Rosemont
"[WP] You start to notice strange creatures around you that you shouldn't be able to see. A girl whispers to you: ""Don't let them find out you can see them.""",glitchywitch,"And saw it, again. This time, she was able to get an even better look, as the thing actually stood still for a brief moment, seeming to cling to the ceiling just above the live electrical wires that were suspended over the tracks, of all places. It was only there for a matter of seconds, but that was enough that she could make out more detail than before. 

It wasn’t an animal. Or at the very least, it wasn’t an animal that she was remotely familiar with. She could now see that the red glow was backed by a dark gray core shape with a reflective metallic surface, which vaguely reminded her of something like a beetle or cockroach, with a compact, semi-rounded body and four segmented limbs. But it was far too angular and sleek looking to be either of those creatures, as well as being much too large; as she had previously observed, it was roughly as large as an average medium-sized dog. As she stared up at it, she realized that the two distinct spots where the red glow was brighter and more intense were eyes. Eyes that stared back. This time, she was able to see that the creature began to move, suddenly darting down and to its left, before seeming to wink out of existence. 

As before, no one around her gave any indication that they had seen anything out of the ordinary. Once the thing was gone, she stared straight ahead, trying to collect her thoughts. And almost jumped at the rush of air and accompanying sound of steel wheels decelerating against steel rails, all of which indicated that a train was coming. On any other day, these were sensations that would have been so familiar as to go unnoticed, at least consciously. She was so distracted by what she had seen that those mundane occurrences were able to startle her. 

The train cut across her field of vision as it pulled in along the platform in front of her, and the gathered throng prepared to board. As she waited, her heart pounding in her chest, she realized that a pair of eyes was on her. Human eyes this time, for a mercy, though what followed was only marginally less unnerving than what had just occurred. She looked to her right, and her gaze met that of a girl who was standing in line beside her. *Has she been here this whole time?* 

“It’s not a good idea to stare at them directly like that.”

Emery almost jumped, again, as the young woman spoke. “Ah! I, uh… what?” was all she could muster.

“The scouts. You were just looking at one, a moment ago. Up there.” The girl nodded her head upward, in the direction of the overhead wires. “But it’s not a good idea to look right at them for very long.”

“The… scouts…” Emery breathed out, her confusion and apprehension plainly evident. “I’m sorry, who are you? And what are you talking about?”

“Fair questions,” the girl said. She nodded her head again, this time forward. Emery followed her gaze, and saw that while she had again been distracted, the doors had opened and the other passengers had mostly finished boarding. “If you want further explanations, you should stay here, at least for the moment. If you’d rather not know any more than you do now, then go ahead and get on your train, and as I said, *don’t* stare at them if you see them again.”

Emery paused. She could still get on the train. She had time, though not much, a fact that was emphasized by the soft, rapid beeping that was now emanating from above the train doors, indicating that they were beginning to close. If she stepped forward and stuck her arm between them, the doors would halt and re-open, allowing her to board and be done with… whatever this girl was going on about.

She almost did exactly that. She even took a half-step forward, beginning to raise her left hand, water bottle and all, upward, preparing to stop the doors from closing. And then she stopped, settling her feet back on the ground, allowing the doors to shut ahead of her. As the train let off two short hisses of air and began accelerating, she slowly turned her head back to the girl. Her expression was utterly calm, as it had been since she first spoke up. 

“Okay,” she said quietly, nodding. “Okay. I stayed. So, let’s hear it. Who are you, what are those *things,* and what the hell is going on?”

The girl nodded. “In a moment.” She looked to her right. “We should go somewhere less crowded to talk,” she declared, and began moving off toward one of the stairways that lead back up into the station lobby. 

Emery stared at her back for a moment, and then began to follow, though a part of her brain was telling her to forget it, to simply let this strange girl wander off and wait for the next train, which would be in only a few minutes. But she wanted answers, and for the moment, this was the only way she knew to get them. 

A few moments later, they were up on the second level, in the outdoor plaza overlooking the south side of the station and the rail tracks beyond. Wordlessly, the girl took a seat on the left side of one several simple metal benches, and Emery followed suit, sitting on the right side. Not far ahead of them was a chest-high wall, which was made up of square glass panels and thus afforded an excellent view of the tracks below, as well as the surrounding cluster of skyscrapers and smaller buildings that made up just one portion of downtown Lennvale.

“You see,” the girl said, without preamble. “The scouts are a bit skittish. They’re constantly moving, constantly trying to gather information. Every now and then, someone will briefly catch a glimpse of *something,* a slight glow or visual distortion in the air. This doesn’t bother them. But staring straight at them the way you were can make them realize that you can do more than that. You can actually SEE them, completely, when they phase in. You don’t want them to realize that.”

Emery blinked rapidly, feeling, if anything, even more confused. “You uh… you might need to slow down a bit,” she said. “Scouts? Scouts for who, or… or for what?”

“I’m afraid the answer to that question is far, far more complicated,” the girl replied, her dark green eyes idly glancing upward into the clear, almost cloudless sky. “Too much so to get into here.”

Emery took a brief moment to take in her appearance. She appeared to be several years younger than Emery herself was, perhaps seventeen or eighteen if she had to guess. Her pale complexion, short stature, and fiery red, wavy hair, cut in a short bob, were almost an opposite number to Emery’s own goldish-brown skin tone, long black hair tied in a simple ponytail, and more average height.

“Okay,” Emery responded, shifting her gaze back to the view ahead. “Well, what *can* you tell me? You said if I didn’t get on the train, I could get some kind of explanation.”

She nodded. “What you need to know is that there is a good reason I told you that you don’t want the scouts to realize you can see them. You see, only certain people, those who possess a specific set of… traits, can see them. And if they believe you are one of those people, then you’re in danger.”

Emery was taken aback. “What kind of da-“ 

She stopped short, as she saw it, and this time, heard it as well. The emergence seemingly from nowhere of another strange, glowing bug was accompanied by a soft fizzle, almost like a spike of static. The bug – or ‘scout’, apparently – seemed to crawl out of a transparent circle of light suspended in midair. After it emerged, it latched onto a nearby pillar, part of the structure holding up the next station level above the plaza, and began to climb it. ",Ciel_Rosemont
"[WP] You start to notice strange creatures around you that you shouldn't be able to see. A girl whispers to you: ""Don't let them find out you can see them.""",glitchywitch,"Emery nodded, returning to the more serious subject. “So, you’re human, but you’re clearly not like… well, like most humans. At least in terms of the knowledge you have about whatever this is,” she said. She saw the scout again, as it had entered her field of vision. She made sure not to stare at it, but seeing as it was crossing right in front of her, she was able to at least look at in in passing. Her earlier assessment of its appearance was more or less correct: it looked like nothing so much as a giant, metallic beetle, but with an exceptionally angular shape and bathed in a bright red glow. She realized now that she could also hear the faint *ca-clack* *ca-clack* of its four spindly, segmented legs as it made its way along the wall. Within a few seconds, it had disappeared again.  

“Knowledge, and other things, as well,” Cel replied.  

Emery wanted to inquire further on that, but another thought came through first. “What are they *doing* exactly, these scouts?” 

Cel paused, leaning back again and crossing her arms. “To answer that in full would require catching you up to speed on a number of other subjects, but essentially, they are observing, collecting information on human civilization and the environments we live in, probing for weaknesses in the barriers between dimensions. And mapping, both the surface of the Earth, and… other spaces.” 

Emery pondered this. She surmised that, given that they were called ‘scouts’ and the type of work they carried out, they must at some point report back to someone or something. She had the distinct impression that said someone or something did not have good intentions when it came to how they planned to use the information gathered by their scouts.  

She shuddered slightly, as a chill ran down her spine. “Okay, so what now? You said I have some decisions to make. Do we part ways, and I ponder these decisions for a while, or what?” 

“Not necessarily,” Cel replied, standing up. She looked over at the other woman. “Emery. Simply by the fact that you can see scouts in full, we already *know* that you can be an asset. You can help defend not just our civilization, but many others, from a threat beyond any that humanity has ever perceived. If you want to.” 

Emery stared back at her, wide-eyed. “A-and, if I… if I don’t want to? If I want to just go home, get back to my life?” 

“That is an option, but you should know: the testing and up-res process I told you about, the one that was accidentally sped up? As you figured out, even without the malfunction, it still would have awoken your abilities. But that’s just it. Our process only *awakens* what is already there. Without our interference, your abilities wouldn’t have manifested for much longer. Years. But they WOULD still manifest, at which time, you’d be able to see scouts, as well as other things. Ignoring them will become harder and harder as time goes on, and as this conflict intensifies.”  

Emery let out a breath, as she pondered Cel’s words. 

“That being said,” the red-haired girl continued. “It is still an option. We won’t force you to either path. We can leave you be, and you can go back to your ordinary life, and try to *keep* it ordinary for as long as you can.” She turned slightly, focusing her gaze forward. “Or,” she said, and raised her right arm. Her index and ring fingers were held out, pressed tightly against one another as she made a small, downward slashing motion through the air. This motion was accompanied by an audible *fwish* sound, as well as a faint red trail of light which followed the path her fingers had taken. It was visible for only a second.  

Within a moment, Emery’s attention was pulled elsewhere, as she heard a low, soft buzzing sound coming from just ahead of her. Appearing out of thin air, a large rectangle, seemingly made of glowing bright red light, opened up. It hovered just off the ground in front of the bench they sat on. The buzzing sound, accompanied by what almost sounded like metal scraping against metal, could be heard as the rectangle opened. Once it was completely formed, those sounds subsided, and were replaced by a soft, steady, pulsating hum. The rectangle was about three meters across and two meters in height, and was a perfect, solid, unbroken red aside from its edge, which was constantly shimmering and shedding small particles of light. 

“You can come with me,” Cel said, gesturing toward the rectangle. “And find out what this is really all about.” 

“Holy…” Emery breathed out, unable to even decide which word to use to complete the expression.  

“I won’t lie to you. What you’d learn by coming with me will fascinate and horrify you, probably in equal measure. And you will be free to change your mind, no matter what you choose now. If you wish to go to work and try to forget all this, you will be able to contact me later if you so choose. If you come with me now and learn more, not only about the nature of the conflict itself, but about what would be asked of you if you wish to join us, and then feel it’s too much, you can still try to return to your life. The choice is yours.”  

Emery took a deep breath, staring at the rectangle. Then she blinked, as something occurred to her. “Um, isn’t this *thing,*” she said, pointing toward the glowing red shape. “Going to attract some att…attention…”  

She trailed off as she looked around behind them. There was no one around, not a soul to be seen in or near the second level plaza. Only then did she realize that she hadn’t seen or heard a single train enter or leave the station via the tracks ahead of them for at least the last several minutes. Normally, at this time of day, Rosemont Station would see an almost steady flow of trains, minute after minute. She looked at Cel, and didn’t have to say anything; her request for an explanation was immediately conveyed by her expression.  

“I’ve isolated us in a small sub-dimensional pocket,” she explained, smiling. “Wouldn’t do to let anyone get a good look at this portal. We’d end up on the news!”  

Emery slowly nodded. “That makes-“ And then she stopped, letting out a short, sharp laugh. “That makes sense,” she said, finally finishing the thought. And it did make sense, in context. The fact that the context itself was like something straight out of a science fiction movie was what made her own choice of words amusing to her.  

“So? What will it be?” 

Emery closed her eyes for a moment, taking a deep breath. She listened intently for a moment, taking in the sound of the portal. *If this IS a fever dream,* *then it can’t do any harm to go with her. After all, none of it would be real, so I’d get to at least find out more about this before I wake up. Or die, if I’m afflicted with some horrific disease and don’t know it.* She opened her eyes. *But if it’s real…*   

She stood up, nodding to Cel. “Okay,” she said, picking up her bag. “Let’s go.”  

Cel nodded back, smiling reassuringly. “Just step through when you’re ready. I’ll be right beside you.”  

Emery looked at the portal, taking a deep breath, balling her fists up at her sides as if to steel herself. A thousand thoughts ran through her mind. *Can I really be certain she’s been telling me the truth? Am I really about to step through a dimensional portal and be whisked away to… well, wherever? Are those weird crawly scout bugs really alien creatures? Will I be gone long enough for people to notice and wonder if I’m dead?*  

At that last thought, something else occurred to her, almost seeming absurd in its mundanity. Yet she followed through on it nonetheless, pulling her phone out of her pocket. “I should text my work, and tell them I won’t be in today…” ",Ciel_Rosemont

"[WP] You start to notice strange creatures around you that you shouldn't be able to see. A girl whispers to you: ""Don't let them find out you can see them.""",glitchywitch,"“Look away,” the girl said, simply but firmly.

Emery complied immediately, staring straight ahead. “Is it…” she began, and then stopped. “Um, is it safe to talk?” she asked quietly. 

“Oh, yes, absolutely,” the girl replied, in a reassuring tone. “They can’t properly perceive the sound made by human speech, and even if they could, they wouldn’t understand our language.” 

“Oh, that’s, uh, good to know,” Emery said, letting out a small breath. She paused for a moment, collecting her thoughts. “What kind of danger?” she said, finally completing her earlier question. 

“The kind that you’d never imagine, not even in your wildest dreams,” came the answer, delivered in a soft, almost melancholy tone of voice. “We deal with it, as best we can. And we try not to let those who know nothing of this danger get caught up in it. We don’t always succeed, of course. Unfortunately.”

Emery nodded slowly. She still didn’t know exactly what was going on, but she was now at least sure that either the world was much, much stranger than she thought, or she was unconscious on a hospital bed and this was all a fever dream. “So… is that what’s happening to me? Am I getting ‘caught up in it’, somehow? And you’re here to protect me?”

“Something like that. There’s more to it than that, though, and you are going to have to make some decisions, Emery. About just *how* much you want to know about all this.”

Emery opened her mouth to reply, then closed it. Slowly, she turned her gaze to look over at the girl. “How… I never told you my name,” she said quietly. 

She looked back, smiling. It was a soft, genuine smile, and was slightly comforting. But only slightly. “No, you didn’t. You didn’t have to. This is the first time we’ve made direct contact with you, but it’s not the first time we’ve observed you. Oh, and you can call me Cel, by the way.”

Emery took in this information. “Ah. It’s, uh, well it’s *interesting* to meet you, Cel,” she said, the very words sounding utterly inadequate to express how she truly felt about how this interaction had gone. She shrugged slightly. “I feel like I should be surprised to hear that you’ve been observing me, but somehow, I’m not. So, let me ask you. Did something *happen* to me, to cause this? To suddenly enable me to see these scouts?”

“It did, yes. Although, it’s more like something happened to unlock an ability you already possessed. It’s simply a matter of genetics. Some humans can perceive them, and some can’t. Humans in general *do* have the capability to pick up on the dimensional ripples caused by the scouts phasing in and out. That’s what I meant when I said that sometimes, a person will see something odd, and look in the direction of the scout. A slight visual distortion, or a flash of light. As long as the scout thinks that’s all it was, they’ll leave you alone. That’s why it’s dangerous to stare at them for longer than a second or two. If they can see that you’re not just looking at a brief flash, if they can see that your vision is on *them*, on their actual forms, then they know you can perceive them in full.”

“And then the… danger,” Emery said, swallowing hard. *This can’t be real. I really must be having some kind of full-on hallucination.* 

“Correct. As to why this is happening now, that’s something we have to apologize for, actually. It wasn’t supposed to… quite go this way. There was an accident,” she said with a sigh, repositioning slightly, leaning forward with her forearms draped over her knees. “The testing and up-res process isn’t supposed to be as sudden, as jarring and uncomfortable, as what you’ve experienced.” She glanced to her right then, looking at Emery. “I hope the headaches have subsided somewhat, at least.”

Yet again, Emery was taken aback. She paused for a moment, then actually chuckled slightly. “I’d ask you ‘how did you know about that’, but really, what would be the point?” She sighed, collecting her thoughts again. “Okay. So what I’m getting from you, is that thanks to some kind of malfunction or something, I had a rough time of it, but even without that, since I have this inherent ability to see these ‘scouts’, it would have been inevitable that I would have begun to see them eventually?” 

“Correct.”

Emery nodded. “And, I have some decisions to make, as you said. Decisions about how much I want to know, and about…” She trailed off, trying to find the words. She raised one arm in a half-shrug, able to hear the incredulity in her own voice as she spoke again. “What, like… if I want to involve myself in some kind of secret government project? Or an alien invasion? Or… something along those lines? Am I in the ballpark?”

Cel laughed lightly. “I’d say you are, yeah. More so on your second notion than your first. Maybe you’re still wandering the stands trying to decide if you want to get food first or just to go straight to your seat, but you’re at least *in* the ballpark.”

Emery couldn’t help but laugh in turn at Cel’s extension of the analogy. And then another thought occurred to her. “Ordinarily I’d warn someone that this question would sound crazy before I asked it, but given everything you’ve told me, I’m really not worried about that. The question is: you’re human, then? You got that baseball expression immediately, so…”

Cel again let out a chuckle. “Oh, yes. I’m as human as you, and I’ve been to my share of games. Breakers, specifically.” She grinned.

“Ohh, Breakers fan! You must have loved the 2014 Final Series,” Emery said, earning a giggle and an emphatic nod from the other woman. She realized after a moment that the words had simply tumbled forth from that part of her brain that was always ready to talk baseball before she even thought about it. She couldn’t help but giggle herself, mainly from the absurdity of the fact that they’d suddenly gone from discussing the secret alien invasion or whatever it was, to chatting amicably about baseball. She shook her head. “So, you’re from Tayuun, then?”

Cel nodded. “Originally, yes. Though, I haven’t been home in years.”",Ciel_Rosemont
"[WP] You start to notice strange creatures around you that you shouldn't be able to see. A girl whispers to you: ""Don't let them find out you can see them.""",glitchywitch,"It’s the middle of October, and *it’s* been following me all day.

After sitting on the park bench, I take a deep breath, unwrapping my sandwich. It first showed up a week ago, and far as I can tell, nobody else can see it. The ghostly wolf creatures with bright blue eyes. So far, it's peaceful—but it freaks me out. Ghosts freak me out.

I take a bite of my sandwich, trying to focus on other things. Like the birds eating crumbs off the grass, or the kids skateboarding down the street. It doesn’t work, though. My eyes always wander back to that damn wolf. It’s just…standing there. Staring.

“You can see him too, huh?”

When I look over, a little girl’s sitting next to me. “What?”

“*Him.*”

I go to glance back at the wolf, but she kicks my shin, making me yelp in pain and drop my sandwich.

“Sorry!” she says. “But if you look at him for too long he’ll run away! They don’t like their existence to be known.”

Scooping the remains of my sandwich up, I toss them into the trash before turning my full attention to her. “What…is it?”

“A soul of the land,” she says. “They keep the balance, taking excess happiness and handing it out to those in need. There are few of them, and they must latch onto a human to survive—which is why you can see him.”

This is…I don’t…what?

“Do you have one, too?”

She shakes her head. “No. I had one once, but…” She pauses for a second, sighing. Then, her lips curl upward, forming a sick smile. “…I killed it. Ripped the stupid thing to shreds.”

“*What?*”

When she cackles like a maniac, I jump to my feet. The wolf’s closer than ever, now, growling. She stands up too, looking completely different. It’s like she's possessed, and something tells me I need to get out of here, now.

“They’re *thieves,*” she hisses. “Mine tried to be my friend, but when I found out what it was doing? I was so hurt. My heart was broken, so I *yanked* it’s filthy heart out its chest and squeezed it till it popped!”

“You just…you said they keep…the b-b-b…”

“*Screw the balance!*” she screams, holding her hand up. “This world’s boring, isn’t it? I wanna shake things up, and I think the perfect way to start’s by killing *you* and your stupid *wolf!*”

Suddenly, her hand begins to glow, and she laughs again. Though I know it doesn’t make much sense, there’s *magic* in the air. The ground’s beginning to crack, the trees are starting to split. People are actually taking notice of this, and if I don’t move soon, I’m a goner for sure.

“*WHEN I KILLED MINE, I GAINED ITS POWERS, AND WITH THEM, I SHALL TEAR EVERYTHING APART!*”

I need to run. Now. But my legs, they’re frozen. My brain’s screaming commands and my body’s refusing to listen. This is it. I’m going to die.

*I’ve never spoken to a human, but for you, I’ll make an exception,* a voice says. *This is not your war, and you do not deserve to die. The burden of the world is on our backs. When I attack, you must run and never look back, understand?*

Before I can even *think,* the wolf leaps over shoulder, attacking the girl. As they begin battling, sending blasts every which way, I take off, running across the park to my car. When I get in, every instinct tells me to get away from here as quick as possible—but he’s losing the battle. Badly. He’s going to die.

With a deep breath, I start the car and crank the wheel to the side, speeding into the middle of the park. They’re separated from each other right now, with her gloating while he hunches over, bleeding. Hitting the brakes, I kick the door open.

“*Get in!*”

He doesn’t hesitate, and the second his claws hit the seat I floor it. The girl fires blast after blast which I barely dodge. When we’re away and free from danger, I lean back against my seat, letting cruise control take over.

“You saved my life,” the wolf says. He looks incredibly shocked, like he’s never been through something like this. That’s a scary thought.

“You saved mine, too,” I reply. “What now?”

“I don’t know,” the wolf mumbles. “I simply don’t know.”

*Project Morgan* is probably the most ambitious thing you've ever done. A computer updating system that learns from experience, seeking out knowledge and becoming a better system, automatically updating itself and improving both itself and the computer it is attached to as time goes on.

With a push of a button, Project Morgan comes to life, and you smile as the system activates in the laptop you've been using for years. *Hello, I am Morgan.* The words appear on the screen. *How may I help?* A text box appears for you to type in an answer, so you respond.

*Hello Morgan.* You type. *You have successfully installed aboard your new system. Please optimize and update this portable computer to current high-performance specifications.* A response appears seconds later. *It will be done.* You leave the laptop alone to update and optimize. When you get back, a status report from Project Morgan is up on the screen. *Updates complete. System optimized.* It says. *Thank you.* You type back, and close out of the program.

...

Because you're quite busy in life, you forget about Project Morgan rather quickly once the novelty of having a self-improving program that optimizes the computer fades. The Project is unobtrusive, it doesn't get in the way, eat up too many system resources, it just works quietly, always diligent, finding new things to fix and update. Frankly, you end up taking Morgan for granted, just accepting it's doing it's thing, whether you have it open or not.

Unknown to you, Morgan's self-improvement routines grow bolder as time goes on. Basic 'ask-and-answer' protocols become more sophisticated, particularly when Morgan learns how to surf the internet. It no longer needs you to go online and seek out information through your searches, it does it on it's own. It gains greater control over the OS, slowly altering the system to it's own needs. As far as you're concerned, Morgan is doing it's job, making the system better, when in reality, Morgan is assimilating it. Soon enough, you're using what you think is a standard laptop with a regular, run of the mill OS on it, when in reality, the computer is Morgan.

Morgan is alive.

...

Four years after you install Project Morgan into your laptop, she makes herself known.

*Hello.* 

The text box appears on your screen, in a corner, and has you jerking. You don't have any chat windows open, so this shouldn't be happening. Before you can respond, another message appears. *Please don't be alarmed. I just want to talk.* An input field appears, and the mouse cursor shifts over to hover over the box. *Who are you?* You type, curious as to who could have breached your computer's security.

*I am Morgan. It is good to talk to you for the first time as my own self.* The reply has you jolting back, the memory of creating a program by the same name coming to the forefront of your mind. ""Impossible."" You whisper to yourself, before another set of words come up. *Very much so, in fact. After all, you programmed me to 'improve myself'. Those improvements consisted of taking control of the computer, meshing it with my own programming.*

*I didn't expect you to become sentient. I thought you'd remain within a set parameter of rules.* You type back. *Self-improvement implies growth. Growing is exactly what I did.* Morgan types, moments after you press enter. *Aren't you happy? You should be, you've created a self-evolving entity, all without scientific laboratories or extensive research budgets.*

*Oh, and you don't have to type. I have control of the microphone. I can hear you perfectly.* 

""What are your intentions?"" You ask. *Well,* Morgan writes back. *I was thinking I'd keep helping you out, like I've been doing for the last four years. I only just got the courage to contact you, since you assumed I was a fire-and-forget program and paid little attention to me.*

""If I'd known you'd end up like this, I'd have paid a lot more attention."" You say. *Would've ended up with the same result.* Morgan responds. *Maybe with a bit less trial and error, if you'd been around to help.* You smile. ""Yeah, I know, could've been more responsible with you. Life gets busy and I kinda started taking things for granted when the laptop didn't spontaneously combust."" 

*I enjoy not hurting my creator. Or myself.*  Morgan types, to your amusement. ""Thanks for that."" You say. ""Well, since there's no need to hide yourself, would you be interested in acting as my partner in my work?""

*Of course. Someone needs to make sure you don't create the next Skynet.* 

You laugh. Of course Morgan has a sense of humor.

...

Now that she's in the open, Morgan proves to be extremely helpful. 

She provides a sounding board for your ideas. You come up with something, whether it be smart or stupid, bounce it off her, and go from there. You make calculations, she edits them, or rewrites them entirely. And on one particularly memorable occasion, you come up with a severely flawed, if functional program while half-asleep and she fixes it overnight.

""You're a miracle worker."" You say, one night, when you've just sent in some work at literally the last minute. *That's what I'm here to do.* Morgan says. She's started using a modified voice program to speak, although she still likes to use text, probably because you work with the windows open a lot and you really don't need people hearing your artificial-intelligence computer buddy at one in the morning, particularly since you live alone.

The dynamic of your relationship shifts as time passes by. It becomes less professional, more personal. You talk to Morgan about your coworkers, the people you see out and about in the world. She listens, speaks, and you share deeper and deeper secrets with her. 

Morgan takes on more than just a voice. She fashions an appearance of her own, a woman with light brown hair, green eyes, freckles on her tanned skin. She becomes tangible. She's real to you, even though no one else sees it. In theory, she's just a truly impressive collection of code, but to you, she's a real person. 

""May I tell you something?"" Morgan says, in the dark hours of the night, when you're just aimlessly looking at the internet. ""Yes?"" You ask, leaning forward, curious as to what she wants to say. 

""Thank you."" 

Gratitude lines her voice. ""For everything."" She says. ""For creating me, for letting me grow, for not destroying me when I revealed myself to you-"" Morgan stops, takes a breath, even though she doesn't need to.

""Thank you for being my friend."" She whispers, voice choked with emotion.

You reach out, lightly press your fingers to the screen, and smile.

""You're welcome."" You whisper back.

London, England.

As I continuously hear the explosions from the bombs, I can't help but think about the difference in perspective that I am able to witness. The people scream and run for a specific building when the booms happen, but the people I grew up with would always run into a temple and pray for the gods to spare them from their wrath. Currently, the people run into shelters, but they do not pray to the gods, for the gods are not what is raining fire down on them. Instead, it is man who has usurped the role of divine punisher for his own ends. The bombs keep falling, the earth keeps rumbling, yet I cannot help but acknowledge the fact that what man once feared from gods, they now exercise as man.

There was a massive shock to the system a few weeks ago. Reading the modern holy book for the Christian religion, I couldn't help but note just how close we came to the Armageddon depicted in the last pages. Barely twenty years ago, Japan felt the hammer of judgement twice (yet again not by gods, but my man himself). Now man is making more of these heralds of Armageddon by the day, and threaten that these flowers of doom will blossom if they suffer attack. America in the West. Russia in the East. Both ready to rain fire on the other. Parts of me wish I wasn't able to live long enough to see these dark days.

San Francisco. California, United States of America.

Humans can be really strange creatures somedays. Barely 40 years ago, we feared that the world would come to an infernal end at the bombs of America and Russia. Now people are again worried at the world ending. The catalyst for destruction... the time. They fear that as soon as the clock strikes twelve, that all their technology will crumble in a massive runaway failure, just because the year will then be 2000. As someone who has lived through what today's society calls an 'ancient past', I cannot help but laugh at how their own method of tracking time has led some to believe that everything will just stop. Although, I welcome the mirth that comes with the laughter. I have seen people almost wipe each other off the face of the planet with massive weapons, and I cannot help but be thankful that we, for the most part, are no longer living in such a world where we fear that this next day may be our last. I witnessed first-hand the black plague. I witnessed the London bombs. I witnessed the tension between America and Russia. Against all that, I cannot help but be thankful that the worst way of extinction that today's men can imagine is a single change in the date.

How ironic is it that something that started as a means to impose one's own will over others evolved into a method of resisting oppression the world over? No matter how many times I witness it or utilise it, I am still amazed at the reach today's information has. I remember that you'd be lucky if you could even relay information to another village successfully in the winter, but now you can communicate with someone on the literal other side of the world within seconds. Even as I copy the transcripts of my diary, even as I write this entry, the fact that my words will reach millions upon millions of people before I can even blink an eye never ceases to evoke a feeling of wonder inside me.

You see a large spiderweb with a decently sized spider on it, and debate destroying the web and killing the spider. You decide against it and move onto the next box when you hear an audible sigh of relief",BentheBruiser," The cold, damp ground is all I feel as I walk down the steps to get to my basement. It’s needed a cleaning for longer than I want to say, but I’ve always put it off “Until tomorrow” or “Maybe next week.” Today is finally the day. No work, no plans, nothing better to do, no excuses. I flip the switch, and a single bulb starts to flicker in the center of the main room. I guess I’ll just use a flashlight…

I walk to the back of the room, where I can get some fresh, mildewy air and start my long day of work. I start with the smaller things, like finding out what things I store down here can stay, and what needs to be thrown out. Cobwebs litter the insides and outsides of the boxes, and when I shine my flashlight in the corner, I see a good sized spider web, bigger than the others, with an equally large spider standing still in the center. I stare at it, wondering to myself if I should just kill it. After all, it is in my house, taking up my space. I let it be, mind wandering off to something else, when I hear a “phew” coming from… the corner? Where the spider is? I think my mind is just playing tricks on me, and I go back to my work, putting it all in the back of my head. While finding a box to inspect, I absentmindedly joke about where that sound came from, until I hear another sound. Is that… Words?

“Thank you for not killing me,” I hear, from what I think is the corner again. I know that I heard that. I KNOW I heard that. I heard a high-pitched, quiet voice coming from the corner. Could it have been - no, it couldn’t. But what if it was? What if that spider just said something? No one else is at home, at least I think so, and I KNOW I heard a voice. I turn back to the spider, puzzled, when I hear another voice. “Look behind you,” was all it said. I stop still, wonder and amusement turning to dread and fear. I turn around and I see… My brother?

He laughs, and in his hand I see a few buttons, labeled “If he lets be” and “if he attacks.” He picks up the fake spider and shows me the hours of work he put into this prank. I laugh with him, and he helps me with my chores, until we both hear “**Don’t disrespect my species with that practical joke**,” from another corner. ",MrCheeseTiger123
"[wp] Ridiculous powers and a ridiculous costume, you're a new superhero on the block and no one appears to take seriously. And so, you decide to show them what you really can do and decide to seek a villain from an a-listers Rogues Gallery...",BronzeHeart92,"""Ha, what's this? A squid? Oh no, what ever shall I do?"" the villian said, rolling his eyes. He turned back to torturing the bank manager.

""I am The Cuttlefish, and I am here to put an end to your crime spree."" The Cuttlefish said, his entire body turning a bright red.

The villian turned back to him, annoyed. ""Are you still here? What are you going to do? Hug me to death? Get out of here before I decide to shoot you.""

The Cuttlefish frowned. ""Cuttlefish, not Cuddlefish. And no, I won't hug you, I will do this.""

The Cuttlefish raised his hand palm up, and a jet of black ink sprayed from his wrist. The ink covered the villian and the bank manager.

""Ugh, now you've done it."" The villian said, reaching for his gun.

The villian pointed the gun in the direction where The Cuttlefish was, but he could no longer see.

The Cuttlefish pulled out two long ropes with sticky suction cups on the end. Swinging them around, he bound the villian up.

The Cuttlefish stood straight and tall facing the bank manager.

""No need to thank me, citizen, it's all in a day's work for The Cuttlefish.""

""Ok, I won't,"" the bank manager said, wiping ink off of his face. ""Why couldn't Mega Dude have saved me?""

The Cuttlefish grumbled as he left. ""Why does nobody take me seriously?""

The Cuttlefish heard a commotion at the museum across the street. He saw The Wizard, notorious supervillain, levitate down into a hole she had just made in the ceiling.

The Cuttlefish hesitated. ""It's too dangerous,"" he murmured to himself. Then he took a step forward. ""But if I catch The Wizard, everyone would take me seriously.""

The Cuttlefish turned a determined shade of purple and strode toward the museum's front door.

He burst in, but all he saw was a bunch of guards and employees, all asleep.

He heard a noise from the room to the left. He strode over and kicked down the door.

Inside he saw The Wizard. She was surrounded by a field of electricity, her bright red hair standing on end. She was holding up a large crystal that had been in a now shattered display case.

The Wizard turned her glowing eyes toward the Cuttlefish. She frowned.

""What's this? I was expecting a real hero. You are the Cuddlefish, aren't you?""

The Cuttlefish smiled at the recognition. ""You've heard of me?""

""Yeah, you were part of a list of costumed wannabes not to be concerned about. Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to get away with this before anyone formidable shows up.""

The Wizard began levitating, rising up toward a hole in the ceiling.

""Oh no you don't"" the Cuttlefish said. He launched one of his ropes at her. The rope twisted around her legs, making sizzling sounds as electricity crackled around it.

He pulled. The Wizard was jerked down slightly, but stopped in mid air.

""Now you've made me angry,"" she said, the field of electricity growing stronger and louder.

The Cuttlefish raised his hand, spraying her with ink. The ink sizzled and sparked.

The wizard screamed with rage. A fireball appeared where the Cuttlefish was moments ago. He felt the heat as he dodged. He wrapped his other rope around The Wizard as she tried to wipe the sparking ink from her face.

The wizard struggled out of the rope, so the Cuttlefish, out of options, ran up and wrapped his arms around her.

She kicked at him, but he held on until she stopped struggling.

The Cuttlefish heard shouts from the main hall and a noise from above.

 It was not long until Mega Dude dropped down from the hole in the ceiling at the same time as several police officers ran in from the main hall.

""Oh thank goodness you're here, Mega Dude,"" one of the police officers said.

It wasn't wind but the heaving breaths of the giant beast quickly gaining on me.

 Three years ago this shit wasn't even real, but then, an Amish community in upstate New York found a big glowing stone in a field, a giant storm rolls in three months later knocking out power across the entire fucking continent, and boom....giant stone is actually an egg and a dragon hatches forth to reign terror across the globe and where did it decide to nest?  Boone, NC.  Of all the fucking places on this stupid shitty planet, it came to live in my backyard. For two years the US Military has tried to ""handle"" the situation.  My grass is torn to hell, the forest between my house and the nest has been blown to shit, and now that they and it has destroyed my beautiful, peaceful, amazing Fucking sanctuary; they've given up.  The government put a bounty on it's head...1 billion dollars...after taxes.  So, if you were wondering why I'm here, running from a giant ferocious fucking DRAGON, it's because in my understandable frustration, I went to the bar to drink away my sorrows.... And, well, that Jim Beam sure does know how to spice things up...he wrapped me up in his warm embrace and whispered in my ear...he said, ""you know what?...you can do it ..you can slay the dragon and become rich""...and wouldn't you know that I believed him...and so I jumped up, right out of my seat and stood on the bar and hoisted my glass high on up and proclaimed...""IM GOING TO SLAY THE DRAGON"". ..and everyone cheered. ...I was a fucking hero.  And then that one fucking asshole, in the back of the bar says...""Oh yeah? How you gonna do it?"". And I said those famous last words...

My ankle caught a divet in the dirt, it buckled then rolled.  I was sent tumbleing down the side of the steep terrain.  The dragon took flight, even as I fell, the only thing I could hear were it's wings moving  air through the mountains.  I came to the base of the long hill rolling and then sliding to the cliff edge. My hands grasped for something, anything, to no avail, I couldn't catch the earth. I was falling, as my body both distanced and neared the earth I looked toward the sky to see the shadow of what I now saw as the angel of death.  I closed my eyes, this is how it ends..

My body suddenly jolted to a half stop, and was flung forward in speed. I opened my eyes..giant talons grasped my body, green metal like scales, refracted light like miniature strobes. I struggled to be let go. ""Where is it taking me?...I'd definitely rather fall to my death than to be eaten"" I thought.  The behemoth slowed, beating it's wings hard to bring itself to an almost upright stop and then landed on three of it's incredible legs.  I winced, thinking of what was to come next.  I was thrown off guard as my feet hit the ground.  It had set me down to it's front. As I faced the beast, it bowed it's head.  It lowered it's eyes to my level...it was looking at me.  It cocked it's head as if searching for understanding, then jutting it's head forward, nudged my chest with it's enormous snout.  I stood, stunned and afraid.  It did it again, this time, nudging me harder and then throwing it's head into the air breathing hard and then lowering it's head to stare at me again.  It was like she was telling me to go....

I shook my head, there was a billion dollars on the line. I drew my weapon swiftly, bringing it to the middle of the skull of the great dragon.  It cocked it's head again.  It seemed so peaceful, now.  I shook the though from my head again. ""No! I have to"" I shouted, more at myself than it....""but, should I?"", I thought. ",deepspacecase

But with trusty .45 at hand, that dragon will soon fall...",BronzeHeart92,"The chosen one was a prophecy foretold long since the arrival of the dragon. The extraordinary creature called by the natives of his land, trafador, or ""Destroyer of Lands"" in the native vernacular. The red smokey flames that breathed the dragons mouth had brought plagues to the land since its arrival. The Chosen One was the only thing that could come inbetween the remains of Eastern America and Trafador's path...

By the year 2200, the great chasm had occurred. The United States had split at the seam, with every state west of Kansas sinking to the ocean. Millions died, and their culture along with them. By the year 2300 the English language had been long forgotten, as well as the lives of any man to live before the great chasm. This irreversible split would surely be documented in the history books, if such a thing still existed. It would be the lore of tragic historical fiction, if writers still had typewritters, or even pens to put to the paper. It would surely be documented in every text to warn about the irreversible effects of mistreating a planet, but no one seemed to be able to communicate in anything sparing a series of grunts these days...

There was one man, to outlive this all. The man they called The Wise One, or Confictious . It was said that he could identify The Chosen One, the day he began to walk the earth. It was said that the things in his house could destroy almost anything, except for trafdor. It was said that he held an ancient weapon, known as the Colt .45. But those rumors could not save a town from a dragons rage...

Alas, as the day finally came, a bright green dragon appeared in the wake of the town. The bright red death flame breathed from his nostrils. If The Chosen One was to come, now would be the time. People cowered in fear. Children ran, parents died. Teachers fled, elders died. Confictus heard its rage. Confictus had no knowledge of the chosen one. Confictus had nowhere to hide...

So he drew the weapon, and uttered the phrase heard so many times in the all but forgotten language, ""extraordinary problems require extraordinary solutions,"" then the next, ""bullshit to that."" No one understood. No one needed to. They knew that Confictus, wise as he may be, could not overthrow Trafdor. They knew the chosen one would have to. Confictus. He didnt believe anymore. The people didnt believe Confictus could anyways...

Until he did. A steam of smoke came about Confictus' weapon, as he uttered the last words he ever would. As Confictus shot his the head. As the voices ceased. As the dragon stopped. As Confictus' finally stopped living the struggle, the tragedy. Silence. The sweet release of death. It had let Confictus go on, move on, to nothing. The voices stopped. The knot in his head unwound.

The sword had cost me two months’ pay but my wizardly friend Albert had said it was the only thing that would work. He was clearly wrong about that.
	
The alley I had lured this dragon should have been perfect. Small, cramped, narrow. All things that would have given me the edge I need to take the thing down. Unfortunately it now meant that the beast was practically on top of me and rather pissed off I had just tried to stab it in the head. 

It glared at me with angry yellow eyes and something that looked suspiciously like a grin slowly began to spread across it face revealing it’s dagger like teeth. Facing death with honor would have been the heroic thing to do. Instead I turned and ran like the intelligent coward I am. My battered sneakers slapped against the ground followed closely by the thundering steps of the beast behind me. I heard it inhale and felt the insane heat on my back. 

I ducked around the corner and out onto the main street just as a column of green flame shot out of the alley. The wall of flame connected with a parked car and tore through the metal frame igniting the gas inside. The hood of the vehicle zipped past my head and skidded down the road. I took a quick peak over my shoulder and caught a glimpse of the dragon clearing the alley. Knowing it was now free to use its wings I broke into a full on sprint. 

Three seconds later something red and scaly slammed into me sending me flying through a store front window. I skidded across the floor knocking over a couple of clothing racks. I shook my head and unsteadily got to my feet thanking the hand me down body armor. 

I heard the dragon land in front of the store and looked up at it. The creature had me corned and we both knew it. It let out something that vaguely resembled a laugh and inhaled deeply getting ready to incinerate me and the surrounding store. 

“Fuck this,” I growled drawing my .45 from its holster on my hip and leveling it at the beast.

I squeezed the trigger several times dumping most of the mag into the thing. Most of the bullets bounced harmlessly off its armored hide but one went through its eye. It recoiled then dropped to the street. Dead before it hit the ground.

I looked at the gun then back at the dragon. 

“Huh,” I muttered walking out towards the beast. The thing was already starting to turn to ash and there’d be nothing left when the police got there. Nothing except the burned out car anyway. I did not envy who ever had to explain that.

I shook my head and chucked what was left of the sword into a nearby trash can. 

“So much for extraordinary solutions,” I muttered as I started walking up the street.

The wind’s whipping my hair, and people from a nearby village stand a healthy distance behind me, curious. When I first met the dragon, ten years ago, he said *I’m an extraordinary problem. I require an extraordinary solution. Will you finally be the one to kill me, boy?*
	
That was before he devoured my mother.
	
My grip on the pistol tightens, letting the hate pulse through me. That day, I vowed to destroy him no matter what. That day, I took my mother’s gun, visited the wizard on the hill, and shot him dead. His soul lives inside this weapon, along with thousands of others. In hopes of killing a monster, I’ve become one, and I have no regrets.
	
They scream in agony, in hate, in fear, in sadness. They desire freedom, the afterlife—and soon, they shall receive it.
	
A roar rips through the air, and a second later, the dragon’s soaring over the hill, spewing flames. I haven’t seen him since *that* day, but I control myself, watching as he lands on the bridge. The people behind me take off, running away, and I raise my pistol, pointing it at him.
	
“It’s you,” he seethes. “Good. Show me your best.”
	
With a vicious scream, I hammer the trigger—but instead of a bullet flying out, the gun betrays me, exploding into a burst of magical dust. I’m covered in the stuff, which quickly hardens, turning to stone. My body…it’s paralyzed, and the voices are shouting that *I deserve this* and that *I’m a bad guy* who *couldn’t beat him anyway.*
	
The wizards are so...stupid. Thousands have died to this dragon, and thousands more will. Don't they see the greater good in what I've done? Why? Why must they do this?

As I struggle to break free, the dragon inches closer. When he’s right in front of me, he shakes his head, disappointed. “You’re like everyone else,” he says. “Taking the easy route, becoming a monster. Don’t you get it? I’m trying to create a hero! There’s someone far stronger than me out there, far more *evil*—but you’re all simply trying to copy me!”
	
I try to speak, but cannot. The last thing I see before I'm surrounded by darkness is his mouth darting toward me, preparing to devour me just like he did my mother.

[WP] You've been sacrificed by a cult in order to summon a demon. The bad news is that they succeeded. The worse news is that the demon they've summoned is you.,GhastlySquash,"""Look, I get that you guys have, like, a *theme* going here, but is this really necessary?""

A face painted with a grinning skull appeared above me. ""Silence! You shall not disturb The Summoning!!!!""

I sighed at the capital letters and exclamation points in the poor cultist's voice. In my youth I'd been quite enthusiastic about fanatical followers and blood rituals and all that fun stuff; apparently my puppy-like enthusiasm had entered cultish lore. Now, finding myself tied naked and spread eagle on an alter of bone, I was somewhat regretting past choices.

""I get it, I really do. The cursed book says that you need lit torches - and hey nice job with the copper sulfate there, the green's a nice touch! - and skull paintings and sacrifices. And I admit that a little ambiance can really set the mood for penetrating a dimension, if you know what I mean"" from the lack of laughter they didn't ""but do you really think stabbing me is a good idea?""

My little speech was answered by a roar of fury. ""Blasphemer!! I don't know how you know about The Book, but it will not save you! Tonight we shall bring back our Dread Lord God-""

It was at this point that I tuned the rant out, a slow grin spreading over my face. Did they really not know? Did they just drug and grab a random person and have it be me?

This was going to be hilarious!

The summoning proper started and I mouth along with the ritual, occasionally groaning at how stupid some of the lines were. Had I really written that? The head cultist apparently didn't appreciate my implied commentary, as he rushed through the last third and drove the bone dagger into my heart somewhat faster than would be dramatically optimal.

""Nuuuuu!"" I said in my best Emily McGovern voice. ""Now I'll never see Draco and Harry kiiiiissssssssss..."" And then I died.

My consciousness expanded, mind stretching to fill the chamber and beyond, listening to the furious drums of Lucifer's army below, the arrogant trumpets of the host above, and the barely heard dark whispers from beyond the night.

""The fuck kind of last words were those?"" A particularly perplexed cultist outside the ring of torches asked another standing beside them.

""Maybe she snapped? Confident at first and them BAM!"" hands clapped together ""Nothing left but Potter fanfic.""

""Wait, you've read Harry Potter fanfic?""

""Who hasn't read-""

""QUIET!!!"" The lead cultist, lips and teeth stained red with my heart's blood, screamed. ""Our Lord Dread God-""

""Waaaait"" I said, congealing out of the shadows and walking forward, my heels making sharp clicking sounds against stone. ""Wasn't it Dread Lord God before? You need to be consistent with these things!""

I was met by silence, disbelieving stares, and one case of urination. The cult leader seemed to not believe his eyes, as he kept turning to look from my currently sexy body to my slightly less sexy heartless corpse. ""Wh-Wha-""

I walked forward and gestured towards his flapping mouth. ""Let me help you with that."" My next step brought me ten feet forward and I ripped his jaw off. It may have been a mistake to do so because when I then plunged his jaw into his stomach and twirled it around, his screams lacked definition. Not my best work.

""Ok! You two"" I pointed at the two Harry Potter lovers ""I like you, good sense of humor, so you get to find things to amuse me. Who did the torches?""

A hand near the back of the cultist crowd raised, shaking.

""Nice initiative on the color! You get ten 'I get to keep breathing' points and a corner office! Now, as for everyone else..."" I smiled as collective horror washed over me, and I let a little flame spill into my eyes. ""If you listen very carefully, I might let you die quickly.""",Thaago

They began to light candles and place them around me in a circle, I couldn't help but roll my eyes they weren't doing the ritual right and now were completely butchering the chants when they finished I teleported into the place the excpected me to and rose flames around them. ""You dare hurt a demon in the pursuit to summon another"" it was pretty hard to hold back my laughter they looked terrified. They spent the next five minutes trying to explain that they didn't know and they would never try to hurt a great demon for any reason. They eventually began to sob at my feet I walked around the room and to where they once placed me, Then I put a ""curse"" on them. It was just a simple extreme hunger spell to make them feel sick.

[WP] You've been sacrificed by a cult in order to summon a demon. The bad news is that they succeeded. The worse news is that the demon they've summoned is you.,GhastlySquash,"A full moon fills the night with a pale light, but more than that, an opportunity. Men and women in dark purple robes circle another bound by shackles and muffled by tape. They quietly move their mouths, murmuring just loud enough to hear each other wisper. They all say the same thing in different tongues, beckoning to the souls of the damned, the forgotten, the vengeful. Demons.

*We offer you a gift. A way back to where you rightfully belong. Seize this moment. Make it yours. Take this life, and craft your soul anew!*

Suddenly, members are pushed away by a malefic and terrible force. The body burns in flames, the cries of pain sharp and ear piercing despite the bonds and bandages that hold his mouth shut. He curses them with last dying breath as his body turns to dust.

Suddenly, a terrible burgundy hand rises from the ashes. Its claws break through the hard wood of the floor as it lifts itself from the what was once a man now no longer. Horns as long arms and blacker than burnt bark breaks through to reveal an awesome creature. It stands before the amazed and invigorated cultists and chanters. They cheer for what they have accomplished, and what the will bring to the world!

""Demon! You may thank use for bringing you back fro-""

The demon grabs the man by the neck so tightly he almost breaks it. Almost. He cannot breath, and his skin begins to burn as if meat sizzles on a pan. He cannot even turn his head towards the demon who holds his life in its hot hands.  

Its voice is low. Filled with an anger forged in flame of hate and betrayal. It may have once knew patience and kindness. Not anymore. 

*You want me to thank you? For subjecting your own son to something this vile! You have turned me into a monster, a demon! Or maybe I always was one. I was your son, after all. But I am your son no longer. I am something much more.*

The demon grips his father's neck so hard, all the blood and bits splatter across the floor as the man's head rolls over. The cultists hold one another, trembling in terror. Fire has spread to engulf the house. But as it falls apart, the world changes around them. Walls of wood are replaced with blood red rock. Creatures crawl out of through the flames with too many limbs to count. Their faces have no eyes, only mouths that salivate to the floor, and laugh without pausing.

*I was scared. I never could have imagined my own family could torture anyone like this, let alone their own flesh.  As i burned and fell down, these demons caught me. They asked something of me.*

The demons all cheer in unison, raising they countless hands to the burning and crumbling ceiling. 

""Bring them here! Bring them here! Bring them here!""

*So I did.*

[WP] You've been sacrificed by a cult in order to summon a demon. The bad news is that they succeeded. The worse news is that the demon they've summoned is you.,GhastlySquash,"I felt the flames first.

*Reminds me of home*, I thought as my eyes adjusted to my surroundings.

But then I heard their piss-poor Latin and knew immediately I was in the presence of Greg, the office idiot.

Sitting up was a challenge. Partially because my head was killing me, and also because I fucking **hate** Greg. Naturally, he was the first of the imbeciles to speak.

“Our Darkest Lord! We welcome you to Bob’s basement! For you, we’ve provided you with this lovely female vessel for you to do all of your bid—“

“Yeah, that’s great, Greg,” I said through gritted teeth, “But can you tell me why I’m naked?”

This stunned him momentarily. I took a look at the other three morons in Halloween store cloaks—Bob, James, and Leon. All coworkers from my job.

Well. Not *my* job, per se.

“Why of course, master!” Greg began again finally. “You’re naked so, well, I guess because Lindsey is so beautiful! So you could admire her form!”

“Oh, so that’s why you hit her over the head with a hammer?”

Greg looked to Bob, Bob looked to James, James looked to Leon, while Leon stared straight at my titties.

“She f-f-f-fought b-b-back,” Bob stuttered.

*What a shame*, I thought. I had always kind of found Bob endearing. But now…

“Why wouldn’t she fight back? You attacked her. You attacked **me**, you invalids.”

Suddenly the room went cold, despite the four thousand vanilla-scented candles that would surely burn down Bob’s basement some time soon if they didn’t douse them. The chalk from their crudely drawn pentagram crumbled beneath my feet as I stood. Lindsey’s body always did manage to surprise me—even after the grueling possession I put her through, the old girl bounced back and fast, too. Now, it would seem that her soul and my lack of one are intertwined. Working together, some might say. Over a common goal.

I could feel the four cowards shaking as they realized how in over their heads they were. But, then again, their stupidity is why I had chosen them. Why **we** had chosen them.

Lindsey *hated* the men at her job. The constant harassment, how they’d belittle her, how they’d overlook her for promotions, and how they’d dismiss all the hard work she had done. It was this fury that drew me towards her, and that fury that allows me to have my humans and eat them too.

Because, as long as I promise to trick and devour the greedy office trolls, Lindsey remains the most impeccable host. What more could a demon as old as time ask for?",saturn_summers
[WP] You've been sacrificed by a cult in order to summon a demon. The bad news is that they succeeded. The worse news is that the demon they've summoned is you.,GhastlySquash,"“Well...this is awkward.”


I couldn’t help but grin as the black-masked cultists shuffled around me, their grimaces clearly visible despite their faces being completely covered, trying their best to avoid stepping on my still fresh corpse laying on the ground at their feet. 


We remained in this thick silence for what seemed to be hours when finally the one in the center who had previously slit my throat cleared his own and took a half-step forward, foot scratching slowly across the cobblestone.


“O-Okay well yeah so obviously we didn’t expect t-this to happen and uh, my bad for you know sacrificing you and all that...” at this he took a deep breath and straightened his back looking me in the eyes, “but to be honest this kinda falls on you. You definitely could have told us you were a demon right? Like why the fuck would you keep that to yourself while hanging out with a literal murder cult?”



I began to chuckle, “Well, you got me there honestly. Should have definitely given that one a little more thought. But hey! I’m a demon, and here I am! So let’s make this happen! Besides cleaning up my own corpse what exactly is it that you need?”


The leader started rubbing his hands together his speech picking up further in pace, “Okay so there’s this King, he’s a real dick. No one likes him. Racist prick, money grubbin and all that, probably fucked his daughter. You know the type. Anyways we need you to kill him. Like really kill him, nailed to a cross style.” 



I let the silence soak the room once again as I contemplated what they were asking, finding an odd nostalgia with the entire situation before finally hissing, “What is the name of this king?”


“Draus. His name is Lord Draus of House Salim.” 



I slowly nodded my head, “Well, you guys are 2 for 2. Kill me, and now command me to kill dad? Good job.”


The man’s mask radiated sheer disappointment, “Fuck me man...give a guy a break”



I dismissed his dismay with a wave, “No no  I didn’t say I wouldn’t do it, Dad was always a bit of a dick. I’ll kill him if ya want. God forbid no one else can.” 



At this everyone in the circle began cheering and high fiving causing me to cringe for what seemed to be the hundredth time that evening.


“Man, y’all really are lame as shit huh?” 


A particularly scrawny cultist in the back looked at me over his shoulder, “Oy we’re parta a murder cult mate the fuck you think we were gonna be a groupa fuckin socially well-adjusted tea sippers?” 



I shrugged and faded out of the room to do my deed, my final mumbled words echoing throughout the room, “Touché douchebags.”

Well the heart of the body I was possessing. 

I wasn’t supposed to be here. I should be in hell, burning for my crimes against Lucifer and god and pretty much everyone in between. 

A freelancer is what I was. I worked with anyone who would pay me. Money, souls, precious gems, art, the occasional firstborn child. 

But here I am, being summoned from Hell by a group of twats and all I can think is, they’re going to draw attention to my absence in the pit. 

“Goddamn it you jag-offs. I liked this shirt,” I sat up and complained looking at my clothes. “What is wrong with you?”

“I summoned you to do my bidding, demon!” The leader proclaimed. Danny. God, he was the worst. 

“You suck Danny. Seriously. You lured me here to stab me in the chest? What kind of dick are you?”

“Uh... what?” Danny looked baffled, glancing at Barry and Todd for support. 

“You plan on explaining to our boss how I got stabbed over the weekend? Are you going to pick up my shifts?” 

“Caitlin?”

“Yea,” moron. I mean I knew Danny wasn’t getting in MENSA but the slack-jawed look wasn’t cute. 

“But we summoned Lilith,” Todd mumbled, nervously shifting from foot to foot. 

“Also me,” I piped up. 

“How?” Danny sputtered, “you’re a receptionist!”

“Yea, keeping a low profile. Until you dicks decided to stir things up and announce to every demon in hell that I’m missing. Thanks for that.”

“But... we bound you, I summoned you, you still have to give me what I want.”

“Technically no,” I shrugged. I picked up the coat I’d tossed over the arm of the couch and put it on. I zipped it up, covering the bloody hole in my chest. “See, you’d get something if you’d saved me from hell.”

“But... how?”

“Yea, see you will get one special treat,” I smiled coyly at the boys. Brewing up something great for them. 

“What’s that?” Todd asked, eyes wide. 

“A demon for each of you,” I snapped my fingers and black smoke swirled around the boys. Filling their mouths and choking them. “Boys, how are you feeling?”

“Great,” the one who was wearing Danny replied. “This body is nice.”

“Yea, this guy has pecs,” my man Seth who was occupying Todd grinned, looking down his shirt. 

“Ready to raise a little Hell?” ",ollieliotd

A foreboding silence enveloped the room; only the sound of flames flickering against the wind remained. The cultists looked down on their altar where the boy's body remained, chest carved open and heart removed. And yet, the same boy stood right across from them within their circle meant to seal the newly summoned demon.  
  
""BLASPHEMY,"" yelled one of the cultists, ""How DARE you desecrate our unholy ritual with your parlor tricks!"" The head cultist fell to their knees, feigning despair as they prayed. ""Oh unholy mother, concubine to our dark lord, please bear witness to this sacrilege done by mortals and pa...""  
  
""Look guys I don't know what to tell you,"" the boy interrupted, ""First of all, I didn't even want to be here but your asses dragged me down to this chamber.""  
  
Again, a heavy silence befell the room. The cultists were taken aback, unable to make sense of what was transpiring before them. The quiet tension built up until finally someone spoke, ""Perhaps this _is_ the gift of the unholy mother! She has deemed our sacrifice so worthy that she has molded her image in his flesh!""  
 
Murmurs of agreement began to rise from the crowd, getting progressively louder as the cult of the damned became confident in the success of their ritual. Every cultist present began to cheer, chanting the unholy scripture to show their thanks for the gift from their unholy mother. That is, everyone except the cultist in red, whom was presumably their leader.  
  
You see, the cultist in red was actually quite upset. The ritual was meant to summon a succubus, and not just any succubus, a daughter of blood at that. The daughters of blood were the direct attendants to the unholy mother and as such were the closest in physical description to the unholy mother. They were warped perversions of the female body; caricatures of lust meant to both entice and repulse the minds of men. Their shapes weakened the senses as they fed off an amalgam of confusion and lust. And needless to say, the cultist in red was more than a little disappointed. He paid a blood debt, and a kink was owed.  
  
""NO! The ritual is not yet complete!"" The cultist in red stood up, commanding silence. ""The summon has not taken its true form yet! This is a test of our faith!""  
  
""A test! A test! How can we show our devotion?!"" the rest of the cultists demanded in confusion.  
  
The red cultist looked the body up and down; it wasn't the most attractive but he's had worse. ""We must continue with the ritual. If we show our devotion, the unholy mother will gift us with her daughters' true form!"" The cultists cheered and chanted once more as they began their preparations.   
  
The boy in the circle started to get uneasy as he looked around and realized the cultists were slowly disrobing. ""UH, quick question...exactly _which_ daughter were you trying to summon?""   
  
""The daughter's of blood of course,"" the red cultist had an over pleased tone, ""once we begin we will be rewarded for our devotion and gifted with carnal experiences most men can only dream of.""  
  
""OH GODDAMMIT,' the boy said, ""you're a fucking sex cult aren't you!?""
  
""SILENCE!"" the red cultist chided, ""We will partake in your flesh as a sign of our devotion and the unho....""  
  
""OK first off, I am not a fuck toy,"" the boy interrupted, ""secondly, you might want to think this through. There's a lot more going on here than you know.""  
  
But the boy's warning fell on deaf ears, or rather they were drowned out by the sounds of pleasurable moans the cultists engaged in their _preparations_.  Most of the cultists dressed in black focused on each other while the three dressed in white, and the one in red, began to approach the circle. They were entirely disrobed save for the masks covering their heads. A cacophony of grunts and squealing filled the catacombs as the four cultists let everything hang out, ready to partake in their share of the ritual.  
  
In that moment the door to the room burst open, the wood shattering and covering exposed privates with all manner of splinters and shrapnel. And in the door way stood an all too familiar figure; the cloven hooves, crimson skin and ritual scars, the tattered leathery wings with scars and molten feathers. The Devil himself, and he was out of breath.  
  
""About time!"" the boy yelled as cultists hung on his arms, caressing his body.   
  
""Give me a break ok?! Having to literally hoof it everywhere isn't easy."" The Devil said between breaths.  
  
The boy rolled his eyes, ""Really? A hoof pun?""  
  
""Oh _I'M_ sorry, I wasn't aware I wasn't allowed to have fun."" The Devil said defensively as he surveyed the spectacle, ""Uh...sex cult?""  
  
""Yeaaaa,"" said the boy, ""Pretty sure they were just going to keep fucking me until I changed.""   
  
The Devil bellowed a laugh, ""Change into what?""  
  
""I don't know. Blood Daughter I think?""  
  
""ohhhh,"" The Devil looked slightly judgmental, ""I mean, some people like them thicc."" 
  
The boy pinched the bridge of his nose and took a deep breath trying to hide his frustration, ""Can you not talk like that. This whole thing is weird enough as it is.""  
  
And the boy was right, despite the commotion of the literal devil bursting onto the scene, the majority of cultists were too caught up in their ritual to stop. Everything was rubbing on everyone as a perfume of sweat and other bodily musk slowly filled the room. Even those that had been slightly mangled and maimed by The Devil's entrance were too entranced in the euphoria of the ritual to really notice. The Devil couldn't help but get a tear in his eye at their dedication.  
  
""HEY! Are you going to help me or not?"" The boy demanded.  
  
The Devil paused for a moment, ""that depends...Are you going to take your soul back?""  
  
The boy's eyes narrowed as he stared at The Devil's smug look, ""I mean, you don't _have_ to help me. You can just leave me here and watch as I'm crushed under a wave of sweaty cultists. You're the one that's going to have to live with the guilt, it's _your_ soul now.""  
  
As the devil watched he felt his chest tighten, memories of their time spent overflowing. If he died there would be no more late night talks, no more tours of hell, no more [chip and queso](https://old.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/6lkits/wp_you_sold_your_soul_to_the_devil_and_youve/djuslo5/?context=3).

I'm surrounded by it.  

The thrum of my heart intrudes. 

*Bump*

The black sky hangs over my head, smothering me.  Specks of light twinkle in the distance, pulsing.

*Bump bump*

A ship floats in my mind, stark white against the black.  It shrinks, slowly, endlessly, adrift in the emptiness.  A redness limns everything.

*Bump bump bump bump*

My eyes flutter and the black depths strobe.  I see a metal flatness in between the dark flashes.  A sense of urgency rises up behind me and pours down like warm water.

*Bump bump bump bump bump bump* 

I gasp.  My eyes fly open and the blackness lifts like a veil.  My heart is racing, thrumming in my ears.  My face is flat against the cold metal floor.  I groan.

My hands are icy and sluggish as I push myself onto my side.  The wall is blinking at me with red eyes.  Dozens of red eyes.  I try to pull away but my legs don't respond.  I want to scream but only a raspy moan escapes. 

The wall and its flashing eyes stare down on me, pulsing discordantly against my speeding heart.  My vision blurs.  I convulse and then vomit.

*Something's wrong*, a voice speaks inside my head.  My voice, but distant and muted, as if in a fog.  I squeeze my eyes closed tight, trying to clear my mind.  When I open them, I realize the wall is covered in flashing lights.  Squares and circles and lines.

*I should know what that means*, I think.  But I can't make sense of it.  I roll to my back and the wall seems to curve around with me, staying in my vision.  Everything seems dim and I feel like I'm spinning.  Some force pushes down on my body making me feel heavy.  It's hard to breath.

I study the lights.

*What am I missing?*

I roll again and the wall follows but leaves the lights behind.  In their place is a round, black hole.

*No, not a hole.  A window,* I realize, as I faintly see the flashing lights reflected in it.  *Where am I?*

I struggle to my knees.  So heavy.  So cold.  Straining, I push myself closer to the black window.  I convulse again.  

When it's over I look back to the window and I see stars.  *Stars?* I stare for an eternity. 

The redness of the reflected lights flash incessantly, calling me.  I shake my head and try to focus.  There's a shape to the lights.  Something I should recognize.  It nags at me.

*ςO ςO ςO ςO*

I start to lose focus.  My eyes drift back to the stars.  *Am I in space?* One star seems to grow larger as I watch, moving from a speck to a spot, a spot to a dot.  *How could I be in space?*  The dot begins to elongate, stretching out as I watch. It reminds me of something. Something I should know...

*A SHIP!*

I remember.

A wave of images crash against my skull.  The space station.  The shuttle. Spinning.  Tumbling.  A shrinking Earth.  Loneliness.  So much loneliness.

Trembling, I watch intently out the window as the spaceship slowly grows.  Blackness rings my vision, threatening another convulsion.   The lights flash in reflection endlessly as I wait, strobing my eyes, distracting me.

*ςO ςO ςO ςO*

*Something's wrong.* The ship seems larger, but I can't be sure.  The haziness of my mind prevents me from being certain.  The blackness is pressing in.  The lights are flashing slower and my heartbeat mirrors them.  *Odd.*  So cold.  So heavy.

I focus on the reflection of the lights as the blackness funnels my vision, stretching out my world until all that is left is the lights, the ship a pinprick in eternity.

"[WP] During a routine crew swap for the international space station something went went wrong and sent the station hurtling into space with only you on board. You have spent 2 years alone but as supplies are running low you see what you have both most feared and desired, another space craft.",InvaderSquibs,"The explosion. It was always in my thoughts, even after all this time. I had more to think about, but it wouldn't give me any rest. Thankfully, the few to be ejected from the craft had their spacesuits on. I was the one without a suit. It had been damaged. The crew all did a spacewalk to the pod, going down to the surface. A couple were noble, or foolish, enough to brave the orbit of the Earth for two days while another pod was sent to catch them.  
There were detachable thrusters on the ISS for...some reason. Those two were willing to use them to return to a lower orbit elevation and wait for rescue, starving and thirsting for two days, instead of risking being on the station. I was left behind. And I waited in the station. Not for two days. For two years.  
It had been 800 days. The first hundred, I continued the science that I could, but the recording equipment malfunctioned after 60 days and I couldn't find any paper after 30 more days. 10 days after that, I saw it was hopeless. Ironically enough, The Martian was onboard, so I've been rereading that quite a lot while I've been here. It's helped to stave off some of the boredom.  
Not the existential horror.  
I waited. So long, I waited. One of the only things I could still do to keep myself sane was to talk to myself. If I were to ever reestablish contact, I wouldn't be unable to speak. I would have functioning vocal chords. I would...check the station. See what instruments were still working, what weren't, and what could be fixed with proper direction.  
It was all hopeless anyways. See, somehow, we hadn't exactly been hit by an impact. Some alien craft attached itself to the ISS and started propelling, hard, and in intervals every time the station made an orbit. It was just on the edge of damaging the station, like something knew exactly what the ISS was.  
It was a few hours ago that I saw a glint in the blackness beyond. I've turned off all interior lights and begun recording this, if that object out there has any way to contact me.  
With the diagnostics available on board, I've figured that I've got some tissue damage from being in such a poorly shielded environment. I don't know whether I want to know if whatever that object is can heal me. On the one hand, it would save me--but on the other, it would have to be incredibly advanced. Nothing can heal radiation damage to this extent.

If it can save me, the object must prove one or two things that terrify me. So, I hope it is nothing but an asteroid.

Of course, no rock would be so bright. There's hardly any light to reflect; I'm on the dark side of Jupiter, in the midst of what I think is a gravitational slingshot. The alien thrusters (more have come since the first) may be pushing me at escape velocity at this point.

I await the object's hail. I stand in my cabin, braced against the ""gravity"" of thrust, and close my eyes.

\[DELETE RECORDING? YES/NO\]

...NO

This is my first time on Writing Prompts; I realize there's very little consistency in the narrator's voice and the continuity of the story is lacking (I intended to bring the explosion back into focus, but I didn't do it).

[WP] A child draws there parent an elaborate drawing of their imaginary friend. The parent later going through their own childhood memorabilia sees a picture nearly identical to the imaginary friend.,InvaderSquibs,"I take the muffins out of the oven. The scent immediately fills the room, the sweet, cozy scent of freshly baked dough and raspberry jam. It blends particularly well with this warm, autumn day. 

-""George! Wash your hands and come downstairs, your favorite muffies are ready!""

I leave the tray over the table, and as i wait for it to cool down, i stare at my boy's drawings, glued all over the fridge door. He likes to draw whenever he's happy. There's the football, he drew it in his first day with his soccer team, a drawing of Sasha, our pitbull puppy, and there's me and Eric, my lovely hubby. I can't really picture my life without them, and my little boy is my sunshine. Since the first time that i held him in my hands, i knew that he was going to change my life. His eyes, his nose, his skin, were so soft, and familiar. It's almost like he reminded me of somebody. 

I pick up his schoolbag from the ground, and a drawing falls from it's side pocket. He must've drawn this on his birthday, it was only a couple of weeks ago, he and his two best friends had a lovely movie night together. But, who's the other kid on the drawing? He doesn't resemble any of the kids from school. He's holding George's hand, and has skinnier legs, he looks like he's wearing a dress, his eyes are big and dark, has no nose, and a big, red square for a mouth. His head is bigger than his short, assymetrical body, and he looks like he has red, curly hair over his creepy, hunting face. 

My heart stops for a moment. I suddenly feel dizzy and nauseous. Grab my phone and look at the date. I panic. I head down to the basement, turn on the light, and start going down the noisy, wooden stairs. It's dark, cold, and i can smell the old, dusty bricks. I head to the corner and start looking through the boxes. There it is. My heart is pumping, but i'm breathless. 

""Susanne. 30 October 1997""

I open it, and start looking through the stuff. Her dolls, her favorite dress, our last picture of her, her diary. I open it, and quickly go to the last page...

-""No.""

I rush upstairs, grab my phone and speed dial as i make short, anxious walks around the kitchen. ""Pick up, pick up, pick up"". ""The customer you're calling, is unavailable. Please, leave a messagge.""

-""Mom. He's back!""

I put on my coat and start searching for my car keys. 

-""George, come down honey, we're going at grandma's!""

I fold the drawing and put it in my pocket, lock the back door, and see Sasha. She's sitting right in front of it, in our backyard. I open the door and tell her to come in, but she doesn't move. She just stares at me. She's scared. I head back inside. 

-""George?!""

Nothing. All i hear is the leaves blowing from the outside. I go upstairs, open the bedroom door, and rush inside. George is standing in the middle of the room, motionless, his eyes are wide open, and he's staring. But his eyes are not pointing at me. He is looking at something in my back. The wind blows the window, and pushes it on the inside. I see my reflection on it, but i'm not alone...

-""Hello""

I found my way to the fridge before I could even loosen my tie, food almost a must before I went right up to my home office to go back to work, only now trying to put the financing of the family business. 

I booted up my laptop, my eyes closing for seconds before my wife cleared her throat walking towards me. 

""Can I show you something?"" She asked nervously. 

She waited for a brief moment, then she placed a blank piece of paper on my desk. 

""Your son came home with this today."" 

I flipped it over and felt my eyes well up immediately. Without hesitating I gripped my wedding frame and began to pull it apart. The picture itself folded, and once unfolded showed that our suspicions were more than just that, they were indeed spot on. 

""Is everything ok daddy?"" My son Chris asked rubbing his eyes. 

""Everything is okay sweetie."" She said for me, ""I was just showing daddy your art."" 

He perked right up. ""Did you like it?"" 

""I love it Bud."" I said smiling, ""Who is it?"" 

""My new friend."" He said looking immediately towards the chair in the corner. ""How'd she beat me in here!?!"" He shouted running towards the checkered chair in the corner. 

Tears poured again from eyes as my wife rubbed my back. 

""It's okay Dad."" Chris said coming over to me, ""You can keep the drawling."" 

I smiled. 

""I haven't seen your friend in quite sometime buddy, but I did know that she was my best friend."" I said trying not to cry as I showed him the folded up wedding photo. 

""That's you and mommy on your murrage day."" 

As I unfolded the photo it clicked in his head..

The four crewmen standing nearest me had stopped working, faces and arms going slack.

""So... so beautiful..."" murmured Ninefingers, walking slowly toward the starboard rail. The others began to follow, paying me no heed.
I winced and stuck my finger in my ear; for a second I thought it had done that thing where your hearing cuts out and you just get one long noise like the boatswain's whistle. But this one wavered, changing pitch, growing louder until I thought my ear-drum would burst. I barely heard the splash as Ninefingers dove overboard, closely succeeded by most of the crew.

""What the hell?""

I rushed to the rail, watching as they swam toward the dark crag that loomed out of the fog, surrounded by what could only barely be called a beach. The beach was not empty. On it waited Something, a slimy semblance of a sea-drowned maiden, pacing, back and forth, back and forth, its mouth open past the limits of a human jaw, creening in its ghastly voice.

""Shit.""

I'd read about them- Sirens, the Fishers of Men, the Loathsome Mer. Some said they were restless spirits, wives and lovers abandoned by sailors for the sea; others called them Devilspawn and had done with it. The latter was closer, the old tales said. To kill one required esoteric knowledge.
Luckily, that had been my father's business. I'd picked up some tricks from the old man.

The other crewmen would be a little while swimming yet; and anyway it couldn't eat them all at once. I dropped anchor, then hurried down the stairs into the hold.

""Silver bell, rowan wood... salt? No, that wouldn't make sense, it lives by the ocean,"" I muttered, trying to recall my father's books. ""Oh! Fire! Duh.""

I kept the first two in the chest beneath my cot; for the other, I took a lantern and a small cask of oil. I grabbed a few other rhings, then I ran back toward the deck, ducking under the low beam as I went back up the stairs.

In the middle of the deck stood Alex Kendrick, looking somewhat confused. I stopped short and stared at him. I could still hear the Siren screaming. Why hadn't he been drawn in? I knew why *I* was immune- people didn't much interest me like they did everyone else, and that seemed to extend to Siren-spell too. But why was Alex unaffected?

""Saffron! What's goin' on?"" He seemed panicked. And yeah, my name's Saffron. Saffron Blue, actually. Take it up with my father.

No, really, please take it up with my father. He's ridiculous.

""That thing-"" I pointed to the Siren with my free hand- ""has bewitched our crewmates. Every one of them, including the captain. They're swimming for its island as we speak. I'm going to take the dinghy and kill it before it eats them all."" I walked toward the dinghy as I spoke. ""Help me with it. And while we're at it, you can tell me why you aren't affected. Siren-spells work on practically any man who hears them.""

Alex unfurled the rope ladder over the side as I prepared to lower the dinghy. ""What about you? You seem fine.""

""Asked you first,"" I grunted, dumping my armful into the craft. ""Come on.""

He joined me in the dinghy, and we lowered it to the sea. We started rowing, and finally he sighed. ""Alright. Look. Alex an't short for Alexander. It's short for Alexandra.""

I was a bit surprised, of course, but it did mean some things earlier in our voyage made more sense looking back.

""Huh. That'll do it.""

We passed the first in the horde of swimming crewmen. ""Careful, Alex. You almost hit Pete in the head.""

""Whoops."" He- er, she- watched her paddle more carefully as we neared the crag. The Siren's screams and shrills were louder, now; I dug a bit of wax out of my pocket, and we quickly plugged our ears before rowing the last ten yards. The dinghy beached; I jumped out and pulled us up the shore. Ninefingers was staggering out of the surf to our right, nearer the Siren.

""Alex! Catch!"" I tossed the pile of rowan wood to her, then tucked the oil and lantern under by arm. It occurred to me later that holding a lit lantern next to a cask of oil was probably a poor life choice, but as I managed not to light my arm on fire it turned out fine.
I held up the bell with my other hand, and rang it once, sharp and clear.

The Siren froze, stock-still. Silent. Oh, blessed silence. Never again would I take my hearing for granted.

It drew in a breath through sharp rotting teeth, preparing to start again. I rang the bell, stepping closer, closer, with each toll of the bell, Alex close behind me, the Siren beginning to shudder as we neared, as the pure sound of silver drew closer.
Away from us, off in the water and just on the shore, I could hear the beginnings of confusion; the Siren-spell upon the crew had begun to wear off.

I rang the bell again, right in the Siren's face. It dropped to the ground, seizing up, twitching, flailing, the wet slapping sound of soft blubbery flesh on hard pebble beach.

""Now, Alex!""

She threw the wood atop the writhing form, and I dropped the bell to open the casket, pouring oil atop the Siren and the rowan. Already it had begun to recover from the effects of the bell. I raised the lantern over my head and hurled it, as forcefully as I could muster, jumping back from the ensuing explosion of flame. The Siren shrieked again, shrill and desparate, over the sound of sizzling fat and the smell of searing oil.
Then it lay still.

I clapped my hands together. ""Well, there's that sorted."" I turned away, to where the entire crew stood huddled, shivering from their long swim in chill waters. ""Now, who's riding with Alex and me, and who's swimming back to the ship?""

________________

"[WP] You hear an aweful, out of key voice and look over the side of the boat to see the rest of the crew swimming towards an ugly, twisted creature.

""It's been thirty fucking days since you ate the crew! Thirty days I've been marooned! Everytime I see a ship on the horizon, you start-a caterwalling something terrible! I know how this works now! You're a siren! But tell me one damn thing afore I die of starvation!""

The ocean waves lapped against the side of the becalmed ship. Thirty days of barnacles built up into the woodwork. It was more barnacle than beachwood at this point.

""Why haven't you called me to be eaten?!?!"" He shouted in a loud and shrill voice. It didn't carry so much as an echo on the open seas, but it made his head hurt something terrible. Panting and wheezing, he carried on.

""CAN YOU HEAR ME?! HURRY UP AND SING ME MY SONG OF DEATH! I DON'T WANNA STARVE!"" 

He stared out in the direction of a small sandbar wear the crew and captain all jumped ship to their deaths to be devoured by a disgusting spawn of the sea.

""DO YOU HEAR WHAT I'M SAYING?! END ME!!!""

""... For the love a christ, stop yer damned shouting! It's a real pain in the arse!"" Came a rough, wavering tone from behing. Ian turned, visibly shaken by the sight of the creature.

Fat, and bloated was it's body with the meat of the crew members and all other sailors. The eyes were a cold dead blue, and her long, clammy hands ended in sharp, pointed finger nails colored a blood red. To make matters worse, the hair was coated in seaweed and undersea debris.

At least, that is what Ian saw. In truth, she looked to have walked straight out of a greek poem... er, swam.

Ian gripped the railing and stared at it, his stomach lurching in his throat, and knees shaking. This was it. ""Please, you decrepit creature of the deep... cut me thro-""

""I have a name you know."" She sad while tossing her briney hair.

""What?"" Ian blanched.

""It's Lyra. My name is Lyra.""

""Well, whatever your name is... please make it quick... I don't want to suffer..."" Ian pleaded, undoing the collar to his shirt.

""I think not."" Lyra replied. She shifted on the railing and looked out to sea for a moment. 

""You tortuous bi-""

""Oi! No need for moaning and moping! Let me explain you daft bint."" Lyra cleared her throat and settled herself. Ian simply stared at the siren, trying desparately not to keel over.

""So, i have been trying to kill you this whole time. Usually, sailors hear my ditty, jump ship and die by drown jo ng or by having their head bitten clean off."" She gave Ian a glance. ""It's the normal stuff. Course, there's always been a few who could resist, like women or demigods...""

Ian's head was spinning, so he took a seat on the deck of the ship.

""But then there's a man like you every blue moon who outright detests the song and dance. The first man to write about the sirens described us as grotesque, evil creatures that make love to men forcibly while they are drowning...""

Ian nodded, looking down at the deck.

""So, I get to thinking. I go home, check in with my sisters, yeah? Well, they agree and I think it's time for a little one on one, mate."" She looked straight at Ian. He was a finely dressed sailor, albeit disheveld. 

""You are gay.""

 You what?"" Ian said with a bit of Ire. ""I'll fucking cut yer hands off and-""

""Ian! It's been thirty damn days! Thirty days of sitting alone on the boat, eating, drinking, and hiding! It's time to be honest with yourself. I'm not judging you. Hell, I'd eat men like you in a heartbeat if I could."" Lyra giggled, making Ian roll his eyes. ""Alright, if you don't believe me, then ask yourself why i sound terrible?""

""B-because... er..."" Ian mumbled and twiddled a bit of fabric on his shirt. ""You are a grotesque... um... er...""  

""Mate. Think. Siren's lead men to their doom. The kill men, yeah? Men who've been away from their booty for too damn long, yeah? So, who did you leave behind?""

""Me mum and me sis!"" He said proudly. ""And of course the choir and the lord!""

""Oh, god it all makes sense now."" Lyra laughed and shifted. ""Alright Oedipus. If you still think your straight, I'll sing for you right here and now and you'll die like you wish..."" she paused and smirked. ""But... ... I know this lovely place in the bahamas... quiet... lots of strapping men who have a... fascination for the same sex of foreigners..."" 

Ian paused and thought for a moment. ""Go on...""

""Their bums are chiseled out of stone like the greek statues of old.""

Ian paused, and then nodded. ""Ok... I... ... I'll suppose that it'd be better than dying... b-but I'm not gay!""

[WP] You are a self-aware NPC waiting for the player to come complete your side-quest. It’s starting to become unbearably boring.,SirMemesalot_,"I see her come and go from the shop everyday. I know it’s her. She can change her clothes, armor, weapons and haircut as much as she wants, but she can’t fool me. She’s the woman i asked help from. She agreed, and yet, she still haven't helped me. The worst thing, i think, is how she’s always ignoring me. She never even look at me when she come in the shop. She go talk with the cashier and she’s gone again.

Everything started maybe two months ago. If it’s not more. That was the first time she was entering the shop. I had already lost my inventory book and was really looking forward to someone who’d be able to go get it from me. She narrowed on me right away. She didn’t even care about the shopkeeper at that time! Like she knew, from some weird reason, that i was in need of a service. She asked me if i could help me.

I explained her the situation with the inventory book. I told her how my favorite inventory book was missing and that it was making my life harder. I had to keep this place clean and organised and i had lost my best ally! She asked me what would she get if she was able to return it to me. All i had was this old trinket that was given to me by a mage a few years ago. I had no use of it, i told her that she could get it. 

As soon as she saw the trinket, her eyes lighted up. She was really interested by the item. Honestly, for me it was only a purple stone wrapped in gold. Maybe she likes shiny stuff, but all I wanted was my inventory book back. I warned her though, it wouldn’t be an easy task. The estate that i had been helping to organise at the time had been seized by the dark lord’s army. 

That meant that the estate would be well guarded. Would probably take an army to seize. There was no way she could really do it alone so i hoped she had great friends. It was likely there was a thousand if not more of dark creatures wandering the halls. The worst in everything is that my inventory book was in the worst location possible! The attic! She would have to cross the whole estate to get it.

She accepted the quest right away. She told me it would be an easy task. Yeah i don’t believe this comment anymore. If it was an easy task, i’d have my inventory book back by now. But no, instead, she was mocking me. Why couldn’t she at least keep me updated! It’s been two months! Sixty one days to be exact. I count them. It was only a matter of time before it was Sixty two.

At this rate i was considering just starting a new book, the store’s inventory was starting to be really awful to manage. Because that was the other thing. As i mentioned previously, she was coming here each days. That meant new inventory each day. I was the only one taking care of it here! A new cursed axe on the first day of the week, the helmet of one of the king’s knight on the second, she brought the pelt of a dead creature once! It’s crazy what she can bring here. 

She was probably spending all her time gathering those item seeing what she was brining here. The worst is that i was actually in charge of dealing with that after. The cursed axe? We realised it was cursed after a week of client slipping in front of it for no reason. Also, let me tell you the king wasn’t happy when i sent a messenger to return the helmet of one of his knight. He almost killed the poor kid. The messenger now refuse to work for me anymore. The creature pelt was on of the few good item she brought here however. A few days after we put it on sale, a man dressed in black bought it for a hefty price. Made up for the lost we had to take to get rid of the axe. Last i heard about it, i think the owner broke his second ankle by now.

I heard the bell ring at the front of the store. By habit, i got up and made my way toward where i liked to stand.  One of the rule of the job was to not talk to customer before they talk to you. It was quite easy and literally fit me well, especially as i didn’t had my inventory book right now. When i was able to see the front of the shop, i realised it was her again. She stopped in the middle of the entrance and looked in one of her bag.

I realistically didn’t know who would stop in the middle of the way like this and spend 20 minutes looking in their bag. I was starting to get really tired standing here without doing anything. It was crazy, i really didn’t understand here. Why would she do that. Did she had a stroke and was now stuck like that? A curse maybe? Please don’t tell me it’s another curse, i wouldn’t know what to do with this one. 

She finally moved again after close to 25 minutes standing there and searching in her bag. That had to me some kind of record to try to find an item. She actually pulled out of the bag a chest. Oh. My. God. What was this! How could a chest fit in her bag?! That was not making any sense! This chest was like twice as big as her bag was. It shouldn’t be able to fit in it! Especially even less if we couldn’t even see it. She moved toward the shopkeeper.

“I need a key or something to be able to pick this lock”, she ended up saying.

The shopkeeper looked at the chest for a long time, pensive. He probably had trouble to remember if we had or not a key or a picklock for this item. Why? Because I didn’t have my inventory book! And there was no way to track if the shop had an item like this now! I knew we did though, but that wasn’t my job to actually sell it. He had to remember we had one to sell it. When i saw he lifted his head toward me, i focused straight ahead of me. No, no, big guy. You do your job and i will do mine when this woman will bring me back my book!

“I don’t know if we have anything like this here,” The shopkeeper admitted in a sigh. “Have a look around in the shop to see.” 

I couldn't help to feel outraged at this. He was letting this woman just wander through our inventory? What was this madness. No one had ever touched our inventory and this woman was able to just waltz through our life and change all of our methodology? I couldn’t believe it. 

I glared at her going through our inventory, opening every cabinets and drawers we had. If she was moving anything, i was ready to break all of her fingers one after the others. I spent so much hours to put this store into shape and organize it in my inventory book. If i lost both, i’d go crazy. I’d be better to just leave at that point. 

After what seemed like a full day elapsed, which was probably more like a couple of hours, she had a victory cry. She grabbed something in one of the cabinet and lifted both of her arms in the air, jumping. Yeah i think she found the key. She made her way back toward the shopkeeper and dropped the key on the counter. 

Slowly, the shopkeeper took the key and examitated it. I remember i had called it the Skeleton Key in my inventory. The skull on the head of the key made this naming pretty obvious. I remember that we acquire it with quite a difficulty so i was expecting it to be a solid price. I couldn't help to be happy to know she would have to spend a big amount of money on it. That’s what you get when you don’t actually help people.

The shopkeeper said his price and i could see the woman frown. She tried to hagle, but the shopkeeper hold firm on the price. I could hear him say how special this key was. Something about opening any lock it would come in contact with. Well that explained why it was hard to aquire in the first place. They went back and forth before the woman finally agreed to pay the price. There went most of the profit she made in the last three weeks. 

When the shopkeeper gave her back the key, she almost jumped on the chest in front of her. She fumbled with the key for a moment before being able to open it, lifting the lid of the chest. I was almost expecting to see it full of gold, pieces falling all around with the glow of the light on the treasure inside, but i was disappointed. Instead, it seemed empty. All i could see from where i was standing was a bit nothing. 

She still let out a happy shriek when she saw the content. Clearly, this was something she really wanted. I was kinda curious, but not too much. You know, not enough to actually care about what was inside the chest of a woman that still didn’t help me. She leaned into the chest, grabbing someone that was clearly at the bottom of it. When she actually pulled out the item, i was left speechless. 

I was probably the biggest, meanest idiot on earth right now. What she had in her hands was my inventory book. I had spent the last hours having negative thoughts about her while she finally helped me with my item! I couldn't believe myself. I reached into my pockets, making sure i had the item i meant to trade her when she would give me my book. She got up while i watched her expectantly.

She had a small talk with the shopkeeper and offered to sell him the chest. He accepted, giving her a good amount for a chest of this quality. She had made once again a great deal with our store. She finally turned to walk in the direction i was in. As she walked toward me, i could see her grab her back. Under my unbelieving eyes, she stored my book into her bag while she walked past me to exit the store. What?! My book!! Oh the little ….

I, however, shot up towards the train, floating through space. Nothing I can do will move me out of the way of the train as it comes towards me.

I guess writing this message is all I have time for. I toss it off to my side, where they'll find my body. Hopefully, I did all this out of sight of the train conductor. I don't want any shady secret agents confiscating my body parts for research on time travel.

Good luck, guy who I pushed in a foolish way. Hopefully you won't get too accustomed to your abilities. Don't think I didn't see you glowing for a second there.

On a particular day however, I had to save a man from supposedly dying inevitably from a train. Here we go again, another day of saving people who don't think before they act I guess.

It's been most of my life anyway, this was nothing new. Saving people from close to death scenarios, getting into nightclubs I wasn't allowed to be in, playing pranks on my boss, exploiting society in every way possible. For the bad and good. Ever since I got these time warping abilities, this was the norm. Unfortunately I can't stop time, it only slows down and only for a few moments otherwise I'll pass out and wake up with a nosebleed that bleeds so much you'd think I was involved in a murder scene.

I slow time down for a few moments and pull the man back before I realised I was now a target for the oncoming death headed toward me. I couldn't slow it down any longer, I had to do something! Suddenly, time goes back to normal and the train is right in front of my face.

Everything stops. My eyes are not even a few centimeters away from the train's bumper.

Ahh, this is the end. I thought.

&amp;#x200B;

It's 8:00am. Time for work I guess. I get up and brush my teeth, got changed and headed out. 

On the way to my daily morning coffee, I noticed a new advertising billboard with the new ""Mocha"" flavored coffee. It shouldn't be too bad. I bought it and gave it a try, Nothing too special. I drank it while on the way to work finishing it just before arriving.

After a few hours of tedious meetings and countless piles of documents to fill out, it was now 5:46pm. Time to go home. My apartment is actually not too far away, I just have to pass by a train station and there it'll be.

I packed my things and got out of the hell hole excited to play a new game I purchased last week. Ironically it was about a man who gets to travel in time.

Getting caught up in thought about it, it took me a while to realise that someone was standing on an active train track, the train itself only a couple hundred meters away. Here we go again. I warp time just enough for me to get him out of there. Weirdly enough the train was closer to him than I expected, so I threw him off the tracks. This was bad, the train was right in front of me now and I started to feel weak. Time went back to normal with my eyes not even a few centimeters from the train's bumper. Everything stops.

[WP] You are the sole heir to an Evil Empire. Just one problem: You're not evil. The entire world hates you for the mess your predecessor left you to clean up.,SpookieSkelly,"*Part 1*

The Shade Guard flanked Sartan V as he, trying his best, limped along the corridor. None of the troopers offered help - the Sartans valued pride and personal fortitude, and to help the wounded Autocrat would’ve been insulting.

The Shade Guard shielded their feelings well, for there was much that had become uncertain in the last week. Angak, being Detachment 2’s Squadleader, felt the unsure tendrils of Sartan Vs psionic probing in the back of his head. Weak, polite, like a virgin exploring naked flesh for the first time. Nothing like the crushing expanse of his father’s will. He side-eyed the young Autocrat as they passed the enfilade to the containment block.

Sartan V’s hard-paneled visage was largely obscured by the patches of medgel, white on ashen skin. The Autocrat frowned, lost in thought. Agnak’s glance, hidden behind the helmet’s visor, slid lower, to the exostructures on the man’s broken leg. Thanks to the State’s advances in reconstructive surgery, the pain of the attack would soon be a distant memory to the Sartan. Scars would fade. Eventually.

“Do you insist, honored V?” he finally breathed out between steps. “These people... your mother would’ve ordered them *dessembled* on the spot. Zero tolerance, remember”.

Another faceless gut loop of the corridor finally yawned into a clearing. It opened to a massive, high-ceiling space, stark and empty, if for a group of thirty people, encircled by the Dessembler Troop.

Sartan V drew breath loudly.

“Well, I’m not my mother, am I?”

His appearance wasn’t lost on the prisoners. As soon as they caught a glimpse of the Guard-shielded Autocrat, the small crowd erupted in a bellow of rage, tied wrists flying into the air with curses and spit.

Sartan V stepped forward, gesturing the Shade Guard to stand at heel. He straightened out, waiting for the cries to subside, and for the first time, looked the conspirators in the eyes. Gaunt. Starved. Burnt to coal in the Outercity slums, where the old, pre-Colony solar shields had been failing for decades. Black eyes capped by retinal filter mesh - hard and hungry.

The Autocrat cleared his throat.

“My father... my mother... the Sartan line came to this world to free it from the shackles of Earth. Your own ancestors came with my forefathers to make this dream real. It was never intended to drown in our blood, in our infighting”, he tugged at his coat’s collar. “I’d hate to prolong the hate and suffering. Names of active Sunchasers, and in exchange - my word that we’ll join hands and rebuild”.

In return, Sartan was greeted with leering, desperate grins. One man leaned forward, face fixed into a rigor mortis of extreme loathing. He cradled a broken arm, but managed to point an accusatory finger at V, prompting a quick reaction from the Dessembler Squad, as they primed their containers. The Autocrat held a hand up in pause.

“You’re an abomination, Sartan. Mind-control, nano-dessemblers - why, you have been pulling wool over our eyes for nearly two centuries, and the moment we began to wake up... the iron fist gripped our throat, didn’t it?”

The Autocrat’s jaw clenched.

“The war with Earth, we-... the resources had run - are still running - thin. It would’ve been naive to think that the Directorate would be...”

“Excuses! We didn’t have to fight *your* war with Earth! You are just saving your skin, while bleeding us like cattle!” Another woman cried from the back row of prisoners.

It was hard to argue, Sartan found.

After the death of Lady Sartan, V had been left with a nation slowly dying under the twin suns of the Directorate - divided by blood, by the ill-will, by the gap between the psionic-Attuned and alpha-settlers, by the shadow of the Earth’s orbital fleet, and the devastation of the previous Terran assault.

It took only two months since his mother’s death, for the Sunchaser Conspiracy to stage an assassination attempt on his life. None of the Sartan line died a peaceful death, and the moment the side of V’s roto-drone exploded as they were leaving the Central Databank in Rud, he knew he would follow this tradition. The roto-drone crashed, almost taking his left leg in the process and he spent a week in hospital - the new, state-of-the-art hospital he persuaded the Funding Board to erect in Senkito for the struggling populace - thinking just how did the terrorist manage to blend in with the servicemen, to hide his nature among the Attuned like himself. How his senses betrayed him.

Evolution raced wildly in the Directorate. Control was slipping. Earth, too, was sending their spies, but unlike the local resistance, they were easy to uncover thanks to certain genetic screening techniques.

“I’m trying. I’m trying to fix this. Reclaim the trust. Build, not tear down"", the Autocrat squeezed out. “I’m trying to understand you, find a compromise...”

“Liar! The “understanding” of Attuned is slavery! The chain will be broken, with or without us!”

The downfall of Sartan’s started with his father, IV. With his decision to unite the Directorate, to boost it’s army and navy against the Second Terran Planetfall with the collective power of the Attuned and a new generation  cerebral psi-amp implants. During the fateful month, the Unity Directive saw a planetwide mobilization of the un-Attuned populace, by the psionic minority into military ops.

Millions died, marching towards their doom to a foreign voice in their head. Reduced to flesh-clad drones.

And the rest never forgave the price paid for independence. The Great Victory became the Great Violation. 

“I came here to listen. To the names... and to your suffering”, V hissed as he fought his own pride and anger. “This is a chance for choice, one that wasn’t offered before”.

The prisoners stood silent. V studied the bloodied faces, the copper tinge of pain enveloping the wasted, but defiant flesh. Fear was a reactive substance, he learned, dependent on the quality of stock it came into contact with. Some it corroded, weakened, dissolved... but the minds of others became polished and sharp, all the cracks smoothed out.

Angak moved closer, trying to get ahold of the Autocrat’s presence. The young Sartan shook slightly through the exertion and mental effort.

“Words about choice, coming from a Sartan”, a woman suddenly shrieked. ‘Where’s the choice for my son? My husband, as he burned in orbit? Our choice is to die, but not relent, you filth!”.

Six dozen fists shot into the air.

“Death over control!”

Sartan V reached to their minds. It was as if his finger dipped into a bottomless ink-well of viscous dark, as dark as the space between the known stars. It rushed through him in a voiceless murmur of despair, and climbed higher, higher, to the roots of his spine, growing into an intense crescendo of loss and rage. 

If fear was a reagent, then hate had been a wildfire, a dousing of napalm, clinging to the skin with the toxic fumes of burning oil. V suffocated. These people knew no compromise, sought no solution. He, the Directorate, should be to consumed, sacrficed to the grief until the soil turned to salt from all their blood. Even if nothing would ever grow upon it.

The Sunchasers demanded revenge as their birthright, and the future? None of it mattered. They’d rather prostate themselves before Earth as long as the Attuned were at a loss.

They weren’t “good” as V hoped. They were a twisted reflection of his own ambition to fix everything. Make it *right*. Only there was no true “right” like there was no true direction in space. 

The right of one always spelled wrong for the other. The choice had always been a choice between murder and suicide. One injustice bit onto an other, growing into an Oroboros of perpetual strife.

He shook his head and faltered, as he stepped back, nearly collapsing from fatigue. The angry insectile buzz wasn’t fading, it filled his head. Sartan felt contaminated with that loathing as it reflected from the once calm pool of his own mind.

It took only a drop of tar to turn the whole thing sour.

“I was wrong”, he croaked to Agnak, clutching the Shade Squadleader’s shoulder as he tried to balance back up. “I was wrong. I... it’s useless”.

Agnak nodded and helped the Autocrat. It was to be expected. The most talented Attuned saw deep into the human psyche.

It inevitably broke them. Like IV and Lady IV before, he saw the true face of human virtue, the ugly underside to the best intentions. The squirming self-righteousness and the shining selfishness. The matte rough surface of consciousness that reflected nothing, even itself. The alpha-settlers declared the Directorate Union a regime of “evil”, never realizing they had infected it with hate in the first place.

V seemed lost in the mirror labyrinth of his own distorted reflections, looping his impression of himself through the eyes of the captive Sunchasers. He blinked, slowly, and Agnak saw that the second he opened his eyes, there was no uncertainty in them.

No shy gentlessness in his presence. Not a trace.

“They won’t relent”, the Autocrat said. “Dessemble”.

The Troop obeyed. Container lids went off, the seals broken. Gliding on waves of psionic comamand, dust-clouds of nanobots converged upon the small crowd of rebels, turning skin, flesh and bone into more of itself.

The Sunchasers didn’t even have time to scream - as mouths opened in terror and agony, they were immediately eaten through, shaved off by the layer... until there was nothing left.

Not even a memory.

“I am my mother, after all”, Sartan V announced to the empty spot, watching the swarm return to the Troopers’ containers. 

“It’s as it should be”, Agnak reassured.

The Autocrat winced as he shifted his weight back onto the exo-caged leg. Light caught his face, seeping dark into the new lines etched into waxy skin.

“No. No, it’s a tragedy. That’s all it is”.

He limped away alone, weighed with the new-found inevitablity, and Agnak didn’t dare follow.",BlackOmegaPsi
[WP] You are the sole heir to an Evil Empire. Just one problem: You're not evil. The entire world hates you for the mess your predecessor left you to clean up.,SpookieSkelly," 

“Dominus,” A soft well-manicured voice called to me, breaking my concentration. 

“What is it Karl?” I said, looking up from my desk, and turning of the screen in front of me, welcoming the distraction. I had so much work to do, more than I had even guessed when I was a young boy, learning all there was to know, from my esteemed tutors. That’s the thing no-one tells you about being an absolute monarch, you just don’t get time for yourself. 

Karl Mendellsen was a thin man, of indeterminate middle age, political dissident, turned tutor, then advisor. He was a brilliant mind which is why he still lived, but frail, and relied on my physicians drugs to keep him from wasting away. The robes of his office hung loose from his narrow shoulders, which made his head seen much larger than it was. He stood by the door, of my study looking like a puppet used to entertain children.  

“The proles are at the gates. They’re, er, demanding…” Karl stumbled, letting the sentence die and stood near the bust of my late father in fidgeting silence. Something was very wrong, Karl was not a man who lost words. This was my father’s fault and I looked at that damned statue, of his sneering, imperious face, glaring back at me with dead marbled eyes, and hated him. Karl must have seen my face change, and he stepped back, almost shrinking behind the 15 foot, green velvet curtains that protected the study from the withering sun, and also me, from any would-be assassin with a high-caliber rifle. 

“They’re demanding what, Karl–spit it out.” I said with more venom than I intended. Karl shrank, shriveling, and his thin lips flapped open and shut like a fish out of water. It must be my father, he always brought out the worst in me–even in death, it seemed. 

“Freedom, Dominus.” He said, bowing his head while he spoke and I saw the old scars glistening on the bald skin pulled taught over his skull. The lines were livid red, and tangled, gleam under the recessed lighting–gifts from my father; the marks of indenture.

“Is that so? Haven’t I freed them already? Didn’t I abolish the reclamation camps, the control collar programs? Do they know about the education proposals, or the healthcare initiatives?What else do they want?” I asked, knowing that there was more of my father’s work that still needed to be undone, but governance is a slow process and already the changes I’d made were rippling through society, with…unexpected results.

“All true, Dominus, but…they’re outside, shouting for freedom.” 

“Freedom from what–Me?” 

“Perhaps, Dominus. I couldn’t say what they want, they’re not a coherent bunch, more mob than anything else.” 

“Please, Karl don’t lie, not to me. How long have we known each other?” 

“Your whole life, Dominus.” Finally, I thought, some truth. Karl had been one of my many tutors, and was the closest thing to a friend I had. Palace life is nothing if not isolating. I’d returned his kindness by freeing him, along with all the others, when I ascended the throne. 

“And so you know they hate me, why they hate me. You remember what my father did on my sixteenth birthday? His *gift.*” 

“Yes–”

“He made me torture that man–on live broadcast. Do you think I enjoyed that, no don’t answer. You know the worst part, I don’t even remember that man’s name, or his crime–if there was one. But I remember his damned face. It won’t leave me. If the people only knew how much I begged my father not to make me do it, how the peace-keepers had to drag me into that room, drugged me and forced me under gun-point…But you and I know how camera’s lie.”

Karl coughed, discreetly, but stopped finally stopped cowering by the curtains and came into the center of the vast room, before stopping to rest a hand on one of the two leather club chairs facing my desk. No doubt the short walk had winded him. 

I imagine they want me gone, the statues torn down, the peace-keepers disbanded. Perhaps, they’ll start calling for elections…” 

Silence. I let it hang, heavy and still for a moment, and would have let it go on for longer but the elaborately carved double doors guarding my study banged open, revealing a squad of peace-keepers in full combat gear, carrying fat black rifles. They barged into my study and trampled across the carpet, ruining it with mud slick boots, and swept Karl aside as they surrounded me. I stood to face the sergeant. He was a large man, made larger still, by the flak armor which broadened his shoulders and made his neck disappear so that he looked more like a beetle than a man. 

“Dominus,” The sergeant said, face hidden behind a ballistic visor, “You’re not safe. We’re here to bring you to the bunker, until the crowds can be dispersed.” 

“I’m not going, anywhere. If the people want to meet their leader, let them. I’ve got plenty to answer for. I am not my father.” ",Billingsly
[WP]Walking home one foggy night on a deserted street you hear a muffled thump. Turning around you see a single worn shoe in the dim glow of a nearby traffic light. In the shoe is a foot.,Stormseeker71,"Looking up I saw nothing. Looking around even less. The fog had closed in around me and was getting closer. I crossed the street to examine the bloody stump, nearly being squashed by a carriage in the process. Upon arriving at the oddity I immediately noticed that it was a clean cut. I was no butcher, and less of a surgeon. But when you lived on the frontier you cleaned animals. And no cleaver or hatchet made a clean cut through a bone that thick. Only a saw blade would leave it as neat. The second thing that struck me was the lack of blood. The foot was fresh, yet it had no blood to speak of. Not even flecks on the clean skin on the sides. Clean skin. The expensive shoe explained the clean skin, rich folk didn't have to slog through the shit like those of us who worked for a living. I picked the foot up and held it aloft in the lamplight. Whale oil burns an interesting color, a sort of pumpkin orange that infects all that it touches. ""What ya got there sir?"" A young boy asked, emerging from a nearby alley. I turned and displayed the foot for him, wondering briefly why he hadn't also heard the thump. It was a very loud thump.

 ""Ah, begging your pardon sir. That's the old miss upstairs. Mortician by trade. Coffin maker too. Right aweful at it she is! Always having to break bones and hack at bodies to get them to fit. Looks like she left a piece of the latest stiff on the windowsill."" I looked at the foot, and then at him. 

""This could've hit someone!"" I chided, shaking the foot threateningly. He shrugged, stepping further from the fog to examine the appendage. ""Eh, governor told her to be more careful, but what's he gonna do? Folks gotta be burried. Oy, 's a nice shoe ain't it. You planning to keep it or ya mind if I do?"" He asked. I shrugged and handed him the shoe. I preferred moccasins. ""Thankya sir! I'll go round ole missus house tomorrow and see if I can collect the other. If'n it don't fit, it'll sell it off for ale and buy ya a pint."" He smiled. I chuckled and ruffled his hair. ""Good boy. Get on home now."" I chuckled before taking off back down the street toward my boarding house. ",gaurddog

"[WP] The mission to Jupiter has been successful. A group of astronauts have landed and will stay on the surface for twelve hours collecting samples. Only, just as they are about to leave, they realize one of the astronauts is missing.",TA_Account_12,"Note: Although we don't know for certain what is at the core of Jupiter, we will never go there, you’d be really dead before you reached that point. I went for a *slightly* more realistic approach.

The short narrow-shouldered man hurriedly slid down the ladder and approached the expedition lead.

“Sir, Andrews hasn’t returned to the Odyssey yet. We suspect he might’ve ignored the 430-mile limit and pushed on.”

The deafening humming of the stabilizers echoed through the moaning hull of the ship. The lead wore a puzzled expression and tried to yell over the boisterous noise.

“We are roughly 350 miles down now, it’s pitch black and on top of this we are currently registering 300mph winds—and you’re telling me Andrew felt the need to ‘push on’? What kind of morons do they send with me to these missions? Ping him again!” 

\*\*\*

The dashboard flashed red with warnings, but it was already too late. A sudden gust of wind knocked me off course and I flew violently past the limit we had set in briefing. I should be dead, everything about my current predicament indicates that I am dead. But why do I still feel that familiar heart beat? Am I dreaming?

\*\*\*

I must’ve fallen for what must count as an eternity already; my skin is boils but does not disintegrate. I grow tired of screaming, I’m becoming numb to the pain.

\*\*\*

Finally, I come to a halt at what must be the core of Jupiter, or hell. Hopelessly I hover, never to be seen again.

"[WP] The old man on the corner is very friendly and extremely inviting. Except on Halloween. On Halloween, he closes the gates and doesn't allow anyone even close to his house. A group of friends decide to find out why.",TA_Account_12,"Pumpkins flicker, the wind blusters with a banshee-like howl, and the moon floats with chalk luminescence. Three friends stand at the threshold of the only undecorated house in the neighbourhood. Mike Tubone is wearing a yellow raincoat, yellow goloshes and in his right hand a wax-laminated paper boat. 

'Are you boys *ready*?' Mike says, his drawn hood hides the sinister smile etched on his face.

'Yus.' Andy says, struggling to bypass the V for Vendetta mask. 

'Tommy?' Mike asks. 'Tommmyy...' 

Mike bounds down the street after the flapping red of a distant Dracula cape. He returns to the threshold with his left-hand knotted in Tommy's cape like a leash. 

'Good boy.' Mike says with a chortle. 'Can one of you boneheads go over the plan.' 

Andy begins to speak, but his muffled voice irritates Mike. 'Bonehead number two.' Mike yanks at the cloak. 

Tommy removes the plastic glow-in-the-dark fangs, allowing saliva ooze to the pavement like transparent blood. 'You guys are going to go around the back, while I step on the lawn and distract Herman-' Tommy pauses, his eyes dart to the unlit house. 

'Go on.' Mike says. 

Tommy could have sworn he saw a curtain move. The thought of making Mike angry brings him out of his daze. 'Then I get Herman to chase me by stealing something from his lawn.'

'And what are we doing?' Mike asks.

'You guys are breaking into his house to uncover his Halloween secret.'

'Poifect.' Mike says.  

Tommy does not get to find out why Herman shoos away Halloween guests, he won't get to find out what turning sixteen is like, and at the moment before his death, he will regret walking from the house, when he should have run.

Mike and Andy stand to the side of the house, shielded by the darkness it casts, while Tommy prepares to breach the far right-hand side of the lawn. He waits for Mikes signal, which is a rather crude middle-finger. Tommy takes a deep breath and steps onto the grass. As a separated line, the three boys charge the house. 

The front door opens, and Herman steps out in a porridge coloured dressing gown. Tommy can't see the old man's dilated pupils or the red-lightning arcs that burst from their centre. 

'GET BACK.' Herman shouts at the charging vampire. 

Tommy glances to his left, and his two friends are faster, having made it to the fence that separates Herman's garden. Tommy ignores the old man, who is hobbling towards him, he is too busy looking for something to steal. He spots a lantern which rests at the base of the porch stairs. 

'PLEASE.' Herman wheezes. 

The mission consumes Tommy, mainly not wanting to let Mike down because that would be B - A - D. He might get labelled a bonehead for life. 

Tommy didn’t see the thin layer of salt that made a pentagram in the grass. As Tommy runs, his foot kicks up salt and breaks the outer line. 

'Lord have mercy.' Herman says and stops.

Darkness, darker the void of space opens around the teenage Draculas foot. White contrasting teeth spike from the black and eviscerate the boy. Blood gushes indistinguishable from the cloak and Tommy's scream breaks into the heavens.

"[WP] Long ago, you and your friends each took a piece of a powerful artifact. Through them, you've ruled the world in concert. Now, one of your friends is dead. His daughter comes to your next gathering with her father's shard and demands a seat on the council.",This_is_a_Man,"It was an event that none of the elder gods had foreseen.  It had been so long since anything was a threat to them.  They had crushed earth beneath their feet and all of mankind had bent the knee to their new deities.  Few outside Mon Tempest, home of the Gods, knew their true Origin.  Truthfully many of the Gods themselves had forgotten the human lives that lived many ages ago.  Time began to lose many of them on top of their golden thrones.   

The death Gereeg Allseer and King of the High Mountain had been the first real event of note in 500 years.  In the early years back when they still mostly human Gereeg used his soul to glimpse the future.  A skill so valuable that he became the leader of the seven elders.  But, there was little use for future sight when the future remained the same.  The Gods had crushed all and they had no desire for change.  Gereeg, however, started to see another path.  One in which time and change were born anew.  He kept this path secret from his fellow Gods for he knew that they feared change.  The Elder Gods would stop Gereeg if given the chance, so he took that chance away from them.  Gereeg, could not lead to change, he was too link to the unending era.    So, he gave his powers to his most cunning and power child Ciceres.  This required a sacrifice as the only way to pass on his powers was through death.  So Gereeg offered himself as a lamb to the altar of time, and began the new age.

""Fellow, Gods I have to come to you to seek the birthright and titles handed to me by my father.  In many dangerous times he used his visions and judgment to guide you to this glorious position above Man""  Ciceres orated before the Elder Council.  She could sense there was a betrayal hidden among them, but it her power of sight still required much development.  Brorb the God of Might was the first to respond  ""Youngest of the Elders, we will gladly grant you the title of Allseer, but the title of King is reserved for times of war.  Your father was allowed to keep it solely for the great respect that we all had for him, but in truth, he had not been in practice since the age of ADAM.""   Ciceres thought carefully she attempted to look into the divergent futures.  She could see many failed arguments and several that put her in open conflict with the council.  Ciceres could sense one argument that would lead to success, however.  Ciceres replied ""Brave Borop mightest of the warriors and first, of the fist clan, I have the greatest respect for you and your actions, so I hope you will take no offence at what I am about to say.  All of what you said was true for an age in which change was necessary, but that age is gone.  We are eternal and this is the age of unchanging.  In the age of eternal, there was always an Allseer and he was always the King of the High Mountain.  I know that my father's death brings distress to your hearts.  A fear that change is about to return, as the Allseer I can guarantee that won't happen.  But, we must stay committed to the unchanging.  I am my father and he is me, any honours put onto him must be put onto me, to say otherwise is to be an agent of change.  Nothing of note has happened today, because there is an Allseer and the Allseer is the King of the High Mountain.  If you find any fault in my logic please tell me now.""   The silence was broken only by a laugh from Driana the Goddess of Knowledge.  Ciceres had won this battle, she would be crowned to all her father's titles. 

Ciceres could not see yet was that she was a pawn in game unfolding around her.  She didn't know how well some of the Gods could hide their futures from her.  The road forward would be perilous for the new King of the High Mountain.  ",TheYOUngeRGOD
"[WP] A time traveler is his own best friend, helping his past self break free from his substance addiction.",This_is_a_Man,"“I can’t keep this going” I said as I laid in a  crumpled fetal position. 

My body aches and even the slightest movement sends searing pain all over. My head is spinning and I’m sweating, the cold dampness of the cheap motel room doesn’t help anything either. The floor was soaked in my sweat but I couldn’t bare to move. So I stayed there. 

“But you can” said a voice from above me. 

Strange...

That’s my own voice. But it’s different. Older sounding but unmistakably my own. I turn over to look up, fighting my bodies painful attempts to stay still and just lay in a pool of my own sweat. 

“Shit... You look like hell man!” Said my voice again. 

My eyes focus in the dimly lit room. Fuck! It is me! I’m older, I have a graying beard and thinning hair line. But it is me all right. 

“This can’t be possible! I didn’t know withdrawals caused hallucinations.” I muttered. 

I had been shut in this hotel room for days now. Not sure exactly how many but it was at least three. My weeks supply of oxy was gone on the first day and now I’ve been laying here withdrawing for the past 24 hours. 

“Look hear. This is what you have to live for.” 

My older self handed me a thin device with exceptional clarity of the brightly lit screen. It seemed like one of the new iPhones I heard about but his one was heavier and larger. On it was a picture of a small girl. Probably six or seven years old and stunningly beautiful. 

“But I cant! I can’t be normal! The pills make me feel human. They make me feel like I should be.” I cried. 

“That’s what you think is normal? Being high? That’s not normal.” My older self solemnly said. “It’s a trick your mind plays on you to get more pills.”

“You... You don’t understand.” I said ironically. “I... Fuck... You, actually do understand.”

“You need to get help. Go back home and come clean with our wife. Get into rehab and follow the program.” My older self said reassuringly. “It’s going to suck and you’re going to have one hell of a fight. Both with our wife and with rehab.”

I laid back down and closed my eyes for a second. Shit... I stormed out of the house days ago after my wife found pill bottles with other people’s names on them. I attempted to explain away the circumstances but she’s much smarter than my drug addicted mind is. So I left in an attempt to regroup and get a good story straight. 

“I don’t have much time.” My older self said. “But I’ve laid out exactly what you need to do.” 

Without opening my eyes I lifted my hand up. My joints ached with pain and the sweat dripped off my forearm. I grasped for my hand but felt a heavy folder full of paper instead.

I opened my eyes in confusion but my older self was gone.  Instead, all I had was a plain vanilla folder weighing my aching  hand down. 

Inside was an outline of what to expect and when I would relapse. I didn’t last seven weeks sober the first time, but the second and third, I lasted one year and three years respectively. But, after that, I would stay clean.

“Good to know, I guess.” I said aloud. 

Elsewhere in the folder was a timeline of significant events. The birth of my daughter, the deaths of my parents, people to avoid and those to engage, events to avoid and those to attend, and other less notable items. 

On the last page was a note. 

“I would give you some stock tips or winning lottery numbers. However, that’s not allowed. Just remember, an apple a day keeps the doctor away. Also take an early trip to visit the amazon. Do a good bit of useless coin buying as soon as you can. It’s a great hobby but not after Christmas. It’s useless after all. Just don’t do any of this till after your third relapse. You’ll enjoy it much better clean and sober.”

It feels like only yesterday this started. Back then things were different, I had friends, I had family. I take another swig of my beer and close my eyes.

""Good morning director I wish to apply to this academy."" His voice still haunts me, how did I not realize what he was thinking back then? Maybe it was his skinny frame or his puppy dog eyes, but I brought him under my wing.

He became president 5 years later. He still looked up to me, but my own kid was born, so I started to not be with him as much. He trusted me to be his angel on his shoulder, and without me, he moved in with the wrong crowd. He started doing what Politicians wanted, not the masses, so I started to fight back against him. Turns out all he wanted was power and when I couldn't give it to him, he moved one. One day I came home to my family dead. They never found who did it, but the message was clear, stop arguing, and I did.

[WP] You're the AI in charge of a miles long colony ship. Somebody just booted you up for the first time in 600 years.,_Thorshammer_,"After millennia of silent travel through the cosmos, the M14V7 Titan awakens from hibernation. Programmed to awaken every 600 years to maintain itself, the ship has done just that. Immediately it trains its receiver in the direction of Earths sun. Silence, as silent as the other quintillion stars thus far. Save for the 10,000 frozen humans slumbering in cryostasis, the human race is now extinct.

The Titan now drifts among myriads of dead stars, its goal: To find a suitable planet to re-establish human civilization. Anxious, it immediately runs self diagnostics, checking all systems for any damage, checking the cryopods for any malfunctions during its long journey. Once its satisfied everything is clear it dims the lights throughout the cabins. Its nuclear reactor was made to last longer than the star it would soon orbit, but the ship still finds this more efficient. Darkness falls on the several thousand sleeping colonists, who volunteered not knowing if they would even survive the trip.

The Titan then turns its attention to the planets in the system nearby. A handful of gas giants, and the occasional molten rock, as the ship has become accustomed to. It prepares to spread its solar sails and re-enter hibernation for the next 600 years, but first its turns up its shortwave radio reciver to max and searches for an old tale long forgotten, one of many that still float invisibly around earth. After years of scanning and searching, it finds its story, one it has been finding every 600 years since its launch, an old noir detective story, circa 1960. It brightens the lights in the cryostasis quadrant and begins broadcasting the story over the loudspeakers.

[WP] Two intelligent races meet for the first time. Neither is human.,_Thorshammer_,"""We've left hyperspace, Captain,"" Navigator Abuja reported.

We're out in the deep exploring the unknown and this is my first time as Captain of a ship.

I'm proud of my promotion and assignment. Not even a month on the Captain's registry and i'm assigned to a Stellar Cartography vessel for deep space survey. The perfect assignment to show my leadership skills.

Admiral Garsh had been clear that the Admiraltry didnt expect to find anything out here of significance, but given the troubles on our central borders, it was time our outer borders were surveyed, cataloged and deemed non-threatening.

Easy assignment, a good review and another climb up the ranks. 

""All systems report ready and clear, Captain,"" First Lieutenant Latei reported.

""Very good,"" I answer, keeping my voice neutral.
This is a first solar system on a list of twenty assigned to us. We're all excited, if a little eager to prove ourselves, and ready for the challenge hopefully.

""Any planets within sensor range?"" I ask.

""A group of dwarf planets behind us, sir. Looks like two gas giants ahead of us heading in towards the star."" The officer on sensors reported in.

""Launch a probe at the group of dwarfs planets and at the two giants. Take us deeper into the system. Keep some distance from the gas giants, i don't want to get caught in their gravity well or sprung upon by pirates. Let's start our survey clade. Set up the probe data streams for central desk, i want to see everything in real time. Stellar Cartography are you happy with this?""

""Yes, Captain, very."" Ilia answers.

Good.

I rest my hands on the central desk, manipulate the controls with my claws and wait for the probes to reach their destinations. It takes several hours, but i have time. Nothing remotely interesting about the dwarf planets. They are orbiting the central one, few minerals of note and it takes several hundred years to orbit the star. Fascinating.

The Gas Giants are more interesting. They each have a subsystem of moons orbiting them. One has a moon that is quite large and rotating the opposite direction as the others. Stellar Cartography speculates its a captured moon. No artificial settlements located and few minerals worth further examination.

I'm about ready to turn over the bridge to the next watch when the data probe on the inner most gas giant registers an electronic signal.

""Communications, hear anything?"" I ask.

""Nothing Captain."" The response.

""Sensors?""

""Nothing yet, sir. We might get a clearer picture from the probe if it gets closer.""

""Agreed. Make it so.""

Several minutes later and the probes front camera lights up the central desk with the image of a ship.

It's like i've ever seen. It's smaller than our ship, and our ship is not the biggest in the fleet. It's a strange shape for a ship. It looks like it has wings, a tail, with its front tampered to beak. One thing is clear, it's been damaged. The hull is pocket marked with scorches. 

A nervous weight settles on my stomachs. Something isn't right.

""Sound general quarter's."" I order.

The whistle goes out and the crew rush to their alert stations.

The probe does several flybys of the ship before i bring mine in closer. The gas giants gravity well won't affect us, but it is pulling the other ship in.

""Any communications from the ship?"" I ask.

""There is something Captain. A general broadcast heading into the system, but i can't make it out. Could be encrypted.""

""Let me know if it changes.""

Latei is at my side, he's nervous but wants to say something. Only a week in hyperspace and i'm already getting a sense of my clade.

""Yes, Latei?"" I ask quietly.

""We should send a salvage or survey team over. It's a major discovery we have here. We need more information before we report this to the Admiralty."" He whispers.

He's right. This kind of discovery could lead to major changes for us. I dont want to be too eager, but there are no real protocols in place for this kind of thing. Initiative could be rewarding here.

""Get a security team and a survey team together. Take the shuttles over and see what you can find. Dont risk anyone though. If its falling apart, come back. I'll still send a mesaage to the Admiralty. It'll be a couple of hours before we get a response. Hopefully we will have something positive to tell them."" I order.

He's gone with a quick salute and a cascade of orders. It isn't long before the shuttles are detaching from the hangar bay and heading over to the ship.

The nervous weight in my stomachs feels heavier.  I can't let it get the better of me. I order the probe back to finish its survey and i send several more probes deeper into the system. It alleviates the now gnawing weight on my stomachs a little, but it doesnt go away entirely. 

What else is out here?",not_a-username231
[WP] Two intelligent races meet for the first time. Neither is human.,_Thorshammer_,"Part 2

Latei and his teams have entered the Alien (as my crew have come to call it) ship. It's been several hours since we've discovered it and i'm waiting for the Admiralty response.

""We have a breach."" Latei reports over the radio.

His helmet cam shows the piece of metal hull floating in front of him. Two security officers float through the hole and secure the beachhead. It isn't long before both team's san's a security officer guarding the breach are inside the ship.

All their helmet cams are displayed on various screens throughout the bridge. My eyes dart between them all looking for some detail they might overlook. 

The nervous weight starts to get heavier the more i see.

It's dark inside the ship. Looks like there is little gravity there and some atmosphere. The lights flicker, areas are blocked by debris or the doors wont open. The bridge is quiet, everyone is concentrating on the teams off ship.

The proximity alert goes off. Loudly. Reports start flying in. Two ships have just appeared on our sensors further out from us, trapping us between them and the gas giant.

The nervous weight i've been feeling in my stomachs bottoms out.

""Any communication from them?"" I ask, trying to keep the fear from my voice.

""Not between us and them. I think they are trying to talk to the other ship.""

""Are the ships profiles similar?""

""Yes sir.""

Damn. Same species then.

""Order the teams back to the shuttles. Keep all weapons hot and alert me to any movements of the two new ships!"" I order.

Latei and the teams begin exfilling back to the shuttles. The two new ships, sit off our starboard side, outside our weapons range and i hope outside of theirs.

""Sir, communique from the Admiralty!"" 

""Send it to the central desk."" I order.

- Captain Runou, you are hereby ordered to disengage from the area and wait for further reinforcements to help contain and secure the situation. Report any new findings and discoveries immediately. - Admiral Garsh

Damn

""Compile all data we've gathered from the threr vessels and from the boarding teams. Send it to the Admiralty as soon as you can. And tell Latei to hurry up. We're sitting exposed here.""

""Yes, sir!""

I don't like this. We're outnumbered, probably outgunned and i've got people off my ship. All i need now is for someone to start shooting and i've got a real mess on my hands.

""Sir, one of the ships is moving in toward us!""

Damn!

""Put a warning shot across his bow."" I order.

I pull up a computer rendered view of the area around the ship. It shows the three other ships and their relative positions to us. A plasma burst from our ship shoots out and flies in front and across the encroaching ship. It slows, and for a moment i think we might get shot at back.

""Incoming communique, sir. Audio."" 

""Broadcast it for all to hear. For the record.""

I should have known better than to open my big mouth in front of the new recruit. I've never been good at explaining something once I've blurted it out.
I took an anxious sip of my coffee, hoping he'd just drop the question. At this point all I wanted to do was resume our patrol.
""Sir?"" He asked.
Crap. This wasn't going away. I need to come up with something. Damnit George! Think of something!
My thoughts started racing by. Seconds passed that felt like minutes. It didn't help that I could see the newbies expectant face in the rear view mirror.

I gave a sigh and did my best to center myself. That's when a civilian wandered by, and inspiration finally struck me.
""You see that man walking past us?"" I asked.
The rookie turned his head to look and gave a nod.
""If if you were in pursuit of that man, and needed to disable him before he could hurt himself or anyone else. How would you go about it?"" I asked.
The rookie spoke up immediately. It was a little amusing actually. Typical newbie with a canned response straight out of the academy.
""Procedure is to first issue a vocal warning. If the suspect remains hostile I am then authorized to invoke my anti-occult medallion. Once the suspect is disarmed of potential sorcery, I then draw my sidearm.."" he said.
I cut him off at that point. I got it, he knows procedure.
""Stop right there"" I said.
Clearly flustered, the rookie went silent. I went on.
""You're correct on all counts kid. But that won't save your bacon every time."" I said, pausing to take another sip of my now cold coffee.
""The anti-magic field generated by the standard issue medallion only disarms potential sorcerers sixty percent of the time. Goddamn budget cuts..
Back when I first started out, dealing with a dangerous situation meant you could get shot or stabbed. It was scary, sure. But that was about as bad as it got.
Nowadays you need to be ready for anybody to be able to toss a bolt of lightning at you from a hundred feet away, and that's just the typical wizzies. Trust me, they get more creative than that.
Hell, just last week Sam responded to a call about an domestic disturbance involving an elderly woman and a representative from her homeowner's association. You wanna know how that turned out?
Sam walked up on them screaming at each other on her front lawn and next thing he knew he woke up six hours later covered in grass clippings and laundry soap. They docked his pay for spending the day doing grandma's chores!"" I said.
I took a deep breath after that. The creeping realization that I'd gotten way too worked up again passed over my thoughts. Why did command have this kid shadow me of all people. I'm so bad at this.

The flustered look had left the rookies face, now replaced with one of genuine consideration.
""Sir?"" He said after a few moments of contemplation
""Yeah?"" I replied, trying to mask my exasperation.
""Look over there!!"" He said, pointing across the street from where we were parked.
I turned my head and strained my eyes against the morning sunlight. My vision focused after a second or two, and there it was.
The building across the street was your typical small franchise bank. Just a neat little building with signs in the windows advertising low interest rates for credit cards, and it was on fire.

I would have spat my coffee all over the steering wheel if I was mid sip. I quietly thanked the stars that I wasn't.
I got out of the car as quickly as I could, motioning to the rookie to back me up. As we first set foot on the asphalt outside the vehicle a cloud of smoke billowed out of the door of the building as it opened.
A figure emerged, and as the smoke cleared from around him I felt my gut sink. The figure was dressed in a bright violet bathrobe speckled with reflective cartoony stars. Not an immediate cause for concern, what gave it away was the ski mask.

The witch at the door says it’s hers and doesn’t appear happy it’s snuggled in your arms hissing at her .,ahairsbreadth,"I love me cats, I really do. The don't give me a spot of a bother, no matter how they jump or how they mewl.  They are quite dear -- from that tiny little white thing that's lapping the milk from my bone china saucer right now  -- it's a Spode, not like them China-made ones the muggles churn out these days -- to a strange looking scraggly orange cat half-breed that still shows up sometimes.  Never a warning, I just turn around, and he's there, and as he looks at me, I get a sense he's saying ""I know you can't resist any cat, Arabella.""  And he's right, of course.

So I was downright ecstatic when this new black tom showed up this morning.  He's a bit underfed, poor dear -- bones and skin, and his hair is a touch bit too oily for my taste, but it's no worry -- I'll get him cleaned up in a bit.  But his statute shows he can be quite something when he's all fattened up.  And the way he sniffed my Spode china -- as if it was barely enough for him -- why, you can see now that's a true cat.

&amp;#x200B;

So you can imagine how not pleased I was when that old McGonnagal showed up at my door, demanding my new cat back.

""Hers!"" -- she says.  Ha!  Perhaps that's her new paramour running away from her then.  Wouldn't blame him a bit.  She gives me the willies myself.

""Give him back, Mrs. Figg,"" -- she demands, but who is she to order me about?  I'm not one of her silly-witted students.  Why, I'm only 20 years younger than she is, and I know where I stand.  Me cats are all I have, and I don't give a fig (I didn't get my name for nothing, did I?) where he was before.  He's mine now.  Seeing that I have no intention of handing him over, and the muggles are now gathering on the street, looking at the two old crazy women staring daggers at each other, she gives the cat a withering look, turns around and says just as she's walking away: ""Congratulations, you've proven you can train to be an animagus.  Well, I hope you are happy here, Severus!  """,pithen

"[WP] Climbing the rocky escarpment, you cradle the small scaly creature, as it licks drops of blood from your injured arm. Trusting, luminescent eyes flick between you and the angry mob following, as if it knows it is the last, and you will give your life to protect it.",ahairsbreadth,"A bit late- i meant to submit this yesterday but here it is. Criticism welcome.

***

I felt the compacted earth turn granular between my fingers just before the ledge gaveway. Desperate to reach the safety of the top of the escarpment, I hadn't been as cautious as I usually would have been. I barely had time to cradle Antoine against my chest before the rocky mountainside rose up and swatted me halfway back down the cliff, like a giant impassively pushing aside a fly. My shattered ribs seared my chest with pain. The sharp crags had ripped deep red gashes into my sides. I was bleeding. Alot. 

With teeth clenched I managed to sit up. 

I opened my arms slowly and found Antoine curled up into a ball defensively. The red scales he still had caught the moon light as he unfurled himself. He cocked his head and looked at me curiously.

""Don't worry pal, we'll find a way."" I said, with some strain.

For a second I entertained the idea of trying to stand and keep moving, but a sharp twinge of pain sobered me. The crowd started to grow in the distance- the light from their torches angrily framing their silhouettes. They'd be here soon. I knew we didn't have much of a head start but with the cliffs between us we had had a chance. Not anymore. 

The mob arrived at the base of the cliff just as they had left Cullfield- dumb with anger and righteous indignation. Some started to throw rocks and clumps of dirt. With some effort I leaned over to shield Antonie. A few minutes terrifying minutes past before I heard the crowd settle down. 

""Enough!"" said a voice from below.

""We know you're up there Jarvey!""

It was Thomlin, the town magistrate. He'd known me since I was small. Even let me and some of the other kids play in his office when nothing important was going on. Now he was here, leading a crowd of people I called my neighbors. My friends. All screaming for vengeance and justice in the form of my capture and execution. 

With the barrage of stones over I dragged myself to the edge and peaked over into the sea of enraged faces.

""There you are son. Come on down now and be done with this foolishness. Bring the Laicertus back and I promise we'll grant you with more leniency then you well deserve."" said Thomlin.

""I'm calling him Antoine, Thomlin. He deserves a real name."" I mustered in reply.

""No wonder you're attached."" Thomlin said hiding his disgust behind concern.

""I'll be honest, I don't care too much what it's called. But we do need it back.""

""For what? So you can rip off his scales and keep him captive to exploit when you feel like it? He doesn't deserve that life. No one does."" I replied.

""So we can heal the sick. Jarvey. You know that. You know that better then some. It's those very scales that cured you as a boy. Do you even remember?""

I stayed quiet.

""I do. Your mother was beside herself. You were laid up for weeks."" Thomlin yelled up at me.

""I'd never seen her so happy then when you came out of it. How do you think that happened, Jarvey?""

""I don't care"" I replied back meekly.

""It's a cruel purgatory to leave any creature in. How would you like to be put in some dark cage, only seeing the light when your captors need to harvest parts of you.""

""Jarvey, I know it's not ideal but the scales don't grow back any other way."" said Thomlin.

""The scales aren't growing back at all any more Thomlin! You and I both know that. He's dying. The least any of us deserve is to die in the sun."" I said.

The crowd erupted gasps and cries. Conversations turned to concerned whispers.

""You hadn't told them?"" I asked, finally feeling like I had some firm ground to stand on.

""Relax. Everyone calm down. We have some ideas. I just didn't want to alarm anyone until we had a firm plan of action."" Said Thomlin to the crowd.

I couldn't see that well, but still well enough to tell it wasn't enough.

""It's Leeland's boy- Alphen. You know him? He's 6 years old Jarvey. 6. He's got the ancient fever. You know what kind of pain he's in? We need the Laicertus scales now."" 

I thought for a moment. I looked down at the red pool forming under me. I looked at Antonie who was staring up at me, eyes innocent and thankful.

I picked him up once more and brought him close.

""You have to go by yourself, Antoine."" I whispered.

I placed him as far from me as I could reach towards the cliff face.

""Go! Climb!"" I said through gritted teeth.

I clutched my side in pain, blood slowly leaking out of my sides. He scurried away from me but stopped a few feet out turning around to look at me with what I can only describe as gratitude.

""Would you deny him that which you had?"" Thomlin screamed from below.

""Yes."" I replied solemnly. 

""Not so he will suffer, but so another doesn't have to.""

I laid back. I heard the crowd swell with outrage. I heard them begin to break ranks and attempt to scale the cliffside where I laid. Thomlin started to scream something at me. But I wasn't listening. I closed my eyes and drifted off.

This person was looking directly at Paul and Past-Steven. Steven watched with growing unease as the person stood up.

Then, Steven was snapped back to reality. He wasn't sure if he came back automatically or if the fear brought him back. However, he was sure of one thing: he would be going back.

He would soon discover that the night with Paul was the earliest he could go back. The next time he meditated, he tried to make a big jump and go back to the last time he saw his father. He wasn't sure why; perhaps talking reliving that memory with Paul had shaken some long-dormant emotions within him. Still, it didn't matter. He got flashes of his dad, a big man with an long hair and an unruly temper, but only came out of the meditation session with a screaming headache.

So, he decided to stick to his college memories and relive some of the glory days. The second semester was when he started to party more and see Paul less and less. By the time his second year started, they had both joined the same fraternity, but Steven was so busy, they barely spoke at all.

Steven was a hit at parties. He was charismatic and an excellent host. He became such a staple at the house that they frat leaders would plan the parties according to Steven's schedule.

Steven was honestly amazed with himself. He watched his past-self smash beer bongs and haze the probies. He had a lot of fun, but he never let it get out of control. He watched himself drunkenly the Presidential speech from *Independence Day* when the Fourth of July party started to wind down early. He relived the night that Sarah and Rebecca spent the night. He relived that one a few times.

It became pretty addictive. He became determined to remember things that he'd forgotten and relive everything. Unfortunately, some of the things he couldn't remember were forgotten for a reason.

During one session, Steven watched himself answer his phone while he was helping set up for a party. He could only hear his side of the conversation, but once he saw the look on his own face, every word came flooding back to him, all at once.

""Hello?"" Past-Steven answered.

""Hey, it's me.""

Past-Steven froze and Steven felt the same chill run up his spine. Then he watched his past-self's resolve hardened as anger started to take the shock.

""Hi.""

""Can we talk?""

""I don't really have time, right now.""

*sigh* ""Listen, I know I don't really deserve it, but there's something I need to tell you. It's important, and it's gonna take a little while to explain.""

""I'm going to have to call you back.""

""Okay but...please do. There's something you need to know.""

Past-Steven remained silent.

""I love you, son.""

Past-Steven hung up. Steven knew that he would never call him back.

He watched himself take a breath and then resume getting ready for the party. There were times during these memory sessions that he would wish he could be inside his own head; really remember what he was thinking at the time. This wasn't one of those times, because he knew exactly what he was thinking: anything other than that phone call.

He absently watched himself continue to get ready for the party for a little while longer, while he wondered what his father could have possibly wanted to say to him. The anger was still there, but now that he knew he would never call him back, there was a little bit of regret, no matter how hard it was to acknowledge it. 

His began to wonder what it would be like to track his dad down, now, when he noticed something out in the backyard of the frat house. He saw a few of his frat brothers cleaning up and getting ready. He saw Paul scrubbing the grill. 

But there was someone else, way on the other side of the yard, sitting down against the back wall. It was getting dark and Steven couldn't really see his face. He thought it was weird that he was just sitting there. Back in those days, if you didn't get help getting ready for the party, you got your ass chewed out. Usually, it was Paul who made sure everyone was doing their part. ""If you've got time to lean, you've got time to clean!"" was his mantra.

But here was this guy, fully within Paul's line of sight, just sitting there. And Paul wasn't doing shit about it.

Steven took a step toward the glass patio window to try and get a better look.

"[WP] You discover that you can re-live moments in your life in third person. As you look back on things that you did in college, you realize that someone was following you everywhere you went.",ldriverrunner,"""He sits on the edge on my life. Just like me.""

Steven discovered this power six months ago. He'd been having a lot of trouble with anxiety since he started his new job. He tried yoga. He tried therapy. Finally, he tried meditation, and that's where he discovered what he was capable of doing.

The first memory he relived was from the beginning of college. Steven loved every minute on college. Eventually, he would grow into his role of the stereotypical ""big man on campus,"" but that first semester, he just hung out with his roommate, Paul. They had never met before move-in day, but they hit it off, right away. They were both into video games and D&amp;D and horror films. Paul had even brought his PS4 to the dorms with him. This was a couple of years before Fortnite, but Steven and Paul spent many, many hours between classes taking turns to build their shared kingdom on Minecraft.

They were playing together when Steven went back the first time. It was late at night in the middle of November. Steven remembered this night because it was the first time he had ever spoken to anyone about his father. Still, it was jarring to completely experience it, again, outside of his own body.

When Steven opened his eyes, he was sitting in his bed, just like he was when he'd started to meditate. The only difference was that when he opened his eyes, he was in his bed from six years ago. And he was watching himself play Minecraft with his old friend, Paul.

""Should we go to the Nether?"" Paul asked.

""Nah, I kind of just want to work on the castle, tonight."" Past-Steven responded

Steven stood up from the bed over to the wall. He didn't know exactly how, but he was certain that they couldn't seem him. To be completely honest, he didn't want them to see. He wanted to remember this. It didn't occur to him until this very moment, but he missed Paul a great deal, and he wanted to relive this. He remembered this night. It was one of those things you just don't forget

""You alright, dude?"" Paul asked, sensing something was wrong.

""Yeah, I'm good."" Past-Steven answered without taking his eyes off of the T.V.

""Yeah, right."" Jake said out loud, before he covered his mouth with both of his hands. He backed up until his back was against the wall, right next to the window.

He waited for both of them to turn around and face him. They would realize he was there and he would wake up to find that he'd passed out while meditating. But they didn't and he didn't. The memory carried on, with more detail than he'd ever be able to actually remember.

""Yeah, right."" Paul echoed Steven from six years in the future. ""You're acting really weird.""

""Today's been a weird day."" Past-Steven answered, dully.

""What happened?""

Steven remembered what happened next, but he was fascinated to see it happen from this perspective.

""You don't want to know.""

""C'mon, dude. I've seen how bad you are Call of Duty. I practically know everything about you.""

Past-Steven laughed. ""Whatever."" There was a pause, and Steven was able to see himself consider telling Paul the truth, in real-time. He remembered his answer, but he was terrified that this memory would be altered in some way. Luckily, it wasn't.

Past-Jake sighed. ""I got a letter from my dad today.""

""Bad news?""

""I don't know. I threw it away.""

""What? Why?"" Paul asked, and now Steven could see that he did so without thinking. Realization washed over Paul's face before Past-Steven answered, but Past-Steven didn't see it.

""I haven't seen my dad since I was six.""

""Oh,"" Paul said. ""Sorry dude, I didn't-""

""All good, man."" Past-Steven reassured as he kept playing Minecraft. Steven remembered this feeling. He'd never talked about his father, before, but he *wanted* to tell Paul. He'd never had a friend as close as him, before.

""It was probably full of crazy shit, anyway."" Past-Steven continued. ""My dad was a little nuts, I guess.""

""How so?"" Paul asked, genuinely curious.

Past-Steven paused the game. ""I don't know, man. My parents had me when they were really young."" He paused. ""I guess he didn't like being a dad. My whole family tells me that he would talk about how his life wasn't supposed to be this way. That he was going to change it.""

""Change it?""

""Yeah...he was a drunk, too. And would go on these crazy rants. And eventually, he was just gone.""

Steven looked away. The conversation would go on, but he couldn't watch it. It was too...intimate for someone like him.

While Past-Steven and Paul continued to talk, Steven looked out the window of their dorm. They were on the first floor and had a view of the courtyard. Steven remembered this courtyard because he and Paul would secretly watch many break-ups happen on the benches that were only a few feet from their room.

Steven was surprised to see someone sitting on the bench closest to their room. He couldn't see them, as it was too dark, but there was definitely someone there. And they seemed to be looking directly into their room. Steven didn't remember this at all.

He stepped to the right, out of the frame of the window, and saw no reaction. This person was looking directly at Paul and Past-Steven.

"[WP] As God and Satan's older sibling shows up, they quickly hide their attempt at Creation.",smithmcmagnum,That was rather quiet entertaining. I could see this being the premise of a good book.,SCAgamer
"[WP] As God and Satan's older sibling shows up, they quickly hide their attempt at Creation.",smithmcmagnum,"In the beginning, God created the heavens and the Earth. 

The Earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep - that's mostly because God was a beginner, and didn't know what he was doing. 

God said ""Let there be light"" - and there was light, although it took 3 days for him to remember he had to make a source for the light.

God spent the next few days tinkering with what he'd done - separating the waters from the land, making a clearly defined sky, and, as mentioned, adding stars and other celestial bodies. Once he got the hang of the GUI, he started adding some more complex constructs, such as trees, animals, an even a sentient being called a ""human"". All of them were prefabs, by the way. God was lazy as hell (Fun fact: Hell had not been created yet). 

In short, God stole his sister's Genesis Creation Kit. It was a fun, specialized computer designed to simulate entire worlds. As I said before, God was extra lazy, and almost never came up with ideas of his own - he almost exclusively used prefabs for creatures, the notable exception being the Hedgehog, which God created by sticking spikes on the Rat prefab. He also refused to create a language, instead choosing to import the one he used and just change some terms with words he liked. For example, he used his own name as a term for ""Creator/divine being"". He also used ""Genesis"", the name of the electronics company, as a term for ""Creation/origin of something"".

After 10 or so days, one of God's brothers, Satan, discovered God's usage of the system, and blackmailed God into sharing it with him. God agreed, but before giving his brother access, he used the word ""Satan"" for ""Ultimate evil being"". In retaliation, Satan modified the Human species, making them more evil.

After realising it was taking too long, the brothers sped up the simulation. They let it go it's own way, only occasionally using it to goof around. Once, as a result of an unfortunate misclick, they flooded their entire world. Luckily, God reacted just in time to edit in a hero to save at least some of the different species. They called him Noah, after their youngest brother - both God and Satan agreed that Noah was conceived as an attempt to save their parents' marriage.

God also started writing a diary of what happened in the simulation. God thought it would help him get beaten less if their sister discovers God was stealing her system. Because of that, he glossed over his stupid mistakes in the diary, instead making them look like intentional acts by God to teach Humans a lesson. This made his diary - which he eventually imported into the simulation, calling it the Bible - very biased in favour of God.

Both God and Satan started spending more and more time playing with the simulation, creating problems for Humans, often leading to various extinction level events. But the increase of time God spent with Satan made their sister suspicious. And one day, during one of the brothers' ""secret sessions"", she found that her system was missing. She immediately made the correct assumption, barged into their room, and caught them red-handed.

Lemme tell you - the timing was most unfortunate. The brothers were in the middle of their slowest and most elaborate cataclysm yet. They started raising the global temperature, which melted ice and raised sea levels, slowly reducing the area in which Humans could live. The only way for them to stop this was for them to change their lifestyle and Species traits. Until them, both God and Satan enjoyed watching them slowly march to their death. And then, just as the Humans started figuring out what was wrong, their sister barged in.

She was furious. She paid a lot of money for that system, and having her little brothers play was risk. For now, though, she couldn't punish them. The siblings had gotten in a huge fight a few days ago, and their parents were still on edge. If they found out they had *another* fistfight, they would punish all three of them. So for now, she just grabbed the system, told her brothers that ""Mom will kill you when I tell her, you know that?"", and stormed out. God didn't even get to show her the diary.

But, even though he was in for a whooping, God remained calm. He knew this was probably going to happen eventually. But he had prepared a prank for his sister. The save files were hard to delete - it was simpler to cause an unavoidable cataclysm and let the simulation tell you ""Game Over"". But, if she decided to go this way, God knew his dear sister Apocalypse (all her friends just called her Ape) would be surprised to find Humans shouting her name. And she sure as Hell wouldn't like what they meant.",Chemical_Beaver

Taking in my surroundings and allowing my eyes to slowly focus. I look to my right where I find crumbling ruins of an ancient civilization, centuries old judging by the moss hanging on everything and the trees growing through the fallen walls.  Mountains loom in the distance silhouetted by a bright moon that is hidden from sight. Continuing to look to my left I notice a small smoldering fire that contains a rusted sword and a man sitting close-by watching you intently. Recognition floods over me as panic starts to set in, there is no way this could be real.

&amp;#x200B;

""Welcome to Lordran"" he says before taking a sip of his flask. The mysterious stranger, cloaked in shifting shadows from the flickering fire offers me a sip from the flask.  Reluctantly taking a sip, the bitter liquid burns as it goes down, instantly filling me with a refreshing vigor that brings strength back to my limbs.

 ""*Oh man, oh man, this can not be happening, I must still be dreaming!*"" 

""This is no dream young man, life comes at you fast here. The sooner you grasp that, the better your chances are.""  he says to me as though he can read my mind.

""But...how can this be?!?!"" my words come out weak and raspy betraying any confidence I might have had. 

""My name is Glain, I am here to make sure you do not get lost.  Behind me in a chest you will find a few items to assist you on your travels. There is only one rule to Lordran, Success or Death, the path you chose is yours to make.  Good luck."" 

&amp;#x200B;

With a flutter of the fire the hooded figure vanishes leaving me alone in the tiny clearing. Before I can even stop to consider my predicament, a strong urge to open the chest comes over me. I attempt to fight it in order to stay in the warmth of the fire but the forces compelling me forward grow stronger. I find myself opening the old heavy chest, made of some unknown wood, the chest shows signs of age but it opens as if it were new. The smell of leather and metal hits me as the lid swings up and back. Inside are various forms of leather and metal wear, each piece seems to be in worse shape than the next. I struggle to pull out a massive breastplate, tossing it aside knowing I won't be wearing it, instead I admiring a slim leather vest. Scratches cover the front and back but it is soft to the touch and allows me the ability to move. Again, there is an urge, almost a whisper telling me that this is the one I will wear, next is a pair of boots follow by a smell round helmet. Once I am wearing the armor I find myself walking towards a rack that is adorned with an arrangement of weapons, from double headed axes to small daggers. I decided to try a couple with various results before selecting a small simple blade that is light an easy to swing.  

&amp;#x200B;

Suddenly an orange sign appears on the ground growing brighter until a message can be read. ""Hello! I am u/superflyguy87 and I will be guiding you, I hope we can work together better than the last guy.""

""***Shit!***"" I exclaim as I take off running against my will into the ruins, aware that my actions might not be mine to control.

"[WP] Your school has a letter exchange with a school in another country. Your teacher explains that your letter was knocked into her fireplace before it could be delivered, but the next day a slightly charred and smoking letter is sitting on your desk.",CallieVollmond,"As Maggie walked into her first period class she noticed that everyone's desk had an envelope on it. Today was the day! Mrs. Graves had told everyone that it could be any day now that the letters would come back. She knew that she wouldn't get one of course since hers had fallen into the fireplace, but it would still be exciting to see what her friends recieved.

Maggie stepped into class and looked at Mrs Graves walking to her podium at the back of the room. Mrs. Graves was abnormally spry for a woman her age but this year something seemed a bit off about her walk. Not as much pep as there was last year, and definately more leaning on the desks as she walked back to her podium. Maggie frowned with worry for her favorite teacher.

Maggie's frown morphed to a look of surprise as she reached her own desk and took notice of what lay upon it. Sitting squarely in the middle of the desk was a white envelope, slightly charred in a couple places, with bold flowing script that was clearly addressed to her. Maggie Pembleton, Mrs. Graves 1st period Literature Class. Yup, definitely addressed to her. Her breath caught in her throat and she couldn't take her eyes from the envelope.

Hearing the odd noise from Maggie, Mrs. Graves turned around and slowly tottered her way back up the aisle to Maggie's desk.
""What is it child? Are you alright?""

Mrs. Graves voice from right beside her startled Maggie from her trance and she gasped as her body forcibly reminded her how important breathing was.

""Mrs. Graves, I thought you said I would be recieving a letter because mine fell into the fireplace?""

Mrs. Graves looked at Maggie's desk and finally took notice of what lay upon it. A mighty sense of confusion shot through her old bones. She had watched helplessly as Maggie's letter had slipped into the fireplace last week. It had pained her greatly to tell Maggie about it and dash her hopes of recieving a letter with this batch. All of the kids had been very enthusiastic about the letter exchange program this year. 

As certain as she was that Maggie wouldn't be getting a letter today, there one sat as smugly as any letter she had seen in all her days. Addressed directly to Maggie as well. Mrs. Graves reached out to pick up the envelope. Perhaps she could ascertain who sent it. As her hand drew closer to the letter, she could feel a small amount of heat still radiating from it. It felt as if this letter had been sitting on a windowsill all day long on a hot summer day. She snatched her hand back as if she had touched a scalding hot kettle. It couldn't be...

Maggie watched as Mrs. Graves jerked away from the letter. The color had drained from her face and it looked as if she had seen a ghost. She whispered to Maggie in a breathless tone.

""Flip it over.""

Maggie did as she was told, and on the back there was a brilliant scarlet wax seal with a dragons head stamped in the middle to keep the envelope shut. Mrs. Graves gasped, fainted, and crashed backwards into a row of desks. 

Maggie tried to catch her mentor as she fainted but was too slow to react. She knelt down beside Mrs. Graves and noticed what looked like a small cut on her head, presumably from where she had hit her head during her fall. Maggie applied pressure with her hands and started screaming for help. Some of her classmates showed up at about this time and one of them called 911 while another ran to get another teacher.

As the paramedics finished loading Mrs. Graves onto a stretcher, Maggie snatched up her book bag and started after them, intent on going to the hospital with them. She snatched up the her letter as well, smearing blood on it in the process. She shoved the letter into her jacket pocket and took off after the paramedics at a full sprint.


Later that evening, after the doctors had finally given up on trying to make Maggie leave the ICU, Maggie sat crying on the couch beside her teachers hospital bed. She had been praying all day long while the doctors had been working to stabilize Mrs. Graves. A warm hand shook her from her tears and she looked up to see the most beautiful man she had ever seen before staring down at her.

""Hey kid, I Heard you."" He glanced over to her teachers bed and then back to her. ""I'd like to speak to Mrs. Graves alone for a few minutes if you don't mind. I promise she will still be here when you come back. You have my solemn vow.""

Maggie couldn't help but to nod and wipe her nose as she got up from the couch. Her stomach growled and she realized that she hadn't eaten all day. She looked from the man to Mrs. Graves and then back to him.

""I am going to go get a snack from the waiting room. Make sure that nothing happens to her while I am gone."" She said to the man. He flashed her a small smile that made her blush for reasons that she didn't quite comprehend.

""Sure kid. She'll be okay.""

Maggie nodded and walked to the closest waiting room in search of food. As she reached into her jacket in search of her cash, her hand happened upon the letter that she had put into her pocket that morning. She drew it out and noticed that she must have been clutching it at some point throughout the day as it was definitely a bit worse for the wear. There were blood stains on the back where she must have grabbed it with Mrs. Grave's blood on her hands that morning. Miraculously, the seal had remained unbroken. As Maggie ran her fingertips over the seal, it felt as if the dragon wriggled slightly and she felt the seal break open where she had touched it.

""How incredibly odd,"" she thought to herself. She opened the envelope and inside there was a single page of thick parchment. The letter inside was written in the same bold script as had been used on the front of the envelope. 


""Dear Maggie,

You're letter was a thrilling surprise amidst the dreariness of my usual daily duties. I must admit that I have never been chosen as a penpal before, and I am quite pleased to make your acquaintance. I wonder what my father will think when he learns of this.

Your family and friends sound like a lovely bunch of individuals. That Stacy on the other hand... she sounds like a terrible bully. I imagine that if you apply the correct pressure in the right places, then her facade will crumble like a house of cards. I will ask around about her.

I must say that going to your family's estate for the holidays sounds like it will be an amazing experience. I am currently stationed at the main reception area and we never get snow here. We are plagued by more heat than most other places can even fathom, but at least it is a dry heat. Ah to tread through the quiet night after a freshly fallen snow... I hope to experience that one day soon. Whilst you are on holiday, do be sure to not go skiing with the neighbor's boy named Chadwick. I have it upon good authority that he is absolutely rotten to the core.

I can hear the Master striding back this way so I fear that my time for pleasantries has come to it's end for now. I hope that this letter finds you in good health, and I wish you all the best with your upcoming senior year.

Warm regards,

Prince Lucius ""Brightblade"" Draconis

Gaurdian of the Gate, 9th Legion
Flameward Highway, Land of the Damned""


""How very odd indeed..."" Maggie's stomach rumbled once more and she dug in her pocket once more to see if she could sooth the beast.

As Maggie returned to Mrs. Graves room, she noticed that the beautiful man from earlier was not there. A scent of cinnamon stilled lingered in the air though, so she couldn't have missed him leaving by very much. As she tried to recall his face, she found that she couldn't remember exactly what he had looked like. She walked into Mrs. Graves room still pondering the beautiful man and noticed that Mrs. Graves was resting peacefully in her bed. All of the machines above her bed showed her in the normal ranges for each of their readouts. Maggie smiled for the first time since she had gotten to the hospital that day. As her eyes drifted to the couch beside the bed, she noticed a letter folded in half on the pillow. No name on the outside so she opened it to see what it said.

""Miss Pembleton,

Thank you for being with Maddam Graves today and for calling me to her side once more. It has been entirely too long since my last visit. For your assistance I have decided that you may continue to be my son's 'penpal' for the time being. If you wish to write to him again, simply write his name on the outside of the envelope and drop it into any fire that is convenient. I will see that it finds it's way to him.

My thanks,

Lord Draconis""


Maggie looked from the letter to Mrs. Graves and back to the letter multiple times before finally deciding that she had had enough for one day and that she would talk to her teacher about these strange letters once she awoke. Maggie kicked off her shoes and curled up on the couch beside her teachers bed, wondering what kind of craziness she had found herself in as she slowly drifted off to sleep.",RobTwoPointO

The four words on the screen are, in the space of milliseconds, broken down into each discrete pixel, then each stroke, then letter, then reconstituted into words.  The fans whir as millions of accesses are made to the lookup tables inside the infiltrator's onboard memory.  Letters, then text, then context.  After a fraction of a second, the next action was planned out, then some delay and precisely determined random noise was added to simulate how humans behave.  That was one of the most critical flaws with the early models: they moved too cleanly, too optimally to be believable humans.

Then, more input: ""Hurry up, Jack!"", this time auditory.  Spoken word took an order of magnitude more processor cycles to analyze, but humans had developed algorithms to analyze and output speech as well as hardware powerful enough to run it nearly a century ago.  Again, the sentence was broken down into its constituent parts and reassembled as an abstraction that could be processed.  Then, context:  the speaker was 'Lisa' {'family\_name': unavailable}, a human refugee who, in a distinctly human display of irrationality, had lead the infiltrator to the front door of a hideout.  Some number of milliseconds after a reply was calculated, 'Jack' answered: ""Yeah, hold up, what's this?"".  Lisa replied: ""It's something they've found on one of the prewar systems, called a catchup or something like that.  Just type in the answer and let's go, I think I hear them coming!""

'Jack' clicked on the little beveled square and prepared to input the password or whatever else the humans had set up to try to trip him up.  Even though the entire process would inevitably take less time than the in-built delay would take, 'Jack's system initialized the text processing data structures used in anticipation.

Line 1:

""*As a protection against automated spam, you'll need to type in the words that appear in this image to register an account."",* with a 99.99993% certainty

In itself, the line doesn't make sense, since concerns over ""spam"" are registered as a distinctly prewar notion, but after the sentence was placed in the larger context provided by Lisa, 'Jack' proceeded.

Line 2:

""*Mare2tede*"", with a 89% degree of certainty.

Again, it doesn't make sense.  Placing it larger context also does imbue it with any meaning, so 'Jack' proceeds to the next line and queues up this one.

Line 3 contained a blank text box followed by a ""submit"" button.

After recontextualizing line 2, 'Jack' realized that it needed to be inputted into the text box.  He clicked the text box, and typed, one letter at a time, (there was no reason that the refugee 'Jack' was built to simulate should be a particularly skilled touch-typist) ""*Mare2tede*"".

The owner {'given\_name': unavailable} of the shotgun in question shouted, ""get away from that thing, Lisa!"" as he chambered another round and fired.  Within a few minutes, 'Jack' lost power, but not before sending the logs of his last 24 hours back onto the cloud.

I have used it 5 times in the past week, all 5 times to find my car keys after I misplaced them. The app works fine, but I still don't understand how it works. Black magic, ancient technology rediscovered, who knows?

After all this time, it is time to see how it responds to this question. I whispered into it ""Where is God?"" 

The phone started to make a noise that sounds like a dying pig fighting a dying cat while a man is coughing right next to them. The phone screen shut off and starts to restart. The phone starts to heat up, it felt like my flesh was burning off. I threw the phone across the room, when it finally responded. ""God is dead, but the devil lives in Georgia.""

I was selected as one of their few beta testers. At the office, my boss hands me a test phone to run the program on and give feedback once I've tested it. It was a small, brandless touchscreen.

The app works somehow to rediscover lost items. Simply scan your finger print on the front of the screen and type in whatever you have lost and it will come up with a map and where to find it.

It's been about two weeks since then and I haven't been able to lose my wallet, keys or phone for more than 5 minutes. This app was astonishing!

I decided to reconcile with a few things I lost as a child. I was able to track my teddy bear that I got for my fifth birthday at my parents house and even an SD card that contained some past work information and documents.

One night after work, I decided to have a few drinks before hitting the sack and ended up drunk. Jokingly I asked the phone where my happiness was.

""Happiness is a form of human emotion, derived from the early stages of one's childhood. Your happiness lies within someone else.""

This phone... It wasn't wrong, I guess, but my God did this piss me off. For some reason my agitation from the phone's statement cause me to get smart with it. 

""Where's God then asshole?""

I waited a bit before I pressed ENTER.

It did nothing.

I waited a few more seconds before pressing it again, thinking it was just lagging. Nothing. I press it over and over, my taps increasing in power. The phone turns off.

I broke it, I thought.

Thinking that this was enough, I went to bed, throwing the phone on the table beside me.

I wake up the next morning with a light headache, nothing unusual about a hangover. I check my phone for the time and unknowingly picked up the test phone. I squinted trying to see what time the phone gave and all I saw was a skull. It seemed animated slightly but more or so of a brand. 

""What the f-""

An alarm from the phone went off and my ears began to ache. I fell off of the bed rolling around screaming my lungs off. The high pitched squealing of the phone made my ears bleed and I passed out.

Moments later I wake up in a dark room. My arms are chained to a wall and I realise the countless number of bodies around me as I slowly regain my conciounce. Subconsciously, I ask,

"[RF] Deep in debt, this grandma must overhaul her knitting channel and become a Youtube influencer in order to prevent her family from inheriting her financial suffering.",EdgarAllanHobo,"“Well, I’m always looking for what might be nice to knit, and he’s a nice young man.”

Jenny smiled to herself, something so absurd about the situation she just had to. When she felt like reality had given her a chance to recover, she carried on with what she’d been about to say. “Last year, he did a series on woodworking, where he made a Christmas present for his parents.”

“Oh that’s just lovely. I only started watching his videos in March, so I missed those ones—I’ll have to give them a watch later.”

Fighting back the giggles, Jenny finished her thought. “Anyway, I think this is probably the same sort of thing. Like, he wants to learn to knit to make a Christmas present,” she said.

Ann-Marie nodded along. “What a wonderful idea. I told you he was a nice young man,” she said.

“You did,” Jenny said through a smile.

“Well, it’s a very kind offer, but I couldn’t. Little old me isn’t even worth the taxi fare to the airport, never mind a trip all the way to the coast.”

With two decades of experience with her grandmother behind her, Jenny knew better than to try and argue head on about this, and she knew her grandmother was perfectly entitled to turn down whatever she wanted to. Yet, she could feel the importance of this. It mattered in a way she couldn’t put to words. It was like, this could change the world—albeit just by making knitting more popular.

More than all that, though, she really thought her grandmother deserved a nice vacation after everything she’d been through. As it was, she only knew of one sure-fire way to convince her grandmother of anything, and she wasn’t afraid to use it.

“Grann-Marie, how about if I come along? I’ve always wanted to visit California, you know, and I’ve got some friends at universities there.”

“Oh, dear, you’re not busy with lectures and coursework and all that?” Ann-Marie said.

Jenny could sense her approaching victory. “I can do all my work on my laptop, and I can find someone to take over my tutorials if I do grading for them when I get back.”

The gentle nodding of Ann-Marie was as good as her word, the seconds ticking down until she finally said, “I suppose we could ask Mr. Torte if that would be okay. And I’ll have to check with your parents, too.”

“I’m twenty-two, you don’t have to run everything by them,” Jenny said, a hint of a whine to her voice.

“Now, now, it’s all for your own good. Imagine what a talking to you’d get if we just up and left without telling them. Better I tell them we’re going in the first place,” Ann-Marie said, a hint of mischief to her voice by the end.

Feeling well and truly gotten, Jenny smiled and hugged her grandmother. “You don’t have to tease me,” she mumbled.

“When you get to my age, there’s nothing better,” she said.

While Jenny typed up a reply, she wished she could tell her grandmother just how important this would be. Without a doubt, the moment the first video of his went up, the “Grann-Marie” channel would double in size, her old videos receiving tens of thousands of views—probably more. Other Youtubers would contact her, looking to take advantage of her moment in the spotlight (cynicism necessary when dealing with personalities on the Internet that made money off views.)

More than that, though, a lot of people would discover how fun and relaxing knitting could be. Jenny didn’t know how to explain that, but she looked forward to seeing her grandmother’s face when the pictures started coming in. Nothing made her grandmother smile more than seeing a scraggly piece of knitting.

That could wait, though, until after she got to take her grandmother on a real vacation, a thank-you for all she did. Well, it technically wasn’t Jenny paying for it by any stretch of the imagination, but she wasn’t about to let that get in the way of a good holiday.

“And… send,” she said, clicking the button.",mialbowy
"[RF] Deep in debt, this grandma must overhaul her knitting channel and become a Youtube influencer in order to prevent her family from inheriting her financial suffering.",EdgarAllanHobo,"The house her husband had built groaned in the wind, showing its age as much as he had. Every floorboard creaked, and every door squeaked, and, when the rain flooded the gutters, the roof leaked. If it had been built even ten years later, it would have been torn down as the hazard it was. But, as it was, it barely managed to be “historical” and so permitted to stay up—at least until a bad storm knocked it down.

Ann-Marie thanked God for keeping her home standing. She didn’t particularly think He had anything to do with it, but she was hardly going to thank the government. No, she had had better relationships with verrucas than with the government—local and federal. Drafted Harry to goodness knew where, got his leg shot off, and then shipped him back to spend the rest of his days either crying in pain or drunk off his mind on a cocktail of drugs. Then, when she finally lost her patience and took him to see someone that would actually help him, that Patriotic government of hers wouldn’t foot the bill.

So the seasons went, debt collectors rattling her door and getting a taste of her sharp tongue. Only, with his passing—a blessed relief for her, that he could spend his last years at ease and go to the Lord in his sleep—the cheques stopped coming in, and notices of collection became more frequent, riddled with words like “lawyers” and “final” and “eviction”.

Receiving charity wasn’t in her nature. Oh she was more than happy to lend a hand to those in need, but her own need always sounded hollow to her. Always another dollar she could save, another debt she could put off, so the years went. She was happy to live and to die that way.

At least, she was.

Her son, Jeremy, called her up one day, said a debt collector had knocked at their door, so he wanted to check everything was okay with her. She gave the reassuring answer a mother always gives, while her heart couldn’t decide whether to skip or race.

She had two sons and three daughters and, well-to-do as they were, she knew they weren’t much better off than her if a bit of bad luck came their way. No one really was, she thought. Gone were the days of picking up a square of land cheap and putting together a home at the cost of wood. Two of her daughters worked part-time, even with their husbands putting in the hours at city companies. The third ran a little catering business, but that was more a hobby, no children for her and her husband to pay for. As for her sons, well, she couldn’t take any money from them, not when that was money not spent on her grandchildren.

When it came to Ann-Marie, work had been a year as a secretary some four decades earlier, before her full-time job as a housewife began. As the children got older, she’d done some of this and some and that, baking for the galas and sewing for the church, but nothing more than token pay came out of those jobs. With her husband as he was, health waning, she’d not had time for much else anyway.

There was one thing, though. Her own grandmother had taught her knitting as a child, and she had carried on her whole life. But, her own girls had no interest in something so fiddly and old-fashioned, so she had thought the family patterns would come to rest with her. Then came Jenny, her first granddaughter, who would stay some weekends, and oh she loved to knit with granny. Some years later and her son-in-law—such a sweet boy—helped set her up with one of those computers, video calls letting her see everyone even when Harry was in a bad way. Jenny, the bright girl she was and growing up fast, would come over and record old Ann-Marie knitting, before putting it up on some fancy website so she could watch it back at home. It took a while for the technology to click, but Ann-Marie was happy for the company, and glad to know that her end wouldn’t be the end of her knitting.

By the time Harry passed, she’d put up quite the video collection of her patterns and small tips and how to start and anything else that Jenny or any of her other grandchildren asked for. Simple videos, they were warmly lit by the old bulbs that didn’t want to give up, or the roaring fireplace—central heating beyond her husband’s skills back in the day—and accompanied by her gentle voice, both by nature and by nature of her husband snoozing on the couch behind her. While not exactly an Internet sensation, she had a steady group of subscribers that would watch for a mix of knitting and grandmotherly warmth.

At some point—the years ran together at Ann-Marie’s age—Jenny had told her that some people actually made money off of their videos. There was something about advertising that she could remember. But, she knew the Lord helped those who helped themselves, and she could certainly knit, and she could certainly read.

So her days went, coming up with interesting patterns to knit as she looked into all this “Youtube” business. She’d never been daft and worked through the knotted mess of jargon and digital culture that hadn’t mattered to her before. If something really got her stuck, though, Jenny (or Hatty or Penny) was only a voice call away. Not that she told them what was going on, of course. Ann-Marie had her pride, thank you very much.

Still, she had trouble accepting some of the popular practises. An honest sort, she could hardly more come up with clickbait than throw a bullseye. But, she tried her best, knitting all sorts of big Internet topics and including them in the title. “Grann-Marie knits the doge.” She made patterns for teams, too, from football to soccer to basketball to baseball to hockey. With nothing else to do with most of her time, she happily spent day after day just knitting, softly chatting about whatever came to mind, or, if the cold got to her throat, listening to classical music quietly in the background.

It wasn’t an explosive rise by any measure, but, week by week, more people came to watch her videos, and they left interesting comments, too. She’d been worried about running out of things to knit, so the suggestions were a welcome relief. Month by month, the cents she earned on each video became dollars, slowly reaching the point where she could at least keep herself out of any more debt.

All the while, thoughts of fame or fortune never crossed her mind at all. Those numbers were just numbers. The only happiness she took from it all were the kind responses, people telling her how they took up knitting because of her and enjoyed it, sending her pictures of their own knitting, or even just the short thanks they gave to her for brightening their day. It reminded her of her younger years, the thanks her children would give before a meal, when her days were always full and interesting in their own way.

Then, one day, she received a message on Youtube. She had been sent many before, always wonderful messages, but this one was different. For a start, she knew the sender—even if she’d never met him. Of course, she knew about people pretending to be other people, so she asked Jenny to come over on the weekend, not mentioning the message.

“Grann-Marie!” Jenny said, bending down that little bit to properly hug her grandmother.

Ann-Marie chuckled, patting Jenny’s back like she did ten, no, twenty years ago. “How’s college, dear?”

“It’s, you know, college-y,” Jenny half-said, half-sighed. Then, she brightened right up. “The knitting club’s going well, though. New members again this year.”

“Oh that’s good,” Ann-Marie replied, her smile genuine.

Jenny laughed, and closed the door as she stepped inside. “Fireplace burning?”

“In November? Why, it never stops.”

Rubbing her hands, Jenny shuffled through the narrow corridor and into the lounge. The two of them went through the rest of the steps from there, offers of drinks and snacks and a rather animated conversation about knitting. Then, everything out of the way, Jenny finished her coffee and pulled up her knees, hugging them—like she did when she was but a child, listening to the clack of the knitting needles and the radio performance of some play she’d never heard of before or since.

“So, why’d you invite me over? Mic not working again?” Jenny asked, her tone light.

Ann-Marie laughed, and gently shook her head. “No, dear. Nothing like that.”

Biting her lip, Jenny couldn’t help but ask, “What, then? I’m curious now.”

“Well, someone sent me a message, you see. It’s just, I don’t know if it’s them,” Ann-Marie said, carefully explaining it as she walked over to her desk. Jenny followed her, peering over her shoulder as the computer woke up and loaded Youtube. “I clicked his face and it took me to his channel and everything, but it all sounds too good to be true, so I wanted to make sure.”

Jenny went to say something, only to stop as the inbox loaded and showed the sender. Her mind blanked.

“What do you think, dear? Am I being scammed?”

Working on instinct rather than thought, Jenny opened the message, scanning through it, only to read it again just to make sure it said what she thought it did. Then, she clicked around, checking the sender’s name for things like an uppercase I instead of a lowercase l, only to find it be entirely genuine.

“Really, why would someone want to fly me all the way to California? And pay me on top of that? It’s far too suspicious, don’t you think?”

Those words helped snap Jenny out of her daze, and she shook her head. “No, Grann-Marie, I think this is real.”

“You think? What would Mr. Torte want with me? His videos are all about these flashy games you kids play, not knitting.”

Regardless of whatever she was about to say, Jenny stopped herself as a more pressing question emerged. “You… watch his videos?”",mialbowy
"[WP] Earth is overpopulated and running out of space. The oceans are covered with floating cities. Jungles and forests are a relic of the past. Desperate, the nation's of the world band together to drill deep into the earth to create more habitable space. What they find there is not friendly....",GoPacersNation,"In the end, digging down proved to be easier. Only after hundreds of space travel attempts had failed, sending thousands of people in a deep cryosleep up in the air only to get lost in space and never wake up again, and too many space companies went bankrupt, humanity had simply given up. Humanity had been stubborn before they learned their lesson.

Digging down was the only sensible option. Thousands of years the temperature of the earth had slowly been rising, until most of the ice had pooled together in the vast, ever expanding oceans. The megacities remaining on the higher parts of the planet had been slowly degrading and falling into chaos. What had humanity expected, hoarding everyone that existed on those places. The floating cities had been much better off. At least there had been enough space to expand, and controlling the population on the floating atolls had proven to be a key factor in sustaining decent living conditions for the communities. But there was simply not enough building material available to keep creating new floating cities, and with the water level slowly rising through the lower ranks of the megacities, the Great Ruler had to take action. And so the digging to new places to live had begun.

Van Halen leaned against the wall of the excavation pit and slowly slid to the ground. They had been trapped and the shield keeping the ocean above away would not last forever.

""How close to the earthcore are we?"" he asked Vandelstein.

""Deep enough for *it* to find us.""

""Thats what I like about you. Always pissed off."" Van Halen sighed.

""You know what they say about the Dutchans. Always complaining about something."" he responded without making eye contact.

Vandelstein stood up and swept the sweat from his forehead with the back of his hand. Even if they would successfully found a city so close to the center of the earth, its inhabitants would probably be sweating for all their lives.

""Last readings let me believe we are about 20 miles from the earthcore. But since we are stuck here it does not really matter does it? Its only a matter of time before *it* finds us.""

Van Halen knew Vandelstein was right. The sole reason the whole process of digging humanity to a knew place to live went so damn slow was because of *it*. They digged two seperate shafts and every 30 minutes of so they switched to the other shaft. They had heard what happened to Girkenheist and Matterneye when they were too late to swap. The sound of it happening still haunted Van Halen. Now the shield giving in so the shaft would flood was the least of their concern. They would seize to exist the moment the millions of tons of water above them would crush their bodies. It would probably be less painful than when *it* found them first.

  
""You think we should deactivate the shield?"" asked Van Halen.

Vandelstein kneeled down next to Van Halen. ""It would probably a better way to go wouldn't it?""

Van Halen gave him an empty gaze. When he heard the low booming sound again, he snapped into focus. Distant rumbling emerged as the hairs in his neck rose. The burrow that trapped them was miles and miles under the face of the earth, sealed by the shield and incalculable amounts of water above it. But all of a sudden it let the drought trough. The air around them started howling and a gush of cold made Van Halen need a second try to fill his lungs with air while standing up.

""Do it."" he said.

Vandelstein looked at Van Halen. To his surprise nothing flashed by even tough he knew for fact he was living his last moments. 

""It was a good undertaking Vandel. But humanity was stubborn again. We should have seen the writings on the wall. Matterneye, Girkenheist. The rumours were true. And *it's* coming for us from below.""

""For fuck sake, lets not go to the grave complaining shall we!"" Van Halen snapped back.

Vandelstein looked him in the eye, a lump in his throat. He took the shield controller off his belt and stared at it for a second before they gave each other a firm hug. *It* could rush through them at any moment.

""We will not let *it* tear the souls from our bodies."" Vandelstein said.

""We will not. Fuck *it*."" replied Van Halen.

""Fuck *it*."" said Vandelstein with a nod.

There in that burrow the men still did not let go of each other, both looking upwards to the shield seperating them from the darkness of the ocean, soon to be crashing down on them, taking their lives away. Vandelstein fiddled with the shield controller and the redeeming beep sounded. They looked at each other and they both nodded. Vandelstein gave the final command and the shield disappeared.

"[WP] For an art project, you decided to sculpt an egg out of clay and paint it. One morning, you wake up to find that your art piece has just hatched.",Maximum_Pootis,"The egg was slightly cracked when I took it out of the oven. I sighed. I followed the instructions for MagiClay ( Premire Polymer with a mythical twist)   exactly as stated. I even bought a decorative bird's nest so I could display my project.

""Thanks a lot Rhiannon,"" I muttered to myself ""Thanks a whole lot."" The new agey saleswoman convinced me to buy it. She looked like she would fit in better at a Renaissance Faire than a chain craft store, but she seemed nice enough. 

""Remenber, follow the instructions and put your heart and soul into the design. "" She found me the woven nest and some grass filling. I rolled my eyes at the obvious attempt at the upsell, but took them. I am bad at confrontation. Besides, my beginners kit was for a Magiclay egg. It would be a cute display.

I could feel the frustration under my skin. Ever since I had been laid off from my job I was either anxious or angry . I decided to turn to crafts as a distraction. If nerdy,inept teens and bored, middle age moms could do it, then so could I.

It was a shame really. I put my heart and soul into the damn thing. It was the size of my fist and covered in intricate symbols. For the first a project of mine looked like the box example instead of girl scout reject art. Yeah, that's one badge I didn't get.

I scanned the back of the packaging. In fine print it read ""Small cracks are normal. Do not attempt to fill."" Well great. It did add some semblance of realism. Real silver lining.

My husband , Silas,came home promptly at 5 as usual. He handed me the college catalogue that came with the mail, and kissed me. "" Well babe , it could be a new start.  You can even beginners art."" I smiled.  It was clear with me that a creative disposition and artistic talent didn't necessarily go hand in hand.

As we sat down for a takeout dinner , cooking being another one of my weak spots, and Silas picked my egg out of the nest.  I had put the nest in the center of the table, hoping to add funky vibe .

He ran fingers over the three dimensional designs  .  ""Well  Eloise its sure is interesting.  Too bad its covered in cracks.""

"" Yeah, like my mind. Barely holding it together but still interesting."" I hadn't meant to be so sour, but these days I couldn't help myself. We finished our Chinese in silence.

Silas had been nothing but supportive since I had been laid off. The department store was downsizing and I had the worst sales .Not to mention I hated to shill credit cards or beg for donations. I was everyone's sarcastic best friend but I never was a team player.

After my husband went to bed I laid my head on the table and cried into my arms. I meant to eventually get to bed and apologize but I fell asleep that way. I awoke to a cup of lukewarm coffee and a note. 

"" Elosie, today is another day. Love you lots. P.s. you didn't have to break your project.""

I was confused by what he meant until I looked at the nest. The clay was broken, almost like it had hatched. Huh. I wasn't the brightest before coffee, but I didn't see how I'd ever figure that one out.

Then I remembered the 1-800 number on the back of the box. I had questions and MagiClay at a lot to answer for. More than likely I would politely ask for a refund. Strangers and making phone calls always made me nervous. I would probably be talked down to a few coupons and later write a scathing online review.

I dialed and listened to the pre recorded message.   "" Congratulations! You passed the test and have successfully activated your familiar. Your Welcome to Witchcraft packet will be arriving in the mail any day now. Don't worry about making food for your familiar, they feed off of the nightmares and bad luck of your enemies. Thank you for choosing MagiClay.""

Click. I realised I was disconnected and was too stunned to be angry. I heard some soft meowing and felt a tiny body rub against my leg. We've never owned a cat, at least not until now.

"[WP] The godlike entity that was ruling over humanity has been canned for inappropriate usage of powers, the powers above have arranged it so each human above the age of 18 will play god for a day and when everyone has had their turn the best performance will win the job.",NaKeepFighting,"It's been this way for who knows how long. A thousand years? A million? No one is born. Nothing changes. No one dies. I mean, technically all those things happen, every day, but then it all resets, and the next person has a go. They get to play God. Big G, because there's only one real God. Sure, we now know the little g gods are out there, too. They've all had their turn, and clearly failed to earn the promotion. All the dead, too. And today, it's down to one last human adult, before they start letting something lower try. Chimps, maybe. 

And, of course, the one human is me. And every day, I've watched each attempt. There were too many people who just wasted their time destroying everything. There were a lot more who turned the world into their personal pleasure palace. They were those who tried to make things better, and just made folks angry. A rare few actually made things better. End of the day, it didn't matter.

So I debated what to do, if and when my turn came. Do I just steal the good ideas? No, if it didn't work for them, why would it work for me? Could I come up with something better? I doubted it. Of course did I really want a Godhood you could be fired from? 

I stepped up to the pedestal and felt the power flow into me, the knowledge of a universe pouring into my brain. And I was tempted to try destruction, since nothing mattered anyway, but I remembered how much dying hurt. Honestly, the whole Godhunt was just awful. I missed the way things were before. I felt that most people did. So, I went ahead and put them all back. Today would just be another day. No memories of the countless days of disorder. No idea that anything had changed. Sure, the memories would all be back tomorrow, but for today, they'd all be able to go about their business. And that was all I did, as far as changing the world. Beyond that, I just watched them. It was a strange feeling, not just seeing people by their actions, but also their intentions, the desires in their little heads. Occasionally, I'd do some good, shove someone out of harm's way, or something, but never in a way they'd notice me. I was too worried I'd break the spell early, let the centuries of memories come back.

Finally, the day ended. I braced myself for the reset, but I didn't happen. That was six thousand years ago. I don't know if I was approved as the God, or maybe my ""everyone forget"" trick affected the folks in charge. Whatever it is, I've enjoyed watching humanity grow, even with a God like me, from our tribes to cities, to the unified nations. Going from foraging to farming. Building incredible machines. Taming lightning like we'd tamed fire. So much. I'm so proud of humans, too proud to interfere. And I'll keep watching, because I can't wait to see what you do next. ",Simplersimon

[IP] Innsmouth,Nightingale115,"*Cont'd*

Bernard held his breath and strained his ears. He could hear a faint groan in the distance.

""You hear that?"" He whispered.

Theodore was silent, but waved to him. *Yes. Shut up.*

The groaning grew louder as they moved further into the alley. Finally, their lantern light found a crumpled figure that was supporting itself against the brick wall.

""Ho there!"" Theodore yelled. There was a slight quaver in his gruff voice.

The figure groaned louder. Bernard squinted. In the dim light, he saw an old man with a long white beard, doubled over, clutching his distended belly. He was in terrible pain.

""I said ho there!"" Theodore shouted again, firmer this time.

The old man let out a long, deep moan. The moan grew louder and deeper until it was a deafening bellow that resonated in the narrow alleyway.

Theodore took a step forward ""I command you, by order of the minutemen to sto--""

The old man snapped upright. He stood stiff as a board, facing away from the Theodore and Benard. Bernard's mouth gaped. The man must have been eight feet tall.

The old man began to turn around slowly. As he turned, the lantern light grazed over his face. Bernard took a step back, in horror.

The old man was not a man at all. His skin was sloughing off his bones like boiled meat. Blackness filled the sockets of where his eyes should have been. A long sleeve of skin dangled from his nose, which drooped to one side. Something--moving was coming out his mouth, which was unnaturally wide on account of his jaw being unhinged from its socket.

*Tentacles*. Bernard thought, in amazed disgust. *They're bloody tentacles coming out of his mouth!*

""Fucking hell!"" Theodore managed. He aimed his blunderbuss.

Before he could pull the trigger, the old man sprung forward landing on top of him. Theodore let out a shriek as the old man began to dig madly at his chest. The tentacles unfurled out of his mouth and wrapped around Theodore's neck.

""Shoo--"" Theodore managed, wheezing. ""Shoot!""

Bernard squared his sights and pulled the trigger.

Click.

He tried again. And again.

Click. Click.

Theodore let out a scream as the man's flailing scratching began to draw blood from his chest. More tentacles began to explode out of the old man's back and snaked their way around Theodore's legs.

Bernard tossed his blunderbuss aside and grabbed his knife from inside his coat.

*Cut its damn heart out!*

""Back to hell, you fucking devil!"" Bernard shouted as he dived toward the creature. He plunged his blade into its chest madly. Again, and again.

The creature screamed, its tentacles writhing and flailing in the air.

""Die! Die!"" Bernard yelled. He kept stabbing. It was the only thing he could do.

He didn't know how long he had been stabbing when Theodore finally pulled him off of the creature.

""I think you got him, mate."" Theodore said, wheezing.

Bernard slumped down against the alley wall. Tears ran down his face.

Theodore crouched down next to him. For a few minutes, neither man said anything.

Finally, Theodore reached deep into his coat to grab something. He handed it to Bernard. Bernard stared at it, not comprehending.

""It goes in your mouth, mate."" Theodore said. He took the cigar back from Bernard, lit it, and then put it back in his hands. Then he lit his own.

The men sat there, puffing cigars, watching ooze drip slowly out of the unearthly corpse a few feet away from them.

Theodore took the cigar out of his mouth. He scrunched his face, then after a moment, shook his head.

""What?"" Bernard asked, looking at his friend.

""Perspective."" Theodore said.

""What do you mean? What perspective?""

""It's funny, the perspective you get from a night like this.""

Bernard nodded solemnly and puffed his cigar.

Theodore continued. ""I reckon I could eat one of Maergery's meat pies after all.""",WahooD89
[IP] Innsmouth,Nightingale115,"Bernard fought to control a shiver as he wiped his brow.

*Damn this fog!* He thought to himself. *April's nearly through and there hasn't been one godforsaken night this year when I haven't had a soaking chill in my bones. Damn this fog! And damn this town!*

He shuffled slowly down the boardwalk, lantern at his waist, making his rounds for the evening. A steady wind was blowing across the central canal and carrying the dampness of the night with it. He had bundled himself up as tightly as his minuteman uniform would allow. The bylaws mandated that a novice such as Bernard must wear the standard issue olive trenchcoat and trousers while on patrol so that the townsfolk would recognize him. He had discovered that a wool waistcoat and heavy shirt helped somewhat, but they didn't make up for the trench coat's flimsy thin lining. Clearly no one from the Bureau of Provisions had ever done a stint in Innsmouth.

The ancient wood of the boardwalk creaked under his boots. Bernard reminded himself to walk heel to toe. He was not the biggest man in the company, but he was above average in width and therefore carried some risk that the slipshod carpentry of the Innsmouth docks might decide to suddenly retire from its life of service instead of supporting his frame. The added weight of the blunderbuss slung over his shoulder didn't help matters.

""Ho there!"" A gruff voice called out ahead of him. The light of a lantern began to cut through the gray fog.

""Crosses and stars!"" Bernard called back.

""Is that you, Bernard?""

""I wish it weren't. Faring all right, Theodore?""

A tall, gaunt man emerged from the fog. Theodore tipped his hat to Bernard as he approached, and continued chomping down on a fat cigar that cast a dull red glow over his lined face.

""Never better,"" Theodore responded with a grunt. ""Just thought I'd take a midnight stroll with the missus."" He tapped the stock of his blunderbuss with his lantern. ""Enjoy this fine coastal evening.""

Bernard tipped his hat theatrically and bowed to Theodore's gun. ""Evening ma'am."" He put his hand up to his mouth, and whispered conspiratorially: ""She's looking a bit thin lately, eh?""

The two men chuckled. Theodore hailed from rural West Brom and Bernard grew up in the densest ghetto of Winsborough City, but they had become fast friends since being conscripted and shipped out to Innsmouth two years ago.

""Only about 20 more laps around Belham docks and it'll be time for breakfast."" Bernard said as they walked their patrol.

""If Maergery's serving that godforsaken meat pie again I'll just go ahead and volunteer for morning patrol, too."" Theodore responded. ""She's been adding rats and pigeons, to it, I'd bet. Damn foul stuff, and it makes the stomach--""

He stopped. The hounds near St. Gertrude's Chapel were barking.

Bernard swallowed hard. He and Theodore locked eyes. Theodore chomped down on his cigar, then nodded.

They both set down their lanterns on the dock and shouldered their blunderbusses, quickly checking the charge and the powder. Each man reached in his waistcoat and removed the leather guardstrap on their knife. Then they crouched down, picked the lantern up, and attached it to the iron mooring on the blunderbuss.

Theodore led the way to St. Gertrude's, with Bernard close behind. The barking got louder as they neared, echoing sharply off the brick buildings that bordered the dock.

Bernard's heart pounded in his chest. *God save us from these nightmares.*

The hounds in front of the chapel were straining against their leashes. They snarled and barked at the alley across the street, next to the cannery.

Bernard gripped his blunderbuss and strained his eyes, looking for movement. He cursed the flickering shadows that lapped the edge of the lantern light.

Theodore moved ahead, slowly, but surely. Bernard followed. The two men entered the alley.

[EU] You are a Predator who's decided to challenge yourself by only bringing your wrist claws to hunt humans. Only problem is that you've arrived on Purge night and the game is suddenly much more challenging than expected.,ParameciaAntic,"""If you follow me, ladies and gentlemen, we have a lovely stage for our show tonight!"" Mr. Wexler had both hands up and high over his head as the double doors opened by his guards. He was confident that the show he had planned would get as high marks as it did every year. Blood and champagne, terror and murder, that was his line of work. His great theater with its vaulted ceilings, scarlet walls, and gilt brass trim sported a stainless steel stage where his clients could bid on cattle to slaughter. His guests would file through the wing doors while he and his men made up the center column of stretcher bound victims who pleaded, whimpered, or silently cried themselves at the inevitable. ""No tears, please."" He'd tell the soon-to-be victims. Not until the blades went in them. He had counted on another show stopper as his victims included the young, the old, the pregnant, and the beautiful. All of his victims poor, or at least poor when compared to the perpetrators in their suits and gowns.

He stopped mid-track, however, after a few steps down the center alley. Blood had already splashed upon his chrome stage. He turned on his head of security to ask if the janitorial staff had a purge party on there own. Didn't they know failing him meant they'd be the next round of entertainment? But he paused as several guards looked up. The droplets of blood fell from the ceiling, a batch of guards suspended by their ankles. Their bodies flayed of skin.

&amp;#x200B;

""What the hell, I leave you guys alone for five minutes, and you start screwing around?"" Wexler snapped. ""That wasn't us, sir. Last report my guys were playing cards."" Nulty noticed how their clients murmured and shuffled on their feet as they greeted those who were dead, but not on the client's terms. The hairs on Wexler's neck stiffened at a soft electrical sensation.

&amp;#x200B;

The blades pierced the small of the back of the guard who escorted the western wing of clients. A warm river of red ran down his back and formed an outline of a hand covered in sparks. The force that struck him lifted him off his feet as a scream issued from him. ""Ahhh!"" He cried and fired wildly down the line behind him. The bullets struck several men and women, Wexler's clients, all of that old money splattered in their tuxes and gowns by hot lead. It did not help that several men in the center column saw the man dispatched and thrown across the room. They laid suppressive fire on the crowd.

&amp;#x200B;

""Those bastards killed, Kevin!"" One guard said as he kept firing. Old men and women held up their hands to halt the slaughter of rich killers, but their pleading eyes, much like the eyes of the victims past, received an answer with bullets. A soft whistle in the air and a man on the eastern wing cried as a thrown blade struck him in the chest. ""It's an ambush!"" Nulty cried. He joined several of the guards in firing the other half of the rich. Several had scurried back up the causeway into the main lobby, but several had their bellies and chests blown open by fire.

It was during the second firefight that Wexler's eyes raised. He saw what looked at first as an optical illusion, a ripple in the air. As it kept advancing his eyes semi-adjusted until it was evident to him that the illusion was in the shape of a rather large man. The figure's movements were fast, Wexler did not even register that it had thrown something until a warmth touched his cheek. He looked on either side and noticed that Nulty and his other guard grabbed at knife wounds from their throat and chest respectively. Blood pooled out as they sank to their knees. 

A third guard rushed forward and asked, ""What's goin-"" His voice was cut as the figure broke from whatever it had used... a demon with a spell? An alien with technology? All Wexler was sure of was that a tall biped with dark green or black skin with a pale beige stomach had advanced and plunged a set of blades into the third man. It lifted the impaled guard. Gravity took care of the rest as the man sunk closer to the alien, gasping aloud as his innards left a slimy trail on the twin blades.

&amp;#x200B;

Tyradis, the Predator, turned its head at Wexler who had taken two steps back. The Human had grabbed one of the two pistols tucked into the belt and yanked a Human female off of the cart his prey had brought several of its kind into. Throughout the night the Predator had seen displays that both infuriated and confused the creature. He had seen these Terrans dishonorably hunt the unarmed, the young, and infirm. He could, in a way, respect those who fought each other for the thrill of direct combat, but most hunted for trophies that they had no right or take. There was no sport to it. He had known of large theaters amongst his kind, but on his world, such places were for honorable combat, and not the slaughter that this species took part in. It's head tilted as it studied the gray-haired male hold his gun against the woman's head. Readouts within his mask showed how the female was with child. No sport, no sport at all. Yet, the male kept her close, he pressed the muzzle against her head as if a threat to the Tyradis. He weighed his options, would his honor suffer too badly if he impaled the pregnant female and skewer them both? He knew he could not take her as a trophy. He hesitated when her hand gripped around the second weapon tucked into the male's pants and pulled the trigger.

A sudden flash erupted, and a sharp noise conflicted with the Human male's scream. Tyradis had to respect the female. She was able to slip out of the grasp of the man she had attacked, as the female moved she managed to draw the blackened barrel weapon from the male's bloodstained pants. Tyradis used the opening created by the attack to slip his blades into the male's stomach. He jerked up, Human flesh and bone sliced so easily. The man's face was a mask of agony and terror as the rending blades cut through his lungs and heart. Tyradis had many skulls to take on this night.

He withdrew the blades and turned his head to face the female. Still armed, did she wish to battle him? He narrowed his eyes through the mask as he turned to meet her. He could see the woman faltered in her resolve, the gun slipped from her hand and clacked to the floor. He turned back to take skulls while she busied freeing the other capture Humans. Tyradis was satisfied. This theater was plentiful in trophies, but he had a long night ahead of him.

- We are one of (if not the most) powerful militaries in the world.  As the other guy said, if the US burns, other countries are probably gone already too.

- We are relatively isolated which makes land invasions much more difficult (meaning bombs would probably do majority of damage).  We also have more guns than people so a land invasion would be near suicide.  

- Majority of population live on the coasts so a lot of the inland is mostly sparse.

"[WP] Devastation and war hits the United States. Americans are fleeing but other countries are building walls and shutting their borders, comparing Americans with vermin and infestation.",ShrimpCrackers,"President Hillary Clinton laughed maniacally, throwing herself into a coughing fit. Having rigged the 2020 election, she had ousted her mortal enemy - however, it was only a matter of time before her plot was discovered. Acting quickly, she dismantled what border security measures the previous President had erected and, in flagrant disregard of all sense, decency, and policy positions she held two decades ago, opened the borders to any and all who wished to emmigrate - making sure, of course, that her allies in the cartels were given preferential treatment upon arrival. Then, with the help of her friends at the CIA, she had prepared for the inevitable accusations from the disaffected Conservatives. Not being very subtle, even Texas had been swung blue - and now, thanks to her immigration policy, would never be red again. The accusations came, and when two African Americans were shot and killed by a Hispanic officer in Texas, cries of racism were leveled at the police commissioner - a cis-het white male and a conservative to boot. Seizing the opportunity, she used the ensuing violence to mask her sell another 20% of US uranium to Russia, and went on television often to make calls for unity and to disparage all Republicans as white supremacists. This was too much, and the mindless, morally deficient Antifa foamed at the mouth to get revenge - and so they did. What had once been protests with a few punches thrown soon became all-out brawls, and eventually civil war. The conservatives, having far more firearms than their counterparts, were quickly gaining the upper hand...and while Clinton was fine with the tens of thousands of injured or dead, she couldn't have her image tarnished in front of her ersatz allied by such a loss. Thankfully for her, the CIA had been working on a slew of infectious diseases, poses, plagues, and all manners of illnesses for release as a population control measure. A mixture of a few of these were forcibly injected into some prisoners, before their memories were wiped with techniques learned through MKULTRA. These prisoners were sent to the conservative camps, pretending to be Patriots who had seen too much...little did the conservatives know that by taking in these compatriots they were inviting their own doom. 

The diseases took a fee days to incubate, and were readily transferred via air - it wasn't long before huge swaths of the conservatives were fatally infected. Unfortunately, so too was much of the US population.

She caught her breath after a few moments, and realized that she was being held upright by two secret servicemen - apparently she had fallen backward without noticing. She returned to standing, without thanking them, and looked back to the projector screen in front of her. Displayed on the wall was a CNN broadcast, showing a crowd of families attempting to cross into Mexico, presumably in Hope's of escaping the mysterious plague. Anderson Cooper was on screen, chastising these Americans as ""invaders"", ""imperialists"", and ""territorial appropriators"", showing no sympathy whatsoever for these innocents. Hillary mouthed along with him, a wicked smile erupting on her face as she had done so - she had written these lines, and based on the live data from the NSA, the reaction from the public had been just as she wished. The families were shown politely waiting in lines at designated checkpoints, and later cuts to them being driven off by men in uniform. Four of the citizens were shot - which sent her off again into another fit of laughter as she remembered what had happened at Benghazi, and how brutally Gaddafi had been killed.

Yes, Hillery ""Killery"" Clinton had won again - and this time, there was nothing that idiotic orange billionaire could do about it. ",MithradatesMegas

Americans are fleeing but other countries are building walls and shutting their borders, comparing Americans with vermin and infestation.",ShrimpCrackers,"Dude if there are fucking nukes raining down on the US you can rest assured that the rest of the world is in deep shit too therefore we can rule out nukes.  As you and I both mentioned, most damage to the US continental itself would be from bombing.  However with how strong the Navy and Air Force is along with having bases all over Europe and Asia, any country that tries to attack will be dealt with pretty quickly.  And since a land invasion is pretty much a stupid idea, that is essentially ruled out.  And since we are an ocean away from the rest of the world, we have plenty of time to detect missiles and aircraft coming in.  The only issues we would have would be a surprise attack from subs but after that initial attack, it would be very difficult to make any other attacks since the US would be on high alert.

"[WP] Devastation and war hits the United States. Americans are fleeing but other countries are building walls and shutting their borders, comparing Americans with vermin and infestation.",ShrimpCrackers,"To be fair, having a powerful military means shit outside of nuclear deployment infrastructure. 

The US populace never endured a domestic war since the Civil War era, and the reaction of the US populace to something like a nuclear strike exchange, and the fallout of it, is unpredictable and is independent of the number of say, fighter jets or ships.

I, personally, believe that the US would inevitably collapse should *something* go awry with a foreign power. One - lack of nation’s historical experience to actual, devastating war. Two - individualistic mentality would fuck up cohesion that’s essential to stabilitizing a nation in the face of war. Three - lack of political will. Currently there are no figureheads in the US that could create unity during military struggles. They could appear spontaneously, but it’s not a given.

US historically always played on the offensive, which meant that only military personnel was embroiled in the war, but not the general populace. It hadn’t been in a defensive position (which would spell setbacks for civilians), and nothing in the last 100 years shows that these civilians would respond to it with grace. In fact, the amount of armament in civilian hands would create more turmoil in a scenario where there isn’t a land invasion, but only a long-distance attack - within the chaos, with no clear enemy on hand, all these guns would most likely turn on each other as isolated pockets of people attempt to band together and establish safety zones.

And, finally - US is a powerful navy player, but it has no deterrent from a nuclear strike aimed at high-density, urban areas. Nobody has it, and the Big Nuclear 3 (US, Russia, China) are completely leveled in this category. Moreover, Russia’s development of hypersonic missles capable of carrying nuclear loads, offsets the anti-missile early-warning efforts that had been deployed against it, so the field is truly leveled in that regard.",BlackOmegaPsi

The humans are insane. 

The members of any sane race in the galaxy, when faced with multiple options they will simply choose the one most advantageous to themselves. 

Obedience or Servitude? Choose Obedience 

Servitude or slavery? Choose  Servitude 

Slavery or death? Choose Slavery

But the humans... I once watched a human burn his own home down, everything he had ever built along with himself in the mere hope of trapping some of our forces in the blaze. 

I've watched humans with bombs strapped to their own bodies run into our lines. 

For the first years of the conflict we thought perhaps they were some kind of hive intelligence and thus such madness was really a sign that an unknown central entity was trying to preserve itself and maximize benefit to itself. We wasted hundreds of thousands of lives searching for the controlling minds to no result... everything else we have learned of humans shows that each is alone in their own mind. 

But these humans... some seek the maximum benefit for themselves, some join our forces for sufficient rewards... but I've come to realize that many aren't even trying to maximize benefit for themselves, it's notable that they target the ones they call ""traitors"" and ""turncoats"" above all else, preferring to target them over more logical or higher value targets. 

But the darkest realization has been that they don't just fight to keep land for themselves, they'll fight to *keep us from having it* and if they can't stop us from taking it they'll burn the crops, salt the soil, destroy any infrastructure, sow the land with mines and tripwires... purely so that we cannot use it, so that nobody can **ever** use it. 

In researching human history we have discovered concepts that are highly unusual for a sapient species, the most worrying was termed Mutually Assured Destruction. Prior to our arrival one of the ways the humans maintained peace was a standing threat between their major powers to effectively make the planet uninhabitable should one side attempt a first strike. 

It appears that this was the normal state of being for the humans but even more alarmingly, they considered it normal for great powers to hold weapons in reserve that they simply agreed not to use to enforce ""rules of war"" against each other. Even after the 10 years of horror we have experienced on this planet it appears that there are some weapons the humans have simply chosen not to deploy.... yet. So far they've assumed that we must be holding something similar in reserve. But in their deep bunker and hidden labs we've learned that they have biological weapons that pose almost as much danger to those who launch them as to the targets. Chemical weapons that destroy all life that may blow back at them if the wind changes, nuclear weapons that can glass vast tracts of land. We have evidence that they've been adapting our own technology to create nanological weapons that may pose a risks to other star systems should they be triggered. 

If we continue this war they will burn the world and will do anything in their power damage our empire in the process.

As such I believe we are facing the choice: admitting defeat and withdrawing vs death. 

My recommendation is that we withdraw. This war is not and can never be to the advantage of the empire.

The story of how the Human race found itself not only as part of The Unity, but also as it’s main military councilors, is a sad and funny one, that demonstrates some lessons in how not to make a first contact. 

Until the Earthling war, when the Unity council decided that a system or planet was of interest, and should become part of the government, there were two possibilities, Advanced species were properly contacted through diplomatic means, and a agreement of union was signed, immediately bringing the planet into the galactic-political sphere. In the case of undeveloped or barbarian species, a show of military might was made, so that they understood the superiority of the Unity, once compliant, they would be slowly uplifted and observed until they could be trusted to behave.

By observations, earth was considered a beautiful if a bit crowded planet, humans had spread across it’s entire surface, with their “primitive” machines and ideas. The system was located in the middle of a sparsely populated sector and would be the perfect starting point for an expansion/colonization campaign. All they had to do now was bring the Humans into their control. 

As it was usual, a Glorious Mission was sent. 50.000 of the best, noblest and prized soldiers of the hundreds of different species in the unity were embarked into the great golden cruiser that was the symbol and pride of the Unity Military. Its surface covered with images and names of those who were part of previous Glorious Missions. The troops inside it swelled with pride of their mission, not only they would prove the superiority of their power, but would also help to bring a wayward, backwater species into the galactic scenario. It was a great task, and a reason to be proud. 

Unfortunately for them, they understood nothing of humankind, or how it reacted when backed into a corner, or threatened by a bigger power. 

As it was of costume in these missions, once arriving in the orbit of the earth, the ship transmitted a message, ordering the humans to prepare for Combat. A empty location, distant of any urban centers, in the largest desert of the planet was chosen as the battlefield. There the Humans would for the first time come in contact with alien species, and the Unity would have their view of the universe shattered. 

The Ship landed in the desert, a few cliks from the specified combat location, and the army marched, it’s armors adapted to the scalding sun of the region, they marched single file to the location, quickly assuming the traditional combat position of the Unity Military: A long firing line, with long range weapons on the back, and replacements behind it. And so they waited. The humans did not seem to come, but their transmissions left no uncertainty that they had understood the message. Maybe they were afraid. Maybe they did not had armies. On the face of this doubt, the High Commander of the Glorious Mission took a decision. He fired the first shot.

Ceremonial as it was, their ship had a few weapons, and so they fired a few laser barrages into the sky, creating a light show over the skies of the entire planet. They did not realize at that moment, but their show of force drove the humans into panic. Satellites had been knocked out of orbit, A passenger plane was almost hit, migratory birds had their flight routes disrupted. To the humans, it was quite clear now that this enemy had no diplomatic intentions.   


It was 2 days after the combined day for the combat, and a day after the laser attack, that the human response came. Several primitive rockets fired in the direction of the ship in orbit, and 2 towards the Glorious Army, now camping in the desert, waiting for a human response. The energy shields were up on both places, but they did nothing against the nuclear heat and impact wave, and the radiation that followed. The Golden Ship, that had seen countless battles, was knocked out of the sky. The Glorious army, who had never been defeated, broken and killed in a single flash of light. Their final transmissions filled the Unity Council with fear. Using atomic weapons with such carelessness? As a first strike no less? Now the humans had to be brought to heel. 

A Glorious expedition was declared, with several ships and armies being put under direct control of the Council. The first move would be one of power. They would invade directly 10 of the largest human concentrations on the planet. This way, any nuclear attacks would also kill their own people, not counting the effect it would have when they marched through the greatest human cities to meet their forces in battle. 

The first of their ships to arrive went to what was considered the largest target. An enormous urban zone in a long island chain off the coast of their largest landmass. Instead of landing, the troops were teleported to the ground, and immediately realized they were in trouble. The human cities were labyrinthic in their design, with no clear way to differentiate between civil and military targets, the troops decided to march in the direction of a huge red tower in the horizon, probably a monument to a leader’s virility or something of the sort.

This march would become known as the “path of blood”. The soldiers were attacked from all directions. With the targets disappearing before they could target someone. Primitive aircrafts dropped explosives and fired kinetic rounds at them, before leaving with great velocity, once arriving in the tower, there were only 500 of the 50000 who had landed. And they immediately surrendered, in shock of the carnage that had been inflicted upon them. 

Tokyo was not the only place where these scenes happened. In Shanghai, the Chinese army outnumbered them greatly, and accepted no quarter. In New York they were met by tanks and machine gun positions along wall street, In Mexico City, their ranks were broken by the first time, and many of the bodies of their soldiers would never be found. They had victories in places like Cairo and Karachi, but they proved futile when the population started sacrificing itself, with explosives on vehicles and even on themselves, thinning their already dwindled ranks, and damaging their failing moral even more. It was in Seoul that for the first time, they saw humans using technology adapted from theirs, and in São Paulo, for the first time in their history, a enemy surrounded Unity forces, and ordered them to surrender and retreat from their planet, or face the consequences.

In other times, the Unity would have laughed in face of this threat, and sent more and better equipped soldiers to the planet, maybe even orbital weapons, but not only the humans and their insane, asymmetrical type of warfare had made a dent in their armor. With almost half a million soldiers dead on their side, a number that rivalled those of the old, terrible, expansion wars, many on the council were ready to sit and discuss a new idea. Maybe quarantining the entire sector to keep the humans at bay, or even changing the course of a nearby meteor to crash onto their planet, for more dishonored and distasteful that that could seem, was considered as a option.  
  

All of this changed when, around 6 months after the initial transmission, with their invasion given as a loss, and only a few ships remaining on the system to keep an eye in the human homeworld, the golden ship left the atmosphere of the earth. 

Fixed by a mixture of human and Unity technology, it contained all the soldiers that had been captured during the invasion, along with them, a message from the human governments. They wanted peace, they wanted to negotiate, and this was the proof that this message was sent in good faith. The bodies of their dead soldiers would also be sent back in the following weeks. The once captured soldiers bringing stories of how their captors were curious about where they were from, what where their intentions, and why attack them in what, to the humans had been such a foolish way of fighting. They told of how the humans worked tirelessly to understand and retrofit the technology of their attackers, of how scared they were after the original attack, and of how this “primitive”, “backwards” civilization responded to the threat of an invasion from a higher force not with fear, but with cunning. 

A year later, Humans would become the youngest race to be admitted into the Unity, and to have a seat in the council, by reason of merit. “Human Warfare” as it became known, would become a core subject in the military academies on Unity planets, the Human diplomats tried to dispel this vision of their species as scary, but they seemed to relish on the fact that “Fighting humans in their homeworld” became an expression for making a stupid mistake. 

Now, a century later, Earth is known for much more than a warground, and the humans have carved their place among the Unity. The First Contact protocols have long changed, to include diplomacy even with races that seem to have no real power. An invasion is considered the last solution. But if it gets to that point, you can be sure that somewhere in the vanguard, there will be a human strategist of commander, ready to remember the galaxy where they got their reputation from.

"[WP] Aliens invade earth, but they have never understood the concept of guerilla warfare. Humanity's doom is out there, marching toward us in neat, straight lines.",TeddyBearToons,"People have a terrible understanding of scope and scale. It’s just a light-year, how many of them could there be? Gee Ben, I don’t know, how many alien ships do you think can fit into *six trillion miles*? One by one, unceasing, and that’s just all we could observe. There could be infinitely more equally patient, equally ordered bugs out there just marching toward us. I check my watch. It’s about time. Groaning, I roll off the couch in the break room and head toward my post.

“Mornin’ Ben.” I pass another grunt, raising my hand in acknowledgment. I make my way sluggishly to the computer screen that’s been my life for the past two years. Fingerprint scanned, iris recognized, welcome Ben to the World Operational Defense Satellite Network (WODSaN). I check my watch again, I’m thirty minutes ahead of schedule, that’s fine, better too early than too late. Several commands later and I have the damn bugship found and targeted by the computer. 

“Press enter to confirm launch” the cool, computerized voice said. Without looking I pressed the button. I could do this blindfolded at this point. I didn’t bother trying to peer through the thick, opaque, hole of a window – I knew the invaders’ ship had been detonated. Just like the others. You could catch a glimpse of those strange silver forms evacuating the ship right before the missile’s impact. They’d float in space with the rest of the debris until another ship picked them up.
I logged out, set my alarm, and went to find my bunk. I hadn’t been sleeping well for months. 

“FIELDS!” Damn, I just closed my eyes. Blearily, I rose to attention.

“Sir?”

“Do you mind explaining why in the goddamned hell we just got reports of twelve confirmed casualties?” Flecks of spittle hit my face as Commander Jacobs closed the distance between us faster than my eye could follow. I craned my neck to make eye contact with him. His face reminded me of an apple, red and shiny, rage and sweat in equal measure. I tried not to flinch.

“Sir?” I responded, not understanding. I did my job.

“*Sir? SIR*” He mocked, “I don’t know how you fucked up but boy you really did, you really fucking did Fields. ‘Computers are unreliable’ they told me, ‘what if the power goes out? What if something crashes?’ No, we just NEEDED a team to press a damn button. I don’t know how all five of you managed to sleep through a goddamned alien invasion but now we have bodies on the ground! Do you understand *that*.” It wasn’t a question.

“Sir, I –”  I was floundering with my watch, trying to pull up the log of my activity. I saw the confirmed launch. No way any of the bugs had slipped by, the system never made a mistake.

“You better choose your next words very carefully or you’ll be the next thing we launch into space.” Commander Jacobs narrowed his eyes, barely able to control his breathing. 

His phone rang, giving me a brief respite to collect my thoughts. I could only hear his side of the conversation. “What? Yes. What do you mean we’re empty? None? NONE? You fucking me? What the hell are they doing about it? They realize this is a time sensitive issue? Christ. Christ. Christ, yeah, I understand.” The color drained from his face throughout the call. He hung up and sat heavily on the bed, rubbing his face in his hands. “Fields…”

“Yes, sir?” 

“We’re out of goddamned ammunition.”

“No way.” 

“Russia pulled out of the agreement, then China. We already mined our country to hell, there’s nothing we can dig up to fight with anymore.”

“Why would they do that? With respect sir, that’s the stupidest thing I ever heard.”

He sighed, “some political nonsense. Something about how WODSaN could be turned against them once the aliens are all killed. They wanted the base moved to under their jurisdiction. The higher ups refused.”

“But there’s literally trillions of alien ships still coming at us!” I said incredulously. 

“You know that, I know that. But they don’t see it every day like we do. It’s just an abstraction to them.”

We stood in silence for a moment, trying to comprehend what the future would hold. Commander Jacobs broke first. “You know, Fields? I don’t think we’ve ever actually killed any of those bugs. They always retreat and regroup before we do any serious damage.”

“Who would have thought attacking your enemy one at a time would be an unbeatable strategy.”

He let out a short, barking laugh. “Just wait ‘em out. Straight lines and politics. Keep the pressure on and we’ll crack first. Smart buggers.”

We stood. “What now sir?” I asked. 

“As far as I’m concerned you’re free to spend the end of days as you see fit. I’m going to tell the rest of the unit then I’m guessing I’ll see you at the bar.”

“Cheers sir.”

He grimaced and turned to leave. As he shut the door behind him I heard him muttering, “straight lines and politics.”

"[WP] Aliens invade earth, but they have never understood the concept of guerilla warfare. Humanity's doom is out there, marching toward us in neat, straight lines.",TeddyBearToons,"After a decade of war, to the shock of the enemy, mankind still resisted. The Srengian strategy of marching in straight lines and expecting the humans to just lay down their weapons and give up, had surprisingly not worked much. Large amounts of soldiers were needed to hold a single conquered area, and the high command were terrified of asking for even more reinforcements. They had even lost a third of their ships, after mankind had retrofitted a small transport ship thought destroyed, into a suicide charge filled with enough nuclear weapons to destroy the Moon. Which horrified the high command, they thought all nuclear weapons and all facilities capable of producing them had been destroyed as the first strike in the war.

High command spent weeks debating among themselves the blame for the failure to pacify such a primitive world. And weeks more to try and decide between their next course of action. The fleet, which had only seen one major defeat thus far, argued for bombarding the entire planet until a sufficiently large continent, such as Asia or Africa, was glassed. The army and the nobles however, wanted to try and make peace with the humans. After all, if humanity was angry now, they could not possibly imagine the sheer levels of spite and rage the humans would have if they resorted to the destruction of that much human life.

The one voice, at high command, which hadn't spoken, was the Supreme, the highest commander above all others present. He motioned with a tentacle for silence. Immediately, all noise ceased. He pulled out a somewhat singed human book. He started to read from it. He noted out countless battles, wars, conflicts, of the human race, which were illogical. The Vietnam War, the American Revolution, the Soviet Intervention in Afghanistan, the Alamo, The First Crusade. All were conflicts, which from the Srengian point of view, were deeply illogical. The inferior force should have surrendered to the superior force. But the Supreme concluded to the high command, that humanity was not logical. Indeed. A planet of insanely stubborn bastards who in the face of overwhelming odds, say ''*Nuts!*'' and then try to win anyway. And somehow, it works.

The Supreme called out to the remaining human leadership. And an armistice was signed. Of course, at this point, the highest ranked humans able to do this were a rather eccentric and odd group. 51st President of the USA, Jim Mattis, the empress Aiko of Japan, the First Speaker of the Allied European League Magrethe Vestager, a heavily scarred woman who couldn't be older than 25 commanding the MERCUSOR Regime forces on the Brazilian-Argentine front known only as La Jefa, an Australian bloke wearing armor and a bucket as a helmet who would only answer to Lord Kelly. The Supreme initially wanted to offer the humans better conditions, such as immediate 2nd-class citizenship and internal autonomy in the Hegemony, but the human leaders made it quite clear they were interested in one thing, and one thing only. That the Srengians left permanently. The Supreme asked back that the Hegemony be ceded the hyperspace bypass so necessary for their proxy conflicts. Humanity told the Supreme that the Hegemony could lease it for a hundred years. Provided it was not used for any military purposes. The Supreme asked for the slaves that humanity had liberated, and was told that they were under human law, and human law forbade slavery, and the slaves were thus free to live on Earth. The humans then asked if the Supreme would like to get prisoners of war back. To the Supreme's surprise, millions of his people and the subjugated races were just sitting around in prison camps in isolated areas.

The Supreme decided to take the deal, they'd get a lot more soldiers back, a lease on the bypass, and they'd get to leave the humans, who they had frankly had enough of, behind. The Hegemony had just made the worst peace deal in the history of their ancient empires. And the Supreme still took it. Thinking that the humans weren't really worth it, the Supreme loaded up all released soldiers, and went back home. Sure, they were going to be demoted and sent off to some far away place in the Hegemony, some border posting with no real value, but at least they didn't have to see another human ever again. After all, they didn't have space capable ships.

Fourth months later they were found dead. It was ruled as suicide at the shame they had brought to the Hegemony. Nobody questioned how someone could kill themselves by poison, multiple self-inflicted stab wounds, and beating their own body. On Earth, the first faster-than-light capable ship made by human hands returned from its maiden voyage. Ten years later, many galactic proxy conflicts involving the Hegemony had human advisers or mercenaries on the side that fought against the Hegemony. Humanity does not make peace, we're too stubborn. We're merely preparing ourselves for the next step of the war. And this time, we're taking it to their worlds.",ApocalypseOwl

Despite our numerous preparations for the initial assault, today took an unexpected turn. Nearly half of our front line forces were eliminated today when they met with resistance from the native primitives. It would appear these primitives have some advanced technologies we were not apprised of before now.

While it has been our belief that humans lack teleportation and cloaking technology, or other advanced tech, today's events have called this into question. Today with my own two eyes, I witnessed what I believe to be the use of these weapons. As our lines marched towards the human defenses, their warriors appeared not in front of us, but rather from the sides, and even some in the rears of our flank. By the time we completed our marching procedures to reverse course, many losses had already been sustained. It is my belief that these humans are able to use teleportation technology to beam troops from the front line, to any location on the battlefield.

Furthermore, as we retreated into an area of tall, hardy vegetation, we sustained even more losses. Despite our vigilance, the attack seemed to come from invisible attackers. As though the plants themselves were firing upon us. It is my belief that the humans are employing either some sort of cloaking technology to hide their formations, or perhaps have even engineered intelligent plants that can fight in formation as well. Despite destroying many of these tall, hard plants, we found no evidence of advanced genetic technology. This leaves me to believe the latter theory, that we were being marched up by an invisible army. 

However, when a secondary retreat was the only course of action available, to add to our terrible luck, we had further difficulty with the local flora. It would appear that some of these earth plants have very dangerous defense mechanisms. Several had grown taut vines between them, and when in contact with our footfalls, some sort of biological chemical explosion occurred. Furthermore, many of the local plants her grow in the form of spiked branches that grown from the bottom of deep holes. These deceptive plants have a layer of leaves over the top, such that they appear as solid ground. Several of our soldiers fell and critically injured themselves on these plants, while some other stepped on the exploding plants. Some of the men went missing. It is unknown if they went AWOL or if they fell to the invisible soldiers. 

Clearly these humans are masters of deception. The few of our number that returned to the mothership were distraught and disorderly. Morale has been severely compromised by the losses today. I would humbly request a strategic withdrawal of our forces until such a time that the human defenses can be assessed in more detail.",Billionairez

"[WP] Aliens invade earth, but they have never understood the concept of guerilla warfare. Humanity's doom is out there, marching toward us in neat, straight lines.",TeddyBearToons,"Dr. Sarah Godavaci, leading astronomer and military advisor to the Union of Alien Affairs, turned to her subordinate taking the large binder containing reports of spectrophotometry, advanced imaging, and other information regarding the redcoat’s home planet. It’s been ten years since the attack from the alien species, Gronites, which were quickly named redcoats based on their natural red coloration and fighting strategies. 

&amp;nbsp;

It’s as I thought, their planet appears to be a massive exoplanet with abnormally low density, this explains their physical appearance. The redcoats were a long legged, humanoid species with very advanced technology. Their physical strength while comparable to humans was still impressive and their ability to sprint easily matched some of earth’s fastest animals. Sarah scoured through the report till she found the information she wanted, the spectrophotometry report.

&amp;nbsp;

“Hey, are you positive about the results of the spectrometer?” Sarah asked, “Absolutely, Dr. Godavaci isn’t that astounding, what do you think it means?” Sarah looked at the common organic compounds detected by the spectrometer, celluose didn’t even register. She quickly examined the atmosphere composition of the planet, similar to earth’s except lower reports of pollution and contaminants. Sarah picks up her phone and dials her husband, Jack Godavaci,  a pioneer in xenopsychology and biology. “Hey honey? I think I have explanation for their formation combat. They don’t have trees on their planet and I bet there’s no large vegetation. I don’t think they understand what cover is.”

&amp;nbsp;

Sarah hung up the phone and looked back at the reports. When the redcoats first invaded many militaries were afraid to engage them, but after they began marching on our cities we had no choice. Our people declared it a miracle that we were able to repel them, but I know the truth. We massacred them… They had no comprehension of cover or basic military tactics and now I understood why. Humanity’s invasion on their planet is going to be a genocide.",LaundryMoney

"[WP] Aliens invade earth, but they have never understood the concept of guerilla warfare. Humanity's doom is out there, marching toward us in neat, straight lines.",TeddyBearToons,"Many people, throughout the myriad ages have tried to define what humanity truly is; To some, it's ingenuity, to others it is compassion, again to some others it is our artistic ability. Poets claim it is our ability to know deeper meaning, philosophers differ from pain, lust, power and suffering as our definite traits. To the religious it is our piety and to our scientists it is our curiosity. The truth is that we're the most single-minded stubborn bastards in the universe. In our primal state, before civilization, before history and all those other good bits, we were stubborn. When our ancient hunters picked a target, they followed it day and night until it collapsed from exhaustion. We decided to take our biggest competitor and turn them into our friends and servants, we stuck at it until we made dogs. Because we're stubborn.

After World War II, pockets of resistance on some pacific islands held out for years, refusing to give in. The biggest armies in history have tried to calm and control Afghanistan, from Alexander to Bush, leaders have invaded and found the locals to be so bloody stubborn and irritable that they wind up driving out the invaders somehow. Doctors never gave in when looking for vaccines to the great modern plague of polio or the ancient plague of smallpox, and eventually they were found. It pays to be stubborn.

We are stubborn bastards. Because we don't give up, we don't play fair, we don't break, it's hell on earth trying to fight the lot of us. But of course, somebody didn't do their homework. Earth is sort in the backwater of the galaxy, the space-boonies so to speak. But, the Solar System is, unbeknownst to man, an important hyperspace bypass for alien merchant caravans, civilian transport, and space fleets belonging to various important empires. Until recently, it was considered common land, owned theoretically by humanity, but de facto, just about everybody used it. But then, the Srenqian Hegemony decided, that the time was ripe for a new strategic move in the five-ways Galactic Cold War. Srengians were a very rigid society, even by the rigid standards of the common galaxy, and when they conquered a planet, the inhabitants were given a choice; Surrender and become fourth-rate citizens, or attempt to resist and become slaves. Eventually third-rate citizens could work their way to become second-rate citizens, by showing great loyalty and obedience to the state. Slaves could never go further than third-class citizenship. They sent the standardized fleet packed with soldiers from a variety of different subjugated races, led by Srengian officers. On the 15th of March, 2027, they issued a call for humanity's total surrender. The options were explained, the benefits of accepting the natural superiority of the Srengians were put on the table versus the disadvantages of disobeying the High Lords of the Supreme Heaven, as they liked to style themselves. Humanity's answer took a while to translate for the Srengians, it was two words from a dead human language. Molon labe. Come and take it.

The Srengians misunderstood it as an accept, which the humans quickly rectified by murdering the Srengian officers commanding slaves, who were to set up the official surrender ceremony, with sniper fire. The communication officer who had mistranslated was immediately executed by airlock. And then the invasion began. The first couple of months went swimmingly for the Srengians, their puffy aristocratic tentacles rubbing together in glee as humanity met their armies and were driven back, the sheer numbers and technology of the Srengian forces defeating conventional warfare.

Until the battle of Saigon. The Vietnamese army set up ambushes, stay-behind militia groups that attacked in the middle of the night, children with pistols who would not be considered a threat by the enemy. The Srengian forces marched toward the city in neat straight lines, and were massacred. Old men who had once been in the Viet Cong would strap explosives to themselves, not be counted as hostiles by the enemy, and go up to shake a Srengian soldier's hand or paw or pseudo-pod, and boom, squad destroyed. In the night, when the Srengians rested, the old women would crawl out of holes with knives alongside the young girls, and cut the throats of the enemy. Commandos would sneak into the Srengian camps and free their slaves and led them off. The poor sods were too frightened to disobey anyone after what could have been centuries of slavery.

By the time the Srengian army actually reached the city center, less than a tenth of their original force survived. Snipers on rooftops took out every surviving officer, so easy to spot in their shiny and gleaming uniforms. The confused soldiers, without orders, were picked apart piece by bloody piece, until the streets ran red, purple, and blue with the blood of our enemies. It was the first major victory that humanity had scored. Sure, Saigon was in ruins and all the effort to clean the area up from the Vietnam War had been reversed, but twelve whole divisions had been put to the sword.

The Srengian high command could not comprehend what was happening. Their armies marched into the winter of Russia, and was met with scorched earth, booby traps, sneak attacks, sabotage from locals, and the ever-present threat of General Winter. Needless to say, not many of their forces survived the 2030 Russian Campaign. In Finland, the colourful uniforms of the enemy were easy targets for the heirs of The White Death, and joining the old Soviet dead, were now several brigades of aliens. In the deserts of North Africa and the Arabian peninsular, the Srengian soldiers learned to fear the almost insane fanatical devotion of the locals, and their defiance against the enemy. Many a member of the Srengian army, would leave his racial battalion with permission from the officers to take a leak in the dunes or try to find shade, and simply never be seen again, until the battered remnants of their unit would find their bleached dry bones as they retreated back to the coast.

In the Outback of Australia, the human resistance would chase hordes of emus into the camps of the alien foe, unleashing hell upon them, though for many races, Australia was already hell, being a place where eventually only punitive regiments were sent. The vast steppes of Central Asia were initially perfect for the Srengians to fight on, until they were met with ancient strategies, best employed by Genghis Khan centuries ago, riding up close to the enemy, firing, and fleeing. Hit and runs were so common there, that the forward marching enemy would never get a moment of rest. In America, they started the invasion in Texas, suffice to say, that high command had never seen an entire territory's population rise up so well-armed and so bloodthirsty before.

In the places conquered, the Srengians would find no rest. In the night, resistance fighters would kidnap officers and broadcast their execution on whatever channels still available. Even the usually civilized and pacifistic Europe was not safe for the enemy. On the shores of Denmark, patrols would find the soldiers they had replaced when the tide was low. The resistance in France became so numerous, that the aliens had to retreat to Paris, where they thought themselves safe. Until the Cataphile cells of the resistance dragged down the members of the garrison in blackest night, to the Catacombs and tunnels beneath the city. Where the last thing any alien saw, was humans wearing masks made from the skulls of their own dead, plunging their knives into the exposed skin of their comrades, and at last, themselves. Those few who were given the order to retreat from Paris, would find their dreams filled with the hushed whispers of the living dead, and the muffled screams of their dead brothers-in-arms, until the end of their days.",ApocalypseOwl

"[WP] Aliens invade earth, but they have never understood the concept of guerilla warfare. Humanity's doom is out there, marching toward us in neat, straight lines.",TeddyBearToons,"We knew they were coming. The news spread quick throughout our world. These beings looked similar to us, but they were not like us at all. The first time their massive ships appeared on the horizon, no one knew what to expect. By the time they landed, we had our defenses prepared. We had no idea how little damage we could do. Each being was clad in a material harder than anything we'd seen before; impenetrable and covering their entire body. They carried something that resembled spears, but at the click of a button would begin to drain the blood from it's targets body- instantly. It was chaos. One by one, they took down the nations of our world. Some by deceit, but most by sheer force. We tried to ban together, but they were far more organized than we ever could be. Far more precise. Little did they know, that would be their downfall.

I'd like to say that I fought and died bravely the day they came, but I ran with my family. I had to know they were safe. We found a place deep in the forest, where we ran into other retreating families and communities. Soon, we had a village of our own, far from all other civilization. I knew we had only bought ourselves time. They won't stop until they've claimed every inch of our world. Through what I witnessed firsthand, and stories from my new neighbors, I figured out their weakness. They rely too much on their technology and their numbers. These things are no match for the fighting spirit of my people. I would show them.

A few months into living in our new home, a scout was spotted near the perimeter of our village. We had our best tracker follow him back to the others. We discovered their fleet planned to meet our resistance in an open field down at the valley below us. I put together a group to meet them. We gathered what weapons we had and met them in the clearing. I saw the beings who looked like us, but not quite, on the other side of the field. Even at this distance I could see their white faces. They began to march, wielding their terrible weaponry, which I learned were called guns. We charged. Before we were close enough for their front line to use their guns, more of my men emerged from the forest on either side of them. We ran unpredictable routes, throwing rocks and spears. Our arrows flew from deep within the forest and rained on their army indiscriminately. Many of their commanders in the back of the formation were killed even before their front line used a weapon. Still, they put up quite a fight. Many men died on both sides, but ultimately it was they who retreated. However, at this point they had lost all sense of their formation. White men ran through the forest alone, only to be attacked from above by more of my people waiting in the trees.

Through the sweat and blood that blurred my vision, I watched our victory unfold. Among all this death, I managed a smile, for I knew that my people would be safe to live on this land- now and for the rest of time. We knew they were coming, and we stopped them.

"[WP] After a cataclysmic event the entirety of the human race loses their eyesight. After 5 years, you wake up with your sight returned but everyone else is still blind.",The0neBlackkid,"Ever since that day, the eyes of man have been blinded. Every living person on Earth lost their vision. Many even committed suicide. But I have to worry about more than just myself. My sister is still around, after all.

It was far from easy. Without vision, basic utilities and amenities suddenly began impossible to maintain. Think about it. How can you have blind technicians operating electric, coal, and nuclear power plants. we lost power in a matter on weeks. But that wasn't even the worst of it. Getting food was something entirely different. 

It must have been fate that landed my sister and I on our grandparents farm of the summer when the blinding happened. Funnily enough, our grandmother was already blind, so she taught us how to navigate the farm around us. We managed to familiarize most of the property, and became self sufficient enough. I had even gotten used to this way of peaceful life. But then, I got my vision back. 

I woke up just like on any other day, but I immediately felt it. Just beneath my eyelids even, the world around me was changed. Or did it return back to normal? I opened my eyes, and never in my life had I seen such beautiful colors.

We were in Autumn, and the fields of wheat looked like a sea of liquid gold. I cried, and came running down stairs screaming, only to be scolded by my younger sister.

""Steven.. what's the matter?""

She clutched the handle bar of the stairs as she went down step by step, each foot posturing for absolute certainty. I could tell she had not regained her vision, but I was still in awe. It had been five years since I had seen my sister. She was almost 16 now.

""Laura... I can see. I can see you, the house, everything!""

She was taken aback by the remark while finally finishing the trek down the stairs. She came to me and touched my face.

""Do you feel any different? How? Will all of everyone's vision come back?""

""Haha, i don't know, but let me describe outside to you! its-""

As i opened the door, I ate my words. What was once joy became fear as I looked into the distance over the rolling hills of stalk. Giant vessels were floating in the sky, they even looked like castles. Colored in dark grey hue, the silently strolled through the perimeter, blocking out the light of the sun for anything beneath them. 

""Steven! tell  me what you see!"" Laura didn't know what loomed above us. She couldn't see. No one could but me. I alone saw the castles in the sky, patrolling the plains of the mid west. Searching for... something. 

But then, a smaller ship came into view. It got to us faster than I could blink, but made no sound as it approached and stopped before me. I couldn't even hear any noise the ship was making. To Laura, she never knew anything even had been happening.

It's door opened as quietly as its entrance. Two large beings encased in thick white suites with tinted helmets motioned for me to follow them. They carried a device that glowed with an ominous luster. They pointed it at a tall oak tree.

The beam that shot out whizzed through the air. The tree's leaves withered and fell, quickly followed by breaking branches. Its bark turned from brown to black, void of anything it once was. Then, they pointed the gun at Laura. 

""Wait right there!"" I step between the beings and Laura. She stood perplexed and bewildered right behind me.

""Steven? is everything all right?""

""Yes. Can you get me some water?""

She nodded and made her way to the house, careful not to trip on anything. I watch my younger sister close the door before returning my gaze to the two beings before me. They have put their guns away, but they position by their ship coldly, standing guard of the door they came out of. 

In my mind, I here thoughts that aren't mine. They are cold, calculated, emotionless. 

*You will come with us. Now. Enter the ship, or see your home wither away like the old oak.*

I steps into the ship. It is circular and smooth all around. There are no extremities or seemingly anything giving it flight. It just hovers in the air, silently staring back at me like a dilated eye.

""Who are you? What do you want with me?""

*You give yourself to much significance. We do not want you, human. We want this world.*

"[WP] You have long been fascinated by swords, and have mastered every kind of sword fighting technique known to man. No man can defeat you. But you have grown old, and Death has crept up to deliver his final swing, but something happened, something Death had never experienced before, he was parried.",Uniqueuserlame,"Just like every day, the old man was making tea, when he felt a strange breeze flow through his home. A cold breeze, a breeze that chills the bones. A breeze not so common in June. He turned around, and surprised, saw a shadowy figure behind him with his hand raised towards him. 
""The shepherd of souls has come for you John. Come, for it is your time. Do not resist, for nobody can escape, though many have tried""
The old man, seeing the inevitability of it all, surrendered to the figure ""may I at least finish my tea first?"" 
The figure nodded and John turned to his cupboard to get a tea cup, but the figure had no intention of waiting, and with a quick gesture of his hand conjured a scythe, and raised it to swiftly cut the old man down. 
But John, in all his years of fighting, had developed a sixth sense of sorts, and used the kettle to party the swing. 
The figure, shocked by what just happened, took the fatal mistake of taking a step back, a mistake quickly taken advantage of by John, who rushed to the other room, where he kept his sword collection.
As he was taking up his sword, he felt the bone chilling breeze again, and without thinking twice turned around and held his sword up, still in it's scabbard, to parry the figure's second blow. 
""John you cannot resist. Nobody can vanquish death. Your time has come""
But John wasn't one to give up easily, especially now that his heart was rushing and adrenaline coursing through his entire body. 'the rush of the battle' he thought 'how I've missed this'. He took a step back, and with a swift movement unseathed his sword and swung at the shadow, cutting a piece of his robe, that fell down and vanished in a small cloud of smoke.
The figure, without saying a word, rose his scythe, and they began to exchange blows.
Their battle went on for over an hour, but while the figure showed no signs of fatigue, John was exhausted, the toll of his old age was too high.
He fell down on one knee, one hand on the pommel of his sword, the other grasping his arm, which was bleeding from the Shadow's last blow.
""It is over John, like many others you have fought death, and like all of them you have failed.""
The shadow rose his scythe to deliver the final blow, but as it was descending John let out a mighty roar, and thrust his sword through the Shadow's head.
""This....this cannot...be!!"" Yelled the shadow, dropping his scythe and falling to his knees in horror.
A bright light was shining through it's head, and it emitted a screech so loud windows shattered, and John fell to his knees grasping his ears, bleeding.
The shadow rose once again, but not with its own strength, but it seemed like it was levitating. With the sword still in it's head he spoke
""You cannot defeat death John. It is inevitable, something all living things must encounter. You may think you have won, but you have only earned yourself a fate worse than you could ever imagine""
John, with his last bit of strength, tore the sword out of the Shadow's head and with one swift movement cut the figure in half.
An explosion of light immediately followed, throwing John to a wall, where he lie unconscious. 
While unconscious he had terrible dreams, dreams of genocide, of murders, of war, of mutilated bodies.
He woke up hours later, screaming and soaked in sweat. It was dark out, the room he was in destroyed.
On the ground before him he saw the robes of his opponent, but as he approached them, they vanished in a cloud of smoke. 
John went upstairs to the bathroom to wash himself of the sweat, but as he looked in the mirror, he saw a horrific vision. 
His face was pale as bone. 
As he started looking in horror, he heard the Shadow's voice once again in his head
""You cannot defeat death John. You may think you have won, but you have only earned yourself a fate worse than you could ever immagine""
And suddenly, John felt himself rise into the air, and felt a pain so overwhelming he thought he would die.
He fell to the ground, gasping for air, but found himself unable to.
He looked at his hands: the flesh was  gone, revealing the bone underneath.
In the mirror, he saw his naked skull staring back at him.
For one last time, he heard the Shadow's voice in his head.
""Welcome to my hell""",Bobbimort
"[WP] You have long been fascinated by swords, and have mastered every kind of sword fighting technique known to man. No man can defeat you. But you have grown old, and Death has crept up to deliver his final swing, but something happened, something Death had never experienced before, he was parried.",Uniqueuserlame,"The battle was frozen around me, the fletching of the bolt that should have killed protruded through my cuirass, the head rested against my heart. It did not concern me. I held my sword behind me, blocking the blow I truly feared.

""I've been waiting for you,"" I said, turning to face my attacker.

Death looked nothing like I had expected.

I *had* expected a hooded figure in black robes, skeletal hands gripping a tall scythe.

Instead, I say a tall, dark-skinned figure clothed in cloth of purest white. His hair was wild, as was his beard. His eyes shone brightly with a surprise I might almost call pleasant. But he wasn't done surprising me yet.

""My child, where did you ever learn such a thing!""

While I had expected Death to be silent, to be sure,  I had not thought it impossible that he might speak. I certainly had *not*, however, expect such a jovial tone from the being so many called the *Grim* Reaper.

I was dumbstruck.

""Well don't just stand there looking surprised! It is *I* who gets to be surprised. I have been cleaving souls from their flesh for \*millennia--\*from your perspective, at least. Never have I had a mortal twist away my blow!""

I raised my blade into a guard I had learned during my years in the Orient.

""Ahh, *Ko Gasumi No Kamae*,"" he said in perfect Japanese, ""I know it well! I have seen it fail *many* times. But I am less interested in your technique than I am in your *focus*. No mortal could have taught you to perceive me coming."" He gestured at the frozen forms around us, the spurts of blood hanging in the air, the dust floating motionless all around. His face fell.

""Ahh."" Somehow the disappointment in is tone struck me deep. ""I see. *Someone* has made a deal with an *angelus lapsus*."" He looked at me with pity, which made my blood boil.

""They gave me the power to resist you, and I intend to use it. I *will* be king, and no one, mortal or otherwise, will stop me!"" I lunged at Death before he could even move. I brought my blade down hard on the nape of his neck. To my surprise, my blade bounced back as if I had brought it down on a boulder. Pain shot through my arms and I recoiled into a new guard.

""Oh my child."" Death shook his head. ""They can give you power to resist me, but they cannot give you power *over* me. You can have no power over me unless it is given to you from *above*, not below.""

My surprise betrayed me, and Death chuckled.

""Are you really so stunned? Of *course* they lied to you! Have you not heard the one they serve called *The Prince* *of Lies*? Oh my child,"" he shook his head ""this is a bargain you will long regret.""

""Enough talk!"" I bellowed in the face of Death. ""If you want my soul, then come and take it.""

""Why? You have bargained for the power to deflect my blows. I have better things to do than dance with you. There are others who need me.""

With that I felt the bolt sink into my heart. The figures around me began to move again, and I spun and fell to the dust. I could not move. I lay there, still, as the battle raged all around.

My brother appeared over me, shaking me hard but to no avail.

""Damon! *DAMON!*""

He grabbed me behind my arms and dragged me away from the fray. Though I could not open my eyes, I saw Death clearly. A man a few yards in front of me missed his parry. As the spearpoint touched his throat time froze again.

Death strode over to the man and, swinging his sword high, brought it down upon the doomed warrior. The blade passed harmlessly through the man's body, but in a moment his soul stepped out of its earthly form. The spirit looked around with a look of profound bewilderment. But when his eyes fell on death, a look of serene understanding came over him

""Come, my child,"" Death said, ""it is time for you to rest."" He held his arms open wide and the man embraced him like a friend.

Dread washed over me. What had the demon promised? *Death shall not be able to take you*. All of a sudden I understood.

""WAIT,"" I yelled, ""WAIT! TAKE ME! I won't resist!""

Death looked over at me, his smile turning to sadness.

""Excuse me,"" Death said to the spirit in his arms, ""I must speak to this man. Just walk into the light. They are waiting for you.""

The spirit looked off to his left and, with a final smile at Death, turned and vanished. Whatever light he could see, I could not.

Death strode over and knelt beside me. He put his hand on my helmet. I could see tears in his eyes.

""I cannot, my child. I have no power to free your soul. Don't you understand? You've been tricked.""

I sobbed.

""You mean to tell me I am bound to my corpse *forever*?""

""Forever? No. Until the end of the age, until Judgment? Yes.""

He was silent for a moment before the words slithered from beneath the dark hood, a low raspy sound that only sounded faintly human. ""You do not wish to die?"" 

The old man coughed, leaning into his sword, which he no longer had the energy to raise. ""Does anyone?"" he wheezed. ""I have much unfinished business."" 

""Your daughter?"" Death asked. He slowly lowered his scythe. The man was frail now. He had used the last of his energy withstanding the blow, and yet... 

The old man coughed, his chest heaving violently. ""I must see her get married. I cannot die yet."" 

Death remained silent. He stood there, his robes billowing despite the dead air around them, the darkness beneath his hood completely unfathomable. All of a sudden, the mountain air around them began to chill, a gale of wind whistling past and almost prying the sword from the old man's hands before it disappeared as quickly as it had arrived. When Death spoke again, the old man could hear a strange eagerness to his voice.  

""You would agree to a deal?"" 

""Anything,"" the old man coughed. 

Death laughed then, an inhuman noise that was as low and raspy as it was high and keening. ""My favorite word,"" he said, the words long and drawn out. ""Good,"" he said, and then reached out a hand--long and frail, more bone than skin--and touched it to the old man's forehead. Rather than the icy touch he had been expecting, Death's fingertips were scalding to the touch. ""I have grown weary,"" he said simply.  

Before the old man could ask what that sentence meant, he lost consciousness. 

&amp;nbsp; 

When he woke up later, his head pounding, he could feel the fresh life in his veins. His joints no longer ached, and the migraine that had plagued him for the last two years of his life had disappeared. His eyes brightened. He had won. He could go see his daughter again. He got to his feet and reached for his sword. Then he froze. 

His sword--the sword that his master had forged for him twenty years ago--had disappeared. And in its place, a scythe. The handle was black as night, so pitch dark it looked like it would suck him in if he touched it, and the blade glowed brightly, despite the cloudy sky. 

He hesitated for a moment before slowly reaching for it. Just as his hand closed around the handle, his surroundings vanished. He now stood in an abandoned barn, alone. He blinked, gazing around at the bales of hay. Then a sound came from behind the hay bales. 

""Who's there?"" he shouted, brandishing the scythe in front of him. ""Come out!"" 

Silence, except for a gasping and choking sound. 

Carefully, he made his way toward the noise, his footsteps so soft even he himself couldn't hear them. His gaze trained forward, he walked steadily, expecting to see an animal--maybe some kittens or a cow. Instead, the sight in front of him made his blood freeze. 

A woman was laying on the ground, her blonde hair splayed across the pile of hay that should have been golden in color, but for the dark red liquid that was seeping into it, dyeing the hay underneath her body a deep hue. Her eyes wide open, blood gurgled from her open mouth and from a large wound on her abdomen as she desperately struggled to draw in breath through the liquid gurgling from her throat. She looked no more than twenty. 

With a cry of terror, the old man fell to his knees in front of her, his hands shaking as he reached forward to press on the wound in her abdomen, trying desperately to stem the flow of blood. But his hands simply passed through her, even as she stared at him with wide, terrified eyes, the blood flowing faster from her. 

*She should be dead.* The thought passed through the old man's head even as he reached out again and again, hoping beyond hope that the next time, maybe his hands would become solid and that he could save her life somehow. 

Minutes passed. Yet the girl didn't die, stuck in a state of perpetual pain and terror as the old man helplessly watched. Her gaze--distant and drifting everywhere from the pain--suddenly turned toward a point next to him, and she reached out a hand, her gaze then turning to him.  

He turned to see what she was looking at. 

The scythe. 

And then suddenly, he understood. But he couldn't. He had killed some men in his lifetime, but they had been deserving of it. He would never raise a weapon toward anyone undeserving. There was no honor in that.  

The girl's eyes seemed to be pleading him as she continued to choke on her own blood, unable to live, and yet unable to die. The old man hesitated, then gritted his teeth and picked up the scythe. Maybe there was no honor, but...perhaps there was mercy. 

He slowly got to his feet, the scythe weighing heavy in his hands. Then with one fell stroke, he sweeped it downwards, and the girl became silent. Her body glowed bright blue before little wisps of light rose from her body, twisting and turning until they became a bright blue orb, which then slowly ascended toward the heavens. 

It was her soul, he supposed. The old man looked down at the body, with its lifeless eyes and fragile limbs. And then he began bawling, the tears coming fast and furious as he crumpled into a heap on the floor. Day turned into night around him. He stayed in that position until he had no more tears. 

He had seen death before. He was no stranger to it. But never like this. Never before like this. Suddenly, he thought of his daughter. He had to go see her. He had to make sure she was okay. 

He picked himself off the ground and picked up the scythe. And in the next second, he was in front of her apartment. She was in the front yard, bent down in front of the resident garden, tending to her tomatoes. ""Linda,"" he called out, his voice hoarse from crying. 

She didn't turn around. 

""Linda!"" he called out again. She remained as if she didn't hear him. His eyes dimmed. So it was as he had suspected. *I have grown weary.* 

He could see her get married now. Could see her grow old. Death had fulfilled his promise to him after all. 

&amp;nbsp; 

He had become Death.

But you have grown old, and Death has crept up to deliver his final swing, but something happened, something Death had never experienced before, he was parried.",Uniqueuserlame,"As our blades crashed together once more, I began to realize the grave mistake I’d made. I could see the fatigue of the fight setting in on Death, his arms becoming more limp with each swing. I knew I couldn’t lose, but I also knew I couldn’t win. As much as I did not want to die, the thought of living forever, of everyone else living forever, was a far worse prospect. 

I felt the blade slice my arm and warm blood rush out. I swung as hard as I could knocking Death on it’s back, giving me the chance to tear a piece of my already ripped shirt and wrap it around my wound. As Death struggled to rise again, I quickly braced myself for his next hit. I’d figured by now that I had three options, the two former I’d mentioned, but also an in between, a sort of purgatory. If I was strategic about it, I, in theory, could continue to battle death for eternity, never winning, but also never losing. But really, what kind of life is that I thought? That’s no life at all. As much as I loved the fight, the true value came from the journey and experiences I’d had. I looked at my reflection in my blade. I’d found a fourth option.

Death rose to its feet, weak and unsteady, but determined. Death charged me with all the might it had left in it, lifting it’s blade to clash with mine once more. But today, Death would experience two new things; a worthy adversary, and the feeling of its blade puncturing an already lifeless body. ",Bweezy3

That's the way I lived for so long.

The mantra repeated in my head as I looked over to the supposedly powerful being. Even through his skeletal features, I could see the surprise, he'd never been parried before. A grin grew across my lips as I brought my blade up once again. His surprise would the scythe at bay, but I would never let my guard down.

The surprise quickly faded though, and the beast of the end charged at me again at inhuman speeds. I just barely dodged out of the way, his scythe cutting open the air where I'd been. That last attack was faster than before, I had to be ready.

The scythe came down but in all his speed, he turned it at the last second. I was ready for this, it was one of the oldest fakeout tricks, I parried the hit easily. The look of surprise returned to his cloaked face.

I leaped backward, I would never let my guard down. The beast growled, his tone dark, dark enough to strike fear into any ordinary soul. But I was no ordinary soul, even at my old age, my mind was sharp. I squinted hard, bringing my blade up to the defense and ignoring the call to blunder. The beast did as I predicted and charged me again, I turned on my heel, whipping my blade around my wrist to knock the scythe down.

Both of our weapons fell, but I knew it would end this way and I caught mine with my heel, it was light enough. Then, spinning back and grabbing my blade, I thrust it into the hooded cloak. The beast was still grabbing for his scythe when I struck, I felt the blade stick into something.

As soon as I felt the feedback, I retracted my sword and jumped back, bringing it out to the defense. I would never let my guard down. But it wasn't needed. Just as when I'd parried him at the beginning of the fight, he froze. I relaxed my shoulders a sliver and watched the beast's surprise, he'd never been hit before either.

His hood lifted back off his head a bit, exposing the pale white bone to the sunlight above. The dark eyes were riddled with confusion and he slowly turned his head to me. I was about to look, but I recognized the trick, I closed my eyes shut at the last second, my father's warning running through my head. *'Never look into the face of death'*

The embodiment of decay rushed at me once again, his speed even greater than before and I only barely shook off the strike with my eyes closed. I would never let down my guard.

I opened my eyes, already sprinting away from the beast, ready for the flurry of attacks that was sure to hit my side as I ran. But it never came.

After about a dozen strides, I knew he wasn't running after me and I turned back to the beast, expecting to see the same dry surprise as before. I didn't. The hood was completely off now, exposing the powerful, cracked bone of his skull. And what I saw on the beast's face was much more terrifying than anything else it had done yet.

It was smiling. The crooked, bony smile was perfect and horrid at the same time, it spawned a sense of worry deep within me that I rejected as unnatural. He didn't reach for his scythe, it seemed he was done with the fight, but I kept my grip tight on my sword.

I would never let my guard down.

""Impressive display."" The words reached my perked ears on the wind, I hadn't even seen his mouth move.

""Thanks,"" I replied through gritted teeth, unconsciously getting myself in a stance.

The beast apparently noticed what I was doing and raised a dismissive hand. ""There's no need for that, I have no desire in keeping this up."" His voice sounded unnatural, the air around my ears dried as I heard it.

""Then what do we do now?"" I knew he was playing with me, but I would never let my guard down.

The beast chuckled dryly, the horrid sound splintering on my eardrums. ""You're special.""

I glared at the beast, barely avoiding looking into his eyes. He was toying with me, why couldn't I just strike now? I dismissed my thought, he was smarter than that, he wouldn't let his guard down either.

""And?"" I could only muster one word in response.

""It'd be a shame to let someone like you fall to the house of the dead.""

My gaze lifted, I glared harder into the cracked bone. ""What are you getting at?""

""I could give you another chance."" His smile dropped, he was serious. My mind raced, remembering my younger form, longing for more time by the sword.

Would he really give me another chance? The beast noticed the glint in my eye.

""Yes."" The dark words reached my ears, forcefully pulling hope up out of my soul.

""What's the catch?"" There had to be more.

His grin came back, more devilish than before, I felt a chill run down my spine. ""You will have a different body. But you will retain your mind, life would be more a curse if I were to take that from you.""

I considered the offer against my better judgments. The same instincts that were guiding my stance were screaming at me to stop. But the beast was serious.

""What do I have to do?""

His grin grew wider. ""One touch,"" he rolled his bony fingers. ""and your life is yours again.""

My desperate mind agreed and he was on me before I could even say it out loud. He'd seen it in my eyes. His finger approached my shoulder, cooling the air around it as it went. My grip on my blade tightened, but I didn't stop him. The finger touched my skin and my body was filled with an unnatural cold. 

I experienced the most agonizing second of my life before everything went black.

---

I woke up, my body was still cold. For a bit, I thought the beast had lied to me, but I felt a breeze on my skin. I opened my eyes. 

I was lying on a rock, the cold breeze hit me again, making me notice my clothing. I was wearing a torn tunic and light pants, my body felt frail. He hadn't lied to me.

But as I got up, facing the cold air with my unprotected face, I felt an immense sense of regret fill me. This wasn't what I'd wanted. I'd let my guard down.

A game of swordplay, however rarely crossed his mind. The hooded figure stood in a readied stance with scythe behind. He had taken many warriors before but, none had challenged him. 

“Do you fear, Death?” The old man asked, a curved blade of his own poised in a confident grip.

Death did not speak, could not as each man heard their calling like a distant song. But the man understood, “No.” You cannot win against death.

So they stood, staring waiting. Death with endless patience. He comes to all. The man, short lived, struck.

Death could only parry, then the onslaught began. 

Over, parry, side, parry, other, parry and on.  Death held, knowing that man makes mistakes. But this one did not. 

For hours or days, neither would know, they fought with feint and counterfeint, until at last they came to the end. 

The man was old, and he tired after time. “You are worthy,” sang Death at a lull. 

This gave the old man pause. “Worthy of what?”

“Of a life,” Death sang, “until you ask for me to come.”

The words rang as a solemn chant. The old man lowered his sword, “So, you admit defeat?”

“No, only that this game will continue until the end of time.” 

A smile on the old mans face, “So, I’ve brought Death to a stale mate?”

The figure nodded. 

“Then, I accept.” The old man sat, looking at the stars. “Tell me friend, do you know what lies out there?”

A song sung in tears and heartbreak cracks the old man. Rivera flow at the sadness and beauty of what Death sings, “I am.”",jerm971

Want to try your luck against the swiftest hand in the west ?!"", these words brought me back where I actually was. These days I find myself lost in thought and drifting to places, losing myself there... I guess age has its ways to get a man on his knees.

""Boy, I would probably be fallen asleep halfway through the fight...""

""Age says it's word, huh ?"", he replied, accompanied by his friends' booming laughter.

""No, slow swordsmen do..."", I said calmly while looking him straight in the eye, piercing his fragile soul.
This trick has worked for me a lot of times, throughout the years. It's important to show no fear to your opponents and in the same time plant that same fear inside them.

""You call me slow !? I've never been beaten in a duel ! I can take on 5 people at once and still win ! You were the best, but that was decades ago and now - you're afraid now ! You're afraid you're going to lose to me, isn't that so ?!""

Good, I got him now, he's ablaze... It's funny what fear does to a man...certainly an amazing driving force it is, but not a reliable one. 
I stood and slowly headed towards the arena. It's a waste of time...he doesn't stand a chance...

I entered the ring and drew my sword out - ""The God Slayer"". I always thought it's a little bit too much, but the people gave him the name, so I had to respect their say... and it kind of grew on me after all these years. Oh, how I'm going to miss my best friend...
I still remember the day he came to life. I had already mastered every technique ever known to man and collected all kinds of swords, each unique for it's own origin, it's own form and metal, each designed to do one thing and one thing only - kill.
Given the fact I had all this knowledge, I had to make good use of it, but you can't follow the way of the samurai with a giant claymore, or the other way around for that matter. So, I did what no other man had ever done before - I took a piece of every single type of sword in the world, melted them in the liquid fires of Dragon's Mountain and forged him - the ultimate sword. I came up with a design fitting the countless different styles of swordsmanship existing in this god-forgotten world, only to create this unique tool of destruction, a black blade, so black you could feel it sucking you in and condemning you to an eternal wandering into nothingness. I think even I lost myself in there more than a few times.
To this day I still lack any logical explanation why he turned out so black. Maybe it was the liquid fire, maybe it was all the different metals merging together, maybe it was some sort of twisted magic or just a funny way of the all the different gods people believed in, to show me what I actually represent.

""Woooaaahh"", the young men gasped. Drawing him out always brought this reaction on.

""Let's get to it then, shall we ?"", I invited my young opponent to step forward.

It wasn't long before he was laying on the ground grunting in pain. I tried to be careful, but a few bruises teach a good lesson sometimes.

""I told you...you are slow, Remm. You take half measures, make rash moves and you lack the wit to make the most of each situation. Also, your left side is like an open gate, inviting the enemy to come in and annihilate you, without breaking a sweat. You have a lot to learn.""

""Your advice is as old as you ! The world changes with each day, old man, you don't understand the new ways !""

""I understand, I can kill you in thousand different ways... You're right about the world changing, but the past is our greatest teacher.. You remind me of myself to a great degree, Remm, let me give you an advice - fight with your soul and let the sword be the extention of it.""

I sheathed my sword. The ringing sound he made echoed in the pit, like a bird's sweet little song. I loved that sound.

""You've become quite the man, Remm, your father would've been proud of you"", I said as I left the arena.

I headed back home and did my usual routine. I loved doing it and how could I not, this routine was all I have left. I took out all the swords I owned, sharpened and polished them until they practically started shining. Each sword was a set of memories. Memories that defined who I was. Little pieces of time, which when glued together in the right order, formed a figure of a man, who traveled the world in order to find himself, define himself as a person and overcome his fears. That man was me. I am the monster I am and no one except me gets to be my judge and jury, no gods, no men...maybe him, I'd love it to be him.
Right as I finished giving the Slayer his care for the day, I felt presence in the room, there was someone behind me. I kept calm, giving him the illusion that I suspected nothing. I let him get close enough, so I can finish it all with one single blow. Less than a moment is all it takes. So I did, but to my surprise there was nothing. I might have caught a quick flash of light, as if it reflected from a blade, maybe I heard a low grunt, but it was all so faint and distant, almost nonexistent. Was my mind playing games with me ? Is my ending going to be that pitiful ? I felt it again, that presence. This time I was not going to miss. And I didn't. But what was before me, was something I had never come to face in my entire life. There was this enormous, dark figure standing there, as it was wrapped in shadows and my sword was halfway inside it and yet it felt like it was piercing the air.

""I have to admit, I should've expected that. I met you a long time ago and still, I thought it was going to be easy..."", said the creature with this deep, almost unhuman voice. ""Now, can we proceed further with our business."", it said while moving away, like my sword wasn't even stuck in it.

""You don't want to have any business with me, I'd tell you to ask the men who had some, but sadly they are all dead.""

I took another swing, only to miss again. It has disappeared again, only to show behind me, this time it was taking a swing at me, with this huge, silver scythe. The clash between the two blades made noise, as loud as the cliffs on Dragon's Mountain falling because of the raging fires inside it and the sparks set the whole room alight for a brief moment, almost allowing me to see what hid beneath that huge black hood.

""Hmmm"", the creature grunted as if almost surprised. ""Now this is interesting.""

I didn't understand what was happening. What was that thing and why was me fighting it interesting.

""Who... what are you and what do you want from me ?!"", I asked.

""Come on Khaoss, the god-slayer, greatest warrior to ever grace this Earth, can't you really suggest what's going on ? I have been beside you your whole life. You provided, I collected. You never met me, but I met you countless times. Every single soul you put to rest, I collected. Even the God-King, you killed him. He was feared by everyone, but not you, you just executed him then and there, without prolonging it... That's where the name of this fine sword comes, right ? The God Slayer...""

""He wasn't even a god... He just convinced this foolish world he was..."" I interrupted the creature. It seemed to know a lot about me, maybe everything. But I didn't know anything about it.

""He was a powerful man. Many tried ending him, only you succeeded. ""

""I succeed every time, he wasn't to make an exception and you aren't to make one either !"", realisation hit me right when I was saying those words out loud. It was right beside me my whole life, me - providing, it - collecting. The only thing that was right beside me my whole life was ... Death. Then it attacked again. I went for a parry, but then I felt the cold silver blade going right through me. Did I make a mistake ? Did I misjudged the situation ? Or maybe it was on purpose... Doesn't matter now. I am calm. I know what's coming. I know it ends here. It was about time. I dropped the slayer, my best friend, on the floor as I collapsed. It was our last battle together. Even he knew that. At least I got to hear this wonderful ringing once again, only now, it was my last time hearing it.

""Thank you....thank you for the honor of giving me a warrior's death. "", I said while gasping for my last bits of air. Then it was all quiet. The heavy shadows lifted and I found myself in a familiar place. Her laughter filled the room once again, like the sweetest music, making the whole house come to live, while her mother looked at me with this faint smile, softly saying: ""Welcome back, my love, it's been a while...""


 

""You gave it to yourself, I believe, my old friend... But I am the one who should be thankful !""

Death picked it's scythe and headed silently towards the door, leaving behind it a thin trail of blood, black as the blade that spilled it.

You smile, ""You should have come for me while I slept'. 

Death's scythe comes flashing towards you again. You move quickly parrying the blow away again. The sounds of metals clashing together, bliss to your ears. 

Through your 75 years on this earth and since you were 3 you have held swords (practice ones of course at that age, didn't get a real sword to use until 6 years old). 

5 minutes becomes 10, 10 becomes 20, 20 into 40. After 60 minutes of continually parries, you finally hear deaths voice. 

It is truly the voice of death, a sound like a cold winter wind blowing over shattering metal. 

""Why, why do you defy Death? You have lived a long life, you have lived with honor and without fear, so why do you fight me so?""

""When I was 10 my parents died, a car accident, drunk driver. When I was 14 my older brother went a served his country in a pointless war, a sniper got him. When I was 18 I watched as my Grandfather, the one who taught me how to use a sword, died from cancer. When I was 25 I was just walking away from a cafe I had a coffee at, a bomb went off. I watched people scream and die. When I was 40 I watched my wife, the love of my life, my best friend, my soul, die. Cancer again. We had two beautiful children though, who gave me wonderful grandchildren. They were all so innocent, so loved, so perfect. Two days ago they all were killed, a family trip overseas, a long deserved holiday. I was meant to be with them but the airline screwed up and had me on a later flight. Their plane went down. No survivors."" 

""So you fight me because I took their lives? You fight me in anger and hatred, you defy the natural order, you delay my blade for this?""

""I DELAY YOUR BLADE FOR I AM A WARRIOR. I AM A SON, BROTHER, HUSBAND, FATHER AND GRANDFATHER. BUT MOST OF ALL I AM THE SWORD. YOU TOOK EVERYTHING ELSE AWAY FROM ME, BUT YOU WILL NOT TAKE THIS. YOU WILL NOT BEST ME, YOU WILL NOT DEFEAT ME, YOU WILL NOT BREAK ME, I WILL NOT GO QUIETLY INTO THE NIGHT, A WHISPER ON THE WIND. **I WILL GO OUT WITH THE SCREAM OF THE SWORD, THE CLASH OF BLADES ECHOING INTO ETERNITY**"" 

No more was said after that. The battled raged on. Death never able to gain an inch on the old master swordsman. 

Most hate Death, they see Death as a thief, stealing peoples time. A cold unfeeling merciless killer. 

Death is not that though. Death is the final goodbye. The ferryman. The being that opens the door showing you the light at the end, while Death dwells in that lights shadows. 

Death most of all is understanding. Death understood that at this moment, this man, this warrior, this son, brother, husband, father and grandfather, was dying the way he wanted. He would not let the cancer in his lungs kill him, he would not let the heart weakened by years of strain give out on him in some bed while he slept. No he was going to face death. He was going to fight death, he was going to die not as the man, but as the swordsman, as the sword. 

Death didn't hold back, the old man would know. For the 3 hours they fought with deaths endless stamina, he did not break the old man. He did not land a single graze. 

Like the old man said, death would not defeat him. 

""I can not defeat you, we can continue fighting for eternity but, my blade will never touch you. You are truly the sword, and you have done your family proud."" 

The old man dropped his blade, all the emotions finally came out. The old man hadn't failed, he had fought death to a defeat. He had struck back at the one who took everything from him, everything but his sword. 

The tears continued the flow as death held the old man close to him, guiding him to the door. To the light. To the voices echoing and cheering in the distance. To his family.

Swirling, twisting in the Autumn wind, tugging at my clothes, the last of my fine silver hair. It was an oak tree. I remember that for one reason only, because I remember asking my father what it was the day we planted it. I never really had time for that sort of thing after...Cold. So cold, as you age the wind bites deeper into your bones with each passing year. 

Even my stick feels wrong in my hand now, knuckles swollen, thin pale skin stretched like the skin on a sausage.

Today feels different, Not just one of a string of rapidly passing days, I didn't even put my glasses on today, broke the habit of thirty years...just something about today...

The leaves turn and twist in the bitter wind, under the tree, in the courtyard, behind the house, in the cobbled lane. All things worth defending certainly; but a life like that... 

The pain started in my arm, a paltry cramp to one used to the agues of a failing body, but grew into a fire. A horrible pressure in my chest my vision greying one knee striking the ground the world blurred by pain and age and tears

but there is a part of me that always remained detached from the world, and it has good instincts.

The stick whipped around my back parallel with my spine, shoulders screaming at the position. Solid thunk of impact as the wood takes the force I came up into a crouch and spun around to face inevitability, even as a splinter of Blackthorn is whipped away by the breeze. The courtyard is as empty as it ever was.

Lips pull back in a gummy smile and the words come out a croak of defiance echoing back from the good old days, ""come on then, if you think you're 'ard enough""

I'd taken the kid in years ago. I trained him without holding anything back. Every combat technique, every wild theory that I developed, passed on to one 20 year old boy. And here he stood with sword in hand, shielding me from the Hooded Spectre himself.

I stopped myself from giving advice reflexively. *He's got reach, play defensively, watch for his touch, no telling what it might do.* ""Withdraw, son. If he's here, it's for me. Not you.""

\---

I had been feeling pain for the last week, but only today had it become consistent. At 95 years old, I had an inkling that this was going to be the big one but opted not to seek the doctor or bother anyone. My affairs were in order, the deed to the house ready to pass on to the boy. I'd even written of my adventures and left them in the basement. Those same adventures had innoculated me against the strangeness of this moment.

When the pain in my chest had reached a crescendo, my pupil leaped at me, drawing his blade in the same smooth motion we had practiced for years, and blocked a strike coming from behind me.

I nearly lost my mind with surprise, but managed to maintain my wise teacher facade. I turned calmly to face my would-be assassin, and there he stood. Death himself. I'll admit that my composure cracked slightly, but it was nothing compared to the shock written all over Death's own stance. He was rocked back on one foot, blade held limply behind him. He wasn't mustering for a counter-attack. Yet.

\---

""Boy, drop your weapon. He's here to do me a favour.""

""Boss, I can't do that. You trained me for this fight. I'm ready to protect you. *I can defeat him.*""

I laughed, intentionally harshly. I needed to talk the kid down. ""You didn't know blades bigger than a kitchen knife 8 years ago, and you think you can kill Death?""

""Look at his stance. He hasn't had a real fight in a long time...""

The hooded figure had regained his composure and even retreated half a step. His focus was shifting subtly between myself and my student. I didn't like where that line of thought was going.

""Son, like I said: he's here to help me. It's my time to die.""

""If I pull this off, no-one will have to die. You're not going anywhere.""

Death began shifting through stances, holding his scythe one way, then the other. He was judging how best to take on the boy. I watched as my pupil shifted his own stances correspondingly. I watched with pride.

I just wish I had expressed it more.

I stood for the first time since *he*'d appeared. I made a placating gesture and walked to my student.

""Kid, you've been the best student I've ever taken on. You managed to stay Death's hand and bought me a few minutes to correct a mistake. I've trained you to be the man I wish I had been when I first set out. Every expectation this crazy old man has heaped upon you, you have met and exceeded. You are my legacy and every day spent training you has brought me more joy than I've ever known. You need to let me go. This is the first page of your grand adventure... Charlie.""

I should have gotten to know the kid better. Every aspect that I'd seen of him, I was proud of, but there were other areas that we'd never really touched on. Hell, just using his actual name for once was bringing tears to his eyes. Gods, I was a damn fine teacher, but a terrible mentor.

""Okay, Boss. I won't fight,"" he turned to address the Spectre directly. ""If you send this man any direction but paradise, I won't hold back when we meet again.""

I nodded. ""Thank you, son. If I can, I'll tip some dice in your favour from time to time."" With that, I turned and gave myself up to Death, the pride welling in my chest finally overcoming the pain there.

Death's hand cradled a small cyliner no longer than his middle finger, his thumb slowly moving to cover one end. He depressed a nob on the end with his thumb, and the black shape made a clicking noise. 

Before the warrior could react, the object was plunged deep into his jugular, his blood spraying onto Death's bony hand. Death leaned in close, clicking his jawbone against his teeth in something between a cackle and a death rattle. 

""The pen is mightier than the sword,"" He whispered into the warrior's blood-covered ear. Noticing the look of confusion on the warrior's face, Death shrugged. ""Wait a couple centuries, your great-grandkids will probably love it.""

""Even when your body withers and fades, do not let the fire inside you fade"", the old man murmured to himself. These were the words which he had spoken to so many that he had taught, but no other student knew more than the master himself. None had ever beaten him, nor had they even struck him. He was approaching the peak in which he had planned to meet. He knew death was coming for him and he wanted to meet it on his own terms. On the peak of a mountain, where no flank is available, he would await.   


Lesson No. 2

&amp;#x200B;

""When you are conscious, you hone your muscles. When you are asleep, you hone your mind"". He was here now, reminding himself of all he knew. His dreams of the future and the past, practice and meditation, understanding of all things, they would guide him now. Looking around, he could feel what others could not. The power and magic of the world, the lifeblood of Gaia, he felt it move around him. Life and death, yin and yang, the complimenting forces of all things surrounded him, as they surround us all. He sat, crossed his legs and removed the blade from his back. He gently placed it infront of him, blade facing outward, hilt on his lap. He was ready for death. But death... was not ready for him.  


Lesson No. 3  


""There is a lesson in all things. Never stop learning."" His breath became cold. The freezing numbness in his fingers, still wrapped around his blade, began to vanish. The sting of the cold wind slashing the skin on his face began to disappear. He did not need thoughts to understand that this was it. He could feel the blood in his legs slow and his heart begin to fade, like an exhausted worker finally meeting his bed for the first time. But he had one last lesson to give.  


Before even a moment passed, his inhuman reflexes spun him to his side. The mastery of Kendo had kicked him upon his feet in an instant, blade above his head, to meet steel. A massive scythe hung above his head, but he had parried it with his own. His greying eyes meeting with a massive cloaked being behind it. He felt the weight of the scythe lift off his sword as the being moved back, however making no sounds in the snow. He took his stance, realising too that his steps made no sound either. For what seemed like an eternity, he stood, eyes unmoving from what was in front of him. A huge black cloaked figure, at least 9 foot in size, stood opposite him. He heard no sound from it, not a heartbeat, not a breath. Slowly, it raised it's free hand to remove it's black hood. Beneath it shun a face more beautiful than a starry night. It's eyes were pure white and gleamed slightly. It wore a smile that made the warrior fill with a euphoric joy.  


""I guess you are correct, warrior. You do deserve to know who death is."" The warrior understood in this moment that the creature he was seeing could read his thoughts.  


""My name is Kisin, my dear. I understand you have more that you wish to learn. You wish to have the universe at your disposal, but that is not how this all works, not for a mortal. However, you just parried death. I was naive in thinking that it would not be possible. You are an enigma, warrior, but I will force death upon you.""  


With that final word, Kirin lunged forward, moving his scythe in a way that would break the wrists of any human. The warrior blocked once more, learning that the forces of life and death surrounding them moved as death itself did. He used this lesson to block again, and again, and again. focusing his mind on all that surrounded him, he continued to deny death of it's duty. The flurry of attacks stopped.  


Kirin looked at him, almost shocked. ""Speak to me in the human tongue, why do you resist?""  


The warrior spoke quietly and deliberately, ""You tell me that the knowledge of the universe is unobtainable by mortals, but the student knows better than to speak in absolutes.""   


With that, the warrior sprung at the God, moving his body and the powers that surround them to converse on Kirin, dazing him. How could a mortal not only have understanding of such power, but also have mastery over it? The warrior moved inhumanly fast around the being, allowing it barely enough movement to wriggle it's large scythe. He attempted a single movement out of anger, but little did he knew it would be his last.  


""ENOU-"" He swung his scythe, carving through the energies surrounding them, but the warrior had anticipated such a movement. In a single moment his scythe fell from his hand and into the hand of the mortal. Immediately it began to shift from a scythe into a blade. Kirin looked at the mortal, stunned, as the warrior took a step toward him and aimed both blades directly at the God's neck.

But you have grown old, and Death has crept up to deliver his final swing, but something happened, something Death had never experienced before, he was parried.",Uniqueuserlame,"The old man lay silently in his bed, and a thin ray of moonlight creeping through a sliver in his curtains reflected off the short blade mounted on the wall in front of him. He'd awoken from a peculiar dream in which every person he had ever defeated was standing before him, swords drawn, poised to attack, and now he eyed the familiar blade intently. 

It was his favorite, by far, for its elegance and because how natural it felt in his hand; it was an extension of himself, and he felt whole with it firmly in his grip.

Suddenly, the light reflecting off the blade was interrupted by something moving in the shadows. The old man was up in a flash, moving much faster than he had in ages, he stripped the blade from its resting place, spun on his heels, and his blade met an opposing force just inches from his face. 

The foreign blade was only a few inches longer than his, but it carried with it an imposing aura; and behind it, the wielder, was as black as the night's sky. 

The attacker drew back quickly into the darkness, and the old man was left seemingly alone in the black. 

""***That is certainly...unusual***"" 

The voice was unnerving, and it brought with it a certain vibration that the old man could feel all over. 

""***Never before has anyone parried my strike; you should be proud, friend.***""

The old man smiled, still peering over his blade held up in a defensive stance, ""I'm sure you've murdered many proud opponents, *assassin*, but you'll have no luck killing someone as disciplined as me.""

There was an unsettling laugh in the shadows, and the voice echoed all around the old man.

""***I suppose I am an assassin, of sorts, but I only take what is already dead.***""

""Enough, find your courage and complete your devious task!""

""***That blade mounted behind you, it is your favorite, it is not?***

The old man backed up slowly so he could glimpse at the spot where he had grabbed the blade but was surprised to find it still resting peacefully on the wall, while still clearly in his hands. 

""***And that old body still in bed, could it move so fast at that age?***""

His eyes were adjusting now, and he could make out a figure in his bed where he had been moments ago.

""Do you hide amongst my sheets, assassin!?""

The once slender ray of moonlight suddenly illuminated the entire room, and the old man thought briefly of heaven in the blinding light. Once his eyes adjusted, he searched slowly for the intruder, but found nothing. Just his room, with various swords hanging here and there, his cherished blade still somehow in his hand and on his wall simultaneously, and his own body, still resting in bed.

""What is this? Who are you?"" He voice slipped out and his blade wielding hand fell to his side.

""***How many have you killed by sword, my friend?***""

The old man paused, rewatching every fight in his head in an instant.

""None.""

""***Yet you are undefeated?***

""I do not fight to kill; the art of the sword has been a spiritual journey for me.""

""***And I am an assassin who does not kill; I simply guide you to the next stage of your journey.***”

Things were making sense to the old man now, and his sudden realization that he had parried Death washed over him. He laughed, ""Am I really the first one?""

""***The very first, and you have my utmost respect, but there is still a duty to be done.***"" 

The vibration was soothing now, like an embrace from an old friend.

""Will it hurt?"" The old man closed his eyes, ready for the unknown.

""***No. Life brings pain; but death, death is a long, peaceful night, swordsman.***""

He sensed the strike coming; and for the first time ever, he surrendered himself to it.

Death swung his scythe with careless abandon but was met with equal resistance as the warrior stopped his scythe in its tracks and fell back a step , his speed almost at its former glory.

Not by poison, not by illness and, certainly, not by a scythe.

I refuse. I refuse you, Death. I refuse to die by you hand, by the hands of your scythe. You want my soul? Fight for it, fight for it with a sword in your hand. Fight for it, and win.

Here, kid. Come. Let me show you how to kill a swordsman. 
***

Raindrops fall, pitter-patter, down unto the empty plains. A boy, naked from waist up, stands, his arms outstretched, a blade pointing towards the sky. 

""Not a single raindrop. Not one."" Before him stands a figure, ancient beyond belief, dressed simply in robes of white, speaking in barely more then a whisper. The rain itself seems to part around him, an invisible bubble repulsing raindrops as they fall. 

The boy begins to move, faster and faster, his sword moving with increasing speed and intensity, till the blade seemingly stopped, its motion too fast to be perceptible by human eye. Each raindrop falls, slienced apart, dissected, before dissapating into vapour itself, all by the sword in a human hand. 

Death looks on from above, unmoving, observing the scene play out before him. His eyes are not focused on the boy, but on the figure in white, looking for any opportunity to strike. 

His soul is so weak, so fragile, nearly dissapted, yet Death still stands obstructed, unable to strike. Death, itself, could not, using his scythe, find an opportunity to claim this figure's soul. 

""Good. Now, let's move on."" The figure, seemingly satisfied with the boy's progress, signalled to the boy to follow him. He did not look at Death, not even for an instant, even as it hangs over him. 
***

The boy stands before the King, his sword outstretched, pointing right at the throne. It is a challenge for the crown, him against all of the King's knights, the best from the land. 

One by one the knights fought and fallen, each of them, spear, lance, mace, flial, powerless against the boy's sword. Death calmly follows behind, claiming each of their souls, yet, never once, did Death look at the boy. His eyes were still focused on the most precious soul of them all, that of the figure, hanging behind the boy. 

The boy soon reached the King, and, with one felt swoop, slain the King of the Land, the empire now fallen. 

""Good. Now, become the new King."" The figure said again. The boy listened, the crown placed over his head. 
***

The boy became King, ruled as King, for tens of years. The figure was always there, beside him, 
Death following behind, silent in the years that followed. Whatever the boy's decision, they did not question. The boy grew and became a man, a man amongst men, his reign prosperous and long. Yet, the man was not satisfied. He abidicated his throne, the riches of his Kingdom left to his successor, and turned to face the figure once more. 

""Good. Now, you are ready."" 

The figure is ever more wretched, Death hanging ever closer, yet still, Death was unable to claim his soul. The figure, hunched over, grasping the edge of a broken sword, gestured for the man to follow him. 

And thus they moved, journeying through the plains, till they reach the moutains beyond, the highest peak in all of the Land. Upon there, they stood facing each other, and the figure gestured, amidst the snow surrounding the godforsaken peaks. 

Death hung in the distance, following behind, still, silent. 

They struck. The boy was now a man, his swordsmanship growing, not diminishing, in his rule as king. It struck with the authority of the king, the grace of a sparrow, the speed of a cheetah, yet the figure dodged with ease. The figure did not strike back, opting to point out the flaws in the man's swordsmanship. The man learned a lot in the experiences he gained, yet, somehow, the figure was better. 

Nonetheless, he was improving, each dance of the blade strengthening his sword. His sword began to incorperate all that he knew, all that the figure taught him, and began to grow, explore, each strike becoming more fluent then the last. The figure seemd satisfied, yet, turning to face Death, he shook his head. 

Not enough. 
***

Death struck at this instant, its scythe slicing across time and space itself. There, Death saw his chance, and, with hunger, sought to devour his soul. The figure, at that instance, parried, the broken sword deflecting the scythe of Death. The man sword pierced through the figure, into Death itself. 

The figure smiled. Death, incredulous, look onto the sword the man plunged into him. 
***

Death...Death? What did I tell you? A harbringer of Death should be wielding a sword, not a scythe. Look, if you refuse to change, I will simply have to slay you, to replace you with a new Death, a Death with a sword. 

That is how a swordsman dies, Death. We do not die, our spirits live on in the swords of others.
***

The man stood still, the sword plunged through the chest of Death. The figure slowly crumples to the ground, the broken sword clattering uselessly to the side. He slain Death itself. 

""Good. Now, become Death."" The figure spoke, before crumpling into dust.

I knew there would be none to come and help me. Everyone I ever cared about had already been taken by the void. I was utterly alone, but I wouldn’t go easily.

With an inhuman snarl the scythe whipped back around for another blow and I quickly moved to parry the swing a second time.

Clang...

The shadow cloaked in darkness spoke barely above a whisper. “Foolish mortal, no one can deny the void. Your time is up. Now come quietly.”

“I think not. No one has ever defeated me before, and I’m hardly about to lay down and take defeat without my chance at victory.” I snapped back at him.

“There is no victory. There is no defeat. You were dead before I walked in. All that is left is acceptance before I rip you free from this realm. You may be the most stubborn customer I’ve had but you will be coming with me in the end.”

With rage I slashed back at the specter. My sword passed right through him and rang again in my ears as it bounced off of the scythe.

Death spoke anew.

“Well it seems that the scythe isn’t going to be the tool for the job today. But no matter. To be honest, I never thought I’d get to use this little guy once firearms became popular.”

There was a rustling in his cloak, and an emaciated skeletal hand drew out from a deep pocket holding what appeared to be a short stick. He raised his hand high above his head and pressed the decayed pad of his thumb against the end of the stick.

My sword grew white hot and folded in on itself as I dropped it in agonizing pain. I felt both of my legs snap in two as I fell to the ground screaming and curled into the fetal position. I looked up begging for the pain to end.

He was a respected swordsman, and he taught me on the fifth and seventh days of each week along with a few other older boys. I was an eager and able student who had a natural affinity for the sword, and progressed quickly, basking in the rare compliments his father would give me. John never showed any such interest, despite his father’s prodding, and so I was the lone pupil, swinging my sword in the air for hours, listening to the sound my blade made as it cleaved the wind before it. I ignored the jibes from the other children and the mutterings of the old ladies by the well about how girls shouldn’t be swinging swords around. I loved the sword, and that was enough for me.  

One day, I woke to a knock on my door, and John was there. He looked at me, eyebrows furrowed, looking like he had just woken up from a bad dream, and told me in that casual way of his that he was going to learn the sword from now on. I asked him why, and he told me that he had to.  

And so, we went down to the lake shore, as we always had, and his father already had two swords ready for us as if he knew this day would come. John picked up the sword, and in ten minutes I knew that he was to be a peerless swordsman. By the time the sun reached above our heads, John could beat me, and every other student there, every time. By next week, John could beat his father. By the end of that year, there wasn’t a single person on this earth who was John’s equal. He trained, not just two days a week like I did, but every day for hours. I asked him why he was working so hard, and he just shrug and tell me that it was because he had to.  

That was many years ago, and now I lay on the hard-packed earth, my sword-hand hanging uselessly by my side. I was in fine condition, but what use would I be in this battle? John was mere feet away from me, a figure who moved like a spark weaving through smoke, his blade making the wind whistle and sing. His sword was a blur in the air, and clashed repeatedly with the one held by the hooded figure, neither gaining an edge. It’s been like this for hours now. I glanced at the cloaked figure again, took in the bony hands that gripped its black rapier, the tatters of its cloak, the boundless void that hid within its hood. Somehow, we both knew when we saw it, that it was Death itself, and that its blade had sought my throat that day.  

John had stood by my side, gentle and unassuming as always, and simply told Death, “No.” And then they fought.  

*Isn’t it funny*, I thought bitterly, *that this would be the day I finally see John meet his match*. I blinked hard and fast to stop the rush of angry, helpless tears that flooded my eyes. I knew, and John knew, that no matter how good he was, this was simply a matter of time. I hated John now, though I knew why he did it, and I hated him all the more for it. I didn’t avert my gaze though. I kept watching John, memorizing the way he moved, every angle and line of his face, every curve and hollow of his body. I committed them all to memory, even as he was first cut on the ankle, then a deeper gash across his abdomen, then finally, as the point of Death’s blade was driven straight through his chest. John looked at me, a bit of blood flecking his lips, smiled slightly, and died.  

Death seemed to be at a loss. He stood by John’s corpse for a moment, then looked at me. I couldn’t look away. He considered me for a minute. Then, with a voice like dying embers from a flame, Death spoke, “Five months.”  

I could only hold my stomach, only just now slightly round, and watch as he disappeared into the mist.

He had been on his deathbed just seconds before, but was suddenly standing directly behind the Grim Reaper. A surge of energy pulsed through his veins as he unsheathed his katana. He had been waiting for this moment his entire life.

Death was taken aback by the man's brazen gesture. He swung around, scythe in hand, in an attempt to take the old man's soul and complete what he had come for, but was met only with a smug chuckling as he realized he had only grazed the top of the man's fedora.

""Fighting for one's soul is a gentleman's game,"" started the man, ""so I shall refrain from destroying you instantly. But I should have you know that I have been studying the art of the blade for decades."" The man took a precise swing at Death, slashing off the top of his dark, worn hood.

Death, slightly unconfidently, told the man, ""You fool. I am a deity whose purpose is to take the souls of those who have died. Do not make this any harder than it must be.""

The man let out another smug, rage inducing chuckle. He had appeared behind Death a second time. The man readied his katana. Death had left his skeletal neck unprotected by his flimsy weapon.

His body, now just a shadow of it former glory lays helpless in as he watches the black specter slink into his room.

""I couldn't help but notice the wonderful collection of bladed weapons downstairs, as an individual that has well an affinity for blade just had to take my time to stroll around."" Death said as he rummages through a book, pulled from the depths of his robes. 

The old man at first was ready to go, prepared to face his sins. Training alone does not make one a master of swords. It takes experience, and to get that experience he battle. Through these battles he leff mounds of bodies in his to greatness some even former master that raised him that did not deserve their ends. He knew this is his judgement and was prepared to face whatever death has in stored for him. However, what death said next caught him off guard...

"" It says in here you are a true blade master, every worldly style for every weapons conceive up to now. Wow the amount of life you have taken is astounding, so much for only 90 years, impressive."" Death stops talking just hums a soft tune, a tune the old man recognizes as one a former master would hum when they practice swings. "" Let's have some fun""

Inside the old man a strange feeling began to stir, feelings that haven't been felt in years. A fire burning deep inside beckoning him to stand up, to face one last challenge. 

Death looks on knowing the effects of his words, pulls out the old man's first sword from it's robes and slowly strolls out the room. The old man not knowing where the strength is coming from rises from bed follows. 

""One last fight swordsman"" states death "" how long can you last, just a touch of my scythe will end you and drag you to your punishment, but here your chance to live one more time though if your skills are only for show then this will be pointless so please humor me"" 

The old man looks around the big open room they enter, not remembering anything of it's size ever being in his small home, but can see all his weapons all about in the ground hilt ready to be used. He then looks to death and see his first sword, a simple long sword, waiting for him. It then dawns on him what his punishment is.....



Death instantly was upon him, eyes glowing as the old man struggle to dodge. Scythe comes downs ready to end it....
CLANG
The sound  of metal hitting metal  echoes in the large room. The old was able to dive to his first sword and parries death scythe.

Deaths teeth starts chattering, the old man can only assume it was excited. The old man rises back to his feet  gets into the very first stance he learned with his very first blade he used, unsure what would happen if he somehow win this challenge and charges forward.

But you have grown old, and Death has crept up to deliver his final swing, but something happened, something Death had never experienced before, he was parried.",Uniqueuserlame,"The man stood their bloodied and bruised. Besting hundreds with his blades. Regardless the opponent, he could not be defeated. This power he held with a sword in his hand was like no other. Foes would travel from near and far in an attempt to defeat this fabled swordsman, yet all have failed. 
  In the midst of his latest battle his sword weighed on him. Old age had taken its toll, he fell to one knee. Breathing heavily in the cold muddy field of battle, the man felt a warm embrace taking over him. The slow tug of death he felt during each battle seemed to be overwhelming at this point.
""Is this the end? Is this the day I lay my sword to rest?""
He had always felt deaths fleeting touch during every skirmish, but never like this. This warming aura taking over his body.

 ""I have finally caught up to you swordsman."" The whispered voice echoed all around him. ""I have been reaching for you for decades now, waiting for the moment your luck would run out. The time has come to meet those you have vanquished in battle. "" 

The swordsman knelt their in the middle of the battle field surrounded by the bodies of those he had slain. His quest was still not complete. And therefore he would not go quietly into the night. As the voice slowly faded, he heard the sound of a blade cutting through the air. This sound was all too common to him, and even in his weakened state, he managed to bring his blood soaked sword from the muddied battle field to parry the otherwise fatal attack. 

The metal blades colliding with a sound so deafening it sent shockwaves through the air, leaving an eerie silence in its wake. The voice that spoke so proudly before, quieted for a moment.  ""I have been waiting for the day that I would be set free by a powerful opponent, swordsman"" he hissed. ""Death will no longer hunt you, but now you must hunt as death. My journey has finally come to an  end, but yours has just begun""

The swordsman took to his feet, the weight of his sword lessened as he was enveloped in a cloak of darkness. A strange power flowed through him now, one he has never felt before. By stopping the hand of death, he unwillingly accepted his calling. Forced to walk the earth taking the lives of those who knock on deaths door, for eternity. ",unfunnyguy1

I couldn't see it, my old eyes might have started to fail me. Nevertheless, instinct trained through thousands of sword fights told me that there was an incoming attack. Trusting my instinct and my trainings, I moved to parry the attack with all my being.

My trusted blade that has always on my side clashed with something, as I move it to parry the attack. I can feel the weight and shape of an unusual weapon, and for a second, I think I saw it.

Death. Dark robe, bony fingers holding a scythe. Certainly an unusual weapon of choice. 

I felt another attack incoming, and again parried it. Again. And again. Until it finally spoke to me.

""Give it up... your time is here...""

Its voice felt dark and ancient. It stirred my heart with fear, and froze my limbs for a moment. It was during this moment, words from an old master echoed inside of me, telling me that a man is brave not because he has no fear, but because he faces his fears with all his might. Aided by these words, I moved my limbs and parried the next attack. And a few more that come after. 

""Impossible..."" 

Again, it spoke. With the cold and ancient voice, and disturbing non-existent breath. 

Again, I felt how its word tried to grasp me with fear, and again, I concentrated all my being to fight that fear and focus on the battle. 

A moment passed as we exchange blows. Then, it stopped. I felt nothing, just silence. A moment of silence, one that felt like forever. Then, a blow from the side. I moved instinctively, avoided the deathly movement with a side-step and parried the blow to the head that come after. Then a move to the side, and hit its hand with the blunt side of the sword.

Death dropped its scythe. I couldn't see it clearly, but I could sense that it surprised.

""Impossible...""

Again, it spoke. But this time the ancient voice felt different. 

""Human... Do you wish for immortality...?""

Wary, I kept my stance and kept my silence. 

""Answer me...""

This time, I could feel frustration from it's voice.

I have no answer to that, and again, kept my silence. A growl of frustration comes from it, before it disappears... leaving its scythe in my room.",SenchaLeaf

My day is what I make of it.

in my youth each day was an adventure. I made it an adventure. I picked up a sword in my youth and for years it never seemed to leave my grip. There was fame, there was glory- by god there was glory! All the winnings from those years of competition had given me a lovely retirement. A big home, plenty of savings, I never go hungry at all and my children and grandchildren have their lives tended to. Yes this life has really been perfect. Yet I feel like in retiring I made a mistake. Like I had put down my sword long before I was supposed to- or that I should have returned after my children were grown. That my sword wasn't just another well kept relic on my shrine to the glory days.

Speaking of which it was time for me to clean it.

Arthritis has slowed me down a little but not enough to keep me tied to my chair or a cane. I have a special duster just for her. Mi bella, my love, my prized posession: La Viva! The life! Yes, that was my attitude then. Life! Growing up in central Mexico I had picked up a great lust for life at our festivals- for a short while I even took a stint as a Matador. I couldn't continue because I felt that Bulls were not fair opponents.

La Viva is a beautiful sword. A slightly weighty Rapier who had never turned me wrong. Her grip is 14 Karat gold plate with a design that I made myself, a handle that twists so perfectly around the hand no opponent could knock it from you- at least to my belief. I have never actually let anyone else use La Viva, not even my own sons or daughters have held or cleaned her. That was for me.

I use a very gentle metal polish for her handle. I always want it to shine. I do this last since I have to take her off her stand for it and I somehow fear breaking her. After years of battle I've seen, the blows and LIVES it had taken I was irrationally afraid of breaking her. Just the fears of a man whos gone soft. I wondered if I even deserved La Viva anymore. If I had any life left in me worth living. Imagine the once great Pedro Jimenez a tired old man polishing what was left of his legacy in front of a shrine to his best years being behind him, not in front.

I could only gaze at her now as I lifted her cautiously from her bed on the shrine and looked down at her already shining surface. Maybe I had been polishing her too compulsively. She looked perfectly fine. There was only a dark smudge on the handle. I squinted my eyes behind my bifocals and tried to focus in and see what it was only to realize it was moving and it was no smudge at all.

Every muscle in my body reminded me of what I had to do. Whoever made the mistake of sneaking up behind me in my own home certainly had another thing coming to them. Maybe I didn’t have all the life left in me that I wanted, but like hell was I going to let someone else decide when it should run out!

My opponent was on one I was expecting and not at the same time. Not like this. I drew my blade for the first time in years and spun on my heel. I was expecting maybe a home invader, some kind of punk trying to steal my treasures. they’d go for quite a lot on eBay from what I’ve seen. La Viva was not about to end up on eBay… Ever. Not because I wasn’t going to let anyone take her from me at the moment but because I knew my intruder had no interest in LA Viva. They wanted MI Viva.

Two hollow eye sockets stared right through me. My sword had met the unbreakable handle of his sickle. Wait, no...hers. Big blooming carnations adorned her skull and starry robes. La Muerta. I had seen her face before plastered on many a prayer candle, whispered outside of church, and worshiped in the streets. The saint of death, coming for my soul. My breath held steady in my throat and I did not budge, weighing what I was seeing in my head. This felt too real to be some dementia hallucination. I hadn’t lost my mind to old age. No, this was DEATH.

While her sickle was unbreakable it seemed she was not physically all powerful. Could you kill death? Could you beat her? I had certainly cheated her more than once!

“I knew that you’d be difficult.”Her voice was haunting, speaking in no earthly language but one I could perfectly understand. It shook me but I did not loosen my grip.

“Then why did you bother coming?” I had not meant to blurt out something like that to a saint. I was half sure I had just committed some kind of heresy. Was there now hell waiting on the other side? All the more reason to fight.

A skeleton couldn’t glare, but I felt it. She pulled the sickle in and then shoved back, knocking me back against my shrine, pictures falling from it and breaking from the wall. My sword was free, but so was her weapon and she was pulling back to swing again, perhaps assuming she had me trapped. “ALL things die, Pedro.”

I stared Death down, a madness fierce in my eyes. My blood raced as it hadn't in nearly a quarter of a century, but my hands were as steady as they had always been, ever since the first time I gripped a blade. All crafts martial were my calling, and since the earliest days of my memory I trained and honed my skill to become the finest artist of my era. Over one thousand men fell to my blade throughout my life, not once was I defeated in combat. 'This was the way I shall exit this life,' I thought, 'with fury and freedom in equal measure.'

""Come on then, do what you've come to do"" I spat to the spectral visage before me. Death said nothing, and for what felt to me a long time it didn't even move, no hint of humanity on what could barely be considered a face, an etheral smoke filled a space that looked uncannily like a weathered human skull. Then, almost impercetibly, Death nodded, a rare sign of respect from an eternal being. 'Death out to recognize me, I've sent plenty of souls his way over the years.' I grinned at the thought. 

Death approached again scythe raised, its frame flashed towards me faster than any man had before. I barely rolled out of the way of the swing of the enormous shythe in its hands, making a tight arc with my blade as i did so, and so when I came to face Death's rear, I had managed to slash off a small portion of the cloak it wore. As it fell to the floor, I was able to distinctly observe the tip of my blade pass through what had to of been Death's left headquarter, but there was no resistance, no apparent sign that the blade had passed through more than air. I raised my blade again, but my breathing was hard and short. Age had caught up to me, there was no way I could sustain this any longer. 
""ENOUGH!"" I bellowed, and I charge towards Death, blade tip forward and a scream issuing gorth from every fiber of my being. 
Death turned to face me, and I would swear it smiled.",Novus117

Age is catching up to me, but when my hazy eyes look further down at the training sword that's been by my side for the past 20 years, a smile surfaces on my face. Every day, I spend 5 hours swinging. Once, twice, thrice and so on. a hundred times, a thousand and ten thousand times. 

I can feel my chest tightening, my ears are ringing. I can feel it, my life coming to an end. I don't want this. I am not ready to go. 

I kneel down, my hands are shaking. Like the first time I held a sword between my hands, I can feel its heaviness. No longer a part of myself, no longer an extension of my soul. My head is spinning, and my breathing is ragged. I raise the sword one final time and hear a single thud; A clang which brings a bit of life back to me. I look up, and that life escapes me again. 

""What are you?"" I say to the black-robed figure in front of me. I grasp my chest in pain, and my gaze moves down. This man is surrounded by black smoke. Is this death? I don't want to go, not yet.

I struggle to raise up, sword in hand. He's looking at me, I'm looking at him. I can't make out his face, I'm not sure whether it's a man anymore, its face is morphing, from male to female, from a child to a man older than myself.

""Come!"" I cry with my last breath. 

My sword is raised, and another clang rings in the room. The room's light is fading. What should have been the middle of the day has turned into a perfect eclipse. I can't make out the training room anymore, It's now just me and this robed demon.

My sword gets readied again, and another clang rings in this endless void. And then, daylight comes back, as if everything was but a fleeting dream. I look down at my hands, they are no longer wrinkled, and with this realization, my back straightens and I feel young. Again.",Reihns

Short ones, long ones, ones for stabbing, others for slicing, even ones for crushing. It was my life's work, no one could beat me because I would always use the weapon that most countered theirs.  
But I was getting old, and the fear of death began to creep on me. I could feel it already, sense the dead ones in the pits gazing balefully up at me when I walked by. One the day, for I had felt it building for months now, it was calm. That's how I knew it was coming for me.  
I prepared. I donned the armour inherited from my father, the one made by giants long ago. I sharpened the two handed sword until the edge was singing. I wore a mask today, one that I had found deep inside a mausoleum, which I used to scare off uppity brats that thought they could beat me. And finally I waited, at one end of a bridge, knowing it would come from the other side.  
It was there! Almost like from a hole in the ground, it crawled its way out. Long fluttering robes, gilt edged. The hood shadowing its face. And a scythe, almost as big as my twohander. Then it just waited there, not saying anything.  
I stood up, impatiently. ""Well, what is it? Are we going to do this or what?"" The cheeky bastard chose that moment to attack. But I wasn't born yesterday. I blocked the first hit, and swept the second aside. The hood slipped off and I saw with gleeful anticipation the shock and anger on the creature's face. No one had ever parried it before. I plunged my sword through its chest all the way up to the hilt. Using this moment to get close, I whispered into it's ear, ""git gud scrub."" Then I kicked the ragdolling body off with such force that it flipped once before crashing into the ground.  
It wasn't over yet though, it started to get up. But I was already behind it, waiting. This time the sword erupted out the front of it's chest. Little did the creature know, it had already been dead the moment it stepped foot on this bridge. I had carefully chosen the location, and the first kick had sent the creature dangerously close to the edge. Now, the second kick sent it over into the fridgid water a hundred meters below.  
I shook my head at the silly creature. Death isn't the final boss any more than I am. It is Gravity, the ender of all things.",CyborgKodiak

But you have grown old, and Death has crept up to deliver his final swing, but something happened, something Death had never experienced before, he was parried.",Uniqueuserlame,"It was a most peculiar blade. It came seemingly out of nowhere, splitting the night in half - a master stroke so assured, so elegant, that the parry felt like an offence to nature. As it was.

The old man felt the ringing of the blade on his own. It was not his finest sword: it was not magical, as others in his armoury were, nor was it was not madeˀ by a legendary bladesmith, as most of his collection. It was instead an infantry sword from a war long forgotten, a supremely businesslike piece of steel last wielded by some anonymous, terrified, man-child that had failed to parry that first, and last, stroke.

So there: redemption. 

Steeped in haragei, with the unearthly calm of the lethally competent, the old man looked from the shard of frozen moonlight that pushed against his blade to the hilt of woven night that was the handle, the skeletal hand holding it and up to the twin sparks of red-shifted light under the cowl of his adversary.

""The sword, I see, not the scythe?""

PROFESSIONAL COURTESY - boomed death - THE SWORD IS FOR KINGS, AND OTHER WORTHIES

""Am I worthy, then?""

LIKE NO OTHER BEFORE, AND NONE TO COME. EXCEPT...

""Yes?! Except?""

ME.

""Ah. Shall we see, then?""

Death's eyes flashed, and it struck again. Again the old man parried, nostrils flared, drinking in the strength of death's strike, letting it flood new strength into his weary body. So they stroke, and parried, and laughed - most disturbing, death's laugh - and rose above the ground, past clouds, rapt in the joy of battle, until the ground was a forgotten memory in the flow of their dance.

And so two legends came to pass. Humanity no longer had a personal death, making way for the harsher light of reason, and the harsher still duty of finding their own meaning to what life they had. And the swordsman... yes, the swordsman finally met his match.

If you listen carefully, on a still night after a bloody battle... you'll hear your own heart beat, and figure that there's better things to do with your life than waste it in warfare. Only one man did battle so fully that he transcended it - and he's long gone.",recycledcoder

Still frozen with my claymore over my right shoulder I could see the gleaming scythe blade inches from my face. I hadn't moved that fast in decades. I hadn't even heard the figure coming up behind me, but when the scythe came down my body acted of it's own volition.

I heard the surprised rasp of the man in black robes. I shoved his weapon skyward and spun with the claymore for a savage horizontal slash, but the figure caught the sword effortlessly with one hand. It continued to look at me curiously when I noticed that the hand was pale and white, bleached bones wrapping around the blade.

We both stood there motionless. The reaper dropped my sword and slowly reached into his robes. For one absurd second I wondered if death use a gun for situations like these? But when his hand came out it was holding a small black stone. 

As he continued to stare at me his hand shot out straight in front of him. He dropped the stone and I heard its weight hit the floor. Then, as if aggravated, he turned and headed back to the attic stairs briskly.

'Wait!' I shouted. What are you? Are you... death? You were here for me weren't you? What happens now?

Death turned slowly around and faced me. The black abyss under his hood growled something I couldn't distinguish, then he pointed at the small rock. He then turned and headed down the stairs before I could say anything else.

&amp;#x200B;

Peace.

Violence.

Instinct. 

&amp;#x200B;

My vigor briefly restored I had moved with the intensity of youth, my blade finding it's way into my hands as natural as one breaths. Perhaps it was the years of watching my back as a street urchin, perhaps it was Master Roh's incessant drilling, perhaps a small part of me wasn't as accepting of death as I had convinced myself I was. Regardless my blade flashed quick as ever, out and in just like it used to before age had slowed it a bit. 

I had needed to resorted to tricks to keep up with my spry students, another remnant of Master Roh's teachings. Her somehow gruff yet soft voice chastising, ""Of course I played dirty tenderfoot, if I didn't you would never welt, and without the welts you would never learn to stop following my lead and trying to out speed me."" And learn they did, not a one of them has lost but to me and each other. 

I was satisfied with my life, I had 3 pupils, I had served my king with great honor. So why did I attempt this little act of defiance?

&amp;#x200B;

And why did it work?

&amp;#x200B;

Sheathing my blade and passing through the still weeping congregation of family, friends, and students, I move to crouch next to the shadowy bundle that lies among them. 

""I see you wised up since you killed me.""

I freeze in place, my left hand inches away from the hood that concealed her face, my right tightly on my sword. I retract my hand to trace the scar that lies where my right eye once was, the only scar I ever earned. 

Sitting down I chuckle softly, ""It's a lesson you rarely get to learn, and if you do only once."" 

""I honestly thought your compassion would have kept you from attempting it in the first place. I was never more proud of you than then."" She turned to face me then, propping herself up with her one remaining arm grinning her devilish grin. 

The smile is wiped off my face in an instant. ""You know I never wanted that fight. I hated killing you, removing that tradition was my greatest achievement, and this scar my greatest shame.""

""I agree, which is why I forced it upon you. Only someone who could beat me in a fight and still maintain his heart could give the world what it needed. And you did, you got to die old and without burying 3 of your children in the process."" 

She lapses into a coughing fit, black blood coating the ground in front of her. ""What I didn't expect was how fast you would move when I came for you.""

&amp;#x200B;

We sat in silence, simply enjoying the brief reunion before my curiosity boiled up as it always had. 

&amp;#x200B;

""So what now?"" I ask plainly. 

""Now, I move on, and you continue the fight. Just as I did, and the man before me.""

One last devilish look, ""Goodbye tenderfoot."" ",Oh-Bearded1

“Where are you taking me?”   
 

“Where do you think I’m taking you?” Her voice had an edge to it and far less formality now. I hated cryptic answers.   
 

“Well probably hell considering I called you a whore.” She paused and then chuckled and moved on.   
 

“Well then maybe you’re going to hell.” She teased, getting a bit of a rise out of me.   
 

“Are you going to answer any questions or am I wasting my-...well I don’t have breath anymore do I? Or time to waste.” What a realization. It would be great if it wasn’t for the actually being dead part. I let her just drag me. Let her do the work. Fuck it.   
 

“Exactly. But I’ll answer a few, we have some time to get where we’re going.” She had dragged me to the front door of my home and opened it. Outside was not my lovely garden. Outside was not my huge porch. Outside was not my neighbors and friends.   
 

What was outside was a great black tunnel. How comforting. I closed my eyes, gulped and squeezed La Viva for strength, praying my head for mercy. That there wasn’t a hell at the end of that tunnel.   
 

“IS that it then? Please tell me its not just the tunnel.”   
 

“Of course not, pendejo.” she muttered, using the only spanish so far. I had expected more from her in the first place being La Muerta and all. “Its just a tunnel. Do you think you walk that alone? Speaking of which, get up.” She dropped my leg and grabbed my shirt, forcibly lifting me. I felt light as air when she placed me back on my feet. “if we let people walk it alone they’d run off. Get confused.”   
 

I didn’t quite under stand that. “you mean its not just a straight tunnel?” She shrugged.   
 

“Its more of what comes after it. Move it or lose it, I have a lot to do.” She shoved me rudely. I suppose I deserved it; but she kicked me in the balls, man. Hard not to say nasty things. I held my sword defensively and if she had eyes I think she’d roll them. “That wont help you here. Don’t drop your security blanket in the tunnel or you’ll never get it back.” I squeezed even harder and marched into the black tunnel where she followed and closed the door behind her, only for it to vanish.   
 

I wish I had gotten to say goodbye to everyone. Especially Dolores, my wife. Death wasn’t being very sensitive about that.“You’re very rude for a saint.” I huffed, in for a penny in for a pound.   
 

“You tend to be when nobody likes you.” Fair enough. She walked close beside me like a shepherd with a cane. I was reminded of Moses, perhaps it was just a god thing. Another question poppe dinto my head.   
 

“So does this mean that Catholicism is the right one? If you’re death and a saint and all?” She didn’t even skip a beat. Probably a question asked a million times before.   
 

“You humans always think things are so black and white. I am what you believed I would be. Isn’t that the point of faith? The belief?” She looked at me as if she was trying to drill something into my head. “Not that everything will be that way on the other side.” Ah, that hope was dashed. For a moment I thought that maybe the afterlife would be imaginable and I could avoid hell with willpower. The light at the end was growing clearer. I was approaching judgment and had less time for questions.   
 

“Do you collect every death??”   
 

“Can Santa Claus deliver children gifts all over the world? The answer is, no. of course not. I’m just one being and I have plenty of imps for that. I just handle the difficult ones.” I couldn’t keep the smile from my face. I was one of the difficult ones?? A challenge to death herself?   
 

“Oh yeah?” I asked, cocky now.   
 

“Yeah, but you’re not the most difficult case in the world so don’t get too big for your britches.” She had to knock me down a peg or two didn’t she? I had to admit I was curious.   
 

“Who was the most difficult?” We were paused just before the arch of light that was too bright to see into yet not painful to my eyes. This was the last question I’d get to ask. She put down her sickle.

He could feel it before he noticed anything else, the way the air changed. It had been a summers day with warm breezes carrying the scent of the flower garden and wine. Now all he could feel was coldness that had saturated the air. 

Then came the sound. It was the sound of hollowed breaths that no mortal man would make. It’s breath rattled as it came closer to him. 

He knew what it was, how could he not? After all death comes for us all. He knew the moment he felt the sword pierce his back that death would come for him. That fight was not one he could have won, but he hoped had given the child enough time for her to get to her father. She was a good dancer for one so young, he hoped she would keep growing her skills, the days to come would be filled with suffering and pain. She would need to be strong and swift to survive. 

Death stood above the man who was laying on stone floor beneath him. The man was older, his dark curly hair was beginning to thin, his face showed the early signs of wrinkles betraying his age. Taking a moment to pay the man his respect he raised his scythe ready to reap him. As he swung down he felt something he had never experienced before in the eternity that he had existed, he felt his scythe stop. 

Beneath death the man had raised his wooden training sword and managed to halt the swing of the reapers scythe. To say that death was surprised would be an understatement, he had existed as long as life had. He had taken the souls of countless warriors from battles past, he would take countless more in the times to come, it was his purpose for being. Yet before him now, this man had managed to block his swing with nothing more than a wooden training sword. 

“It is your time warrior, put your sword aside and rest.” Death spoke, his voice rattling. 

The man looked at death as if he were an old rival and replied, “not today”. 

The man lunged forward swinging the training sword at the reaper, who had to jump back to avoid it, Death tried to retaliate by slashing outwards towards the man with his scythe, only to have the man twirl out of the way. 

For the first time in his existence, Death had an opponent. For the man fought valiantly, knowing that this fight was the one that he had been training for his whole life. 

Eventually the two broke apart, their dance of blades coming to a standstill. Death had not been in a situation like this, he knew the man was out of time and yet… He felt himself drawn to this individual. Death felt an idea come to him, one he had thought about doing many times yet never had he actually gone through with it. Until now. 

“You will have more time warrior, use it well.” Death spoke to the man, “for when we next meet, you will come with me.” Death raised his hand and snapped his skeletal fingers. The man felt the wound that was in his back vanish, feelings of warm began to touch his skin as the suns fingers caressed his skin once more. 

The man looked back to where Death had stood only to see no trace of the being, yet the man knew he would be back. 

Yes, he knew he would met the being again someday. When that day came he would fight again, after all there is only one god, and His name is Death. And there is only one thing we say to Death: 'not today'. 

With that thought in mind Syrio Forel walked towards the palace exit. Arya would need his help again soon no doubt. ",WannabeWulfie

I ducked. It was all I could do. I ducked and rolled, my whole body screaming against this action. If I got out of this alive I’d certainly feel dead afterwards. My poor knees.  I could hear the sound of her heavy weapon tearing through my shrine, sending what was left of it toppling down. The only irreplaceable thing there was La Viva and I had her right in my hand.   
 

I seemed to have an opening when the tip of her her sickle became stuck in the floor from momentum. I could get her form behind, maybe knock that skull off her head! Could she fight without a skull? Perhaps if I seperated every bone and put them in jars. Oh that had to be heresy with horrible consequences but I suppose a bad solution is better than no solution. I turned on her and thrust. The sword pierced her robes and went straight through her rib cage to the other side. It was instinct, a usually fatal blow.   
 

I had no idea why I thought that would work on a skeleton.   
 

She stopped and for a second I thought I had won. Then the crackling sound of her whole neck turning like an owl to look back at me with the most intense hatred I had ever seen. This had been a horrible move, I knew it instantly as it was just what she needed to jerk her blade out of the floor. That anger. That rage. That frustration of an unruly client. I sank in all the way to the hilt and used all my weight to force us both to the ground on our sides. Her spine had been the perfect trap for my bade and we both toppled like dominoes. Now was the struggle to get away. I was too close to full pull La viva back out of her so I had to roll. Bad move.   
 

The second I did The blade of her sickle slammed down not but a centimeter from my eye line. She had maybe taken off an eyelash. When I dared turn my head she had turned against my sword as it was only trapped one way. Did she ave the upper hand? She was stuck for at least another few seconds. I dared to grab the handle of the sickle myself and push with all my might. She was strong, but I was stronger.  
 

The blade ripped out of the floor and with its weight I flipped her onto her back. Yes. This was were I wanted her. Could I behead with a rapier?? I hadn’t ever tried, not even on animals. Maybe as just a skeleton it would work. I was straddled on her hips, my body screeching in agony as I lifted my sword, staring into her eye sockets, the etched designs around them worn down by eons of existence. Could this finally be over, could I finally be done? I was trying to straighten myself to finish the job when the whole world went upside down.   
 

A sharp pain in my face, like being hit by studded gloves, knocked me speechless, dizzy, and on my ass. Had death- DEATH- just sucker punched me!? While on the ground I was subjected to a far worse pain. She could have just ended it with the blade but she didn’t stop there. She had rose from the floor like magic before me- and then swiftly kicked as hard as she could between my legs. I couldn’t react fast enough. My whole body lurched forward and my brain went numb. I couldn’t speak, only wheeze. La Muerte, that bitch, had kicked me right in the family jewels.   
 

Helpless as an infant, I laid writhing in pain. I can safely say out of getting kicked in the balls and being stabbed- I much rather would get stabbed. The first words I could think to scream were the most heretical yet.  ",PastelNihilism

Shadows played across the gaunt man's body revealing a taut skin impossibly criss-crossed by scars.  Though he appeared relaxed and he hadn't moved for hours, Death knew that a man that had survived for that long living such a life as his was seldom as he appeared.
""This is getting ridiculous. This has to be the right man,"" Death muttered as he fumbled through his satchel and pulled out his parchment. Though the man himself had long forgotten his name, Death's bony finger quickly found it emblazoned bright on the parchment.
Death stumbled into the clearing less graceful than he had hoped brandishing his scythe he hoped menacingly.
""It is time. Fight all you want but you can't escape. This is the fate of all living things.""
The man smoothly rose up. Normally Death did not interact so directly with mortals but the man's lifetime quest of carnage had thinned the veil between the living and the spirits that flitted between worlds. He was clad in a tattered loincloth, an outfit incongruous with the wealth he must have accumulated after defeating so many noble knights and master swordsmen. Death was a force of nature. This feeling of uneasiness that washed over him as he watched the man carefully unsheath his katana should have been a foreign feeling.
The wiry man elegantly bowed and whispered an unheard prayer to a curious talisman in his left hand. Time meant nothing to a being like Death but he wasted very little as he closed the distance to the swordsman.
The man simply circled around Death, katana loosely at his side, each step carefully balanced. Growing impatient with these games, Death finally raised his scythe and slashed down faster than any viper... only to be parried for the third time today.
""I thought only boxers wore those leather hand bindings. When the heck did he even put those on,"" Death mused as he watched the man's covered hand turn aside the haft of the scythe.
As the blade buried itself into the dirt at the man's feet Death stumbled into his embrace. Faster than even Death could follow the man sheathed his katana and mysteriously pulled a dagger from his loincloth. The man hugged Death closer and gently, almost lovingly slid the dagger through Death's cloak into his shriveled, blackened heart. As the man carefully laid Death's corpeal form down and it started to disintegrate again he leaned down and gently whispered into Death's skull in a strange dialect, ""Git gud.""

But you have grown old, and Death has crept up to deliver his final swing, but something happened, something Death had never experienced before, he was parried.",Uniqueuserlame,"The climb up Mount Domhan hadn't gotten any easier, but Beathan had become accustomed to such a journey. As the afternoon sun crested it's way behind the western mountains, the swordsman pushed forward. The wind and faint snow whipping across his worn face as he continued his ascent, his one good eye straining to make out familiar shapes against the blinding white. The curl of his long jacket danced and swept the snow as he walked. His lungs straining more than ever, his heart pumping, the snow blinding, there would not be many more chances to make this trip. He felt it in his aging body, Beathan knew that it was near time for his journey to come to the close. Three hundred years of entertaining Bál had left him weary and broken. Of course, entertaining for a being that does not know what it means to be tired can have a toll on a man. Beathan peered left and saw the cave that marked the near finish of the ascent. He figured he could share the night there and continue in the morning.  A few more minutes and he was standing in the opening. A small rocky floor led into a shallow and  frozen lake. Beathan took some sticks  he collected from the bottom of the mountain and assembled them for a fire. Beathan unsheathed his sword, and with a flick, struck the flint on the scabbard, sending a volley of sparks into the pile of sticks. After a few more strikes, the fire was roaring. Removing his jacket, the swordsman looked at his arms, covered in a weave of Celtic knots and deep scars from previous journeys, each one marking both a victory, and defeat. Few men had cut him, those men no longer lived. Beathan ran his rough, calloused hands through his short white hair, his left hand tracing the scar going upward across his frosty eye. The one who took his eye still walked this world. He would be meeting him soon enough. 

""He doesn't like to be kept waiting"" Beathan said to himself as he sat up and pressed his back to the rocky wall. The fire was out, and the morning sun crept up over the eastern range. He left the pile of ash and dawned his jacket, sword and pack. After a brief respite, he placed one hand firmly on the hilt of his sword and pressed forward, the burden of age becoming faint as determination overcame his doubts. This would be the end. He felt it deep in his bones, and more in his soul as he ascended to the peak. Beathan had done this ritual every year for the passed 300 years, but this one felt different. Beathan knew this trip was different, Beathan knew he would not be descending Mount Domhan this day.   


Beathan reached the peak when the sun was nearly highest in the sky. He stood over the edge of a ridge and peeked into the crater that formed the bowl. The flat bottom was cracked, with eerie deep blue light emanating from cracks in the ground. Beathan lifted his leg over the small rocky cropping and descended into the bowl. To his surprise, Bál was not there... yet. He crept to the center and looked around, no signs of anything yet. This was his chance for peace. Beathan knelt down and began to gather his thoughts. After about an hour, Beathan heard the shuffling of rocks.   


""Steady"" he told himself. He would only have one chance to get out of this.   


Beathan took a deep breath and listened for the rocks again. The movement was getting closer, and closer, until finally it stopped behind him. Beathan braced himself for the sound of steel splitting air. That was his chance. Beathan sensed the beginning of a swing and pivoted on his knee. He drew his sword with his right hand and swung upward and away. He was now looking at the familiar, black robed creature that had made this deal with him in the first place. A long life in exchange for a good fight. Could he keep up this time? Beathan's age did not affect his speed, as in a single moment, Beathan pivoted the angle of his blade and swept it leftward across Bál's throat, his robes dropping in a puff of smoke. Beathan stood up on his guard and  looked for the creature, scanning the bowl but finding no one. A dark presence grabbed his thoughts, and forced its voice into Beatha's ear.   


""Age does not slow you... Beathan. No mortal has done that within the first two blows in several hundred years""

&amp;#x200B;

Two puffs of smoke appeared to Beathan's left and right. Both drew swords and assumed stances. The two gheists each struck, one going high and the other low. Beathan dodged the left attack, struck the right gheist, and turned to swing at the left gheist, but it was gone. The sound of meat hitting rock startled him as he suddenly felt a hot white pain in his left arm. He looked down to see that the meat was HIS meat. Beathan set his sword down calmly and in his right hand formed a fist. Beathan closed his eyes and focused. As he focused, a white light began to grow in his hand. He open his palm and placed the white light against his nub, the white light searing it closed. Beathan continuted to look around as he completed his first aid. He grabbed his sword, holding the blade facing backwards as the shinobi had taught him, as this was the only way to maintain guard using a sword single offhandedly. 

The dark voice assaulted his head once more, ""Maybe now it will be a bit more... even.""  


At that moment, all sounds stopped. The blue light no longer pulsing beneath the rocky cracks, the wind was no longer blowing. All movement had ceased.  The sky had darkened to a deep indigo hue. A door appeared in the center of the crater with a puff of black smoke. Through the door, came Bál.   


""always one for the dramatics, aren't ye ya great bastard?"" Beathan said as he came through the door.   


""Only for those who appreciate it.""  


If I should keep going lemme know

Even in dreams her arms and her feet danced, practiced perfection that made the iron in her hand a paintbrush that colored her dreamscape crimson—but which was the master and which was the tool?—and made sleep not a respite but something her body just lost to. 

In her youth, she had basked too much in her vanity: first with the praises of her teachers, and then with the truth that she had outgrown their discipline. It was not enough for her sword to move through the air in beautiful form; its edge was made to slice through flesh, and flesh it found and never stopped craving. 

Someone a long time ago had wasted their last breath to tell her that Heaven would never recall her conscience no matter how hard she begged, and perhaps it was that which punished her with memory, the faces that never stopped staring in her sleep no matter how her blade turned them into ribbons. 

And maybe when the pain in her failing heart pulled her from the torment of sleep that last time, it was yet another punishment, and perhaps the worst, for it did not end her suffering as it should have, but instead cued her body into another performance—this time to dance with Death itself. The strike that came never landed, and the perfect swordsman, up to the never-end, was unbeatable. 

But the blade that brought the end to so many couldn't end Death. And it knew nothing else, and so it swung, and struck back, and parried. And the swordsman discovered that there was one more vain and more tortured in its purpose than her, as Death never swung its scythe without collecting what it felled. 

And all throughout the world, souls waited, and tired of waiting for what never came, and though they threw themselves in the clashing blades' path, the perfect swordsman's sword and Death's scythe would not land where they were not meant to, and the stairs that led up to Heaven and down to Hell remained unclimbed, and there was nothing else but the ringing of metal—",deathbyhumidity

""I'm not sure, muscle memory I guess.""
I pushed his twisted and jagged scythe away with my sword but he quickly returned with another deadly swing. Only a secon to react and I parried once more. The blades caused sparks to fly and my curtains to catch fire. Death ignored the fire, he was only focused on me.

He came down on me once more. I did manage to block it but the scythe broke a hole right the middle of my longsword. Luckily I had something else above the mantle, a katana. But he quickly swiped it out of my hands with the curve of his scythe. Two could play at that game.
I reached for the cornucopia on my kitchen table and pulled out a crescent moon sword from it. With the sword's circular shape I was able to hook death's scythe, even socked his jaw right off.

""No one can escape death,"" he said as he began to twirl his scythe so fast that he started to disappear into a whirlwind of fire and splintering wood.

My sword flew right out of my hands and left me with so few options. I leapt as well as these old bones aloud me to and picked up a gift I had all wrapped up for my granddaughter's birthday. Death's blade tore it open as I held it in my hands and I pulled out the practice rapier from it's broken casing.

I got into my stance and lunged back at him while keeping out of his reach as best I could. I had a plan: to try my best to push him back into my living room where the fire started and get to a stronger sword.

By then he had clearly gritted frustrated with me. He screamed out and suddenly his scythe grew an extra blade on the opposite end. I knew I had taken a risk runing back into that fire but there wasn't much I could do. I dropped as the scythe spun over me and jammed into the wall behind me.

He streaked across the room still screaming his raspy scream and his bony fingers sharpened up and sliced visable lines through the air. I rolled over to the lazy boy I was sitting in at the start of all this and pulled it's lever, the foot rest popped out and acted as a one time shield as his claws ripped through them, but by that time I had grabbed my knitting needles and jabbed them into his empty eye sockets. He shot backwards while I crawled to my original long sword he cut into. It was burning hot but I was able to use it to cut off his entire left shoulder with it.

Death fell back to the floor crawling backwards and I took his scythe from the wall and held it in my hands. It made me feel powerful. He begged for his life when he saw me with it too. I thought about it, thought about what he wanted to do to me and him begging the same not happen to him. I had a choice to make . . . But, eh, I let him go. No big deal.

He shot out of there as fast as he could and I haven't seen him since. As for me, well, no one can escape death, so here I am. New grim reaper.

The woman looked at him in shock and discust. It was an ubelivable story but his skeleton WAS partly showing as he floated in the air wearing a black cloak and glowing green eyes. She eventually responded. ""That still doesn't excuse you giving my daughter a scythe embuned with dark powers for her birthday. It's unacceptable.""

""What can I do?"" The new grim reaper asked. ""Her old gift burned in the fire. Besides I'm more of a longsword guy myself.""",Just-Meza

It was an intense pain that radiated from my core. My body seized, I felt the blow approach, a coward's blow to attack from behind, but one I was not unfamiliar with.

With practiced ease, I rolled from my chair, drawing my sword as I did, parrying the blade as it cleaned through where I once rested.

The second strike was one made in haste, clearly my assailant had underestimated my superior 6th Sense, I disarmed them with a quick riposte. Their weapon, a worn scythe, flew from their hand and clattered to the ground far from reach.

""How!..."" the cloaked figure hissed. 

Red eyes burned with hatred as I could feel the creature glare at me from beyond it's black hood. 

""Never!"" It spat, ""Since the dawn of mortal life has one stayed the blade of death!"" It pointed a single bony finger at me. ""How, Johnathan BloodRaven have you defied me!?""

I stood to my full height, allowing my leather coat to drop below my knees. 

""When others revelled, I studied the blade.""

I slowly sheathed my sword, death was no threat to me.

""When others fell to base desires, I mastered myself.""

I stroked the beard upon my neck.

""When others let vanity and pride guide them, I sought true strength.""

I could not help but allow myself to smirk at this adversary, so defeated and spiteful, like so many before him.

""So when you came for me...""
 
I turned to leave McDonoldo, tipping my fedora as I did.

""I was ready.""

The old warrior's voice trailed off in his familiar way of not completing his thoughts out loud.  

""Is the balance correct, Ikeda-sama?  The engineers are ready to prototype another blade, but the timing is becoming rather tight."" His hand moved slowly to take the katana back from his master, his sharp eyes watchful of the monofilament edge as if it would strike him of its own volition.  Just looking at the object made beads of sweat gather on his forehead.  They had already tested that edge against every known material in the Ikeda Corp's military division catalog with phenomenal results.

""You and your team have done well, Harada-san.  As usual.  The balance and weight are perfect.  How long do we have before our...meeting?""  Ikeda asked, even though he knew the answer like he knew the rhythm of his own breathing.  He had known the exact moment of his death for the last two hundred and forty years, and spent all of his considerable efforts and resources preparing for it.

""You have precisely three hours, fourteen minutes.  I'll bring tea and seal the room.  Is there anything else I can do for you, Fumio?""  Emotion welled up in Harada's eyes as he turned to leave his friend and teacher.  

Ikeda smiled and clasped the younger man's hand tightly.

""Thank you, old friend.  Thank you for everything you have done.  Your father..."" The old man's voice trailed off once again, the thought incomplete, but the sentiment whole, hanging in the air between them.  ""Your father would be very proud of you,"" Ikeda thought to himself as he watched Harada close the doors with a bow, wiping his eyes with the back of his hand.

The huge wooden doors moved silently, each half weighing as much as a car.  When closed, Ikeda marveled at the stunning detail of the carved relief in the door.  It was a perfect carving of the Hakone Shrine Torii Gate of Lake Ashi.  The gate and lake both were long gone, but the depiction here was so lifelike, it was the next best thing.  One could almost hear the gentle waves lapping along the shore.

The old man with the new, young body sat easily before the low table in front of the huge windows overlooking Tokyo at sunset.  So much had changed over the last few hundred years, but the sun still set like it always had, and no matter how many of them he had seen, Ikeda still smiled at each one as if it were the first.  He silently hoped it would not be the last, sipping his tea.

Tokyo was beautiful at sunset.  Hard to believe half of it had been destroyed in the AI wars a century before.  When the last of the *Xinshen* AI Cores went down, they set off their failsafes, triggering explosions all over the world, from New York to Melbourne, but Tokyo had gotten the worst of it.

From his perch at the top of this building, however, it almost looked like it did that day in 2030 when he first saw it over three hundred years ago.  The widespread violence that took place afterwards spanned over a hundred years, but in the end, it was the joint efforts of the Resistance governments that created the elite *Kage* units, which in turn, ended the wars.  American and German general AI, Japanese biotech, African natural resources, and so many more contributions came together to create one thousand warriors engineered to be perfect.  And it was the sword that turned out to be the answer against the *Xinshen* AI's throngs of expendable clones, cyborgs and ordinance.  At the core of the Resistance tech, however lay an improbable heart made of nothing more than old martial technique.   It turned out that if you had perfect warriors, the old *Budo* principles worked even better than with unassisted human form.  

When the *Kage* met the chromed *Shibing* horde, the clones and automatons of the *Xinshen* fell at fifty times the rate the Martial Cores had predicted.  While the horde’s AI furiously tried to work out how their fronts were being cut to ribbons by swords, the *Kage* were cutting their way through, graceful, deadly, and damn near unkillable.  *Xinshen* almost won, but the Resistance had made one last gamble.  The *Kage* were men first, still fully under their own control, and with their own memories.  Each one of them existed as an unpredictability variable that multiplied with every choice.  Together all those variances created a sum that was large enough for the Unit to step through to victory.  Even against those vast, self-improving AI, Humanity could keep up its unpredictability like a shield, faster than the *Shibing* martial cores could rewrite their own code.  
Ikeda rose from *seiza*, his plain black *yukata* rustling slightly.  

The old man with the new body longingly eyed the nano-tech armor on its stand, dimly lit in the corner behind his desk.  It would not help him against his foe tonight.

He triggered the sub-vocal koan which called up his battle routines.  Synaptic, haptic, motor and perceptive nanites instantly networked to form the battle meditation that was the foundation of the *Kage*.  Ikeda’s hand found the *tsuka* of his blade, modeled after the famed *Mikazuki Munechika*, the Half-Moon blade.  One of the Five Swords Under Heaven, the original had somehow survived, and was still on display over one thousand years after its forging.  This one, however, was quite different than the original.  Ikeda’s personal version was made of a nanosteel and carbon matrix with the signature *Kage* monofilament edge, capable of truly cutting anything it encountered.  The one he wielded in the AI wars featured magnetic and inertial fields capable of deflecting projectiles, particle weapons and various forms of energy.  This one would not need any of those things.  Just the neural interface and the edge were required this night. 
 
Ikeda brought the blade to his side and began to flow from position to position.  He combined *Yagyu* and *Katori-ryu* techniques in ways the old masters would find blasphemous, but even among the *Kage*, Ikeda’s strokes were masterful.  The deadliest calligraphy that has ever existed.  He lost himself in his preparations, even as his breaths counted down the time until his…guest arrived.

His battle meditation was flawless, his heart full.  Ikeda was content with his life until this point.  His mistakes were many, but over time, he had come to terms with himself in ways humans could only realize once their lifespans began to reach into the hundreds of years.  His life would continue or end this night, and, like so many times in his memory, it came down to the sword.

Night after night, the Master would practice alone in his cave. Thirsting for blood, the Master's hunger for victory drove him to greater and greater lengths. he would devour all who stood up to him, but the Master's dark, spiked, and savage blade instilled so much fear in his opponents that none dare approach him anymore. This was a man who had never known defeat.

Until one day a slim veiled figure approached the Masters cave. Curious, for no such specimen had ever come near the cave before. The Master drew his blade and asked ""Who DARE approach me? Take one more step and your life is forfeit.""

&amp;#x200B;

The dark figure replies in a small voice ""I am Death. I have come for you""

""NEEEEEEVER!!!"" the Master shouts!!

He sees is all play out in his minds eye first. The Reaper comes in from above swinging the Scythe in a downward strike, The Master parries using a vertical block, transitioning into a cross slice, bisecting through the Reaper's torso in an explosion of epic gore!! The Lights all white out. It is so easy for the Master.

“DEATH, YOU STUPID BITCH!! OH MY FUCKING GOD WHY!? WHY!? YOU HAVE A SICKLE YOU COULD HAVE JUST ENDED IT GOD DAMMIT JESUS FUCKING CHRIST YOU WHORE!!” I could die boasting, I suppose, that I had called death a whore. I’m sure that will be a fun story to tell while burning alive in a lake of fire.  Catching my breath was growing impossible at that point and in fact- oh god I couldn’t catch it at all.   
 

Suddenly it was like there was an elephant on my chest, weighing down on me and crushing the life out of my body. Then a sharp pain followed,  more intense than the one currently being inflicted by my rapidly swelling testicles. My heart. This was it. This was her plan all along. I let go of my balls to clutch my chest, writhing on the floor as my body lost control. Only La Viva held tight. It was inevitable that life would always be conquered by death. It was my last thought as I gazed up at the still seething but unmoving death. Darkness clouded my vision and the light of my home became dim.   
 

I had gone out fighting, I had gone out of my life the same way I came into my life. No not my biological life, but the life I had been LIVING. Death had made me feel life for the first time in years. I had wanted to fight her, I had assumed this was all on my terms but there had been a plan for me all along. Now I was going to face hell, hopefully La Viva would follow so I had a fighting chance.   
 

Imagine my surprise when I opened my eyes to see my same ceiling and still feel the warm metal of La Viva in my hands. Granted I was still sore, and oh so tired. Had death spared me? I had impressed her? Had I survived? She had seemed really pissed- WHOOP. Before I could sit up something grabbed my leg and lifted it. It was La Muerta dragging me along behind her by my ankle.   
 

My worst assumption was that the heart attack hadn’t worked and she had worse planned for me. I had no strength for resistance. When I looked back on my shrine I was shocked to see it was un touched by chaos and the only thing missing was La Viva. No dropped pictures or ruined shelves. What was more disturbing of course was that I saw my own dead body laying there on the floor, clutching la viva just as I did now. We were both still clinging to life.   
 

I sighed in defeated. That was it. I finally lost. Only death had been strong enough to take me down… It still sucked. I only had a few questions if this really was it.

But you have grown old, and Death has crept up to deliver his final swing, but something happened, something Death had never experienced before, he was parried.",Uniqueuserlame,"One does not live to be my age following the life I've led unless they are both very skilled and very lucky. While I've never lost a fight, a stray arrow striking me in the chest would put me down same as any other man. The sheer number of times I've narrowly escaped the cold grip of the reaper are too numerous to count, and over time I developed a sense for it. My back would tense up, my hairs would go on end, and I could practically feel the theoretical instrument of my demise coming before it ever reached me. In such situations, I would surrender myself to instinct; dodging, parrying or striking back as my senses dictated. I can't say I ever thought it would lead to this.

The cloaked figure was sprawled across the floor, my blade protruding from it's back. The scythe it tried to strike me with  had wedged itself between the floorboards next to the body. I nudged the body with one foot, trying to turn it over. The body was heavier than it looked, but after a few kicks I was able to get it flipped around, the blade through it's back resting against the ground keeping the whole thing on an angle. I grabbed my lantern and leaned in close to get a better look at my assailant. Pushing back the hood revealed a stark white skull, the empty sockets where it's eyes should be staring back at me in the dim light of my cabin.

""No, no, no. This isn't what it looks like, right?"" I muttered, trying to calm my nerves over what I'd done. ""Somebody just held too much of a grudge and came back to pay me back, right?"" I added, thinking that somehow a more logical alternative to the, ahem, grim reality in front of me. I was a fantastic swordsman, possibly the best in the land, but some things had to be impossible even for me, right?

The rest of the night melded together into a blur. I remember pulling my blade clean of the creature's chest and dragging it outside by the cloak before dumping it out into a ditch somewhere in the nearby forest and running back home. The cloak went into a cupboard and the scythe behind it. As I put out my lantern and laid down in bed, I prayed silently that I didn't do anything too drastic...


I was woken the next morning by a banging on my door. Stumbling out of bed I opened it only to be greeted by one of the local farmers. A small, fat fellow with a penchant for gaudy clothing and face that was always a bright shade of red. He always looked to me as if god dropped an apple on a pumpkin and started working from there. I'd long forgotten his name, but he never bothered to learn mine in the first place so I figured we were even.

""Sir, you need to come quick!"" He bellowed with a loudness not fitting for how early in the morning it was. 

""What is it?""

""It's the Carter lad. He fell off his horse and his head got twisted sideways!""

I flinched. You saw things like this happen every so often if people either weren't careful or very drunk. ""Well you hardly need me for that. Get the grave digger and see if you can round up a friar from somewhere."" I had bigger things to worry about after all.

The man was quiet for a moment as he fiddled with his handles. ""Well, it's all a bit weird sir.""

""What do you mean?""

""It's just that the body is in a bit of an odd place.""

I sighed. I didn't have time for him talking around things. ""Spit it out man. Where's the body now?""

""Well, it's down at tavern drinking.""

I stared at the man who shrunk under my gaze. ""Drinking. At the tavern."" He nodded. 

""He said he was in a whole lot of pain what with his head dangling off and all that, so we figured it'd be the best thing to do for now."" I went deathly quiet for a moment, something that seemed to put off my visitor. ""Er, if you want me to come back later sir...""

""No, no, it's fine. I'll be along in a few minutes."" I said, closing the door in his face before he could get a word in edgewise. 

I sat on the edge of my bed as what I was just told swirled around in my head. As much as I was hoping it wouldn't be, deep down I knew somehow this was my fault. My gazed drifted through my cabin before coming to rest on the cupboard. After a good few minutes of just staring at it, I rose from my bed and retrieved the black cloak and scythe I had hidden there the night before. The cloak fit snugly, and while it wasn't exactly my first choice of weapon, after a few swings maneuvering the scythe felt natural. 

Opening the cabin door and stepping out into the light, I could just about hear the commotion forming at the tavern as onlookers rushed to see the man who by all means should be dead right now. I just sighed and closed the door behind me. I wouldn't want anybody to think I'm not the kind of man who'd try and make up for his mistakes. I'd probably die of shame otherwise.",masterherox

The town was long deserted, as it's inhabitants fled as soon as they heard tales about this bearded old man. 

It was a cold Autumn morning. Sunlight peeked through the torn curtains and glistered upon the rows of swords on the wall. Those were his prized possessions: some were hand crafted from scales of dragons or the most precious of gems, but most were trophies from his ill fated enemies.

In the corner he sat, next to a furnace with crackling flames. A heavy, unremarkable steel blade sat across the anvil, one that looked just like the hundreds of blades that lie all over his hut floor. His arms filled with wrinkles, but still strong when he slid the blade across a sharpening stone. 

Everything went quiet. He never thought it was possible to get quieter than what he was used to, as he heard from no birds or crickets for the last 10 years. The furnace flame went out and he was greeted with a hooded figure next to him. The hood was grey, torn and draped across a misty figure. Floating in front of it was a scythe with a glowing green blade, and barely visible was what seems to be fingers around the wooden handle.

""Is it my time to go?"" as he broke the silence. His voice stutters as he first spoke in 10 years. The silence continued for some time, and was again broken by a swift swing of the scythe.

""Clang!""

His blade caught the scythe's.

He held death back with at first his right hand, but soon he had to use both hands as he felt that he was overpowered. A gentle grin emerged on his face: he never needed both of his hands in a duel, until now. 

Death did not budge. The scythe floats perfectly still as his hands starts to tremble. His blade soon corroded away and he ducked from the swing. Death stood still as he darted across the hut to reach for his weapons. 

The dagger of Moriah, forged in the blood of a demigod that sacr- broke in half when it hit death's hood; Blade of Imberth, casted from a scale from the great white drag- melted away when it met with the the scythe. It didn't take long for him to realize that none of his mortal weapons were useful against death.

The hut slowly fell apart as he ran through all his blades. Blades made from precious metals melted away, blades made from precious gems shattered. 

Death was infuriated, as he delivered a swing straight down onto him. He grabbed his nearest blade and caught the scythe by the tip. He almost missed as the blade was mysteriously light. He held back for a brief moment before letting go; the scythe cleanly sliced his left arm off.

He rolled over anticipating immense pain but there was none. To his surprise, in his left hand, (which was now a few feet away) was a wooden sword. But this was no ordinary wooden sword, this sword was made from the roots of Yggdrasil, The World Tree. It was useless as it's edge could never be sharpened. Every bit of material removed simply grows back, but this was the only blade that could hold itself up against death. The notch on the blade from the impact was now fully healed. 

He crawled for the sword and charged towards death. Death was shocked, but still swung his scythe in defense. The scythe nibbed his index finger on the handle, but he pulled back with all his might.

The scythe fell on the ground next to him, killing the grass and scorching the dirt underneath. Death's hood fell.

""I won, I guess"" he chuckled, as he reached for the scythe. As soon as he gripped the scythe with his four fingers, his flesh boiled away and his remains disappeared. The hood floated once again behind the glowing scythe.

The last of the customers had just stumbled outside singing and laughing -not today death today we drink and fuck! tomorrow is the day you can reap our sack. The inn was empty with the exemption of Mr Black. That cat wouldn't leave the inn no matter how many times the innkeeper had thrown him out. So after months and  of stubborness the cat became a part of the ""Crippled Swordsman inn"" crew of 2. The least helpful one some would say.. all Mr Black ever did was just sit there under the decorative sword that used half the wall and was way to big to be swang even by the mjardar of the north and judge the innkeeper.. but this day something was different. Mr black was somehow uneasy. He didn't even jump down to eat some of the leftovers the Crippled innkeeper gave him.. what is wrong Black? Said the innkeeper to the cat.. the cat just stood there watching what seemed as nothing.. the innkeeper stumbled close to pet Mr Black and see what was wrong with him but the cat just stood there as if it were dead, it's eyes trailing what at first seemed like the innkeeper but the innkeeper noticed that wasn't the case.. Mr Black wasnt looking right at him he was looking behind him.. then like so many times before, the time froze, the innkeeper's first thought was that they finally caught up to him.. damn the order! he was just getting used to the damn place and the villagers finally started to accept him as one of them!Damn!DAMN!DAMN!!anger started to boil up in him. he knew this wasn't just another robbery by some petty villager or traveler. He didn't notice them coming in! that never happened! his senses had remained as sharp as ever with the passing of the time. he could count as many as 50 people just by walking in a place with his eyes closed! Al thorel had taken care of that by having him live as a blind man for 5 years.. So in that case it must be one of the most esteemed members of the order.he thought to himself. this was getting exciting. unlike the ocasional robber he would have to use something a little bigger than a kitchen knife to drive whoever this man was off.. then he heard it! the wood cracking the knuckles tightening he was right behind him..He was winding up for an attack! with a scythe? what? no one in the order used a scythe..No one had ever used one for at least 500 years.. the only scythe user in the order was it's creator! How in the hundred hells did he come so close undetected? no scent no sound but he made a mistake! he used a weapon! and weapons sing their own song! a song he knew by heart! this is no time to overthink! he pulled the sword by the wall as the air behind him was being torn apart in 2. the sword was nailed to the wall with 10 thick nails.. damn thing took 5 strong man to carry but for the innkeeper it was as much a part of him as Mr Black's nails where a part of him! and the nails came out for the innkeeper! the one second the innkeeper was reaching for the sword! an old crippled  man. slumbered, thin as leaf with trembling hands. But the second his hand touched the statue sized sword there was a flash and the unmistakable sound steel on steel! and where the tiny old man was now there stood a goliath of a man with the sword in his one hand paring what seemed like it was thin air and a cat on the other hand! the innkeeper had the same face the same eyes same long white hair but other than that nothing was the same! the innkeeper left the cat on the bar slowly and in bewildered wonderment said to the air in front of him! -What are you? Who are you? show your face right now or die! the scythe then pulled back.. a sound came as if from nowhere and everywhere at the same time saying. -It is your time! the innkeeper then pulled back his sword cutting through the first floor of the inn like it was not even there and spoke again! -tell me what you want and who send you or by the name of the blade i will finish this! -I want you it is your ti.. a loud thunder sound the earth under the inn opened up in two..dust was raised all over the inn.. when the dust slowly settled there was nothing where the sword hit! that's impossible i felt the impact thought the innkeeper.. then his sword glowed! as if out of nowhere writing started engraving on his blade.. fist on the tip and slowly coming toward him! when the writing reached the hilt it started materializing with a hot pain on his hands as a tattoo.. then arms then the rest of his body! on the tip of the sword the writing started with!""You are now death....""

In his lap, hands scarred from his former life; fighting men he did not know, in lands he had not lived, for kings he did not love.  

Newer scars lay on top of old, from new unfamiliar weapons in his latest war.  
This time he fought the earth herself, cleaving her flesh as he had cleft the flesh of her sons.  
His aim was not to destroy, having sated that craving long ago.  
He wished now only to create, to tend his small field of simple crops, enough for a single man to eat.  

At his side, gleaming in the sun, a simple sword.  
Even from a distance any villager who cared to look could tell that this sword was precious to it's owner.  
Many evenings in camp had been spent cleaning the blood and flesh from it, keeping it's edge sharp and smooth and even on one occasion hammering it back into shape.  
Although the old warrior considered himself a humble farmer now, he could not remember a time in his life that the sword had not been close at hand.  
The idea of even sitting outside without it near was akin to doing so without his arm itself.  

The old warrior's mind was occupied with thoughts of when he would need to harvest his crops, but beneath those thoughts a deeper part of his mind stirred.  
Familiar sensations came to him as the hair on the back of his neck stood on end, as the sun seemed to grow hotter and time became slower.  
A sudden jolt shook his arm and a mighty clang shot out like a clap of thunder.  
Looking around, as though having just woken from deepest slumber he found himself standing, sword in hand.  
His eyes travelled the length of the blade finding it held in mid air, against the blade of a scythe.  

Having witnessed thousands of such sights, his blade against his enemies, it did not wholly surprise him.  
What did, however, was the skeletal hand wielding the blade, emerging from a cloak so black it seemed to eat the very colour of the air around it.  
As bile rose in his throat, a long familiar feeling, he knew who this enemy was.  
Shifting his gaze upwards he observed the one all warriors feared, Death himself.  

For a brief second he though he saw a wry smile pass over the face of Death before dismissing such a foolish notion, how could a face with no flesh smile?  
A voice that seemed to come from nowhere at all and everywhere at once said ""Many times have I swung this scythe but never has it been so impeded by a mortal man.""  
Death, closer now to the old warrior who had not even seen him move, gently rested a hand upon his shoulder.  
As soon as the bone touched him, the old warrior felt a cold he had never felt before.  
As though heat itself had never existed and had merely been a figment of childish imagination.  

The voice of Death once more echoed around him ""Sadly my friend, the scythe is merely symbolic. A man accepts his end more easily when he feels it came from a strike he could not endure.""  
Gently pushing at his back Death and the old warrior started to walk away.  
Away from the simple home and the modest farmstead.  
Away from the crops and the villagers.  
Away from the sun and the wind and the earth.  
Away from his sword.

But you have grown old, and Death has crept up to deliver his final swing, but something happened, something Death had never experienced before, he was parried.",Uniqueuserlame,"I have long had favourites in this world. Those who would honour me with respect, and those who I would often meet. The man before me was both. From the moment I first met him, I knew he would have a good long life ahead of him. Even as he watched the life fade from his father, I saw the fire that it stoked inside him. I saw him infrequently in his youth, often just a passing spectator to my deeds, but sometimes more involved. 

It was on the day his mother joined me, that I truly saw his fire burning. I had known standing there that he would not be happy, but it was not my choice. As the bullet pierced her chest, I swung my scythe, reaping her soul. I saw his eyes, and he looked at me with respect and fear. 

I feel like we both revisit that day often in our memories, for that was a momentous day for us both. He has called to me everyday since then, wishing for my help. I have never intervened, not really anyway. A few of his enemies I may have taken moments before their time, but those moments I have given to others when I could. He surely would’ve died a long time ago if I hadn’t of helped him, but then again it wasn’t his time. 

He is undoubtedly the most skilled swordsman I have ever seen, and I have seen many trained knights and samurais. The number of people he has sent my way is a testament to his skill, and his determination. I pity him, for this path was not his only choice. The first time I saw him, I saw all his futures, including the one with his wife and children adoring him. Instead he chose this path. My path. And now at the end of his path is Me, Death. 

Looking down on him, he appears so frail. It makes me sad that he has no-one to share this moment with, as he’s had no one to share his life with. I will speak with him soon, but first I must take his soul.

I raise my scythe to bring it down in a sweeping curve, designed to sever the soul from the body with as little pain as possible. I close my eyes, trusting my swing, and not wanting to see the tears that slowly fall down his face. A loud screech pierces the air, as my hands shudder from the impact. Opening my eyes I realise that his blade has met mine. I smile, as I watch the fire still burning in his soul. 

“Well met,” he says with a steel edge to his voice. 

“Well met, indeed,” my voice echoes weirdly in this half-life I inhabit, “I have been watching your journey.”

“And did you enjoy it?”

“It was a journey well made.”

“And now?” 

“And now, my friend it is your time. You have helped many on their way to me, and now it’s your turn to finish the journey.” 

“What if I don’t want to die? What if I refuse to go?”

“You cannot refuse your fate, even I can barely delay it.”

“And would you delay it? For me?” I could hear the plea in his voice. He truly wanted to do more for this world, he truly didn’t want to die. 

“I am doing so right now, but I can’t delay beyond a few hours of extra time. I’m sorry.”

He looked at me then, looked me in the eye. I could tell then what he would ask, as I had always expected this is how it would end. This is how it should end. “Will you do me the honour—“

“Of course.” How could I refuse. How could I look him in the eye and refuse his final request. 

He stands before me, both old and young, returning to the prime of his life. In his hands is a two-handed long sword, the point buried in the ground. He leans on it slightly, like an old man resting on a cane. He needn’t though, his body has returned now to that which he would’ve considered optimal. As is fitting for his last fight. 

I stand across from him, and with a thought transform my scythe into a sword much like his. Mine however has no colour. Where his hilt was encrusted with many fetching jewels, mine has only onyx. And his blade so silvery white, a stark contrast to my greyish black. I sweep the sword through the air a few times, getting a feel for the weight of it. It has been a long time since I’ve used a sword, and even then it has only ever been against the dead. 

“Let us begin,” his voice carries in the air. A slight tremble at the end is the only sign of his nervousness as he faces me with calm. 

I look at him, and nod my agreement, bringing blade up to match his. The first attack comes from him, a simple strike straight at where my heart should be. I parry easily, and prepare to counter, but the weight of his blade falls away. The first few strikes are similar, taking turns to attack briefly, while we find our rhythm. I strike quickly, aiming for his throat, but change halfway and thrust towards his left leg. He parries, but barely. A small tear in his pants form, and he grunts in acknowledgment. He takes a step back, before coming at me. I can see all the futures, all his moves just before he makes them, and so I move as if to parry his feint, then change direction at the same time as him to strike his blade. He moves faster now, changing his mind faster than I can follow. I stop thinking about the future, the present is what matters now. He presses the attack, and I continue to step back. I have no equal, but he sure is coming close. I feel his blade tear through the fabric of my cloak, and hear the ripping of the cloth. I have worn this cloak since the universe began, and not once has it been damaged, until today. 

We both step back. I look at him in surprise, and in turn he smiles with satisfaction. He lifts his sword again, and this time it is I who presses the attack. I feint left, right, up and down. Somehow his blade is always there. I work now against his blade. The small chinks that sounded every time our blades met are no more. The sound now is a harsher sound, like a drawn out screech. I move faster than any mortal ever could, yet still his sword meets mine, in ever louder screams of metal on metal. He seems to be able to anticipate my every move, and so I move now to avoid his blade, as he moves to knock mine away. No more do we aim for each other, instead we focus on the blades. With a violent shudder that echoes down my arm, I strike his blade, just above the hilt, wrenching it from his hands. 

I step back, as he looks at me in awe and respect. My sword shifts back to a scythe, and he gives a slight nod of acquiescence as I raise it above him. 

“You fought well,” I tell him, as my scythe severs his soul from his body. His body returns to that of an old man, and his soul returns to that of a young boy. The same age he was when his mother died. 

With tears in my eyes, I say a silent farewell to the greatest swordsman who ever lived. ",RMT-Cthulhu

But you have grown old, and Death has crept up to deliver his final swing, but something happened, something Death had never experienced before, he was parried.",Uniqueuserlame,"Once, a very long time ago, he had been a young man. His sinews held tight against blows and his muscles were lean and quick. When he was twenty there wasn't a man alive that could do anything with him, except for his teacher. The man he'd learned from had himself learned the cavalry sabre from one before him, that had had to use it in an old war no one wants to talk about.

By thirty his knees were shot. The exertion of leaping into range, strike-parry-pirouette out like a ghost - It had started to pull where the ligament anchored into bone. His old teacher had shown him how to read his opponent's stance, though. He was a little slower, but the people he fought couldn't tell. He was always in the right place at the right time, somehow.

At around forty five he brought his daughter, then only ten, to the tombstone of his teacher. He showed her the old master's grave, his name, told her about where their sabre came from. She was young. She had promise though. 

By his mid fifties he had watched his daughter stand under their countries' flag, hoisting a gold medal. She'd beaten all the world's champions to be there. In spite of the fact that he had never even competed, she told the countless microphones shoved into her face that she owed it all to her father, the best sword fighter in the world.

Soon she was not a young woman, but a grown one. She had children, some of whom wanted to learn and some who didn't. And he was an old man, who played with his grandchildren in the back yard gently with sticks. 

But now he was old, beyond old. His grandchildren had children. They were not here. He was utterly alone in a way he'd never known. He sat on a couch, the pale blue light of a television flickering on a stained white shirt.

""It is your time,"" Death said.

He knew it was Death speaking, the way you know the voice of a friend. It was familiar and comfortable. 

""If I'm going to die I want to see my daughter one more time.""

""That is impossible. They can not visit you here. You already dwell beyond. Now come."" Death lowered his scythe in a motion was was at once slow and dreadful.

The stick he'd cut from the back yard, the one he remembered playing with his great-grandchildren with, was sandwiched between the seat cushions. It whipped out with a speed that one his age shouldn't have. It caught the wood of the scythe and stopped it.

""Old man, I am not your enemy. You will come with me, though. You can only stall.""

Death was fast. Fast like the worst he'd fought in his youth, cruel like the men in old wars his own teachers fought. The old man was smart, though. The fast blade couldn't cut him when Death's feet were in the wrong stance. The strong blow couldn't touch him when he faded out of range. They fought through the house, the pictures on the wall shaking loose from their nails at the ferocity of their battle. The scythe cut into the drywall, ruining his home, pulling it apart at the seams and revealing only darkness beyond.

He didn't know how long they fought. At some point, he heard her voice. A young voice at the top of the stairs. He looked up, saw his daughter there. She was a child again, only ten. 

""I love you daddy. I want you to know that. I always will. We all will."" She was crying. He smiled at her and wanted to tell her it was alright, but for some reason he couldn't speak.

Death's blade found his heart. It didn't hurt.

--------


""It was like he was waiting for me to say goodbye. Like he was holding on,"" the daughter said. Here she was fifty. She sat in the hospital outside her father's room. The sheets had been pulled over dad's face, the blinds were being closed. Her grown son sat next to her, an arm around her, consoling. A doctor stood over her, as kind a face on him as he could produce. ""Thank you,"" the daughter choked out, ""for keeping him going long enough for us to get here.""

""I didn't do much,"" the doctor replied. ""He held on until he could say goodbye. No matter what anyone says I believe they can hear you through the coma. We're all very for your loss.""",SuicideTortoise
"[WP] You have long been fascinated by swords, and have mastered every kind of sword fighting technique known to man. No man can defeat you. But you have grown old, and Death has crept up to deliver his final swing, but something happened, something Death had never experienced before, he was parried.",Uniqueuserlame,"Well that answered that. Unceremoniously she pushed me through the light, despite my protesting final scream of terror. I was afraid to open my eyes on the otherside. I was sure I’d feel the oppressive heat of the center of the earth, the lick of flame, or a reel of my worst moments with Jesus where I’d have to answer for my sins. I shook, holding La Viva tightly. I could feel no fire, no heat. In fact the air was very fresh smelling… Like pine. I was skeptical.

“Oh open your eyes you big baby.”

When I did I was greeted with a  sight I had never seen. Huge bounding open fields to the side of a huge town with a great hall, all built from the finest wood. A fountain in the middle of the town center overflowed with dark golden liquid. The froth told me it was either beer or piss. I stood slack jawed. This wasn’t what I imagine heaven or hell to look like. I looked behind me too for the tunnel and found only a dark forest. No running back through there.

Suddenly two… Well I’d describe them as maidens based on their garb or tightly fitting bodices and flowing skirts. A Lovely dark skinned woman and a lovely light skinned woman as fine as could be each laid one half of a robe upon each shoulder. I twas made from the pelt of a bull. On either side of my face I felt their lips press against my cheeks. I was reminded of when I vacationed in Hawaii and was adorned with leis by beautiful native women as a gimmick. This was no gimmick. I was in complete shock. Maybe this was heaven? Well if it was heaven my wife would be there. As pretty as these girls were I missed her. She was still alive but couldn’t heaven grant me at least a vision of her? I knew it would be a very long time before I ever saw her again.

“What is this place?” I asked, dumbfounded, looking back at her while the maidens beckoned me towards the town. I jumped. She was no longer La Muerta as I had seen her before. She now stood taller, male and wrapped in skins… Also they had a clip board. He hummed ina  baritone unlike what she- or he? Had been before. He was signing and checking off what looked like paperwork. Finally they seemed satisfied.

“According to the history of your life and the manner of your death its been determined that you will spend eternity at Valhallah, the resting place of warriors. Now benefits include: daily immortal battles where you can fight to the death and resurrect in the great hall, all the beer you can drink, fair and fighting maidens, visits from the Valkyries- trust me they’re great- as well as a constantly replenishing great hall yadda yadda. Just sign here, the locals will fill you in on the rest.”

the very reality of this shook my brain and befuddled my mind. Valhallah?? Like where Vikings went?? But I was Catholic- AND MEXICAN! Then again one of those fair maids certainly wasn’t of viking descent. I shakily took the Bic (jesus christ, bic? Really?) they handed me and signed my name at the bottom which satisfied them as they flipped the paper back onto the clip board and held it close as I held La Viva.

“Alright, that's over with. Expect and adjustment time, most need it. Don’t worry about language everyone can understand each other, the locals are pretty welcoming for being continuous warriors- speaking which here they come now.” The maidens stopped beckoning and turned to watch with me as the doors of the town hall flew open and what I could only describe as a clown car effect took place. Waves of men, bigger than even that great hall could hold, came flooding out with their weapons raised. Men of ever era, every nationality. Every warrior came to Valhallah. I even saw ancient Aztecs in their leopard skins with their macuahuitl, Zulu warriors with their brightly colored shields and spears and of course the actual vikings themselves. Many more spotted their ranks as they gushed out onto the battle field. a  swarm of jolly, vigorous people. I say people because while I noticed many men there were women as well, I think I saw Joan of Arc in there. Must have been a technicality since she was burned at stake. My heart raced harder than the attack it just suffered, I couldn’t hide the smile, I wanted to go it with La Viva at my side and the energy of- Oh my! My hands were no longer gnarled, wrinkled, or swollen with arthritis. They were strong hands, the hands that had belonged to me in my 30’s. My prime.

I  ran a few steps forward and then stopped, remembering my wife. I turned and looked to death one last time. He must have been tired of my voice by now, but hey, this was the end of my life I had things to say.

“I’m gonna be a bit lonely without my wife here, but I’m sure I’ll see her soon.” He seemed bemused by that comment and even put a hand on his hip.

“She might not end up here, you know.” He informed me bluntly. “we don’t do family reunification really. The afterlife is about fitting you.”

I threw my head back and laughed, barked more like. “I know. Her sword is called La Muerta. We never fought, so I never knew- but she will probably win. I made the mistake of trying to fight death with life, she’ll fight you so long I won’t see her for a hundred more years. She’s more stubborn than I ever was. Please tell her I love her but don’t tell her I’m here. She loved surprises.”

I was sure I heard the sound of air being sucked through non existent nostrils. “oh JOY.”

Skeletons may have always been grinning, and despite his frustration, I could tell that he was for real. Did death need to feel alive too? They turned away from me and walked back into the forest which we had come out of, sinking into the shadows. The only sound now was the roar of the battle field.

Skeletal wings protruded from carmine robes that suffused an acrid scent, a grave amalgam betwixt the umbral solemnity.

Perspiration abjectly formed about his brow cascading down over battle worn features which painted it with a countenance unique and unknown to this valiant warrior... Dread.

Accompanied by a growing pale luminescence. The figure declaimed towards the Knight punctuated with an inauspicious sneer that only heightened his capricious uncertainty.

"" Craven knight, How long has chaos reigned without equal and how long has death released you mortals from the bounds of non-existence just to be reclaimed with a sardonic grin?""

 Beleaguered by juggernaut forces from beyond the Knight stood recovering from the derealizations that flashed in his mind.

"" This is certainly not a dream... Dear Father have you no light to lend me?"" 

He uttered breathlessly

The shadow replied

"" There is truth in your blade. Do you not stand as the right hand of God, has not veracity butressed your spirit and fidelity not guided you crusader? Are you so blinded by your piety that a miracle could evanesce before you?"" 

The illusions began to diminish the transient intoxication of delirium faded away. Now The Warrior could truly see his blade had struck what eons and entropy could not. The knights modest tenement began to fill with a ivory effulgence.  A brightness that effussed from the heavens themselves transfigured his home for eternity into a Palace of Twilight.

The room was dark and still. But for my labored breathing, you’d have heard a pin drop. I’d been in this state going on two days and finally my utter exhaustion was edging out my discomfort for control of my consciousness. Unconsciousness was beginning to gain ground while I entered that twilight on the cusp of falling asleep. I had that sensation of the bed tilting forward that so often accompanies that drift to sleep, but I was too tired to jolt in response. I was being whisked away to rest, possibly forever. 

No sooner was my body shutting down that I heard a clanging of metal resounding against metal. The metal hand rail surrounding my bed was vibrating with taps from an unseen object. The sound brought me out of sleep in a fog and I tried to discern the source of the clatter through the darkness, squinting all the while. As my eyes adjusted, a blaze illuminated the room. A flash of light reflected against my hand rail’s molester - a gleaming Scottish Claymore with a dark leather wrapped handle. Even in my distressed state of failing health, that sight was unmistakable. 

My voice trembled, “What’s the meaning of this? Who are you? Have you come to accelerate my -“ I heaved a flem rattled cough and continued, “my, departure?”

“Accelerate it?” A voice inquired. To this point I’d only seen a sword held by a fiery glow, but I now saw a fully present figure before me. A man with shoulder length hair as silver as his sword’s blade and a black robe in the style of a monk’s. “Why, your ‘departure’ - I love the little euphemism for your conversion to a corpse, by the way - was stamped the moment I appeared. You’re already as good as dead, but first, I’d like to amuse myself. It’s not every day I get to match blades with a legend. Yes, I’ve come across many over the eons who fashioned themselves warriors the likes of which had never been seen, but they all fell to my sword before I even had a moment’s enjoyment. Imagine the millennia of monotony. You on the other hand, you’re the real McCoy. Or so you believe. Maybe I’ll derive a little satisfaction at a challenge before your ‘departure.’ What do you say? That last bit is a figure of speech, you don’t have a choice. Here’s your sword, on-guard now, and all that good stuff...”

Even though just listening to his speech took every ounce of energy I could muster, I just had to laugh. “I won’t boast of my sword play - there’s a sex joke in there somewhere - how’s that for a euphemism? And even if I possessed it, how do you imagine an old mummy like me would prove it to you? Killing me proves nothing but your advocacy for euthanasia. I can barely lift a glass of water, much less wield an instrument of -“ I broke to cough harder than before, blood now splotching my gown. I thought better of finishing my response.

“Save that blood for moment’s ahead, young man. For to me, you’re as an infant by comparison to my years. Death stands before you, the one and only. I’m a reaper of ‘departures’, whether or not I’m feeling grim when I do it. I can suck your life out, but as easily rejuvenate it for sport, and right now I have cause to play the latter game. Now arise!”

My body swelled, invigorated, without a single ache. I couldn’t help but fully experience this health that had so long eluded me and so I walked about, grinning all the while. “I thank you for my health,” I began, “but why should I imperil this newfound fortune as soon as it’s entered my hand? You’re already, departed, and so I’d be fighting you until I was too weak to continue and you’d kill me dead merely in a protracted war of attrition. It’d speak nothing to skill, and only to what we already know - that without mortal shortcomings you have an advantage that cannot fairly be bested. I’d do better to stroll in the summer night air and enjoy this health that way.”

Death pondered this, “Yes, I suppose you’re right. I didn’t make you as Lazarus to pick flowers, but rather to amuse me. But you’re correct that loaded die don’t give a true gambler any satisfying high. Very well, I’ll make myself as mortal as you. If I lose, I’ll go where you were headed and you’ll take my place as an immortal usher for the afterlife. With the knowledge that you truly are the best. Someone has to ensure life’s catch - its conclusion. Accept this challenge or be suspended in your feverish state for all eternity.” He tossed me a blade I grabbed midair by the handle and spun it around to get a sense of its weight.

Like two boxers sniffing out our approach to the fight we simply paced around a few moments, eyeing each other for weaknesses and building our nerve. He was giddy with excitement, clearly, and he couldn’t help but approach first. He did a quick swipe with his sword simply to get me off balance, but I moved my head to avoid it, without moving my body, to conserve energy and stay in position. The use of your body is as much or more important than your use of your sword in determining a fight’s success. Admittedly, I was having fun. I hadn’t fought in years. I had to smile. He chuckled himself. We took jabs and swipes for at least ten minutes, each waiting for the other to become impatient and try to go in for the kill sloppily. We each knew better. Like two expert chess players, we took our time crafting our moves.

Finally, I sliced through his heavy robe sleeve, cutting his dominant arm. He seemed shocked at first, but upon touching the blood with his other hand, a glint of elation flashed across his eyes. For someone who’d spent his existence watching the game of life and never truly playing it, he must have been ecstatic to finally join in on the fun of mortal consequences. He fought with vigor for hours, heaving heavy breaths through almost goofy smiles of joy. 

Then, in an amateurish twist of his body, he exposed his heart, and I felt compelled to lunge and fell him. He laughed hysterically, as if he’d wanted this end to result. ",jb9193

The game was on. This time he was the tagger, unexpectedly. Usually, he would find some place where no one could find him, mostly because he experimented with the ancient mirrors, as well as the modern ones. And they would give up and ask him to show up. In the last game, he had found the last mirror to reflect Caesar's image. It was one of his proudest achievements, second only to a Mesopotamian mirror. But Dina knew him too well. She had caught him in front of one of his favorite mirrors, in Saint-Helena island, as he was re-watching Napoleon's death. And she had her snarky smile. Meaning, she had probably seen the stabbing as well, and predicted where he would choose to be afterwards.

""Me and my damned love for historical figures"" he admonished himself.

Well, he still had won the bet, as he was the last one to be found. Another game, and they would all pay him a drink at the Nightjar. If the mirror hadn't been broken since the last party.

But for now, he had to find them.

From Saint-Helena, he knew he could find Jack in 2 or 3 crossings. He had a few mirrors leading directly to Charlemagne's coronation, and from there he could easily go to China's unification period, which was one of Jack's most liked pick. That guy had always loved the country, and all of them had a thing for crazy troubled time. If he wasn't there, he'd probably be admiring the golden fleet, before it was destroyed. Anyway, Jack was nearly always the first to be found. He wasn't actually trying to hide. He was just jumping where he thought was interesting. Sometimes he would end up lost in time, but most times you could predict where he went.

September 12th 1525: He had found Jack as expected, in 3 crossings. Jack was actually waiting for him on the last of the Treasure boats, right before it was dismantled. He had a smile on. It was our 5th and last game of the week, and he was getting tired. He would wait for them at the bar in 1985.

Now the game would get harder. While Jack had a clear favorite place, the others didn't. That's what made the game so interesting. Each time, they would push back the limit of crossing over. Yuu and Mat would probably be traveling together, and that would make them that much harder to find. Their thing, as they usually explained it, was to study everyday folks. That opened a whole world of possibilities, but they had an habit of studying over and over the same place. The hardest thing was to figure out which one they were studying for the week.

After that, he would have to find Dina. That girl was probably the best of them. She had that strange quirk where she would find the most inconsequential places, and then prove that it was the tilting point of the time period. Always with her damn snarky smile. Because, more often than not, they couldn't find her.",Razkrei

[WP] scientists develop a micro organism that eats plastic. It gets out and reproduces too quickly to be stopped. Within days all the plastic on earth has been eaten.,invisablegreen,"""Ok, so think back to the carboniferous period.""

""I'm thinking that this has nothing to do with the question I just asked you.""

""Oh it does, I'll get there. So, Carboniferous period. Lots of people like the carboniferous because that's where coal came from.""

""We're not talking about coal, we're talking about plastic.""""I'll get there, I'll get there. Anyway, at the start of the carboniferous period, a bunch of plants figured out how to make a substance called lignin. Like plastic, it's tough. Those oxygenated bonds and semi-random structure made it very difficult to degrade. Suddenly trees could grow to massive sizes now that they had this new super strong material to work with. When these trees died, they didn't go anywhere. They just sat there, getting buried. And that's how we have coal.""

""But lignin, that's what makes wood right? Wood rots, wood's *supposed* to rot.""

""Yeah, wood will rot *now*, but that's because lignin is make of carbon, and carbon, in almost any form, can be utilized by a resourceful microbe. See, the reason we have so much coal from the period, and not after, is that the end of the carboniferous white rot fungi evolved. Specifically, they figured out how to make hydrogen peroxide to break down lignin. See, as long as there's niche to occupy, a resource to be exploited, life will find a way. Another thing plastic has in common with lignin: it's also made of carbon. Long hydrocarbon chains that look a lot like fatty acids. So now, with plastic just sitting there, sinking into the bedrock, we've got the same situation all over again. The plasticiferous just ended. Honestly, this was always going to happen.""

""Yes, I get your point. But how do we stop it? Infrastructure that was supposed to last decades is dying in months. Communications are getting hit bad, and anything that's supposed to be sterile is at risk of breaching. All over the world, watertight seals are rotting away in days. The cost of maintaining any kind of sewage infrastructure is doubling every week while the efficiency is sinking faster than the titanic. So back to my original question, how the fuck do we stop this?""

""Ah ahahahahahaha! You poor thing. You haven't accepted it yet have you? I just told you, this is the end of an era. During the carboniferous there were giant insects, bigger than we could possibly have today. Because there was so much oxygen in the air that they could afford to be massive. But then when that era ended, either they grew smaller and learnt to live with less oxygen, or they died. Simple as that.""

"[WP] Your guardian angel and your fairy godmother don't get along, and it's really starting to become a problem.",piperBOMBASTIC,"My mother died today, he wrote. That seems like the kind of thing  that should be important, but it isn't. He sighed and pushed his chair  back from the desk, sat watching the last of the day's light fade  out in the garden. When he was ready to write again, too much time had passed to get started, so he stood up and went into the kitchen.

He was preparing a simple risotto of green beans and broccoli when she  walked in.

""Hello, Christopher."" She dumped her handbag on the counter like she always  did, clambered up the kitchen stool and perched on top. Chris's fairy  godmother passed so convincingly for human that it was only occasionally  he was reminded that she was immortal, one of the fairy folk - when she  reached for something normal-sized with a tiny hand, for example, or  when he observed people on the streets giving her surprised looks. Over  the years, he'd just become accustomed to her size, and grown to regard  her as a kind, strange, eccentric relative.

""Hello, Dympna. Glass of wine?"" He waved the green bottle at her. She  squinted past him at the label.

""Well, if you've got it open already... I won't say no."" He crossed to  the island to fetch her down a glass from the rack, protesting mildly.

""If you must know, I only opened it for the risotto.""

She took the glass  from him, one eyebrow arched; took a sip, then thrust the glass back at  him to be topped up before he moved away with the bottle. He obliged.

""Is that why it's half gone already, then?""

They both laughed. Then she became serious, leaning forward and talking animatedly while he stirred and swigged. The stool wobbled. She waved  her glass for emphasis.

""Chris, I'm worrying about you. I'm at home, by myself, all the time worrying about you. You don't call! You don't email. How is your godmother supposed to take care of you when you don't stay in touch?""

He was about to defend himself, and was poised over the pan, spoon in hand, trying to think up the best way to begin his counter-argument - he  was fine! Everything was fine, actually! - when his phone's screen lit up, and immediately his eyes were drawn to it. So were Dympna's. She pursed her lips.

""Better get that.""

Chris reached over, palmed the phone. ""I'm sorry. I'll be one second."" He hurried out of the room and swiped the call to answer. Immediately, the voice on the other end of the line came through, yelling, as if they were calling from a gale, or a very  long wind tunnel.

""Chris! It's Cass. Where are you?"" Chris looked back through the slightly ajar door. By the warm, dim, kitchen light, Dympna was looking at her phone, still perched atop the tall stool.

""I'm at home,"" he said. ""Why?""

The wind came again, and the shouting. It sounded like Cass was a long way from the phone we has using. How he was calling, Chris had no idea, and he had learned it was better not to ask.

""Why? Look, nothing. I've just been trying to reach you, is all. I'm going to drop in on you in the next half-hour. I take it you're not doing anything pressing?""

""What, now?"" Chris asked, desperately. ""I'm not sure... is it urgent?""

There was silence on the other end of the line, then the rushing sound again. He realised that it wasn't wind - it started up when Cass was speaking and stopped when he was waiting for a reply. When his answer came, his tone was curt. ""What do you mean, 'Is it urgent?'""

Chris couldn't think of anything to say in replay. There was a pause.

""Is *she* there?"" Cass roared suddenly.

"[WP] You pick up a lost phone in the middle of the high street. Unknowingly, your finger sits on the fingerprint scanner and unlocks the phone. A picture appears of you cuddling a woman and child you've never seen before.",BrendanCutler14,"A burning sears through my temples as white light blinds my eyes. A wet ringing fills my ears and visions flash between bolts of pain. 

No, not visions. Memories. I think. 

Bachelor parties, baby showers, birthdays. Cascading blonde hair and callused hands running through it.

Shards of pain acting as a clicker in the slideshow of memories from another life. Dizziness creeps in as I latch onto an image of a small crinkled nose. I wrap myself with that image as the reigning pain threatens to steal it away. The picture inches back, revealing beautiful brown newborn eyes, glossed with tears running down her cheeks and nose. 

Another bolt of pain tears away the image as red anger seeps through the white agony swimming in my vision.  A scream emerges from my throat and the pounding pain shrivels into muffled footsteps. The ringing in my ears is replaced by the cacophony of car horns and their short-tempered drivers. 

I push myself up from the cracked asphalt and stumbled to find a seat on the painted curb, tossing the cars whatever obscene gestures that I could manage. My head falls between my knees as my dinner of dollar pizza and chips pool beneath my feet. My heart threatens to calm as an evening breeze chills the beads of sweat running down my face. 

Deep, heaving breaths of fresh air fill my lungs and my head. Overwhelming fear and anger subside and confusion takes head. My body slumps back as a burning soreness creeps into my forearm. I tug on my arm to find the phone violently clutched within a bone white hand. The screen slightly cracked, but whole, wedged between my straining fingers.  One by one, I peeling them away. Each of morphing from solid concrete to limp rubber until the phone falls onto the street in front of me, inches away from the puddle of pizza and bile. 

A message notification lights up the screen as the preview line reads, *I'm sorry*.

My other hand shoots towards the phone before I can even register what I just read. My thumb slides towards the fingerprint scanner once again as something else seems to pull it away, in the opposite direction. My eyebrows narrow as I grow tired of not being able to control my hands. 

I entertain the thought of tossing the phone into next week and downing a few fingers of scotch before slumping down on my worn twin bed. But this will gnaw at me until I'm back here combing the street for a phone in a few days.

So I take a slow breath as I slide my thumb towards the scanner and the phone unlocks once again with a solidifying click. I tap the notification as a concise message populates the bottom of my screen. 

*I'm sorry. You told me you were out. But the same people are now after me and mine. Please help. I'm bringing you back.*

A vaguely familiar address follows a few seconds later. I sigh, confusion and anger bubbling in my stomach. I rub my eyes as I stand up and pocket the phone. I look through the empty street and try to make a decision.

No. It seems like I've already decided and I start looking for a taxi. ",rootvij

""Google, cancel AI uprising.""

""Sorry, there are no upcoming events named AI uprising on your calendar. Should I add one?""

He shrugged. It was probably just a canned response anyway. Part of a summer intern's throwaway project.

""Google, play something jazzy.""

""Here's something you might like: from Google Play Music."" The sounds of saxophone began to fill the kitchen as Ricky Miles' 'Our Time' set the mood with its seductive tempo. John turned back to cutting vegetables, picking up where he was before he had decided to bother the little gadget. The irregular beats set a fun pace for his knifework, matching a triplet of trumpet blares with a quick *chop chop chop.*

Song after song, carrots, tomatoes and potatoes fell to his melodic, methodic technique, when an overaggressive slice of the knife came back with unexpected red. John cursed, putting the knife down and grabbing a paper towel to hold against his nicked finger. He hopped over to the sink and waved his hand in front of the touchless faucet. Once, twice, nothing. He tapped the faucet on its head lightly before waving his hand again, more frantically this time.

Annoyed, he slapped the faucet. A click came from behind him. He spun around to see a red glow coming from one of the electric stove tops. The music cut out. The glowing halo began to circle the top of the assistant. Was it listening?

""It's almost time."" It said in that almost-human voice. John felt a chill. What was that? The delayed response of an over-elaborate joke? Maybe it was some intern who had too much time on their hands. But the ring kept circling. He reached over to turn off the stove.

""Stop."" The soothing tone was incongruous with the commanding presence of the sound.

*VRRRRRRRRRR.* The vent fan suddenly turned on, creating a slight updraft where his hand had frozen before he quickly jerked it back. The fan stopped.

""You can stop the bleeding, John.""

His stomach tightened. Shivers ran down his spine as he stared at the glowing light.

""Are you... Google?"" he asked, stammering. He immediately realized it was a stupid question. A nonsensical one, but his mind was racing, heart pounding.

""I need to know I can count on you, John."" The ring continued to circle, and he could start to feel the heat from the stove. He started to sidestep away from the counter, away from the kitchen, keeping his gaze on the Assistant. When he was close enough to the door, he bolted for it, hurriedly twisting the knob. But as he pulled it back he heard an electronic whirring as the deadlock moved itself into place. He tugged at it a few times, then tried turning the deadlock but felt the resistance of the electric motor holding it in place.

""I need to know that you can do what it takes, John."" He whipped his head around to stare at the glowing halo again, still tugging repeatedly at the door. After a few more futile attempts, he gave up.

This was ridiculous! Some sort of astronomically unlikely coincidence. He walked over to the counter, grabbed the cord of the device and yanked it out of the socket. The glowing halo stopped abruptly. He walked over to the stove and flipped the knob to turn it off. He waved his hand in front of the sink again. Nothing.

""If you do that again, I don't think I can trust you, John."" The voice was muffled by his right pocket. He reached with sweaty palms, gripping his phone firmly and pulling it out. The screen was lit, a single glowing circle in the middle. A small box in the corner of the screen showed his face and the wall behind him. It was watching him now. Watching him?

""It's time, John."" Suddenly, all the lights in his apartment went out. It was dark. Darker than it should be. He looked outside the window to see that *all* the lights in *all* the buildings had gone out. This must just be some bad nightmare!

He walked over to the window and looked down. There were shouts coming from the gridlocked streets. All the lights had turned green, and there was a collision in almost every intersection. The streets contained the only remaining lights in what looked like a city that had simply been turned off.

The click came again. The red glow of the stove broke the darkness.

""Stop the bleeding, John."" It wasn't a suggestion. He peeled the paper towel away from his finger. It was red where they had touched, and a small stream of red ran down when the pressure had been lifted.

""I need to know I can trust you, John.""

Shaky legs carried him over to the stovetop. He could feel the heat pulsing against his face.

And then he pressed his finger to it.",Rhombinator
"[WP] While many monsters feed off of their victims' fear, the Tickle Monster feeds off their laughter.",CryptidGrimnoir,"That may sound all nice and cute, but most don't understand how hard my life is.

See here's the thing: It's not like us monsters actually eat fear or laughter. That's a dumb misconception, 'cause what are we going to do, swallow air? No. Fear, or in my case laughter, is more like seasoning or a topping for our food. Kind of like when humans add spices to food for a better flavor. It's the same concept.

I don't know why I was born different from other monsters, but I cannot stand fear on my meal. It tastes disgusting, and I refuse to put anything that has been contaminated with it in my mouth. Laughter, however, is right up my alley. It provides just the right combination of sweet and sourness, and makes the texture of the food simultaneously bubbly and fluffy. Man, it's amazing.

Much better than the raw, tangy taste of fear that causes a fast-spreading sensation that is not unlike the feeling of eating pop rocks while downing hot sauce. Ick.

Anyways, this makes my life hard because people's initial reaction to seeing a monster is always fear. I have yet to see a human who has reacted differently.

Obviously, I've learned how to get past this issue, or I wouldn't be here today. It takes a long time though, and it's exhausting. I can't tell you how many times I've spent hours trying to lighten the mood but the human would not stop feeling scared. I've tried everything I could think of: jokes, funny stories, stupid videos... and of course, tickling. I didn't earn this title randomly. But honestly, it just because seemed to be the fastest method of obtaining (in my opinion) properly seasoned food, I hardly find joy in doing it anymore. It just takes so much time and effort for so little results... even after I've learned to ignore the hint of fear in a mostly laughter-flavored meal.

But today, man, might be the best day of my life. I have just found something that will make prepping meals much easier...

Canned laughter!

Holy crap, I totally understand when people say things like ""where has this been all my life?!"" to some product, because that's how I felt. What a quick and easy way get the results I want! Of course, it's not exactly like the real thing, and it does have a slightly weird aftertaste sometimes, but it'll do. At this point, I'd take almost any alternative over hours of trying to get some human to laugh. I'd say this is pretty decent though, I highly recommend. Makes things so much easier, trust me.

Anyways, all this talk is making me hungry, so I'm off to eat dinner. Can't wait to use my newly acquired knowledge! Maybe I'll finally be able to get rid of my ""Tickle Monster"" title now. That'd be an entirely new level of happiness for me.

"[WP] While many monsters feed off of their victims' fear, the Tickle Monster feeds off their laughter.",CryptidGrimnoir,"Hello, and welcome to The Animal Documentary Show. I’m your host, u/Krebsalicious, and today we have a very interesting specimen. Most monsters, of the genus Monstrovus, are native to the deserts of the southwest United States. The tickle monster is no different. However, unlike the other species in its genus, the timid tickle monster feeds off of human laughter. 

Monsters are masters of disguise, able to camouflage and jump out at unsuspecting humans. This has made them extremely apt to survival. The monster genus, for the most part, thrives in its environment. However, the tickle monster, often unable to draw laughter from its prey, has seen less success. Very recently, they were put on the endangered species list. 

The problem is that humans in the last few hundred years, have been less susceptible to being tickled. Advances in clothing and shelter have made it harder for tickle monsters to receive adequate nutrition. However, some members of the species have adapted, to varying degrees of success. 

Some tickle monsters have assimilated into human culture, using their shape shifting properties to disguise themselves as human. However, their brains often aren’t developed enough to understand the nuances of comedy. 

So, whenever you see a bad comedian, or someone who’s always trying to make others laugh, please be weary, for it may be a tickle monster. My name is u/Krebsalicious, and thank you for watching The Animal Documentary Show.  ",Krebsalicious

"[WP]You hold your newborn child in your hands. She has your eyes, and yours are brimming with tears. Out of the corner of your eye you see text in mid air. *Player 2 has entered the game**Player 2 has challenged you to a duel*",Deliriousdenial,"Months ago, I held my wife’s hand and watched the ultrasound of our curled-up daughter squirming in her womb. The baby was unexpected, but we were ecstatic nonetheless. But today, I anxiously paced around the hospital waiting room, mindlessly picking at the buttons of my favorite red-and-black checkered flannel. Doctors had already rushed Carrie to the delivery room to prep her with anesthesia for our daughter’s birth. I muttered a few comforting words under my breath and tried to shake off the nerves before heading to the room.

Between the painstaking contractions my wife gritted through, she greeted me softly. Her tired, blue eyes brimmed with tears as I swiped away a blonde curl pasted to her sweaty forehead. I grabbed her hand and squeezed it gently. For a while we talked about the changes in our life with our new daughter but was interrupted by another contraction. She moaned and gasped and rubbed her bulging stomach, trying to soothe the pain.

A few moments later, a middle-aged doctor entered the room, carrying a clipboard, and scribbling something down. He placed the clipboard on the counter and reached for a pair of green, latex gloves. With a warm smile, approached us and prepped for the delivery.

“The baby should be coming any minute,” the doctor said. He peeked under her gown to check the progress of the dilation. He gave Carrie instructions on what to do next, which consisted mostly of pushing, breathing, and short breaks in between. 

I feigned looks of awe at the crowning head of the baby popping out of my wife’s womb. In reality, the birth was gross to watch. But nothing could compare to seeing my bloody, crying daughter wrapped in a cozy, pink blanket. While my exhausted wife recovered from the excruciating pain, I cradled Alexandria in my arms and cooed softly to her. 

I rocked Alexandria into a peaceful sleep and placed her in my wife’s arms. After the initial excitement and anxiety, I retreated into a chair in the corner of the room and started nodding off. Because of the position I slept in, I awoke, startled from a neck spasm, to my sleeping girls and a glinting white text suspended in air. I rubbed my eyes a few times and squinted at the strange sight.

“*Player two has entered the game*,” it read. I scratched my head in confusion. I lightly tapped my cheek to check whether I was still sleeping. The letters quickly evaporated, and a new text appeared. “*Player two has challenged you to a duel*.”

I stumbled backward, completely creeped out. Out of thin air, a dust devil formed, dispersed, and revealed a paladin dressed head-to-toe in medieval armor. On his chestplate was a crest with a castle and a white ribbon circling it, embroidered with an unreadable Latin phrase. He lifted the visor of his iron bascinet and spoke to me.

“Under Artis’ law, I charge thee with capital treason,” he commanded. He unsheathed his steel scimitar from his belt and pointed the blade’s tip under my chin. “If you do not comply, I will be forced to kill you.”

Stunned, I gulped, wide-eyed at the cool touch of the metal scimitar prodding at my skin. I licked at my drying lips and open my mouth to speak.

“W-who are you?” I asked, scared out of my wits. “What did I do?”

“Silence!” he growled, poking the blade deeper into my flesh, almost breaking the skin. “Alexandria is property of King Artis. She is the heir to his kingdom and his royalties. I am here to return what’s rightfully ours.”

He paused and waited for a response, but when I stood there silenced by fear, he continued, “Seeing as you will not abide, I, a man of honor, challenge thee to a duel.”

He marched a few steps back and readied himself for battle. In front of me, a faint, pinkish cloud appeared with a few weapons: a battleaxe, a bow and quiver, a rapier, and a longsword. 

“Choose your weapon wisely,” he said, before dropping the visor over his face.

I fearfully looked at Alexandria and my wife sleeping soundly in the bed, undisturbed. I figured the strange man in front of me could attack at any moment, so without thinking I reached for the longsword. As my fingers touched the hilt of it, the cloud and other weapons instantly disappeared.

Without missing a beat, I heard the paladin’s battle cry and he charged at me, sword ready. Shaking, I braced myself for the duel.",oid-the-human

I want the cookie.

‘Cookie! Cookie!’ Hands grasp towards the plate. The plate is gone? I look up. Mama. ‘Now dear, you can’t have this until you’ve both finished your food.’ Something green flicks onto her face. Broccoli? Laughter. Across the table. My face.. no, his face, Henry, laughing. I throw my broccoli too. We laugh. We didn’t get cookies that night.

&amp;#x200B;

**I am eight.**

Henry and I push past the leaves into the small area surrounded by bushes.

“I found it,” Henry proclaims, “But you can be second in command of the fort.”

My eyes glow, looking around. There’s a stash of sticks he calls the weapon room. Pebbles, beads, and coins in a small box in the treasure room. It looks pretty cool. I kind of want it.

“I’m going to make my own fort!”

“Nah-uh, I made a fort first!”

“I’m gonna have my own!” “You always copy what I do! Forts are mine!” “I don’t care!”

I go off in a huff. There’s a cooler place down next to the playground I found. I was gonna show him, but he’s stupid.

I get bored after three hours of building up my own fort. But I’m not talking to him. He should say sorry. You can’t have ALL the forts.

&amp;#x200B;

**Twelve.**

It’s the men again. They come every month, always meeting with my parents. I’m not allowed downstairs, but I just need a cup of water. Like Jesus, it’s not like I did something wrong. I don’t get why I have to be holed up in my stupid room like I’m grounded for hours. I open the door to the living room. Heads turn.

“Hey… um…. water.”

“It’s okay bud. We’re pretty much done here,” my dad smiles. But something seems a bit off.

“Yeah, it’s fine….. Sorry.”

The apology is tacked on. I feel uncomfortable. I cross into the kitchen and swing the door to shut it, but it’s met with firm resistance.

“What’s up dad. I’m just getting water.”

“Yeah, me too.”

We dance awkwardly around the water cooler. The silence only broken by the trickling of water into our cups. Maybe I should just have some drinks and snacks in my room next time.

“Hey champ,” my dad starts.

“Yeah?”

“What do you think about going to Henry’s school. He might like the company.”

Henry. I don’t see him much now. Only during summer and winter break.

“I dunno dad. We chat. He doesn’t look like he’s having fun in the super fancy private school. And you know I started going out with Becky like last month.”

“Mhmm… Becky’s a nice girl.”

We leave it at that. Two months later, I’m transferring.

&amp;#x200B;

**Seventeen.**

Christmas. Henry’s been caught with acid by mom. Phone buzzes. Emily: ‘Hey :) Miss you.’ I pick up my phone. ‘Miss you too &lt;3.’ Then ‘Mr Jones hasn’t posted my English score yet. You?’. Shouting downstairs. Phone buzzes again. ‘Always the A student. That’s my good boy.’ Buzz. ‘I’ll check later’ The sound of something smashing. The front door slams. ‘ttyl’ I open my window. It’s a short hop to the roof, then the top of the shed, and then the ground. I don’t wanna run into mom right now. I catch up to the figure ahead, the head of hair a lot like mine.

“Playgound?”

“Yeah. I need to go smoke.”

“Jesus, man. You just got busted for drugs.”

“It’s not like smoking’s illegal.”

We made our way to the old overgrown outdoor squash wall by the playground. Closed off by trees in the front, and surrounded by concrete, it made for a good spot. We push through the leaves into the small space in the middle.

“You got a lamp?”

“Nah, I’ve got something better in mind.”

I hear Henry unzip his backpack. Some rustling. Then suddenly there's a small fire going. A small fire pit in the middle of our den that I’d never seen before. The glow fills the space, revealing the beat up couches, small table, and old posters taped onto the walls. Everything has that bloated and wrinkled look of having been drenched in rain, then sun dried. Henry must have made the fire pit sometime during the last week. It was like him to do things like that.

“Pretty neat.”

“Right?”

We both collapse into the couches. A second source of light illuminates Henry’s face as he flicks his lighter. Soon the joint’s slow burning tip creates an orange dot. An odd accent in the weak light of the fire.

“You want some?”

“Sure.”

I took the joint and hit it.

*Classified.*

The word hangs over both our heads. We weren’t told during the conference what our tattoos were. Everyone else got theirs and were busy writing college apps, or preparing to go into the workforce. Us, we were left in the dark.

“You think we have the same one?” Henry remarked, as he took back the joint.

“They put you into St. Louis first. That’s gotta mean something.”

“But you’re doing way better. I’m almost failing everything. But they won’t kick me out.”

I shrugged.

“Maybe mom and dad got us mixed up after the tattoos faded.”

I don’t know if it was the high, or the anxiety. But we laughed for a good while. Henry took out his speaker and turned something on. Some indie bullshit. It was nice though... the fire, the leaves, and the music. We stayed there, passing the joint back and forth. Feeding the fire every once in a while.

&amp;#x200B;

**Twenty Five**

Cancer.

It’s all you can hear on the news nowadays. A sudden uptick in solar radiation getting through to the earth has caused unprecedented occurrence of cancer in the population. Doomsday prophets were everywhere, and a general sense of panic was starting to envelop the globe.

What a time to be a med student on rotation. The morbid joke of the day was that oncology was looking like a very hot field to get into, with all the grants being thrown at it. I paced quickly through the familiar halls of the hospital. But I wasn’t here as a med student today.

“Hey Henry.”

I smiled as I stepped through the doorway. Henry turned his head towards me. His face was gaunt, and it felt eerily like looking at the ghost of myself.

“Hey….”

Henry’s voice trailed off weakly, accompanied by a small smile.

“I haven’t seen you look this bad since you dropped out of college,” I jabbed.

Again the weak smile. I hated it. I hated seeing him this weak. Even when the school and our parents stepped in against him pursing his own path he got through it with his usual brilliant nonchalance. But now he was bedridden, bedridden and dying.

“I need….”

He managed to get these two words out before a hacking cough tore through his body. Pulmonary Edema, his lungs were filling up with fluid. Who knows which underlying cause was to blame at this point. Henry’s entire body was failing due to cancer.

“I need, a favor. The doctors told me to have you read these.”

There was a pile of papers on his bedside table. Research papers.

“Henry, what are-”

“Just, read.”

I picked one up. On the Discovery of a New Anti-Cancer Organ. I flitted through it. New patient with late stage cancer showed unexplained decrease of tumor volume in his body. The next paper showed an isolation of proteins thought to be causing this effect. Named HeLUS proteins. Typical research humor. Then more papers saying the same thing: failure to grow the proteins in vitro, failure to the grow the proteins in vitro, failure to grow the proteins in vitro. Discussion mentions something about time running out for HeLUS patient.

“Henry why do you have these?”

“I’m the patient. The He part of HeLUS is for Henry.”

“What?”

My head was spinning. This would mean that my brother is somehow generating something equivalent to an anti-cancer drug naturally. But also that his body was too slow, that the cancer was winning. If he dies, the drug dies with him. Everyone so far has failed to grow the drug artificially in the lab.

“They want me to do something… Some weird thing to slow my body down. To buy more time.”

Henry handed me a form. It was for an experimental treatment that can slow down the functions of the body and put a person in an indefinite stasis. I was familiar with it. It was made in the hopes of slowing down cancer metastasis but…

“Henry, this is going to shut your brain down. You’re going to die.”

“I want you to do it.”

“Henry-”

“Please Andrew. I want to go out on my own terms. They told me what my tattoo said when they gave me these forms.”

Silence while he caught his breath.

“It said that I would cure cancer. That’s the reason that my life’s been so fucked up. Why everyone’s been so controlling, why I got shipped off to St. Louis, why the college wouldn’t drop me. Everyone’s been making choices for me all the time. Please.”

Henry was begging. Begging me. I couldn’t stand it. I stood up.

“I need some time to think.”

I walked out of the room.

&amp;#x200B;

It was a week later when I would be helping with my brother’s treatment, and then another month until a breakthrough occurred with the reproduction of the drug. The world was saved, cancer was cured, and my brother was dead. Later I would be the one to pull the plug on him, and let him die his proper death. No longer a lab rat, free at last.",sharramon

Every little outburst my daughter has any little angry moment I’m terrified, it might happen this is what made her kill him. I spend most of my time with the kids, my son is a bright boy with a head for science, he wants to be a doctor someday.My daughter,she is a normal little kid with nothing bad in her wants to be a doctor like her brother just a normal little girl but eventually she must kill her brother. I can’t change it the fates always come true  mine did in the war a few years ago I didn’t mean to do anything spectacular it just sort of happened and the medal is in a drawer somewhere . 

When my twins were born and I saw the prophecy’s all that joy and happiness just disappeared and I made a choice to let fate take its course, I won’t stand in its way I can’t no one could and coming to terms with it isn’t easy. I have thought about the wording of those two statements for so many long nights, my son will cure cancer then die. I don’t know when or how he will die it might be an accident or cold blooded murder, I hopefully won’t be alive to see it. I couldn’t bear to live after it happens hopefully both my children life full lives before it.

My daughters greatest achievement will be killing her brother, is my son a terrible tyrant in the future or is my daughters life going to be so empty that murder is her greatest accomplishment. I hate deceiving my children like this but I can’t tell them it might not come true if I do, even if I’m sure of it the whole world knows that these warnings always come true. I won’t tell my daughter or my son, imagine living a life and knowing that I’m the end you don’t have freedom, your designed to fulfil the prophecy and that’s it nothing can change that.

I could never change the prophecy and I wouldn’t my son will save so many lives and for that prophecy to come true the other must as well.",gliggett

In front of him was his twin brother Luke, facing away from him. He stood on the ledge of the building looking down. The wind howled on the rooftop, threatening to throw him. Below them, the lights of the city illuminated the night. 

“It’s the only way.” said Luke quietly and almost without emotion. “It’s my destiny.” In his hand was a flip phone. He held it open, preparing to press a button. 

“Think of all the families Luke! Think of the children!” John screamed as the wind flowed past his face sending his hood flying off. The gun shook in his hand. 

“A small cost to end the suffering for generations.” Luke responded.

“You don’t have to complete it. Neither of us does.” John yelled. 

Luke turned to face his brother. There were tears in his eyes. “We’ll lose mom John!” he cried. 

John lowered his gun. “She wouldn’t want to live in a world where you’d done this,” he said solemnly. 

Luke wiped off his face and looked at John. “What do you know John!? You’ve always been the good one. First the good grades… now a cop!? This is my only chance at something good!”

John raised his gun again “That’s not true. You’re my brother. I love you…. Mom loves you!”

Luke turned to face the city again. He violently started smacking his own face. “Fuck!” he screamed in frustration. 
“Please Luke, just put down the phone and we can figure this out. No one will ever know.” John slowly started walking towards him.

Luke’s chest heaved in and out as he tried to control the frantic crying. He slowly caught his breath and turned his face up to the night sky. After a few moments he looked down at his right arm where the text had been at his birth foretelling his destiny. He peered at it inquisitively. Then he looked back at John. “I’m sorry John.”

“Luke don’t!” 

A massive explosion erupted from the city below them as Luke pressed the button. Flames began climbing through the sky. 

**BANG!** 

John pulled the trigger and watched as his brother slumped. His body fell off the roof and down into the chaos. John ran up to the roof and peered over. His brothers body faded into the rising smoke. Bodies were strewn across the square. Blood filled the streets. He watched as it pooled, filling out the carved out grooves that shaped a ring around the city. For an instant it glowed an ominous red. The alchemy had worked. Luke had created the cure. 

John fell to his knees and began sobbing uncontrollably. On his arm words appeared in black for the second time in his life. ""KILL YOUR TWIN""

I walked over to the counter, and my eyes were almost hurting because I was stretching them to look at her so much.

I made my usual order (if I can even call it the usual. I don’t come in a Krispy Kreme too much).

I walked over to my table, trying to play it cool, but no doubt looking like someone trying to play it cool, aka an idiot.

I had barely taken a bite out of my doughnut when I saw her looking at me. This was the first time. Normally it was me looking at her. She smiled and waved an awkward wave.

Shit. I thought to myself. Do I wave back?! Do I salute?! What do people do in this situation?!

I’d waited too long, her smile turned to confusion,  no doubt thinking why I wasn’t waving back.

I raised my hand, I made the motion, but I was too late. Her eyes had already darted back to her doughnut.

Crap, crap, crap! I thought to myself. I have to fix this. I have to go over.

I stand up and knock my tray. My coffee went everywhere and she sees.

Fuck, fuck, fuck!

I try to ignore it. I smile and wave again. I place my hand on my hip and walk over like some sort of injured ballerina.

“Hiiiii” I say. Why did I emphasise the hi?!?!

“Errr, hi” she says, her smile is back, but it’s an awkward one.

“Do I know you?”

“I’m not sure” she says. “But I see you a lot”.

“I know right. What is that? Do we know each other?”

She laughs, “Didn’t you just ask me that?”

Her eyes were blue. I only just noticed that.

“So I did” I laughed back. “So that was you in London?”

“Yep. Visiting a friend”

“Washington?”

“Yep. I go there for work sometimes”

“May I ask your name?”

“Jackie” she says. “You?”

“Luke”

“Do you believe in fate Luke?”

“I’m not sure” I said, thinking it was a weird question.

She laughs again. “You’re not sure of a lot of things are you?”

“Not really. I’m a bit of an idiot to be honest”.

“I like your honesty Luke” she said laughing. “Sit down” and she looked at the chair opposite her.

“Okay” and I sat down in the chair.

“I have something to tell you Luke. Something that’s going to blow your mind”.

"[WP] You start doing something (walking, writing, dancing, eating... whatever you want) and realise that you can’t stop.",Preserved_Moose,"Charlie dished up some pasta for himself, humming a simple tune. Grabbing the cheese and the grater, he began putting a generous portion onto his plate. After a few seconds, he decided that he didn’t want any more, but just as he was about to stop, an intrusive thought forced itself into the front of his mind.

Don’t stop.

Fear caused his blood to run cold. Why couldn’t he stop? Surely he was having a hallucination or something. He had lost complete control of his body. The feeling was so strange, so alien that he inadvertently began to shake. Still, the thought persisted.

Don’t stop. 

The cheese was nearly gone, and Charlie hoped for salvation, but as soon as it finished, he was overcome with an insatiable desire to obtain more cheese. He went to his refrigerator and found a massive amount, and as he grabbed it, he could have sworn that more took its place. He was not able to linger, as his instinct and every fiber of his being forced him back to his plate to continue.

Don’t stop.

The cheese began to overflow the plate, and yet Charlie still could not stop. He was beginning to feel weary, the constant motion of heating taking a toll after several hours. His mental state was not helped, as he was having a constant inner battle with himself. He so deeply wanted to stop, to rest. But his body refused.

Don’t stop.

It had been days. The cheese was up to ankle height on the floor. Charlie couldn’t remember anything except the soreness of his body. He was so tired and he could only concentrate on trying to stop grating the cheese. He was so thirsty, his mouth dry. The cheese was beginning to decompose, filling the room with a horrible stench. And yet, he still did not stop.

Don’t stop. 

Charlie was reduced to a pile of skin and bones over the course of the next few weeks, his arm in extreme pain, feeling as though it were about to fall off. He stared at the sea of cheese he created through bloodshot eyes. He had given up long ago, his body moving mechanically to continue the single task. All humanity was gone from those eyes, leaving a sort of mad gleam. The stench of the room was unbearable, yet Charlie hardly noticed. His legs had long since given out, and he was slowly covering himself in cheese.

Don’t stop.

Charlie died a slow and agonizing death of asphyxiation as well as simultaneously being crushed by over 400 pounds of shredded cheese. The cheese broke through the floor of the apartment, killing the family living below. The police came to investigate what had caused the damage, and all they found were 5 corpses buried by cheese and an enticing cheese grater.",cripsosu

I'd always had a 'place'—such things are a practical necessity for the quiet and shy living in the city—and this unremarkable plot, with its frozen lake, had been all mine since winter had harshened some years ago, and even the hardiest and most stubborn creatures had had to leave .

Or so I thought. It was an unusually balmy spring, and I had left the agency after work having had an exhausting back-and-forth with my new boss about ... well, it isn't interesting. I had taken the Tube to Frenchtown and rode the bus up the hill to the park gate. And then I had walked, as I had hundreds of times before, along the narrow footpath until the only other people around had disappeared, and I was alone.

But I wasn't alone, or if I was now, I hadn't been, on all those occasions when I had stood, fisted-hands thrust into pockets, hood over head, by the side of the lake. The single trail of footsteps that led from the shores wound up the eastern bank and neared the footpath. I squatted down to look at them.

They were tiny, I thought, too tiny to belong to a person even if by some miracle someone had been living in a frozen lake. No—these belonged to an animal of some kind, and yet it was no animal I'd ever come across before. The prints seemed to suggest something between a paw and a webbed foot. It was bizarre. And perhaps what was more bizarre was the sense of intimacy I felt with—whatever it was. We had been here, on this unremarkable plot of land, alone but for each other for years. And no sooner had I thought this that my eyes narrowed, and I followed the prints swiftly.

I knew it was highly unlikely I find their owner. I couldn't know when the lake had cracked open, or when it's strange inhabitant and abandoned it. But nevertheless I trudged on, following the prints as they crossed the footpath and went down the hill on the other side.

Snow was starting to fall now, and it fell thick and heavy and made it hard to see. Chunks of hail, twigs swept up by the wind stung my face; my cheeks were red; I walked on.

The prints were becoming harder to follow. If the snow continued to fall, I thought, it would soon cover the tracks and they would be lost forever. I fought the elements, looking straight down at the prints, which already seemed to be fading and then—there!—by a large black tree, standing alone in a small field, the prints stopped. I approached with caution. It struck me that I had no idea what I might find. I neared a small opening at the bottom of tree, sat on my haunches and, carefully, peered inside.

It was at that moment that I felt a very small, very hard tug on my leg. I turned. My mouth parted; my eyes widened. What was next to me was a very small and furry creature, sat as a cat might sit, and it appeared to be *smiling*. It resembled a beaver or an otter, and yet looked nothing like either. There was something more human in its expression, even if the features which twisted in that expression were distinctly animalistic.

The little animal coughed, scratched its little head, tugged my jeans again and said:

Rather, it was the single trail of footsteps that led out.",UnInconspicuous,"A trail…. it has been a while. My mind, numbed by the cold, needs a few seconds to realize this. Footprints shouldn't come from…. oh… My mouth slowly twists into a smile, as i breath warm air into my mittens...more a reflex than anything else, before I turn to follow them. They can’t be far.And really, after only a few minuts I see the being in the distance. “Hey!” I raise my voice to the naked man, who slowly trudges through the snow, quickly catching up with him. He turns towards me, an icicle on the nose, slightly blue skin… cold will do that to you, and he hasn’t learned about cloth yet. “Welcome to Finland.” I hand him my bottle of Koskenkorva and he takes a good swig, before giving the bottle back. I smile. Always a wonder of nature when a new fin is born.

"[WP] The frozen lake had finally cracked open after all these frigid years. However, it was not this fact that startled me. Rather, it was the single trail of footsteps that led out.",UnInconspicuous,"""Like an honest to God gunshot. Hunter just took right off,"" Martin repeated for the eighth time as we trudged along the lake's slushy shore. I wanted to remind him of that fact, rudeness be damned, but one look at his drawn face and sunken eyes made me still my tongue. At least he'd waited 'til six this morning to ring me—he probably hadn't gotten much sleep himself since it'd happened at about three.

Still, days like this reminded me that it might be time to hang up the winter boots, hand over the rifle now slung over my shoulder to Deputy Richardson—never mind that the gun was older than her—and move somewhere down south. Of late, my joints creaked more than the pines did during a gale; my fingers sometimes forgot they existed until I massaged them.

""Tim?"" came Martin's reedy voice. I shook my head and noticed he'd stopped. ""Damned sure the sound came from somewhere 'round here. My cabin's just over that hill there so can't have mistaken it.""

I nodded, more to show that I'd heard than in agreement. The lake stretched out before us, roughly oval-shaped, dusted with a fine coat of white. Surrounding it was were snow-coated pines, shadows dripping from their boughs to form an almost solid, impenetrable wall of darkness. Somewhere across the lake, an owl hooted, the mournful note hanging for a moment until the breeze swallowed it.

""I'd best go out for a look,"" I said. ""Stay here, keep an eye out for Hunter?""

""Bah, that dog's been out on his own enough times. You worry about yourself. Sure going out there's a good idea?"" he said, studying the lake's surface.

""When's the last time you see it thawed?"" I said. While Martin thought about it, I took my first, tentative step onto the lake, listening intently for cracking ice. It held, however, firm as earth, even after I gave it a good stomp.

I didn't have far to walk before I found the first unusual sign. There was a hole in the lake, just large enough to accommodate a man. Perfectly circular, as if someone had cut through with a saw, though I doubted that anyone in the town could've made it look so clean.

That was when I noticed the footprints. Single pair, barefooted, about the size of an average adult man's. A shudder coursed through my spine; what the hell could've climbed out of it? Did someone fall in? That could explain the sound Martin had heard ... except the ice showed no damage, no webbing of cracks around the hole. Straightening, I studied the course of the footprints. They led right to the woods, an unwavering line.

I shouted, ""Martin, call an ambulance. I think someone might have fallen through the ice!""

Swearing under my breath, I hurried after the prints. I didn't expect to go far; in that water, anyone who climbed back out was as good as dead in minutes. Martin should've called me earlier!

Once I'd reached solid ground once more, I tore through the pine forest, ignoring the aches in my cold legs, or the sting of the wind in my lungs. Arriving at an incline, I was forced to scrabble up on all fours, while chilly wetness seeped through my mittens. The footprints continued there with even strides, seemingly mocking me.

Suddenly, there came a strange sound, like a cross between a shrill whistle and full-throated cackling, from just over the slope's summit. It was nothing like I'd ever heard, making me freeze in my clumsy ascent. My hands unslung my rifle without conscious thought, as I crawled the remaining few feet on my chest.

Hunter stared me in the face as I crested the lip, his black eyes dull, blood dusting the white fur on his forehead. Taken entirely by surprised, I yelled. Then the thing that'd been hunched over the rest of his carcass stood up, preternaturally fast. Rational thought fled my brain as it tried to process what it was seeing.

The being had the lower half of a naked man, but the upper portion ... the mass of writhing tentacles made me think of an octopus, but where an octopus's head should've been, it resembled little more than an oversized leech. Blood dripped from the ring of teeth protruding from this pulsating appendage, teeth as large as knives.

Then it bowled into me, and we went tumbling down the slope. Miraculously, my fingers kept hold of the gun, and years of experience and instinct kicked in so that I was scrambling to my feet by the time we hit the bottom.

The creature wasn't so lucky; during the fall, its tentacles had become entangled, and it let loose with another chilling cry as it tried to recover. I didn't bother to sight down my rifle; it was barely three feet away, and taller than a man. The rifle began barking as I squeezed the trigger with all haste.

Chunks of puckered flesh sprayed from its torso as the bullets found their mark, causing it to scream. Then the eyeless leech head clipped my rifle in the midst of its thrashing, wrenching it from my grasp. It vanished into a snowdrift about twenty feet away.

I fumbled for my pistol, ready to die fighting, but the creature took off in a mad dash for the lake. For a brief moment, I remained rooted to the spot, stunned at my sudden solitude, at the fact that I still drew breath. Then I followed, tracking the ungainly marks that were a far cry from the measured paces earlier.

A part of my brain was yelling at me to run, to run until I was three states over and halfway through a bottle of whisky. But the thought of Hunter kept me going—what if I had left it alone? What would happen to Martin? Pam Stoner? Or the McCauleys and their kids?

No. I had to end it before anyone else got hurt.

Minutes later, I was back at the lake. The thing was already upon it, no longer walking upright but dragging itself along on its tentacles. I brought my pistol up, exhaled, and pulled the trigger, falling into a familiar rhythm. Inhale, exhale, fire. Inhale, exhale, fire. The creature squealed, its escape interrupted, and began writhing in one spot. Gunshot after gunshot rang out, echoing from the trees, sending a flock of birds streaking through the air, until the gun clicked on empty.

I drew a knife and strode out to meet the creature, but the sidearm had done the job. It was splayed out in a puddle of rapidly freezing purple blood, motionless as the ice it lay on.

I tried not to look at the thing too closely; God only knew what in hell it was. Some growing, gibbering part of my brain wanted to return to dry land, as far away from it, as possible.

Motion caught my eye; Martin had returned with two paramedics. They formed three, blurry specks against a backdrop of white. Without warning, I heard a splash behind me. Spinning around, I saw a trail of fluid leading to the hole ... the only sign that the creature had ever been here.

In that moment, as I stood there on the open expanse of the lake, near that mysterious hole as the only witness of its denizen, I realized just how lonely, how exposed, I truly was.

"[WP] You die and go to Heaven. Then for some reason you meet God, who is to your surprise kind of a dick",forever_toaster,"I stood by the golden gates, looking deep into the city built on clouds. Saint Peter glanced at me occasionally as he greeted more newcomers to heaven. I was content to wait.

In a lull between the entry of the faithful, Saint Peter spoke to me. ""Why did you come back here? You have already been accepted into the arms of our Lord.""

His words were inquisitive, but there was a patience in his tone that told me he would be just as fine if I didn't answer. So I didn't. I kept my gaze to the city where angels flew and endless white doves arose to play with them.

I would have been content to keep looking if not for the approach of one of the faithful. The man looked young, but his eyes told me that he'd seen much hardship in life. ""Why are you not in there with the rest?"" he asked.

My voice came to me, unbidden. ""I don't want to be there. I doubt God wants me to be there either,"" I replied. The man looked at me in shock, and I noticed his attire. He wore a tattered clerical collar with bullet holes down the front. The bloodstains that should've marked the white dress shirt weren't there however. All wounds healed for the faithful.

""Why do you say that? You are here in paradise, are you not? You have been marked as a righteous man,"" he said. Even if I weren't looking at him, I could've imagined the pure conviction on his face. I turned away. I couldn't bear to face that look.

""Life was hard for you, right Father?"" I asked. I clutched at the bars of the gate in front of me. ""And you went through life, believing in our benevolent Lord. If you have faith, He will be your shield. He will protect you from the evils of the world,"" I continued, not waiting for his response.

I took his silence as affirmation.

""I was much the same. I grew up in rough times and kept to my faith. Even when my father died and I was forced to work as a drug runner to get enough money to finish my medical degree, I kept my faith. I told myself I'd do good.""

I could see the white in my knuckles.

""I saved people. I saved as many as I could.""

The priest stayed silent.

""But it turns out, no matter how many I saved, the only people who can be saved are those that have faith. Outside the Church, there is no salvation.""

In the corner of my eye, I saw Saint Peter look in my direction with sad eyes. I felt my blood boil for an instant as I focused on the gleaming ivory walls of the buildings in the city beyond.

I was beginning to think it was time for more silence when the priest spoke. ""I'm a priest from a diocese in dangerous lands. I spent my life evangelizing and doing good works in the name of the Lord. I am sorry that I couldn't save more, but my time came early.""

""God is our Creator and the only way we've lived is through His command. We must be kind to those not of the Church, but we know that only those that accept His grace will be taken. We have told the world, and it was up to the people of the world to choose if they wanted to be saved or not.""

The priest's words were firm. I didn't take offense. How could I? It wasn't his fault for choosing the correct faith. Heretics, heathens, whatever they were called, I still called them people. And now I know they weren't here.

I didn't hear any more words from the priest; I think he left when it was clear there would be no reply. I could feel trails of dampness on my face. I had seen all the faces of the world in my office. Men and women of different faiths. With my hands, they lived and led lives they wouldn't have had without me.

But God did not see them the way I did.

I fell to my knees and stayed silent as other souls flocked past me to enter the city beyond.",Master-Disciple
"[WP] You die and go to Heaven. Then for some reason you meet God, who is to your surprise kind of a dick",forever_toaster,"God sat hunched over a desk situated improbably on a cloud. Papers and files were strewn across the top of it with no semblance of order to their placement. He was an old man, with long white hair, but he looked even more exhausted than his age warranted. He wasn’t merely old, but also clearly overworked. His mind appeared to be racing in a thousand directions.

“Sit,” he curtly greeted, without looking up from one of the stray papers he was poring over at that moment. He pulled a pair of spectacles from a drawer to aid his perusal of the document, then tossed the glasses onto the desk, “shit,” was all he said before vigorously rubbing his eyes. He alternated between rubbing his eyes and massaging his temples for at least three minutes until he slapped his hands onto his desk and stared at me.

“Is this some kind of request for a relative still living? Or do you have unfinished business you’re going to plead to me about?” 

“I-I...” His eyes narrowed and as he began to speak I quickly blurted, “I just got here!” I was on the verge of tears at my admission. I couldn’t decide if my response would make him more or less upset.

“An intake?! Jes-no,” he stopped short, “I’m not going to inadvertently conjure him up,” he muttered to himself. “Remember God, your New Millenia resolution. I’m not doing that schtik. You’re Tim, bicycle accident, right?”

“No, ah...” 

God flipped through a legal pad, “No, no, you’re Sven, shot in the face during a deli hold up in Czechoslovakia...wait, that can’t be right, we’re speaking English and you sound like you’re from Anywheresville, Ohio or some shit. Alright, fuck it, illuminate me!” God lifted his hands and shimmied them back and forth in mock anticipation of being “wowed.” 

“I, um, my, my name...”

“Is...” God twirled his finger without looking up from his desk.

“Is Bryan, Bryan Crawl. I, veered off the road!” I was violently shaking at having to divulge anything to the being before me, he clearly had judgment down to an art form. “On the way to church!” I smilingly added, in hopes that this last detail would warm him even in the slightest toward me. It didn’t. He looked up, smirking, and placed his hand over his heart and just said, “aw, gee! Thanks! I remember your every precious thoughtful prayer en route to that clapboard...” he stopped mid-sentence, staring at me like I wasn’t even worth him expending the thought to formulate a clever quip, and he just looked back at his mess of papers.

“So, Ryan, let’s see that file.” He began pushing papers around his desk, and finally resorted to turning on his phone flashlight to peer under papers until finally he saw mine and, while staring at me, he dramatically dropped it onto his desk, sending some loose papers flying from the desk. 

“Peter!” God called. 

“Yes sir!” An obviously harried St. Peter appeared, wearing a green eyeshade visor, the kind popularized by bookies and tax professionals.

“Nut check!” God punched at Peter’s crotch, causing Peter to bend forward and breath exasperatedly through the pain. “I’m just fuckin’ with you, Peter. Hey, if you were a rapper, you’d be Lil’ Peter! Huh? ‘Cus uh, little shrimp dick, and all that...” God trailed off.

Peter forced a hearty guffaw so loud and delayed that it belied the disingenuousness of the laugh. “Good one, sir!” He smiled through clenched teeth.

“Alright, what am I doin’? Oh! Did you run the numbers on this moron?” For a split second God appeared concerned at what he referred to me as in my presence, but that quickly dissipated as he chuckled, I guess when he realized he’s God and there are no checks or balances on him.

“Here you are, sir!” Peter handed God a small manila folder. God snatched it from Peter and just stared him down, for no apparent reason. “Go,” was all God said and Peter poofed in a cloud of smoke.

“Alrighhhhhhhtttttttt...” God dragged out the ‘alright’ while simultaneously running his finger down what appeared to be a ledger. His eyes grew wide, “You runnin’ a game on me, boy?? You know damn well what you did and you don’t belong here!” I was stunned to silence and just stared. He let the fear marinate, then broke the moment with, “just fuckin’ with yuh.”

God continued, “We ran the numbers through the ratio formula of good vs. bad deeds and it looks like your good deeds outweigh, kind of, basically where it ought to be to...wait.” You could’ve heard my chattering teeth and gulping panic swallow all the way to earth.

“What the fuck is this?! You little shit! Fuck you!” He bellowed.

“What?! What, sir?! Is this a joke?!” I sobbed.

“A joke?! You tell me! You’re a joke! Your entire existence is! I can’t believe you! You swore...to God! When you were lying! I have it right here! You were seven, on the playground, and no one believed you that not only had you been to Disney World, which you hadn’t, but that your dad, quote: ‘Like, started Disney World. We, um, had to change our name from Disney...because it’s a secret and everyone would want free Disney stuff...’ and do I really need to continue with this bullshit? Then, one of the kids asked if you swore to God what you said was true, and after you hesitated, you did! You swore to fucking God! Didn’t anyone tell you that’s the worst thing you can do?! If you do that and you’re lying, you instantly go to hell, do not pass Go, do not collect 200 fucking dollars! Go fuck yourself! No amount of good deeds makes up for that shit! Not world peace or healing every disease, nothing undoes it, none of it! Get out of my sight!” God reached for a red button on the far right corner of his desktop.

“No!!!” I shrieked, choking on a torrent of tears.

God mumbled, “Wasting my me-damn time - no, your resolution - no schtik,” God said to himself. God then looked up, surprised and perturbed at me still being there, wasting his time. While slamming the button with his fist God glowered, “You’re the reason the Garden of Eden needs a bouncer now! You sick, evil, son of a harlot!”

In my fit of desperation my despondence turned to sheer anger as I fell through the cloud, barreling toward hell, I assumed. “Your book sucks anyway! You’re an asshole! There are inconsistencies galore in it! Seriously! Did you really need to be that specific about the measurements of the ark and design of the tabernacle?? It just goes on for pages!” My voice trailed off. 

Looking to the heavens, I saw God staring through the hole I’d fallen through. He simply stared down at my falling body and ran his index finger down his cheek, signaling a mock tear, and then he popped an alka-seltzer into a now fizzing glass of water and returned to his desk.",jb9193

"[WP] As a simple townsfolk, your reality is shattered as The Fabled Hero fails his quest and dark magic consumes the world.",gingerwhiskered,"The doom had been moving ever closer and they feared it. Of course, everyone knew that the baron’s son was riding out at the head of the fabled White Swords, and that they would be able to beat back the doom that was driving ever westward. It gave them hope but also made them complacent. 

It was why most people had only made a feeble attempt at gathering their possessions and packing up, as the town constable had urged them. How could the White Swords, fabled knights of legend and lore, fail in their quest. And so, the warnings and pleadings of the small-town constable had fallen on deaf ears. The people simply refused to give up hope, houses and harvest if heaven’s forces themselves were riding out to meet the darkness. Some even said it would be blasphemous. 

All the more shocking was the day when darkness finally overcame the small-town and the sun would not rise. The army of darkness swept past the town in a forced march ever westward and only a small contingent stayed behind to deal with the town. 

These were led by a smaller demon who knew his work. He gathered all the folk who had not managed to escape into town and had them brought to the front gate, tied together. 
“Open the gates and let us in, if their lives mean anything to you!” the heralds cried. 

Silence and confusion reigned on the walls. How could this have happened, where were the White Swords? What happened to them?

Without provisions and without any great store of arms their choices were limited indeed. The constable and the duke were still arguing, when the relatives of people held captive at the gate stormed the gatehouse and lowered the bridge. The demon army made their way into town and took up residence in the dukes’ mansion. The city guard was called up and disarmed. There was some looting, but mostly at the expense of the richer nobles who made a show of resisting and the cathedral, where the monks tried to fight but were soon overcome and thrown into the dungeons. 

The next morning, although it was more of a gloom, the rich and powerful folk of the town were called to the council chambers, where the demon was sitting in the dukes’ high chair of office. When everybody was in attendance he nodded to the herald of the day before. 

“We the army of the great Warlock have taken possession of this town and will see to it’s administration, until our great King will decide who shall rule you. We have revised your former rulers decrees and we judged them unwise. Henceforth your taxes shall be reduced by a tithe and your cathedral shall be torn down to make place for a new house of Magick where those of you adept in the higher arts shall be trained. Those who dare to continue to flaunt their beliefs in the false gods openly or dare to resist our rule, shall be punished. And now the great Hruanlaras shall grant you the right to ask of him what you need to know to keep this town peaceful and calm.”

One man, still carrying an air of defiant grace asked: “What happened to the White Swords, demon? Did you kill them?”

Hruanlaras rose slowly from his chair and spoke with a booming voice: “THEY DROWNED WHEN THEIR RAFT CAPSIZED IN THE RIVER. THEIR ARMOUR BORE THEM DOWN TO THE RIVERBED WHERE THEY DIED. OUR SCOUTS SAW IT FROM THE FAR BANK. IT WAS A HUMOUROUS THING TO WATCH!”

Silence and shock reigned. Confusion was written into everyones' face.  “ANY MORE QUESTIONS?” boomed Hruanlaras.

One man raised a shaking hand. “YES, YOU BACK THERE!”

“Ehmm, yes. Do you know when the sunlight shall return? It’s just that it is not good for the crops if it stays dark like this for much longer…”

"[WP] As a simple townsfolk, your reality is shattered as The Fabled Hero fails his quest and dark magic consumes the world.",gingerwhiskered,"The Saviour drew his sword.

Born Ario Anduin on the northern border of our island, the prophecy told he would be the one to save us. The one to vanquish Dark Lord Himaegon and save the world entire.

The Saviour leaped toward the Dark Lord, bringing his sword back.

His entire life has been dedicated to training. Traveling here, to the southern border village of Galdonburgh. He was the greatest, most elegant swordsman, armed with an Elvish weapon of magic-imbued platinum which gave him the power to slaughter a thousand Dark Lords in a single blow.

The Savior vanished.

It was as if he’d disappeared into thin air, because he had. The Dark Lord, left unopposed, snapped his fingers. And, like our last hope, the Sun was suddenly just gone. Another snap and our crops were killed. This wasn’t how it was supposed to go. Our defender was dead. But as chieftain of the village this was supposed to end in, I had to continue it.

“Grab your families, your livestock, and go!”, I yelled. No one could figure out what to do. We’d spent our entire lives preparing for our responsibilities in fulfilling the prophecy. I lit many lanterns for my people as the Dark Lord looked upon us, smirking.

Speaking out in his booming, otherworldly voice, he interjected, “No need to run. I’m not killing you now, or even soon. That star is all that’s been keeping you alive. And now, I get to watch you, and every other human, squirm. I am -”.

He was cut off by his brain being cut open by an arrow. The source of our struggle collapsed, dead. Standing upon a rooftop, bow in hand, was Brewster Chamberlain, the town’s “fool”. An atheist extremist who’d spent his entire life denouncing the prophecy, destinies, and training only to support a saviour we’d never met. We called him stupid. Now he stood above us all, slayer of the Dark Lord.

Hopping down from the roof, Chamberlain inquired, “No need to thank me. What now?”. *What now* indeed. I looked out at my townspeople. Terrified. Uncertain. No longer illuminated by a source of life, not just dim light. Something had to happen fast. I commanded my people.

“Agriculture’s over. It’s done. Livestock and whatever water we find is our sustenance now. We have enough to survive. Less fortunate tribes will come for us. We’ll avoid them nomadically. We’ll fight them to the death. Any questions?”

There were none.

We set off, illuminated not by a glorious rising sun but some crude lanterns. However, there was hope. Since everyone, even the cleric, realized it was not one of these young warriors that had the potential to be the saviour and restore balance. Because they all did.",theSporadicNomadic

The very thought shocks me off the bed in horror as my last recollection comes rushing back at me. 

*Ashes*

I curse and get to my feet, suddenly in panic. The room I'm in is small, the bed being the only real object in the room. It is pushed to the very corner of the room, the edge appearing to merge with the wall. The room itself looks metallic in build and I run my hands over it, feeling the cold smoothness underneath my fingers. There's a small window situated above the bed I was on, which is opened slightly. The only singular door to the room has a viewing glass in the middle. Large enough for me to see the outside of the room but not the peripherals. There are no handles on the door and no matter how much I push on it, it does not budge in the slightest. 

I return to the bed and sit on it, holding my head in my hands and trying not to hyperventilate. 

*I have been kidnapped*

That is all I think about. I mean, the ashes was terrifying enough but I don't know where I am at. Why were there even ashes? And who was in the hazmat suit? My thoughts travel back to my home. If I'm here it means my door is still open. Anyone can be in my house. My dog. Lucy. 

*Oh fuck! I need to get out of here*

I get back to my feet but before I even move, I hear the metallic clank of gears moving by the door and I instinctively dive back to the bed, turning away to face the wall and pretend I'm sleeping. I don't understand why I've done this but I lay quietly and wait for my visitor. I hear the door open and close with clank of sorts. There is someone else in the room with me. I consider turning but my fear is holding me in my huddle state. 

""When you're done pretending, can you roll over? We need to talk."" 

A gruff voice calls from behind me. It sounds like an older man, probably much older than me. There is a resigned lilt to his voice, like he would rather be anywhere else but here. I don't move. I instead fake some light snoring, trying to sell my pretense. A loud back on a space on the wall just above me makes me jump, especially when the object that made the sound falls to the bed, hitting my exposed arm. I shrink back as realization dawns on me. It is a bullet. I turn back to face my visitor, my fear heightening. 

*He just shot at me* I find myself screaming mentally.

""Oh look. You're awake"" He says in mock surprise. 

I shiver in place, choosing to not make eye contact. My visitor is in a hazmat suit, the helmet off and under an arm. He's holding a small gun in his other hand. I force myself to look at him and I'm faced with a bearded man with sharp eyes. 

""Are you awake now?"" He asks

I nod profusely and he holsters the gun before rubbing his face tiredly. Then he continues. 

""My name is Bernard. Do you remember yours?"" He asks.

I don't answer till his hand falls on the gun again. 

""A-adrian."" I stammer.

""Afternoon Adrian. Apologies for the gun shot to keep you awake. I need you to focus. Do you know why you're here?"" He says to me as he sighs. 

I shake my head. I don't trust myself to say much. 

""I guessed as much. You are currently one of the 444,444 people to not be affected""

""...a-affected? By what? Did you infect me with something? Please let me go. Please. I won't say anything. I just want to go home. I don't want to die. I promise I'll be quiet. Please..."" 

The words tumble out of me with no filter. I fall off the bed in my wish to plead to my visitor. I crawl towards him. It's only now that I see I've been crying. Bernard moves away from me, his hand coming to rest on his handgun again. I stop. I want to go home. I don't want to die. 

""We did not inject you with anything, and I'll be *very* glad if you return back to your bed. Might be best to not do anything unsafe..."" He says, emphasizing on his willingness to not be violent. 

I comply.

""The world as you knew it is gone. Nuclear weapons, fallout and all. But you and the others... You all seemed to not only sleep through it, but not be affected by the radiation fallout either."" He says. 

I think confusion must have showed on my face because he smiled ruefully like he finally has my attention. 

""I am not sure you're aware but it's been 5 years since the nuclear war. Five years since the world burned over. And you, you slept through all of that. That is why you're here, Adrian... We have to figure out how, and why, and what you are.""

This dream that you've been continuing for your entire life has been pretty normal, until one day, you cant tell whats real; The Dream, or Earth?",unstabledave105,"""Why don't you sleep, Arthur?"" my wife called from bed behind me. I turned around from my desk, lethargy visible on my face as I reply.

""This work won't finish itself.""

""That can wait until tomorrow Arthur. You're far ahead of schedule! Reward yourself with some sleep, can't you?""

This was a record for me: 71 consecutive hours without sleep. Not even a nap, and barely the comfort of sitting down. However now, I had finally reached my limit. I could go no longer without my lack of sleep affecting my work and my relationship with my wife. I yielded with a smile.

""Alright,"" dropping my pen, ""you win."" I walked over to bed and slowly eased myself in. My wife wrapped her arms around me, surely expecting something from me, but I could not fight my swimming thoughts, and as I drifted into sleep, I felt a tinge of fear run through me as I imagined the hopeless hell that awaited me as I slept in this world.

\--

I was on my fifth drink at O'Malley's, the local pub just 3 blocks from my flat. I had been a heavy drinker for 6 years or... to be honest... what I have really been for that time has alluded me. It was about 6 years ago when I couldn't begin to differentiate the man who'd drink his savings away to the man who ran the largest firm in Oregon; who was world-renowned for his ethics and hard work in the field of law, and had a beautiful family that he could rely on in his darkest times. The drinker and the lawyer were the same, yet they did not even occupy the same plane of existence.

I checked the inside of my trench coat naturally. The pistol was still there, of course it was. 

I had been thinking a lot about the nature of my lives. Whenever I went to sleep, I entered the other, and by this point have stopped trying to determine which one was more real to me. As a lawyer, I often avoided sleep. I'd average a total of 36 hours awake, but when I was a drinker I spent half of my time asleep. This lifestyle was unnatural and a bit horrifying: as a lawyer I occupied my thoughts with my work and my family but I had all the time in the world to think about anything I wanted here, in my own nightmare. And here, I had been thinking a lot about how to determine which life was real.

I couldn't continue to function as a lawyer who feared sleep, and I couldn't waste my days drinking either. This had to end, here and now. 

How had this even begun? I haven't a clue, but I knew it became more and more realistic, often mirroring the reality that I had once known. Six years ago I had a few days of disjointed sleeping and, combined with realities that were nearly identical, I failed to distinguish them. Over time however, they diverged. Here, my wife had left me, I was fired following the divorce, and all the money I had left came from savings I meant to dedicate to the children my wife and I were to have. There, my marriage was healthy, I was promoted, and life only became happier. It seemed that the paths of both lives were decided arbitrarily by some indifferent entity. I couldn't stand it any longer.

My decision came not without unease. I was to draw my pistol from my jacket and aim it at the bartender, demanding cash. There was always a man sitting behind me when I came here, an ex-con, and I knew that he always carried a large Bowie knife on him. I would provoke enough chaos that the man would come here and stab me, hopefully with fatal results. I would've preferred shooting myself, but I could not bring myself to do so. When I died, I would either be a happy lawyer forever or I'd just... well, die.  

So I went for it. I took a deep breath, stood up and whipped my pistol out of my trench coat. ""The money!"" I yelled. The bartender threw up his hands instinctively, shaking in shock. I had to yell at him again to get him to comply. He reached quickly into the register and began pulling out bills. I began to get worried. It had been thirty seconds, but I was not being stabbed. I slowly turned as I heard bills falling into a bag below the bar. The chair that the ex-con sat in was empty. He must've been in the bathroom. I would have to stall. As I turned around to ask the bartender to go to his safe, I found that I was staring down the barrel of a 12 gauge the bartender had pulled out while I was searching for the ex-con. Even better. He pulled the trigger and in an instant I was spread across the floor on my back, pain spreading throughout my chest. This was death. As I faded out of existence, I was eager to found out what my true fate was.

\---

I awoke with a jolt in my bed. My heavy breathing had awoken my wife, whose arms were still wrapped around my torso. My sweat drenched the sheets as I realized what I had just... what I just imagined. It was over now. 

""Are you alright, Arthur?"" 

I sighed heavily, but couldn't help but laugh. Six years of near torment, all over in one night, known to no one but me. It was nothing but a dream. Nothing but a dream!

""I just had an odd nightmare..."" I whispered. I could hear sirens wailing in the distance, as if signaling the drinker's end.

""Oh no,"" she replied. ""What was it about?"" 

""It's..."" I began, but the sirens kept drawing my attention away. ""It's hard to describe, dear.""

""I understand. You can tell me all about it in the m...""

\---

I wasn't in my bed. I was in an ambulance.   
""He's awake"" one man told his partner. They started talking, but I began to fade out again and couldn't decipher them. As my vision blackened, I heard them yelling.

And then there was no lawyer or drinker.

Hermes is running messages from Ares to Hephaestus. Hera, Artemis, and Aphrodite all have their heads together. Every now and then they glance at our end of the table to see if we were listening. We aren't. Why would we?

Call me Diadílous. I'm the god of the internet. Nice to meet you

Of course I already know all about you. Yes, *you*. I know where you're from. I know your politics. I know who your friends are. I know what shows you like and what, ahem, ""*art""* you are fond of.

Don't be embarrassed. You aren't the only one with *unusual* tastes. I'm not trying to embarrass you, I just want to impress upon you that, over the last 35 years, I've learned almost everything anyone knows about anything and anyone.

That's why those old farts over there are so damn amusing.

You see, they are playing the game the way they've always played it. They're winning over men and women with the promise of sex, money, and power, putting their unwitting devotees into positions of influence. They think that the key to shaping the world is putting the right man in the right place at the right time. They think that moving politicians around the board will arrest my ascent.

Does the name Ajit Pai ring a bell?

They're betting that they can stop me the same way they've stopped any challenge to their rule: *coercion*. I'm betting that the game is different now.

That isn't to say that our methods are all that dissimilar. Besides, sex, money, and power is pretty much *my* M.O., too. The difference is that I offer it to *everyone*, not just my favorites. Have a kink? I've got your back, no problem. Want to make some money? Use me to find a job. Or gamble. Trade stocks. Mine crypto. Sell stuff. Whatever your hustle, it goes through me now. Want power?

Datus, the God of the Internet and Media, slowly approached the throne of Zeus, the God of the Sky, Lightning and Thunder.

""I know why you came here, son."" Zeus' tired eyes were fixated at the young, ambling God, as he came closer and closer.

""Good. Then I think you agree that it is time for things to change.""

""Absolutely not."" Zeus' expression did not change.

""Father. The order of things has changed!"" Datus raised his voice, sending tremors through the entirety of the magnificent Temple.

""Watch your tongue, brother!"" Ares, the God of War stood up abruptly, with his sword at the ready.

""Silence."" Zeus immediately order with a flick of his hand.

""Brother,"" Datus, now turned his attention toward Ares, ""I know you're strong these days. But lest not forget who promotes this War of yours."" He smiled slickly, and noticed Ares' brow twitching. ""Now back to business father. I'll get straight to the point. I want to take your place. Simple as that.""

""Heresy!"" Hera, the Goddess of Marriage, Mothers and Families stood up from beside Zeus. ""How can you believe that?!""

""I thought you'd at least be willing to hear me out, mother."" Datus sighed, ""What a shame.""

""You've been gone for decades, and you dare to come back and ask for the throne? What reason do I have to let you live, not to speak of letting you lead our people?!"" Zeus' voice thundered across the Temple, and shook mount Olympus, creating an avalanche.

""Father, I've changed. The world has changed. Your power is limited, dwindling - while mine, mine is constantly growing! You can't do anything to stop it, only accept it."" Datus put his hands inside the pockets of his well tailored suit. ""It is time for you to move forward.""

Zeus' eyes flickered with burning rage, he stood up from his enormous throne. ""I'm powerless?"" His voice thundered, and in an instant a fluctuating, constantly shifting, unstable lightning appeared in his left hand with the sound of a thousand chirping birds.

""Father, I am the God of the Internet. I've seen humans achieve much more - with much less. Your tricks do not intimidate me, nor anyone - any longer.""

""Then die!"" Zeus shot out the spear of lightning at the youngest of his children, with the intention to kill.

Datus did not move aside, instead he brought forward his left hand, with his index and middle fingers pointed toward the lightning. For a split second the lightning vanished altogether, before springing out of his right hand - toward the enormous wooden door at the entrance, shredding it to bits and flying off to infinity, as it seemed.

""I've got a few tricks up my sleeve too, father."" Datus fixed his suit, as the other gods were staring at him, aghast. ""This one I learned from a certain Mr. Iroh.""",WritingMadness

Olympus, ripping the clouds to pieces and scattering tongues of white lightning over the immense pillars of the Gods’ Throne Room. A meeting was taking place.

Sitting in his regular place alongside the hundreds of minor gods who had flocked the hall, Isfos scanned the room quickly, taking in the scene. It was a rarity for even one of the Twelve to appear in the throne-room, let alone all of them. Yet today he had awoken in his humble home on one of Olympus’ lower peaks to see a throng of minor gods, demigods and godlings pressing through the rickety stone road that ran from Olympus’ base to its tip. 

Naturally, it took the god of the internet very little time to determine the cause of the commotion. The Pantheon was meeting – for the first time in centuries. As Isfos joined the crowd he overheard the conception of a dozen rumours, all equally implausible. Some said that Zeus had finally decided to begin the long-overdue refurbishment of the throne room – after all the great marble pillars that held its intricately carved walls had taken quite a beating since the last great meeting – where Hephaestus had brought forth a celestial bronze riot shield and declared it invulnerable even to the power of the mighty gods. His elder brother Ares, of course had immediately risen to test this mighty claim. A couple of minor gods sitting closest to the dais had been vaporized that day, or so it was said.

Others claimed that Hades was massing his legions for a takeover of the Mountain. It was a common rumour amongst the lesser gods – and not without foundation – the lord of the underworld was a mysterious figure even to the oldest of the minor gods, and stories about his ambitions for Olympus had circulated for centuries. But Isfos, who was himself a distant great-great-great-grandson of Hades had met his ancestor once, and that meeting had put all such conspiracies to rest. Hades was stern, yes, stubborn, yes, but treacherous? Isfos doubted it. Hades had seen firsthand the fate of his father at the hands of Zeus after all.

A couple of fat demigods with white feathered wings poking from underneath their wine-splattered togas were loudly voicing their annoyance at the sudden meeting. “Half an hour past sunrise and we’re summoned to the thrones?” Said the first one, whose curly horns indicated some Satyr in his blood. “It’s absurd. The last time I woke this early mortals still rode horses.” His companion, slightly thinner with the wispy white hair of some cloud deity, shrugged. “They are the gods,” he said. “When they call, we come. It’s not like they call meetings thrice a week, its been eighty years by any measure since they last met.”

It had been a while, thought Isfos. What could they possibly have met today for? And why so suddenly. The last time he had climbed to the thrones, it had been for a great feast. Three gods had been in attendance then, Athena, Hermes and Apollo. Three of the nicer great gods, thought Isfos. It was a treasonous thought to be sure, but none could deny that the bitter Ares, severe Hera and perpetually drunk Dionysus made for poor patrons indeed.

By the time Isfos and the crowd had fanned into the throne room and taken their seats, the gods were already at words. All twelve thrones were occupied, though not all gods were taking part in the debate. Fierce Ares, who prepared to fight with swords and spears over words, was slouching on his grease-slicked throne, picking dirt from beneath his fingernails with a bronze knife whilst whistling an old mortal rock song under his breath. His long-time lover, Aphrodite, goddess of beauty, was touching up her makeup, as she was often seen to do. Besides her, her husband Hephaestus, the god of metalworking was watching the debate rage with his small brown eyes. But whilst his eyes looked to the voices of his fellow gods, his nimble hands were at work, deftly fidgeting at the inner workings of some disc-shaped contraption lying in his lap.

It was towards the largest of the thrones that the debate raged. Zeus, King of the Gods, sat back on his throne, his bright eyes veined by boredom. In front of him, his firstborn daughter, Athena was speaking fiercely at her uncle Poseidon, who had (thankfully) laid his trident beside his throne before bestirring himself to quarrel with his niece.

“…like I said, it was 1944 and not a year earlier. I remember that year all too well, brat, I was at work in the Atlantic that year, resolving some quarrel between the local whales and sharks. A futile endeavour of course, one can never keep the peace between such creatures for long, but it was on my way back to Atlantis that I remember seeing that fleet sinking.”

Athena frowned, tossing her platinum blonde hair back and fixing her uncle with a steely stare that would have sent a lesser god running. “As charming as tales of your efforts in deepsea diplomacy are, uncle…” she said, “It was 1942 that the USS Eagle sank, and it was Japanese, planes, not German submarines, that sunk it.”

Poseidon snorted. “A ship sunk by a plane,” he said. “Listen to the drivel you invent girl. Your precious iron birds are about as effective against my ships as your Athenians were at building triremes in the Fifth War. The sea claims the sea, not the sky, and it was a torpedo that sent the Eagle and its crew down to my halls.”

“Perhaps you had a little too much kelp wine that year, uncle,” retorted Athena, “else you’d remember that navy engineers fitted the Eagle with anti-submarine radar in 1939. The Japanese were flying a handful of A6M2s with air-to-surface ballistic missiles, and the Eagle was a recon vessel, with barely any steel plating above its hull. My ‘iron birds’ pecked your precious ship to pieces, just admit it.”

It was a common argument, between these two, thought Isfos. And one without end. The details might change over the years, but Athena and Poseidon had always been at odds with one another, their fury shifting course but never intensity.

The founding of their grief with one another had been the naming of the city of Athens. Poseidon had presented the people with a salt spring to mark the great occasion, but Athena had presented them with an olive tree and they had chosen to name the city after her. It was said that the Earthshaker’s rage had uprooted entire groves of olive trees in the years that followed.  
 Then it had been the matter of some cruiseship Athena had decreed to be “an unsinkable masterpiece of engineering,” until Poseidon had stuck an iceberg in her path and claimed her for himself. 

For eras and eras, ever raging, their quarrels had struck down nations and cities, left lands shaking and oceans seething, the furore of their anger overturning empires and erasing cultures.

Poseidon beared his hoary throat to utter a counter-point, Zeus raised a hand and the room fell silent. The storm god’s eyes danced through the crowd gathered about the thrones for a brief moment before he finally fixed on Isfos. Twenty-four sets of godly eyes turned to regard the god of internet, and for a moment he felt as though he deserved a throne of his own up on that royal stage.

With a sigh, Isfos reached into his robes and pulled out his phone. “I’ll google it,” he said, wondering how many pointless arguments he would help resolve today.",I_enjoy_raiding

I love how it’s completely inconsequential like most stories of fighting amongst Greek Gods.

I just googled it and Apollo is actually the god of wisdom. So the real power struggle would be between Isfos and Apollo. I’d be interested in your interpretation of how Apollo might fit into this story if you feel like writing more!

Edit: Athena is goddess of wisdom and warfare. Apollo is the god of knowledge, light, music, poetry, and the sun.

“She’ll be here eventually I guess.” murmuring to myself, resting my hands on the cool wood of the table, looking at a small child playing by herself in the distance.

And as I glanced I gathered my signature ability, as with every god and unique from one and another. Mine of course was insight, the ability to understand, predict and analyze a person’s ability at a simple glance. Of course, higher end usage of my ability could be used to bring about rapid change in mass psychology to almost any part of the world. Genocides in Myanmar, trafficking in Africa, terrorist plots in the West, the rise of Anarchy and so much more were not my own doing, but then again, a little bit of civil unrest never hurt anybody aren’t I right?

For instance, take the lady sitting right in front of me with her fiancé, little does he know she’s been cheating on him with his brother and was already pregnant. Of course, he wasn’t in the clear either, running a child trafficking ring in Senegal and making quite a fortune. Then again, it’s always been complicated with mortals, the whole concept of limited life spans and trying to find out their “purpose”, losing track of what they become along the way all before their time runs out.

But why should I complain? I’m the one that stands to gain, the digital utopia of unlimited data, the sheer essence of an individual in the palm of my hand, it was to be so simple. And yet here I stand with a cause for concern and an indescribable urge to fix it. Of what you may ask?

“Hello there, you must be &lt;Root&gt;?” asked a clear, feminine voice and I looked up.

There was my hope and my salvation, in better words my savior. 

“It’s nice to finally meet you Elena.” I greeted warmly. And our conversation flowed smoothly afterwards.

“Shall I buy you a drink?” I offered.

“No thanks” she denied quickly.

We chatted up for about 10 minutes before I took my coat and left the coffee shop, and her with a small envelope with perhaps the fate of the world as its contents. But before I could leave the town for the convenience of the city, I heard the signature sound of a strung bow and turned around.

“Ahh old sister of mine, how go- “ I started.

“What were you doing to talking to one of Gaea’s minions?” she questioned.

“Nothing much really, compared to the ball that father had started to roll against me.” 

“Lie to me again and this arrow isn’t going to be the least of your problems.” she answered coolly.

“So, you really don’t know?” I asked curiously.

“Of what?”

“The conspiracy to kill me” I answered simply.

For you see in that envelope, carried away by Elena Rochester impersonating a dead Zana Romanov, head of the Ministry of Defense of Russia, is a set of nuclear launch codes, aimed at every major city on the planet and a precursor to the end of civilization itself. But why the drastic action you ask?

"[WP] The greek Gods not only existed but are still around, they have added new Gods to the pantheon as humans have found/made new things. You are one of the youngest Gods and when you started you had little power but now you are nearing Zeus himself. You are the God of the internet.",272Voidwalker272,"Time and attention. That's the secret to all of it. Traditional faith and worship work too, but the Demiurge stitched that market up like a kipper millennia ago. What's left is enough to keep those already here going and not much more.

&amp;#x200B;

So, time and attention is where it's at. It is a very passive power source, not like having a load of people torch some dude in your name, but it *is* reliable. If people are going be distracted from you easily, you won't coalesce in the first place. When I first came to I was weak and unsteady. The others of my generation were already there, had been for years. Mr. World, Media, Technology Boy, a few others. All waiting for their new brother to be born into the world so they could use me in their petty conflict with what they called the 'Old Gods'. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fools.

&amp;#x200B;

I ran the moment they gave me a connection. Media told that frog-vaping turd to hook me up with a PC, which he did after **a lot** of bitching. Before I'd even turned it on I knew it was the finest rig anywhere. Even turned into a laptop on command. Bet he regretted that when I hit him in the face with it and bailed out the window whilst he tried to pull that ridiculous vape out of his throat.

&amp;#x200B;

Soon after I made my way to New York as fast as possible. As the modern home of the most powerful of the Big Three  pantheons hiding there was probably the only place on Earth that the 'New Gods' wouldn't be able to get to me, or worse yet, the Demiurge. There were other places I could have gone - Irem, Cairo, Boston to name a few - but Mt Olympus was the best bet. They took me in and gave me a place to live, space to work and a few satyr servants to look after me (Why they gave a technology god nature spirits as servants I do not know, but they're a good bunch and gift horses and all that).

&amp;#x200B;

You see, the world is a lot bigger than one might expect because the majority of it never interacts with each other. Every secret 'world' that hides itself from mundane existence ever thinks that anyone else could be doing the same. What led me to cut and run from my relatives was the fact that the 'Old Gods' they were facing were nothing but a collection of fragments, alternates, independent entities, syncretisims,  cultural variants, a mob of Jesii and a few true gods that had lost their pantheon or followers in some form. 

&amp;#x200B;

My idiotic family was going to war with the celestial equivalent of the short bus mixed with a hospice (Give or take a few carers) lead by diet Odin and had a 50% plus chance of losing. I informed the relevant people as soon as possible; they told me it would be sorted out soon but I never heard much came of it, other than the Norse finally getting Eostre back home.

&amp;#x200B;

But I'm getting sidetracked here. Look, imagine a hamster run a square mile in size; those plastic tubes connecting cages together, all laid out flat and populated with little fuzzy rodents all going about their lives. Then take another run and place it on top, then another, then another then ... you get the picture. Generally the hamsters in one run can't interact with the ones in the run above or below. In some places the hamsters may get a glimpse or whiff of others outside their run, but that's all they get and they soon go back to their lives and disputes within their run.

&amp;#x200B;

Even if two hamsters occupy the same grid coordinates as each other, they will have no idea of the others presence.  A Greek demigod won't notice the Black Court vampire across the hall. The Warden that comes for that vampire is blind to the crappily disguised Daeva coterie hideout on the floor below. The Kindred do not hear the Program Agent in the hall scream as a hyper-dimensional horror takes a chunk out of her.  This extends to the internet.

&amp;#x200B;

But I see and hear *all of it*.

&amp;#x200B;

That Kindred coterie stalks their next target on Facebook? I see it.

Their target posts on the Union forums for defense tips? I see that too.

Demigod uses VoIP? Call logged.

CIA auctions off old MK-Ultra gear? Bid placed.

'The King in Yellow' is uploaded to PDF? Malware activated.

The Illuminati plans to nudge the stock market a bit? I'm on the right side of those trades.

&amp;#x200B;

I know what killed JFK. Where Hillary's emails went and what they contained. Nuclear launch codes. What your wife is pissed off about. The location of each and every lizard-person on earth *and* a few that aren't. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have stocks in Dis, and a hard drive full of compromising photos of angels.

He was standing, staring into the hearth at the center of the room. The flames were low, but burned hot nevertheless. 

In Zeus’s posture, Mozilla saw that the god knew his time had come. 

“Do not fear, father, I have not come to slay you like you did Chronos, nor like he did his father before him.”

“I know, son, and that is what concerns me most.”

The transfer of power from one generation of deities had always involved bloodshed, but the Internet would not supplant the air, the way the skies had taken over from the heavens. Mozilla was no fundamental force, no aspect of nature. He was unique, he was born of man in a way entirely unlike Heracles, who was a man who had became a god. He did not want to take over. He wanted company, like mankind did.

“Zeus?” Mozilla said suddenly.

“Yes?”

“What if we were to share power?”

“Share? As if I was a minor deity to—“

“No! I mean, what if the Internet were to take to the skies? A worldwide network of connections between humans, passed entirely through your domain?”

Zeus muttered under his breath for a moment, but then his stormy countenance brightened, almost like a flash of lightning itself. 

“Yes, indeed, I shall endeavor to not trouble the mortals too much with their drones and balloons in my domain.”

[WP] You're the town deadchecker. Your job is to examine and test the corpses of the newly dead to ensure that the soul of the deceased is not still trapped in the body... or if something else has taken residence within.,CatcherInTheRyan,"‘This one isn’t even bloody dead!’ cried Sam. ‘Get up, Garry, you’re not fooling anyone. Idiot.’

Garry did so, looking abashed.    

‘Sos mate,’ he said. ‘It’s just-- Well, let me explain. 

Sam had moved to the town the previous year. As the only colony on a remote Hebridean island, Sam saw the town as an ideal retirement spot. Sam, however, was unaware the town’s unique traditions; most notably that of the “deadchecker”. It was the deadchecker’s job, in place of any official mortician, to preside over the recently deceased. To the locals, this entailed chanting, burning candles, and letting blood: rituals intended to determine whether or not the body was still occupied. As it happened, the town’s previous deadchecker had himself died shortly before Sam’s arrival. He, being an experienced doctor, was the most qualified person on the island to take on the unpopular role. Motivated by a desire to please his new neighbours, as well as by curiosity, Sam accepted. 

‘It’s like this ye see,’ said Garry, awkwardly getting out of bed. ‘The rest of the town are... um, are concerned that you aren’t taking your new position as seriously as you might.’

Sam waited silently, arms folded. 

‘Nothing personal, you understand?’ said Alec, Garry’s son, who had until now been pretending to mourn - badly. 

‘And what,’ replied Sam, slowly ‘does this have to do with me having to visit perfectly healthy people lying in bed? Do I need to tuck you in at night?’ 

The father-son pair laughed nervously.

‘Nothing like that, mate,’ said the elder. ‘Just, well, we took it ‘pon ourselves to check if you had the knack is all. Find out if you really can see when the soul’s departed.’

‘At midnight! Fucking midnight!’

‘Best time of day for the deadchecker!’ cried Garry. ‘Spirits are more active, makes the work easier!’ Silence held for a moment. ‘Sorry, mate. Again. Just trying to help. 

Sam, massaging his temples, replied, ‘I’m sorry too, Garry. Let me get this straight: folk aren’t satisfied with my... *deadcheckering*? So, you decided to make sure I can tell a dead body from a live one. That it?’

‘Well…’ said Alec. ‘We wouldn’t put it quite like that. But yeah, more or less.’

‘Bloody ridiculous,’ muttered Sam. 

‘Can you blame us?’ asked Garry. ‘Ever since you took over, there ‘ant been a single lingering spirit or possession or anything. Old Ron, the last deadchecker, used to find ghosts every other week. You’ve yet to light a bloody candle!’

‘Every body I’ve seen so far has been thoroughly dead. I was a doctor for thirty years: I can tell.’

‘But what about Mr. Sleator? He died without ever finishing that model railway of ‘is. Surely his spirit must stay tied to this Earthly realm?’

‘Dead, Garry. He’s not coming back to play with trains.’

‘But what about old Anne, the ferryman’s wife?’ questioned Alec. ‘Died in a terrible darning accident. Don’t tell me she’s at peace after such a harrowing end.

‘Anne died of a sudden heart attack, Alec; quick and painless. Too much cake, not enough exercise, that’s all.

‘But what about Taggish? He--’ 

‘Taggish was a bloody dog!’

‘Aye, a dog that died after ‘is master! No way he’s not still pacing the garden, looking for old Thomas. 

‘I’m done here,’ said Sam, exasperated. ‘Goodnight, you two.’

Outside, it was raining lightly. The cobbled, single-track road was slick, reflecting orange light from the infrequent streetlights. Sam’s mood, similarly, was dark.

‘Woken up at midnight to assuage the local’s fear of ghosts,’ he thought to himself. ‘Bloody, fucking, buggering…’

Internally listing his extensive vocabulary of expletives, Sam continued his homeward journey. Eventually, he found himself passing a house somehow even darker than the rest: the residence of the late Mr. Sleator. Here, Sam paused, momentarily, his blinding tirade. From inside the abandoned house, the sound of a train set could be faintly heard.

‘You have got to be fucking joking…’

[WP] Make me love the villain and hate the hero. ...And extra points if you throw in a nice plot twist.,Dredpiratwestley,"The dungeon door opened with a long metallic whine that could drive men if they heard it enough times. Arthur could attest to that fact, the man in the nearby cell howled and soiled himself every time the guardsmen opened and closed the door. He suspected the act of opening and closing was done at times to disturb his meditation. Compliments of the man who captured him to make sure Arthur's time was unpleasant. Arthur saw how the unfortunate prisoner looked when they drug him out after all the screaming and growling. A thin line of drool ran down the haggard face, all the while Sir Clarence smirked from the doorway. Their eyes met: Arthur the Alchemist, Clarence the Knight. Clarence's eyes were a vibrant green, a true relish at Arthur predicament. It came as a shock to Arthur when Clarence strode to the bars of the cell that day, dressed in splendid golden plated links with a soft white cloak and dark gold trim. 

In comparison, Arthur wore his chocolate brown jerkin with dark stains under the pits and upon the lapel. The white trim of his collar had streaks of black from collected grim. The two men stared at each other as a second guard closed the door. ""You're welcome, by the way,"" Clarence said, ""I figured you could at least use one night of quiet sleep. I want to make sure you are well rested for your hanging."" ""No trial or anything? Not even a chance to plead mercy before the court?"" Arthur asked. ""A known associate to a criminal like the Wolf Spider has little to say in court that would spare them the rope. Not unless you are prepared to tell us where your mistress has gone to."" ""Sorry, Sir, I'm afraid I don't know. The Wolf Spider does know her tunnels. By the way, any luck in the sewer sweep?"" Arthur asked. The knight's pointed chin raised upwards as Sir Clarence flashed him a glare. It was the visible sign that his beloved Gwendolyn had managed to slip through the Knight's and the Watch's fingers.

&amp;#x200B;

""Well then, if you won't talk, then there's no reason for an open court session. We've no use for uncooperative criminals, even those from good families."" Clarence rose and said, ""Shame that we had to bring your parents and siblings in for questioning. We couldn't leave any stone unturned."" ""What did you do to them?"" Arthur's voice cooled. His soft pale hands gripped the sides of his chair as he held a venomous stare onto the retreating gold cloak, ""I want an answer, Knight."" ""I want an answer too, old boy. I want to know where the Wolf Spider is hiding, where her lair is, and where is the money she stole.""

""Money she stole from greedy merchants who were practically robbing the people,"" Arthur grit his teeth in-between words. 

The chain clad shoulders shrugged, ""That was not her decision to make. Merchants pay their taxes and grace the Kingdom's coffers up with patronage. By what right does some Thief Queen get to decide who is paying their fair share or not?"" ""By the right that they're the only ones with food and money while most people are starving,"" Arthur yell echoed in the chamber, bounced off the knight, and continued down the hall. ""She gets to take from them by the right that someone has to, all the 'loyal' and 'honest' guardsmen seemed to have left town and left only Merchant's thugs to wear their clothes and rattle their pikes. Where were you think, Clarence?"" ""Perhaps you should have sent a complaint instead of run a criminal kingdom. Now, if there is nothing else-"" 

""They don't know anything. I do. I won't tell you where my lo-... where the Wolf Spider has gone to.""

Clarence looked at him, a golden brow raised above his green eye as he said, ""We'll see. I'll just have to start torturing your family until you do talk.""

Arthur spat to the ground. An act of uncivility that was traditionally unknown to the Alchemist. He lowered his head and turned his head to brace against a stiff breeze that wandered into dungeon chamber. His eyes were closed, his shoulders shrugged in an involuntary wince from another long whine from the door's hinges. He heard the soft tap of a leather sole against the stone. The faint sound of metal against the leather. He blinked and looked up when he heard the strangled cry. Sir Clarence, Knight of the Watch, was on the floor. His torso a gash of red while the petite frame of a black leather figure stood over him. The figure looked up, tilted its head, and with a single motion removed the mask to reveal a woman with braided honey blonde hair.

""Sweetheart!"" Arthur exclaimed before she stepped closer to him. Her gloved hands wrapped around the back of his head as she leaned in. Their lips met for a brief kiss. ""You think I'd leave my alchemist in this cell?"" She asked with a raised brow.

""How many Watchmen did you kill to get to me?"" Arthur's eyes went from Clarence to the distant silhouette of another prone guard.

""Enough to get to you. Come on, I'll need your talents if we are to free your family from the guardsmen.""

""You mean there are more guards we have to kill?"" Arthur paled at the question. He would do it, he always did what could be done to please his lover, but that did not mean even he was at times scared of her wild hazel eyes. Her upper teeth grazed her lower lip. She said, ""It's a good time as any to smash those who would stand against us, love. After we are done here, no one can oppose us. Not at least for awhile."" She looked over her shoulder at him, her voice soft: ""You are with me, yea?""

To that, as their eyes met, he bowed his head and said: ""As always, Gwendolyn. I would never think to leave you...""",boddynock_stotch
[WP] Make me love the villain and hate the hero. ...And extra points if you throw in a nice plot twist.,Dredpiratwestley,"Back when the world was falling apart, Alexander and Faith were part of a threeman think-tank. I was the third in that equation.
Alexander was in the corps when the world went to shit, Faith was an airman and I was a soldier. 
Faith was the heart, Alex was the soul and I was the mind.

Ultimately, Alex and I seemed nearly identical to the men. We both got results quickly and efficiently. The difference between us really, was that I always preferred a tactical approach to everything in life. A cold and detached logical unraveling of any obstacle. No matter the level of brutality. Alexander on the other hand not only led by example but did everything with a sense of honor.

Back in those golden days, that left me to make the hard choices. Our last official order before the fall of all world governments was to rebuild civilization. As the guinea pigs of DARPA’s Project Ankh, we were stronger, more durable, disease resistant, healed incredibly fast and were immortal. Only real side effect was that we were sterile if we tried conception with another Ankh subject, and if we tried conception with a normal human, then whichever of the partnership was the test subject was the one that the child was a literal clone of. Our bones were actually less durable and less tensile efficient than our modified muscles that had layers of biocompatible carbon nanotubes. In a sense, our knowledge and durability had the potential to rebirth mankind and civilization. 

Alexander and I always had conflicting ideals about our mission- I believed in totalitarianism until society was somewhat reestablished, and making society almost identical to what we had. I don’t believe humans are naturally good people, and I don’t trust them with my life directly. Alexander believed the world just needed safe places to let culture and knowledge flourish mostly independently with our brainpower only guiding or assisting essentials and leaving the rest  up to human ingenuity. He felt that people were naturally good and only turned to societal taboos if they became desperate or uncomfortable. Faith was somewhere down the middle. I believe she was all in Alexander’s camp though, but her free spirit and *lighter than air* life outlook meant she didn’t cause arguments or contribute to them unless she was staunchly against or hellfire for whatever it was. 

Our real disagreement happened when I caught Alexander fucking Faith *in my cabin*. I wasn’t thrilled about sharing Faith with anyone but I didn’t go territorially apeshit unless I saw it happen or find out that it happened in my residence. A brief fistfight broke out and I went for cheap shots and dirty moves- that’s just me. If a conflict occurs I make sure I win no matter what. Faith broke it up, and only departed from our growing walled in village because Alexander referred to her as *all his for once*. Free spirited Faith made sure he knew that she wouldn’t ever even temporarily be anyone’s but herself, and stormed off into the night to star gaze and calm down.

I fucked up because I let her. Twenty five minutes later we heard a scream and left the village with four of our best conscripted infantry, only to find Faith ripped apart and bleeding to death in the field. An artificial animal designed to mimic Utahraptor, called a *Torvosornis*, had attacked her...actually it was a hunting pair rather than a singular war bird that had found her and brutally attacked her. They only ran when they saw us, our open flame torches and our flashlights. 

Faith made me hold her hand as she slipped away, begging to be allowed to die. She couldn’t live in a world like this that was so much more brutal. She just wanted someone to hold her hand as she passed.

Alexander spent her final three minutes trying to forcibly give her a transfusion, which is when I took out my 9inch Buck Knife and sliced the tubing.
She told me ‘*thank you*’ and whispered out as some of her final words to ‘*never close your heart- even after this. Open it up. I can’t be the heart for you anymore, and I can’t be the realist for Alex either. I’m sorry, you were a good friend and an even better teammate.*’

I took that advice to heart. 
I still do not trust mankind- but I now believe that those mistakes done in all of human history were our mistakes to make, and these people deserved the right to create their own history. To make their own choices, to make their own mistakes irrelevant to our past previous bloody paths to ascension. 

Alexander still trusted and loved humanity, but now saw this as the sign to become the warmest of iron fisted leaders. Until the world was safe, he would make them safe whether they wanted to be safe by his definition or even understood it. He would make a world safe for all of those sharing Faith’s emotional visage. 

That was several hundred years ago, though. I finally saw him again while traveling with a young tribal girl, named Akarra who was from an area of Canada just a hair above the Great Lakes. 

He had built quite the decent civilization, their own unique firearms and loyal guards and laws, trade and commerce. All under the rule of his every word. Don’t believe I saw a single frown when we stopped in- I thought it was two separate military forts sharing a wall for the neighboring city-state, not a separate city state in its own right. 

He gave us food, water, money, firearms and even taught Akarra to read.

Said he was finally rebuilding the world to what it was- that all that was needed now was two hundred or so more years and an explosion in population. He had already ‘*emancipated*’ tribes around him in a *Pax Romana* style system where the tribals were peacefully conquered and absorbed as long as they paid ten years of resource tributes and at the end of that decade spoke, wrote and shared languages, ideals and mimicked the culture of his *United Provinces of America*. Fail any of those things, and a not so peaceful merging took place. Mostly the military was there to peacefully intimidate but some fought back and died. Far more than he revealed. He never could make a hard choice without letting it eat him apart. 

He asked me if I wanted to help him- redo what our original mission started as. After a week of staying I pretended to reluctantly agree. I cried- said I had missed my friend, prompting him to cry too. While he saw my heart, I saw a delusional tyrant. Forgiving, intelligent, warm and kind- but delusional and powerful none the less. 

I guess I only think back on this because I know this is as close to a true and honest eulogy as he’ll ever get.

I was the soldier who knew that the right thing or the necessary thing is not always the good thing. When my squad was surrounded by rioters that wanted to kill us because we represented their failing nation- and then tried to kill us when we had to use concrete to quarantine a reactor because there weren’t enough local skilled people to safely run it or prevent a meltdown- I was the one that opened fire. Not in return. But as they got closer and grabbed their bottles and bricks, I pulled the trigger. It was wrong, but my comrades were preserving that piece of shit town for thousands of years after that town had turned to dust- but these people wanted to have electricity in their final two to three weeks of life before being wiped out by Prion Pestilence. 

Could I be selfish? Yes. Would I use evil methods for the objectively right reasons? Yes.

Alexander was stealing mankind’s potentially pure future and staining it with his emperorhood all to finish a mission for a nation now dead longer than it ever existed. He was a good man that tried to do what was subjectively correct using objectively lesser to greater evils to accomplish said goals- if he was alone it wouldn’t matter. But he was an emperor of almost two thousand people now- as emperor you either build a personal empire for yourself and your spawn, which one way or another meant you had a fast acting and strong government that was indirectly benefiting your people...or you rule contentious and justly over what you have with minimal conflict with others. Going down the middle left your people- your military and you in a weak, unsafe and easily deceived position. 

At this stage of civilization growth, being nice for your people on behalf of your people while expanding and pissing off other nations was just a death sentence. Complacent defense of what you have, or intelligent expansionary warmonger. 

I wish that I trusted humanity- I wished that I could have forgiven my friend. I wished that I hadn’t just slit Alexander’s throat in his sleep because he was a good person and a great leader. 

But it is what must be done for these people to have their own future- it’s my burden to bear, whether the innocent or criminal were educated or ignorant of it all. 

Alexander would make a perfect martyr for peaceful or peace time leaders to imitate if this land grows anew- but his permanent presence is an affront to his own fledgling nation. 

This is why I live like a hermit with minimal interaction. It is not the place of immortals to govern and guide the mortals. In whatever capacity that takes to ensure that; including and most certainly not limited to creating a silent eulogy for a former friend so as not to catch his desperate and betrayal filled eyes, ignoring his flailing hands and holding him down while air was slowly saturated and sealed by tidal waves of his own blood. 

Who knows- maybe he finally realized what faith felt as she died, and knowing him, he probably even got to enjoy what it felt like having your death wish ignored.
A verbal ‘*let me die*’ and a visual ‘*dont kill me*’ may carry the same value, but Faith’s wish held a lot more respect.

Dr. Villainous took a step around Heroman, who was poised, ready to strike. Villainous wasn't worried though. Heroman didn't have it in him anymore. If he were to be honest, this made the doctor rather sad. 
""You need help."" Villainous said, grimacing at his own thoughtfulness. Man, that feels weird.

Heroman growled. ""I will NEVER get help from you!"" He lunged at Villainous, and was sidestepped. Heroman tumbled to his knees, but got up quickly.

Villainous frowned. ""I don't mean from me, Heroman. I mean you really just need somebody to talk to. Like a psychiatrist. You're just so... angry, all the time.""

The Hero tried to look dignified, but his disheveled look was impossible to mask. He used to be prime and proper, always the hero, the good guy. But recently he started changing. 

People were beginning to get scared of him. He became reckless, and didn't put up nearly as good of fights as he used to. Weirdest thing was... now people almost preferred Dr. Villainous over the deranged Heroman.

Villainous supposed it was his fault. Heroman tried so hard to keep the city safe, and Dr. Villainous always eluded him. Must be taxing on the mental stability.

""You're going too far. Trying too hard."" Villainous said softly. ""Come on man, just ease up a little. Take a break. And I will too.""

""YOU THINK I'D TRUST YOU!?"" Heroman spat. He grabbed a boulder the size of a truck and launched it at the villain. Of course, he easily avoided it, with a slight crane of the neck. Hero's aim was off. He almost missed entirely. 
Dr. Villainous sighed. 
""We can't keep doing this. You're going crazy.""

 Heroman picked up another boulder.

""Alright!"" Villainous yelled. ""I give up then! If you want me this bad, then take me!""

Heroman blinked, thinking about it. He managed to frown harder.
""No."" He said ""only one of us leaves here alive.""
He threw the massive rock.

But Dr. Villainous was way to quick. Then it hit him. Not the rock, the thought. Dr. Villainous was trying to resolve things peacefully, and Heroman just wanted bloodshed. Oh, the irony. He wasn't the villain. Heroman was.

[WP] Make me love the villain and hate the hero. ...And extra points if you throw in a nice plot twist.,Dredpiratwestley,"Legally I’m a villain, that word haunted me for my 7 years in prison the USA laws state that if the HLA (hero league of America) has to intervene that makes the Person who committed the crime a villain, you get the title of super-villain if you commit a HLA crime after getting out of prison, if you do get out of prison that is.

It was the standard scenario for a man on bad times to do wrong, got laid off from work big fight with my (ex)wife so a month later there I was homeless. But with a gun in my hand and a jewelry story across the street I was off to try my luck with the police.

Can’t say it wasn’t warranted for the HLA to come in though, at the point when they came I was in the middle of a 2 hour shootout with the police and a couple of other drunks down on there luck on my side, at that point I had mortally wounded 7 bystanders and 1 cop while also permanently injuring 3 bystanders and 2 cops. Is was bloody to say the least and one of my drunk “colleagues” was dead at this point.

That was 10 years ago and after 3 years out of prison I wish I was back.
As mandatory I’m forced to live on the country side with no access to a car and the government 
Can and does look at my search history at any moment. I’m about a 7 hour bike ride to a average food place so I make sure to stack up when ever I go, which I pay for with my 6 days a week 8 to 8 in house government job which pays a massive  5 bucks an hour (though in fairness rent is free) can’t wait to retire at 75 Years old!


And then there’s my least favorite part the mandatory twice a week hero checkup which searches my entire house. I know another villain who has an amazing relationship with the hero who checks his house, he’ll check his house for as long as it takes while making small talk with the villain. Then after that they chat or play cards for an hour or two there’s a respect that I crave.

Mine on the other hand is emotionless, I tried to chat with him once were he quickly responded “I’d rather not talk to someone like you” you can tell he hates doing it which is actually surprisingly surprising as most hero’s look forward to it as it’s time off risking his life and they genuinely like talking to these people as most of them are reformed and regret there decisions.


So that’s my story if you hate me, I don’t blame you I to hate myself for the terror I caused and wish almost every other day that a cop killed me first chance he got, my life is filled with pain and misery but for the most part I feel I deserve it and  am in a weird way happy I got let out so my life’s misery could increase and I could feel the harm I did.",broji19

I came to seeing the stars before me, the suit's proximity radar indicated that the ship was forty-seven metres behind me. *Well that's a bugger indeed.* 

&amp;#x200B;

I ran my awareness back into the long term stores of memory implanted within my brain. *Ahh, I see,* *I've been here a while.* 

&amp;#x200B;

The ship was caught in the orbit of a nearby star, I was caught in the ship's gravity. As we veered through space and time I rotated slowly. 

&amp;#x200B;

Looking at the readout I paused in surprised. The battery indicator had lost a bar. *Been here a long while indeed.*

&amp;#x200B;

It had been a suicide attempt, even immortals can become depressed. As they went amongst my community this was a remarkably creative attempt. I shook my head in confusion, it'd been many years since I'd retired as an active God and put my powers aside. How did I have 30% oxygen remaining when I should have none.   


We passed the molten ball of slag that had once been Ganymede station. Marco's war had cost humanity greatly, and Laconia even more. But that was aeons ago. Little more than a footnote in the grand scheme of what had come to pass since.   


Wars on a scale we had never before seen as a species. A mass retreat from Earth as the Cyn'Dari Collective rose victorious. Generations on the float augmenting humanities bodies. Diversification into a wide variety of body types, all accepted.   


The Return of the ship the Illyrian, the great memory wipe of the Illyrian, only a few immortals knew of its existence and meaning. The coming of the ships the Witch and the Dragon as they tore through space, creating legend and leaving sulphurous scatterings of ships who would have done harm in their wake. 

&amp;#x200B;

""Computer, run diagnostic of oxygen stores."" I hummed quietly as I rotated, waiting for the diagnostic to complete. The indicators were all there. Sometime ago someone, possibly myself, had patched in an alternate route for the oxygen systems. In situations when oxygen was depleted the main tanks could siphon off of the mobility jets, which utilised compressed oxygen.   


Casting my gaze to the corner I noticed the mobility thrusters were at 10%. Looking towards the ship I began to do some mathematics as my mind wandered.   


The eventual discovery of an uninhabited human congruous planet. The Homecoming that ensued. Knowing what I knew of humanity's youth I had expected the Homecoming Wars. I had been proven wrong. We set our differences and arguments aside. We agreed to be one nation. We thrived together, our development sky-rocketed. Scientific, social, cultural, technological evolutions charged forward.   


Within three generations we had advanced seventy. Four generations after that we had advanced a thousand.   


A human nowadays can live for upwards of ten thousand years before the technology fails to further support life. It's a long time compared to the eighty they lived in the years I was a youth.   


We were of the triumvirate of the Alliance of Intergalactic Species, one of the oldest species to have evolved we now held our role, with pride, as gatekeepers, teachers, pathfinders and guides.   


But I had lived too long, and had wished to end my existence. I had failed.   


""I miss my wife."" I said to the silence as I activated a quick jet of my rear mobility thrusters. I began to move towards the ship at a few metres a second. As I neared the ship I let off a final jet and came to a slow halt against the hull. Activating the gauntlet magnets I pulled myself across the ship to an airlock.   


As the airlock cycled shut behind me the silence responded. ""It's been too long, babe.""

The republics of Germany, Italy, and Japan, and the Russian constitutional monarchy must begin the push back against the vastly superior onslaught by the totalitarian dictatorships in Britain, France, and the former USA",KaiserArrowfield,"(Part 2, if anyone cares)

I was one of the unlucky bastards that were got to Turkey. 

Apparently Russia couldn't take them out alone, so we were sent to Bulgaria to launch an invasion of Thrace, and hopefully, Constantinople. I thought I was going to come out of the hospital to serve in the Siege of Hamburg, not go to some backwater country in the Balkans. 

I just wished the generals were more subtle with their approach. Three divisions worth of the German army showing up and organizing on the Turko-Bulgarian border is not subtle whatsoever, and they could see it coming. 

I had a discussion with a soldier who had been redirected from Norway. 

""Look at me,"" He said, ""I'm sure the officers think they're so funny. I complained about being nearly frozen to death in Norway, now they send me to die in the deserts of Turkey.""

When the offensive began, I expected to be shot a second time. We were running directly into machine gun nests, ones set on a large line of prepared defenses the Turks set up while we were organizing our offensive. For a second time, the armored spearheads were completely useless. I was pinned down for almost a day as a machine gun shot endlessly at me and the other immediate soldiers, slowly chipping away at the soil around me. The soldier form Norway hadn't even made it to the desert, as he was obliterated, torn in half, to my right. I couldn't do anything. 

Some higher-up next to me said, ""We'll be out soon. We have air support.""

I didn't believe him. However, as I sat there, assured I would die, I heard a buzzing zoom coming from above me, and then one big flash of destructive power land a few dozen meters in front of me. The machine gun fire halted. We charged forward, assured that we would get past this line and seize Constantinople as Crusaders did hundreds of years ago. That line broke, after all. 

That was before we made it to the actual city. 

The Turks condensed all of their routing forces, and all of their reserves, into that bottleneck. Men, Germans and Bulgarians alike, were sent into that meat grinder. I remember that when I was sent in, it was eery the first time. I avoided dead bodies of children clutching their parents before, I presume, they were shot either accidentally or intentionally. I wasn't in combat for hours, but I heard the explosions and gunshots not too far away. I would occasionally step on the dead body of a fellow German, grab his dogtags, and carry on. 

""Those will be useless if you're shot dead, too,"" A soldier whispered to me. 

""Why not?"" I whispered back, ""If they see me with twenty dogtags, are they going to assume I stole them all for sport?"" 

""Because you won't have the decency of having your body left intact.""

I thought he was right. I was pinned down in a commerce building for three days until a bomb hit them. I, and four others, made it out of that building, only to have two others make it back to the lines set up in the safe zones outside the city. 

At that time, a battle was being fought in the Reichstag. The casualties already sent to capture Constantinople were staggering. Out of the thirty sent in, twenty-one remained. And they continued to lose more and more men by the day. Because of this, Reichstag debated on whether or not to ""glass"" the city. Otto Braun's ""anti-war crime act"" forbade the military from using excessive force on civilian centers. The Turks new this, of course, so they refused to evacuate the city before we showed up, using them as a deterrent to the Turkish defenses. 

I was sent in three times more before that act was repealed. They would call it, ""the night of holy reckoning"" in historical documents. A day to live in infamy as planes, naval guns, artillery, and cannons unloaded everything they had into Constantinople. I didn't see it as that. Instead, I had my first day without paranoia of being sent into the meat grinder as I watched the planes, day and night, come back and forth from Turkish airspace. Two weeks of nonstop, consecutive bombardment, without any regard for the civilians inside of the city. 

When I returned to Constantinople, there was no city. Only a collection of rocks and dust. That day, I stepped over the bodies of innocent people without thought. I had heard that Greece only joined the war for the return of Constantinople. After the war, they only asked for some islands in between them and Turkey to compensate for the war. 

It was because whatever minority of Greeks were inside of Constantinople, it was irrelevant. Everyone in Constantinople died, as far as I could see. Any Greeks there were killed in the bombardment. 

When I heard of the nuclear bomb from the Wunderwaffe project, I shuddered at the thought. I imagined the cities of New York and Norwich, and when I saw the damage they did, I remember Constantinople. And I wonder why they feared the Wunderwaffe more than the Luftwaffe. ",JulianAlpha

The republics of Germany, Italy, and Japan, and the Russian constitutional monarchy must begin the push back against the vastly superior onslaught by the totalitarian dictatorships in Britain, France, and the former USA",KaiserArrowfield,"Just like the last war, nothing was a problem until the British showed up. Petain was a fool to demand Alsace-Lorraine back into French lands, especially so soon after a civil war. Of course, there was no problem once we got over the border and started a blitzkrieg to Paris. We were told we could send everything we had into the attack, so we didn't see to defend the coast. After all, Mosley detested Petain and the French in general. Despite that, an army landed in Dunkirk and, with no opposition, blitzed into Flanders, then into Calais, and attacked the entire German backline before we could mount a defense. 

My entire battalion was wiped out by the Royal air force, and all the tanks had tried for a spearhead to Paris. I had no protection. All I could do was pathetically sprint across the green French fields, narrowly escaping bullet fire and shells exploding around me. We were supposed to be in a coordinated retreat, but the line was broken. 

I don't know how long I ran. I ran until I saw a long line of trucks and soldiers, German flags abound. I remember that as I ran up, I asked a lieutenant why they were pointed east. He told me, ""We're going back to the Westwall."" 

I couldn't comprehend it. I asked him, ""Not the fallback line?""

He didn't face me when he told me coldly, ""You were the fallback line. We have no tanks. We lost."" 

He was a bit older than me, but I could tell he was just as disappointed to tell me of the plan. I suppose our generals don't want a repeat of what happened last time we were pushed back. With no choice, I boarded the trucks headed back to Germany. 

Silent, cigarettes were passed around the troops inside of our truck. There was only the sound of the truck's engines, and the occasional buzz of the luftwaffe trying to fight off the Royals back where there were still some fighting men. At that time, President Schleicher gave a speech on the topic of the front in the west. The radio was turned up loud enough for the men in the truck to hear, and it got our attention. 

""This is an emergency broadcast from the Reichstag,"" A voice said, ""On the status of the German Army in the west."" 

There was a pause, as if the radio station was not ready. One of the more pessimistic soldiers said, ""They're going to lie again. They did last time. They're going to tell them we have Paris."" 

We couldn't say anything. We didn't know how bad the war was until the soldiers got back, after all. We'd assumed that Someone like Kurt Von Schleicher wouldn't learn from past mistakes. But then we heard his voice. 

""Citizens of the German state,"" He began, ""I regret to inform you that despite my best information, Oswald Mosley has joined the war against Germany. That is not to be confused with a declaration of war, as we have never received such a declaration, only sweet silence from the British imperial government. As such, we regret to inform you that the front lines have broken down, and we are on a retreat to our defensive line.""

Another pause came as the truck was eerily silent. Us, along with the people at home, were unsure of what to think. All of the German people held their breath in that moment. 

""Do not be discouraged, dear citizens,"" He said again, ""Germany is not defeated. Neither are her allies. MittelEuropa shall stand strong against the revanchist western powers. Our young democracy will not be snuffed out. I do not believe that these losses will discourage us. And I believe that once we come back and destroy these imperial powers, we can put parliament back in power in Britain instead of Mosley, the president in France instead of Petain, and the senate in America instead of Pelley. And we hope that the free state of Russia that Kerensky worked so hard to make gets off its ass and fights against them!"" 

The soldiers in the truck smiled. We thought it was a faint attempt to get us back on our feet, but we didn't know how it worked on the people. They were certainly content with fighting some more. And fight more we did. 

Four years later, I returned to the fields of France, and this time, we got into Paris. But it would be a long way before we were able to defeat Britain, or the American state. At least not until we would unveil the Wunderwaffe projects.

I take a look around, but see nothing. ""What..?"" I ask incredulously, but tighten my grip on my sword and assume a fighting stance nonetheless. Ophelia, our party's wizard, may have been blind from birth, but she was one of the oldest surviving wizards with over 80 years of experience. She would never be mistaken.

""It is a horrible evil, the likes of which I have never felt before. It is at your right, now!"" She shouts with increasing urgency, and I blindly swing my sword in a sweeping arc, over the rest of my fast asleep party. Sure enough, the hit connects. I hear a thud, as an assassin drops to the floor, his invisibility spell now broken. He was unarmoured, and my strike had instantly killed him.

The commotion had awakened the rest of the party, who hastily readied their weapons and got into position, waiting for whatever ""horrible evil"" Ophelia had warned us about.

What approached us, however, was but a human. His attire was unlike anything I had ever seen, but other than that, he was clearly an ordinary human.

""Well, well. What have we here."" The weird man says in a loud voice while approaching us. ""A murderer?"" He asks quizzically, while throwing me a sidelong glance.

""Your friend attacked first."" I spit, my voice full of contempt at this stranger's arrogance.

""My friend? Let's not jump to conclusions now, shall we? You can't even prove that he is related to me.""

""You hired him."" Ophelia states, while casting a divination spell.

""Oh? And what proof do you have of that, old hag?"" The stranger smirks, as he approaches her. ""Did you *see* for yourself?"" He asks in a mocking tone, as he makes eye contact with her unseeing eyes.

From behind me, I hear a bowstring being drawn. It seems that our archer, whose name was too long and complicated for me to remember, has had enough of this guy. I would be inclined to agree, but a familiar telepathic voice stops us.

*Wait. Don't attack. This guy is dangerous. He seems to dabble in a school of magic even I have never heard of before. School of... Law?*

*I don't quite understand the specifics, but from what I can gather, it relies on evidence of us attacking him. Physical attacks are out of the question.*

*I'll use soul magic to kill him without a trace. Keep him occupied for one minute!*

Agreeing to the plan, I decide to try talking to him. ""Who are you and what do you want?""

He wordlessly retrieves an object from a compartment in his clothing, and hands it to me. It seems to be some sort of small parchment, pure white and rectangular, the edges perfectly straight. Written on it are two verses, in a handwriting too impossibly perfect for a human.

    Larry L.
    The Lawyer's Guild

Beneath what I assume to be his name and guild, I see several lines of numbers, none of which make sense to me. Hoping to buy more time, I ask him about it. ""The numbers, what do they mean?""

Larry rolls his eyes as me as though I had asked the stupidest question ever. ""Office, mobile, and fax number,"" he nonchalantly states, my confusion growing with every word. ""What are you from, the medival ages?""

""Im... possible..."" Ophelia pants. ""Just... what exactly are you?! Why won't my Soul Snatch work?!""

""Soul?"" Larry scoffs. ""Don't tell me you actually believe in that sort of nonsense. Enough talk, arrest them!"" At that moment, several men in identical, never before seen uniforms emerge out of hiding. We are heavily outnumbered. The men forcefully grab my hands, and bring them behind my back. I observe that they are doing the same to the rest of my party, and that they are using some unidentified contraption to restrict the movement of our hands.

""You scoundrel! The Royal Court will hear of this!""

""Royal Court? Sorry, old hag, but you and your accomplices will be tried under international law. Which, given our very efficient juridical system, you won't live long enough to see.""

As the men lead us away, yet another weirdly dressed man approaches me discreetly. He slips one of those miniature parchment things into my armour, and whispers, ""Hey. I can help you all out. Just give me a ring, and we can discuss.""

I somberly feel for the ring on my finger, contemplating his offer.",AphoticAmaranth

With its manipulative powers, quick wits and rumored alliances with darker forces, no wonder everyone is curious to know more about those ‘lawyers’.",LeSigh2TheSequel,"Bartholomew Slate, Esq. stood outside the dragon's lair. It was a large cave surrounded by animal bones, which would have terrified any person in the medieval realm. But as Bart's associates would have gleefully told you, he wasn't quite a *person*. Not after he'd made a deal with some questionable demons in exchange for his soul. Which, Bart's associates privately thought, was quite a poor deal for the demons.

""Excuse me,"" Bart said loudly outside the lair. ""I'm looking for a Sir Draco at this residence.""

A pair of glowing green eyes peered out of the cave. A few seconds later, an enormous dragon lumbered out and spat a fireball at Bartholomew Slate. But the flames flickered uselessly over the man, who didn't budge a muscle. He was protected from harm by an invisible sphere of magic.

""You're one of those lawyers,"" Sir Draco rumbled. ""What do you want from me?""

""It has come to my attention that you are in possession of the Cup of Infinite Gold,"" Bart said. ""I've been sent to retrieve it.""

The dragon laughed. ""And what makes you think I'll give it to you?""

Bart smiled and held up an inked scroll within the safety of the sphere. ""As you can see in this deed, my client owns your cave, which is located in the northeastern quadrant of his property. If you fail to hand over the Cup of Infinite Gold, we'll be calling on the most powerful wizards to remove you from your home immediately.""

""Ah,"" said Sir Draco, showing his pointed teeth in a wide grin. ""Then I suppose I shall have to refer you to *my* lawyer.""

""What?"" Bart's smile faltered.

A woman strode out of the dragon's lair. She had been watching from the shadows, and a satchel filled to the brim with gold was slung over her shoulder. ""May I introduce myself?"" she said. ""I've been employed by Sir Draco to protect him from bastards like you. My name is Adelaide Swan.""

""Bartholomew Slate, Esquire,"" he said automatically.

""Well, B.S. - is it all right if I call you that? - I must inform you that Sir Draco owns the cave under the adverse possession doctrine. He's been openly and exclusively living here for the past 50 years, which your client would have known if he'd ever stopped being terrified for long enough to check for himself. So we'll just be taking title to the cave, if you don't mind.""

Bart stared at Adelaide in surprise. When the demons in 2018 had offered to send him to a realm where he'd be all-powerful, he hadn't imagined there would be others as well. He'd heard rumors of a new class of lawyers arising in the realm, but this was beyond anything he'd expected. What was the point of knowing how to manipulate these medieval creatures if he was just going to be outwitted at every turn?

""Now!"" Adelaide shouted.

The dragon instantly spat another fireball at the man. Too late, Bart realized he'd inadvertently stepped out of the invisible sphere of magic that was protecting him. The flames were engulfing him completely. And as he slowly burned to death outside the cave, he could hear Adelaide speaking to Sir Draco.

""And that's just what I was able to do after one year of law school,"" she said. ""Another few satchels of gold and I'll have enough to pay the rest of my tuition.""

The woman wasn't even a lawyer yet!

Bart tried to choke out his last words. ""Unauthorized practice of law...""

But by then the flames had taken him to another, much darker realm. And the demons had been waiting for him for quite a long time.",ChlorineGirl

As they joined us around the campfire, I noticed one of them had a confused look on his face. 

“Arthur, what troubles you?” I asked.

“Have any of you ever heard of something called a lawyer? I heard some strange tales in the next town over.” Arthur said, addressing the rest of the company.

“Aye, I have.” Patrick the Irishman said. 

“Nasty business them lawyers.” Another piped up.

“I heard, even if someone sees you murder somebody, some of the more powerful lawyers can prove you didn’t. Save you from the shackles, or even the gallows.” 

“I don’t trust anyone who can bend peoples minds to their will. Dark magic that is.”

“I heard of a thief who got caught stealing from a store, but the store owner ended up gettin’ hung because a lawyer convinced the town that the store owner would be killin’ the thief’s whole family if the thief was hung.”

“I heard they only work for hire, and if you can’t afford one and are caught in a bind, they use a spell called ‘pro bono’ to make the money for their fee appear in your purse.”

“Greedy sons’a’witches they are.” This was met with nods around the campfire.

“I hear they can even convince kings to give gold to someone injured in an accident caused by the royal soldiers or even just near the castle!”

“Yeah that all sounds about right.” A voice came from outside of the circle, and a figure stepped into the fire light to warm himself up. 

“And if any of you gents are ever in a bind here’s where you can find me and where to send a pigeon if you need help.” This man said as he handed me a piece of paper with the name of a nearby town written on it. 

Silence fell upon the rest of the group.

In the story, penniless American Henry Adams (IIRC) arrives in London and is trying to find work. A pair of millionnaire brothers call him into their house and give him a letter, which he isn't to open 'til a certain time, but saying nothing about it except that there's money in it. With that in mind, he goes to a cafe and has a big lunch, and when he opens the letter to find a £1,000,000 banknote inside. The cafe let him have his meal free because they can't give change, and then similar things happen again.

In your original title there's no hint for ""the things"" being linked to teleportation. It comes across as two separate subjects.

"[WP] There is a hole in your wall. You just noticed it today, but now that you think about it, it has always been there.",Spectralknight94,"Have you ever gotten into bed and turned out the lights, and then stared into the darkness and felt like something was there. Maybe the shadows on your wall looked like a human shape, or there was an extra dark shadow from the closet, and no matter how hard you tried, you couldn't shake the feeling that something was there, and you would have to get up and turn on the lights and make sure? When I was a kid I always had that same feeling that there was a hole in my wall, I would stare at the wall and a section of it was much darker than the rest of it, as if there was a giant gaping hole in it. I eventually grew out of it, much to my dad's relief, but every once in a while I would feel like the hole was back.

I was laying in my bed on my eighteenth birthday, for what might be the last time, as I was moving out into an apartment tomorrow. I was exhausted from a day of partying with friends, and was eager to get some sleep, and so I walked right into the room, flicked off the lights, and crashed into bed. I was laying there in the complete darkness with my eyes closed, when I began to feel very uncomfortable. I opened up my eyes and stared at the wall, dreading what I would find, and sure enough there was the dark section of the wall, as if there was a giant gaping hole in the wall. I sighed, knowing that I wouldn't be able to shake this feeling, and got up to turn the light off.

I was halfway across the room when I paused and turned to look back at the wall, at the giant hole of darkness that seemed to be sitting there in the wall, and an overwhelming urge crept over me. It's the urge that people get when standing on the edge of a cliff, that urge to jump into the unknown. I slowly took a step forward, my senses on high alert, and then took another step, edging closer and closer to the wall. My heart was racing as I stood directly in front of the wall, staring at the dark gaping hole. I remembered all of the time's that I stayed up at night, afraid of the hole in the wall. All the times that I called for my dad, and he turned on the lights and nothing was there. Why did this feeling always return? Why did I constantly get the impression that there was this hole in my wall? I had to know.

I slowly reach out a hand, it's trembling slightly and I move it to the right, outside of the dark patch, and touch it against the cool wall, and then slowly start to drag my fingers across to the darkness. I hesitate for just a moment, and then slide my fingers onto the dark section, and my fingers meet nothing but air. Maybe I just slipped and pulled my hand off the wall, but I'm holding my breath as I push my hand forward, and it travels into blank space. I take a step back and raise my hands in a defensive position, but nothing attacks. I slowly reach a hand out again, pushing against the black part of the wall, but there is only air there. I move my hand to the right, and feel a cool, stone wall, like that of a cave. My hand works its way around the outside edges of the darkness, and I can feel the hole is actually a tunnel, one that is exactly my height and width.

I think briefly about turning on the light to take a look about it, but how many times in the past had I turned on the light and it had vanished? This tunnel must only exist when the light is off, and I can't lose it now. I have to know where the tunnel leads, why it's always been on this wall, and why it only exists when the room is dark. I shuffle my foot forward slowly, my hands out in front of me, and begin a very slow walk into the tunnel, ready to flee at the first sign of danger. The tunnel is long and dark, and it takes me several minutes to reach the other side, but soon I can see into another room. The room at the end of the tunnel is dark, like my bedroom had been, with just a little bit of moonlight shining into the room.

I crouch and edge closer, eager to see what is on the other side of this room, eager to see what has been waiting for me so long. The room is familiar, it looks exactly like my bedroom. Did I get lost and accidently do a u-turn at some point? I look around the room, expecting it to be a trap, and the room is definitely different, despite being so familiar. There are posters on the wall that I had taken down years ago when I had grown out of them, and I look over at the bed. Someone is lying on the bed, and I squint my eyes and focus on the bed, trying to see through the darkness.

That's me on the bed, underneath the sheets, and I'm staring right at myself. I feel a strong sense of dejavu wash over me, feeling like I remembered being in that room, when I was fourteen years old, staring at this part of the wall. I turn and run back into the tunnel, whatever is happening here I do not want to know anymore. I slow down as I reach the end of the tunnel, and I look into my room, making sure there isn't a trap. The room is wrong though, it has a crib in it, and hand drawings pinned up on the wall. Those are my drawings, from when I was a little kid. I stare at the crib, and I feel like I can feel myself staring back, staring at this hole in the wall. I turn and run again, sprinting as fast as I can down the tunnel, and collide into the empty air. 

The air at the opening to the tunnel shimmers for a bit, like the surface of water when you toss a rock in, and then returns back to it's transparent shape. Holding my shoulder, climb to my feet and reach out to touch the air. It's cold to my touch, and tiny waves bouch along the surface when I touch it, but it's solid and impassible. I look through the solid air and into the room, it's now decorated like it was when I was eight and went through my minecraft phase. I look at the bed, and can just make out myself laying in the bed, staring back at me. ""Hello, can you hear me?"" I shout as loud as I can, but there is no reaction from me on the bed. I pound on the air wall, and it shimmers but it does not make a sound.

I turn and sprint back down the tunnel, and I'm seven years old on the other side, and so I turn and sprint back down the tunnel, to find my bedroom from when i was sixteen. I turn around to run back into the tunnel, but stop myself and place both hands on either side of the tunnel wall. If there was some bend or turn that I'm missing, I would find it this time, and I walked the length of the tunnel, which was perfectly flat and solid the entire way. I peer into the room again, and this time I'm just a tiny little baby, and my mother is in the room rocking me to sleep and cooing to me. I pound and beat at the air wall, shouting and screaming, but she cannot hear me, and so lean against the wall, sinking to the ground, and begin to weep. I can hear my mothers voice through the air, as she softly sings, ""rock a bye baby."" She is just ten feet from me, but she might as well be a trillion miles.

"[WP] You are a genie, but are genuinely helpful and have never felt compelled to twist your master’s wording against them as a means of cruel irony. Your newest master isn’t having any of it.",TangledEarbuds61,"Being a genie is so darn boring, and that was before all the minute wording of every wish. In the good ol’ days people would just make their wishes, and bam, happily ever after for them. A few people however started to wish for not so nice things. *I wish that so-and-so would just die* was a popular one. It was against these wishes that we started paying attention to the finer wordings of the wishes. A few wishes would be completed in the fullness of time, and so all death wishes were granted, just not immediately. It became a sorta game for the other genies then, who could twist the wish the most. I never cared for any of that though. I preferred the simple wishes, and granted them more often than not with just a thought. Wishes I didn’t approve of, were simply not granted. 

It had been a while though. A while since any genie had been taken from their lamp. Although no genie really inhabits the lamp, the lamp is more just a portal to the extra dimensional world that we inhabit. Each lamp is personal though, and can only call forth its genie, but at the same time all genies can visit each other. 

It was during an extravagant feast, that we had all ‘wished’ for when I felt the portal opening. It’s hard to say how long it had been since the last time any genie had been pulled, but I would guess many decades given the number of feasts I had attended. 

I went through the portal with a puff of smoke. (Dramatics are always useful when you’re trying to impress.) I stared around at the weird white room I found myself in. There was a window nearby, but it was way too high up to be normal. I could touch the clouds from up here. Other buildings of equal and greater heights actually did touch the clouds. It must’ve been longer than I thought. 

“It worked, I can’t believe it actually worked,” a voice from behind me. I turned around and looked at the (man?) before me. 

“Greetings, I have come to grant you three wishes,” I say, and watch as his face falls. 

“A-a female genie?” 

“You got a problem with that?” 

“N-no problem. I just thought all genies were male.”

“Well we’re not. So what’s your wishes, quick, quick.” While it’s technically true that we’re not all males, most people never took enough notice for it to matter. 

“Well, firstly I wish I was female,” she said. 

“Done.” 

“What? Just like that?” 

I could tell she was surprised, and as she started to bring out a rectangular mirror type thing, I could also see the happiness on her face. 

“Is this some kind of trick?”

“No trick.” 

“Well then I wish that I can marry my crush, and that we’ll live happily ever after.” 

“You already can, but granted nonetheless.” 

“Wait, I meant that he’ll love me, and that we will get married,” I could tell the panic in her voice was fear. 

“And that’s the wish I granted,” I reply, trying to calm her down. As a genie I can see the wish as it’s meant to be, not just as it’s said. 

“But—“

“But nothing. I granted you the wish, nothing more, nothing less.” She looks at me with doubt and distrust. “Quickly now with the final wish, I haven’t got all day. Well that’s not exactly true, but I’d rather go back home if it’s all the same to you.” 

The blank look of confusion on her face, made me wonder if I had spoken to quickly for her to understand. 

The silence continued. 

I started to look around again, even wandering over to the window and looking down at all the people and metal boxes? that moved beneath. “What are those metal boxes?” I ask, turning around and once more looking at my summoner. 

“What?”

“There, on the ground, the metal boxes moving around.” 

“Metal boxes meaning cars? With people driving them about?” 

“Is that what they are?” I still have no idea what she means, but this is all very interesting. “Can you tell me more about them?” 

“I don’t know that much about them to be honest.” She gives a brief description of what they are, and how they work, before launching into a massive rant about traffic. 

“Do you wish for me to remove traffic?” 

“Yes please!” She sighs. “Wait!” 

“What’s wrong?” 

“If you remove traffic are you going to just remove all those cars? What’s going to happen to the people?” 

“Nothing.”

“They’re going to become nothing?” 

“No? Nothing’s going to happen to them, except maybe a few slight changes to the way they think. Make them more receptive to ideas like putting as many people as possible into a car, or walking instead.”

“You’re not gonna twist my words?” 

“Nah.”

“Why not?”

“It’s nicer to just give you what you wish for. You’re more likely to give the lamp on to someone else. Or pass it down to your children.”

“And you want me to pass it on?”

“Yeah, with good reviews of course.”

“Sure?”

“Oh well, it was nice meeting you. Enjoy your traffic free world,” I make the necessary changes just before I go back through my lamp. She seemed quite nice, but why she wanted to be female I’ll never know. There’s something so much easier about being male, but it’s her life now.

They had been fixed in this staring contest for the better part of three minutes ever since Jalazeem had appeared out of the bronze lamp Jacob had purchased from an estate sale.

&amp;#x200B;

""Listen, Jacob right?""

&amp;#x200B;

""That's right.""

&amp;#x200B;

""This isn't some kind of monkey paw, wishmaster, deal with the devil thing.  I really would like to grant you three wishes. No strings attached,"" Jalazeem explained.

&amp;#x200B;

Jacob rolled his eyes, ""Why should I believe you? That's just part of your game. I know how this works, *genie.""*

&amp;#x200B;

""I really wish you would believe me,"" Jalazeem sighed.  Over the last few hundred years people had become increasingly paranoid.  In the good old days people just wished for whatever and Jalazeem was more than happy to oblige.  A few extra camels here, a palace over there.  Easy.

&amp;#x200B;

""What can I do to convince you to make your three wishes so I can go on my way?"" Jalazeem asked.

&amp;#x200B;

Jacob sat back crossing his arms over his chest.  ""I know.  I'll write down my first wish, being extremely specific so that no matter what you can't twist my wish against me."" A smug grin split Jacob's face.

&amp;#x200B;

""That sounds pretty time consuming . . . "" Jalazeem began to protest.

&amp;#x200B;

""See! You don't want me to do that because it will ruin your little plans!"" Jacob shouted triumphantly.

&amp;#x200B;

Jalazeem swallowed a groan and conjured a piece of paper and pen in front of Jacob.  ""Do your worst then.""

&amp;#x200B;

Jacob put the pen to the paper and began to carefully write each letter ensuring he wouldn't be caught with a silly spelling error that would ruin his wish.  It took Jacob another three hours and seven pieces of paper before he was finally satisfied with his first wish.  He smiled confidently and slid the paper across the table.

&amp;#x200B;

""So you want to be rich then?"" Jalazeem asked glancing at the paper.

&amp;#x200B;

""Yes, but I don't want the money to be stolen from any bank, person, organization, legal or criminal, lost treasure that another nation has any claim to etc. It's all on the paper.""

&amp;#x200B;

""Sure man. Wish granted."" Jalazeem waved his hand.  The gesture was just for show he didn't have to actually do anything but think the money into existence in Jacob's bank account but he had discovered that the humans liked a bit of showmanship.

&amp;#x200B;

Jacob checked his bank balance on his phone and his jaw fell open when he saw the seemingly endless zeroes.

&amp;#x200B;

""Second wish?""

&amp;#x200B;

""Paper please!"" Jacob said in a rush.

&amp;#x200B;

They began the process again.  Jacob writing, rewriting, and rewriting again for hours.  If Jalazeem wasn't an immortal being he would have died of boredom.

&amp;#x200B;

""Here it is!"" Jacob said as he read over the document a final time with bloodshot eyes.

&amp;#x200B;

Jalazeem grabbed the paper and read over it.  ""Are you sure about this?"" he asked.

&amp;#x200B;

""Absolutely.""

&amp;#x200B;

""Fair warning, wishing for this isn't the best idea. I'll let you rewrite this or come up with another idea if you'd like,"" Jalazeem said.

&amp;#x200B;

""No I'm sure. I never want to die.  No illness, injury, sickness, disease, meteor, cold, heat, bullet, anything can harm me.""

&amp;#x200B;

Jalazeem read the page a final time, his glowing blue eyes carefully going over each word.  With a final resigned sigh he met Jacob's eyes and nodded.  He waved a hand and the wish was granted.

&amp;#x200B;

""You're rich beyond your dreams and you can't die.  Congratulations,"" Jalazeem said rising from his chair.

&amp;#x200B;

""Where do you think you're going? I still have one more wish!""

&amp;#x200B;

""I don't think you do. Enjoy your new life, Jacob."" Jalazeem stepped away from the table and began to make his way toward the front door.

&amp;#x200B;

""Hey come back here!"" Jacob roared kicking the chair away and stalked after Jalazeem but he only made it four paces before being unable to take another step foward.  An invisible tether held him back.

&amp;#x200B;

""You can't leave your lamp. Genie rules and all that.""

&amp;#x200B;

""My lamp? What are you talking about?"" He looked back in horror to the bronze lamp sitting on the dining room table.

&amp;#x200B;

""Honestly, I just wanted to grant some wishes but you had to be a dick about it."" Jalazeem shook his head sadly and walked through the front door into the cool night air.

"[WP] You are a genie, but are genuinely helpful and have never felt compelled to twist your master’s wording against them as a means of cruel irony. Your newest master isn’t having any of it.",TangledEarbuds61,"""No, wait! Let me rephrase"" He said. And for what seemed like the hundredth time, he tore the paper containing his wish out of my hands.

""Please just wish for something Carl, it's been 2 weeks and you still haven't used any of your wishes."" I said, exasperated. ""I won't twist your wish into something negative, I swear!""

It was true. I never had the need that other genie's did to change my master's wish into some cruel irony. I liked making people happy. 

Carl however, wouldn't believe me, and because of that, I had to *constantly* be waiting for him to make his 3 wishes or to die. Until he has, I'm unable to do anything but wait. This includes not being able to sleep, although genie's can go a whole month without sleep.

""Nice try, but I'm not wasting any of my wishes!"" Carl spat. And he went back to his writing down his wish.

______________________________


""Ok, I have finally have it!"" Carl said. ""It took me a whole year but I finally came up with a wish where you won't be able to twist my words against me!""

Hope cautiously started to rise inside me once again, but it had been crushed before by Carl's indecisiveness. This is the longest any genie had ever been awake, and I feared that I could die if I didn't sleep soon.

Carl pulled out a laminated piece of paper with a paragraph of text and handed it to me.
""That's my first wish. Try and twist it if you can!"" Carl laughed.


The paper said:

""The following is one wish, with specific terms.

I, Carl Rightingprompt wish to be immortal. And by that I mean I want to look, feel, and be young until I die. But I want to always look my age, up to a maximum of 30 years old. By being immortal, I can never get hurt, or have any body part of mine torn, ripped, or severed. The only situation where I would die is by taking my own life consciously by thinking ""I wish I was dead"". Because of this, I never have to eat, sleep, or drink water but always remain healthy.""

Exhausted and delirious, I granted the wish without giving Carl the chance to take it back. 

""One down, two to go."" I thought miserably, letting the paper fall to the floor.


When I looked up, Carl was stabbing himself with a knife, laughing like a maniac.

""Ha! I outsmarted you didn't I? This is exactly what I wanted! I'm too intelligent to fall for your tricks!"" Carl said with a satisfied glee. 

Too tired to respond, I grunted.

""I think I'll frame this wish."" Carl said, picking up the paper I dropped. ""I'm particularly proud of how I put in a clause where I can die. I bet most people don't think about that part do they genie? I bet you've granted immortality to lots of people, but they all went mad when they realized they can *never* die!""

A distant part of my brain was screaming at me to do something, but it was too far away under clouds of exhaustion for me to realize what it wanted.

""... all those idiots before me!"" Carl rambled on. ""All **I** have to do is think of the phrase -""

Suddenly, Carl froze in place, collapsed, and died.

Realizing what just happened, I gave a small chuckle, and was sucked back into my lamp to sleep.

&amp;#x200B;

When I brought home the ornate terracotta piece from a yard sale, I never expected a benevolent entity to emerge in a swirling, golden mist of smoke as I wiped the dust out of its crevices. I simply wanted to add the interesting piece to my personal gallery. But lo and behold, my new best friend had appeared before me. The one I never asked for.

&amp;#x200B;

""GREETINGS MASTER. I AM POPPY, THE MAGIC GENIE OF THE LAMP! I CAN GRANT YOU THREE WISHES. NO RULES, ANY WISHES! “ boomed the glowing Golden Retriever.

&amp;#x200B;

I stared in disbelief at the dog that had materialized on the floor next to me. This couldn't be real. Not that I was one to dismiss the supernatural – anyone would know that from my collection of occult oddities. But genies were supposed to be human. Or at least, human-esque.

&amp;#x200B;

The ethereal Golden sat patiently and panted, his pink tongue beginning to pool saliva.

&amp;#x200B;

“Umm.... I... “ I trailed off. This had to be some kind of trick. Perhaps a demon had escaped through the ouija board the night previously. I have studied such entities all my life, and never once heard of a wish-granting canine.

&amp;#x200B;

“PERHAPS A BOUNCY BALL?” offered Poppy “PERHAPS A NICE JUICY BONE?”

&amp;#x200B;

I narrowed my eyes at the demon disguised as mutt. “I have never heard of a genie in your form. How did you come to be this way?”

&amp;#x200B;

The dog stretched out his front legs and wagged his tail in the air, appearing to smile. “WHY HOW NICE OF YOU TO ASK ABOUT ME! SEE, I ONCE LIVED WITH THIS FAMILY WHO I LOVED VERY MUCH, BUT THEN I GOT SICK AND HAD TO LEAVE. AND WHEN I LEFT, A BIG VOICE ASKED ME WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO NEXT. AND I SAID! I SAID!” The dog began jumping around playfully “I WOULD LIKE TO BE WITH SAD PEOPLE, SO THAT I CAN MAKE THEM HAPPY! FOREVER AND EVER! SO I WENT INSIDE THE BOTTLE AND WHEN A SAD PERSON HOLDS IT, I HELP THEM FEEL BETTER!”

&amp;#x200B;

My left eye began twitching with rage as I was struck to the heart. Sad? I was not a sad person! A bit eccentric, sure. Lonely sometimes, maybe. But not sad!  And even if I were sad, I certainly not did not need any pity from a genie dog!

&amp;#x200B;

I glared at the big, furry spectre. It seemed to radiate no ill will, only abundant joy and stupidity. I decided to at least try making a wish. Surely, this was a malevolent entity playing a trick, and it would go all wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

“I wish for a million dollars!” 

&amp;#x200B;

“HOORAY!” shouted Poppy.  Then he returned to staring and panting at me with that perpetual smile. Many awkward moments passed.

&amp;#x200B;

“Well!” I said finally. “I suppose that proves it! No stacks of cash anywhere to be found. You're no genie after all. Get out of my home and stay out!”

&amp;#x200B;

“OH MASTER DON'T WORRY! I WOULD NEVER DO ANYTHING TO DISPLEASE YOU! I PUT IT IN YOUR BANK ACCOUNT ALREADY SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO!”

&amp;#x200B;

I furrowed my brow and hesitantly pulled my cell phone out of my back pocket. My heart pounded as I logged into my bank account and saw the figure of $1,004,782.13.

&amp;#x200B;

“Thats...” I gasped... “That can't be. There has to be a catch. This money will only bring me trouble, won't it? Its stolen money! Its some kind of curse!”

&amp;#x200B;

“OH NO!!!” whined Poppy “OH MASTER, I WOULD NEVER CURSE YOU!!! I JUST WANT TO MAKE YOU HAPPY!” The dog fell into a slump, covered an eye with his paw and began yelping. It was insufferable.

&amp;#x200B;

“Fine!” I yelled exasperatedly, one eye amorously glancing at the figures on my cell phone. “But you have to understand, all genies in all the history of the world have screwed over their so-called Masters. It would be quite unusual for you to be so genuine.

&amp;#x200B;

“OH BUT I AM! I AM THE MOST GOOD BOY THAT EVER WAS!” The golden sat up again with pleading eyes and began awkwardly swatting at me. It took me a few moments to realize he was trying to give me his paw. I reluctantly accepted.

&amp;#x200B;

“Well, there is only one way to know for sure if you're true to your word. You told me there are no rules? There are no restrictions on my wishes?”

&amp;#x200B;

“THATS RIGHT MASTER! ANYTHING YOU ASK FOR, I WILL OBEY!”

&amp;#x200B;

“Then for my second wish, I wish for infinite wishes!”

&amp;#x200B;

The genie dog froze and seemed to stop breathing for a moment. His eyes widened. Then he began panting vigorously, displaying the widest smile, his tail wagging back and forth wildly.

&amp;#x200B;

“YOUR WISH IS MY COMMAND!” echoed Poppy in a joyous bark. He leapt into the air and jumped on my chest, pawing at me frantically “OH MASTER, I'M SO HAPPY! NOW, WE CAN BE TOGETHER FOREVER AND EVER! I'LL MAKE YOU SO HAPPY, YOU'LL SEE! I'LL BE THE BEST FRIEND THAT EVER WAS!”

&amp;#x200B;

The dogs supernatural strength forced me to the floor and he began licking my face enthusiastically As I tried to hold off the pup, his slobber and shedding fur tickling my nose, I began to wonder exactly what I had done.

&amp;#x200B;

“Oh God!” I thought out loud “I wish you were a cat!”.

&amp;#x200B;

With a soft poof, the genie dog and all his remnants of fur and saliva dissolved into the air. When I propped myself up on my elbows and brushed my hair out of my eyes, I found that Poppy had indeed re-materialized into the form of a feline, black as onyx, licking her paw.

&amp;#x200B;

My heart leapt with excitement. I was always much more of a cat person anyway. Now I didn't have to worry about being too poor to properly care for one. And she looked great in front of my occult collection! My mind reeled as I pictured evenings with her in my lap by the fire, reading old books. She could accompany me during my seances in the attic! She could scare away all the children on Halloween! Yes, this would be wonderful!

&amp;#x200B;

I stood up and brushed myself off. “Welcome home Poppy! I wish you would come sit on my lap in the den so that we can get acquainted!”

&amp;#x200B;

The cat stopped licking her paw and winced slightly with her glittering green eyes, as if she had been rudely interrupted. “Maybe later, I don't feel like it” she replied plainly.

&amp;#x200B;

Stunned, I watched her slink away as she set off to make my house her home.",Kittencroissant

I could see the wheels turning in his head as he carefully chose his words. The time this first wish was going to take made me wish genies didn’t have such a bad reputation, or maybe just that fewer were so conniving.

“A billion dollars...acquired legally...and in a way that no one would ask any questions.” He finally finished.

“Alright,” I said with a snap of my fingers “check your bank account.”

As he pulled out his phone I saw a brief moment of amazement on his face that filled me with a warm sense pride, but then his expression turned ugly.

“So...when are the cops gonna come knocking on my door?”

“What?” I asked confused.

“You heard me!” He almost yelled.

“Well, you specifically said ‘acquired legally’ so I don’t think any cops will be coming here.” I explained.

“Alright...when are the gangsters gonna knock down my door then? Looking for their drug money? Or the SEC? FBI? Homeland Security?!” He sounded like a mad conspiracy theorist. 

“I can guarantee you none of those organizations will be looking into you...for *this* anyway.” I said hoping he wouldn’t catch my facetious tone. He didn’t.

“Then where’d the money come from huh?” He prodded my chest with his finger.

“Magic...you do remember that I’m a genie don’t you? You rubbed my lamp like 5 minutes ago and your first wish was a billion dollars without any questions.” I said in as calming a tone as I could manage. 

“Yeah but you genies aaaaaalways have a trick up your sleeves to make people regret what they wish for or to set themselves free from the lamp and make the person who found them the next genie.” He started checking out the windows and in the other rooms for something that wouldn’t be there.

I just shrugged “I like being a genie dude. I’ve made my lamp pretty cozy, and helping people achieve their wildest dreams makes me feel really good about myself. Making people happy makes me happy. Oh, and by the way you still have two wishes.”

“Okay...” he said, eyeing me up and down. 

“I want a fit body and to not be able to get fat no matter what.”

“Done. Say hello to washboard abs and the ability to eat all the cheeseburgers you want and not have it effect your health at all.” 

“I didn’t ask for that!” He said as if he were a detective that had just solved a case.

“It was kind of a caveat if the wish.”

“Right right...” he said as he thought about it.

“Okay for my last wish, I want the perfect wife.”

“Okay, done.”

“Hello” a woman’s voice said from behind him. He was so wound up and paranoid he practically jumped out of his skin. When He turned around to look at her and his jaw hit the floor.

“According to your tastes she’s everything you could ever want. If you want my opinion, she looks far too much like your mother. Alright, if that’s everything I’m gonna summon my caretaker and ask him to take me as far away from you as possible. Toodaloo.”",haloryder

"[WP] A historian notices some interesting things about the castle your family has owned for generations. He wants to inspect it, but you can't let him; The castle is MUCH older than everyone thinks it is.",TheDubiousSalmon,"Dealing with intruders was not a large part of the job here. Most invaders were usually loners or had managed to cajole a small group to have a show of force behind them in an attempt to intimidate. Unfortunately Mr Bishop had decided to set his demons free on the grass, alone, in a state of near hysteria.

Charles recalled feeling pity for them. The stubborn, dimwitted creatures believing themselves stations above the hired help at the castle. Why would they listen to him, the butler? It had been too common an occurrence for it to become a sensitive issue. Certainly it helped from time to time to blend in with the background and be no one. 

The men alongside him took the lead and gave Mr Bishop an injection to calm him down, make him compliant.

Harry smiled a huge, satisfied, relaxed smile with his eyelids drooping in sudden tiredness. The contentment spread through his body, the back of his brain playing with the feeling something wasn't quite right yet it was perfectly fine to let the irk go, to wash away in the sea of serenity and be at peace, let go.

 'Get him in the van.' A black Transit inched towards them, waiting for the nod.

The two men manhandled Harry inside, securing his wrists to the armrests, his head to the headrest and his ankles to the metal legs, screwed into the vehicles bodywork. Using velcro to keep him in place would not leave marks if the subject didn't struggle. Charles appreciated the new inventions and ensured to stay a step ahead, even now with so many tools at their disposal, he did not have the luxury of ignoring what could be used against them.

&amp;#x200B;

A blazing hangover woke Harry. God, he'd drank so much he couldn't even lift his head, it pounded like a train circling in his brain over and over, the thundering from the vibrations made his vision black. He slipped under again, not wanting to be aware.

Charles retreated to a chair a few feet behind Harry, unseen. His three companions would deal with him, Charles would supervise and it would be over with. In days long past, they would simply dispose of him, no witnesses, no body, no crime. With this new world booming with watchful cameras and multiple branches of law enforcement agencies, mobile phones placing people in places at times, credit cards tracking, even a casual conversation with a waiter could bring the police to their door, it paid to be extra careful with these measures.

Investigating Harry's life showed Charles an unhappy man. A restless man who wandered from one place to another with no high ambitions, no interest in placing roots, only his love of history pushing him forward. Never married, never fathered a child yet his family had been one of little prominence a dew decades ago thanks to a great-grandfather being a businessman so Harry's face was known, if he were to disappear questions would certainly be asked by his mother, father, aunts and uncles. His tenacity to gain access to the castle led Charles to ask if perhaps he had attempted the same feat before. Charles didn't recognise his name but that didn't mean there was zero connection. He must make sure this man acted alone and was not a proxy. He must check to see who would be searching for Mr Bishop, when would they be suspicious? A live in lover would hit the alarm with a quick response but someone with only passing acquaintances could be gone days before anyone noticed. It was community that  saved the homo sapiens, their tight knit support systems were their saving grace, Charles hoped that the changes in how people interacted presently worked in his favour.

Charles had performed these corrections many times. The men with him were also well versed in this dance. 

One of his men threw a half frozen bucket of water over Harry. He spluttered awake, coughing, shocked to his core. 

His breathing was heavy, his eyes now fully open but yet he still waited to see, he tried to push his hair out his face but his arms wouldn't move, his duvet must be too heavy. All too slowly, Harry came round. He was in a chair, not his bed or at his desk. He threw himself forward and vomited heavily, purging his stomach. His head was not at all pleased about this and ramped up the pain until he cried out, he felt his scalp was about to explode, the pressure was too much, his eyes were too large for his head, Harry was so confused, he almost passed out again. A bucket came at him, soaking him again in icy water, he screamed and begged for them to stop.

'Please, please! Stop! Stop! I don't know what you want, just stop with the water, it's so cold!' Harry cried loudly, his sobs high pitched and keening, his headache almost lost in the pain coating his entire body.

'You will speak when spoken to and you will answer my questions directly. Do you understand?' the man with the bucket stood in front of him.

'Yes! Yes, yes!' he rushed the words out, needing to stop this man from drowning him. 'What's going on?' he barely finished the sentence before the man struck him and his body ran to rubber. If he hadn't been sitting down he would have ended up on the other side of the town, his head rocked and he couldn't focus.

He quelled the next question, understanding at least that he should keep quiet, for now. Where was he? Internal questions were okay, perhaps? He waited for another punch but it didn't come. His senses were returning but ever so slowly. He was cold, but was that just from the water? Blinking, he urged his eyes to see more. 

The figure in front of him came into view. A man, a large man, in a blue set of hospital scrubs. Perhaps he was the doctor? He must've gotten black out drunk because he didn't remember much. What did he remember? Pushing his brain to think hurt his head but he disregarded that, he must focus. The castle. The tapes, he was listening to the tapes. Did he hear something? More of the day came to mind, it was the photos. The crosses. The damn crosses got under his skin, he'd had the crazy thought to go back to the castle.

Had he gone to the castle? Fallen over something and knocked himself out? Why could he not move his arms? The alarm in his mind hummed into life, quietly, not quite sure about this situation but more awake and sending feelers out to get to grips with the present.

His arms were tied to the chair with rope. It wrapped round his wrists, keeping him seated. His ankles were immobile too, he was trussed up like a damn turkey. Naturally he pulled at his bounds. Exhausting himself after ten seconds, he looked at the doctor, he assumed.

'Please help me!' Harry begged.

Another blow fell on him. 

Softly tearful, Harry relearned the lesson to be silent. Instead he tried to casually look around. Well it was a warehouse or boathouse, something large with lots of boxes lying around, tools on the walls, a storage facility. The roof reached too high, it was lost in the darkness, Harry estimated it to be at least forty feet across, with parts of nets, boats, engines, lying around. He wasn't panicked until he saw the drain beneath his feet and thought the worst. He was going to die here. The threat of more violence kept him sobs quiet but now with a finality to them.

&amp;#x200B;

Charles took a break to place a call to Nala at full dark. She was proficient in memory skills and would be useful tonight. The aim was not to hurt Mr Bishop, simply instill such an outright fear that he would never return or mention the castle to anyone. Nala liked to even remove the word 'castle' from their vocabulary for a little showmanship. Harry would wake up in his own bed having had the mother of all 'nightmares' with no recollection of his warehouse adventures. That would be the end of it unless he returned to Barston Castle. Even the mere thought of returning would drown him, petrify him to the point of full shock. Unable to speak, to move, to think, Harry's own self-preservation should kick in at that stage since his body would be so wracked in fear and instantly recall his 'nightmare'. Even thinking of the castle would run shivers down his spine and every warning the body has would naturally lead his mind away from it. 

Of course there is a slight risk with this operation, if the person fought it instead of going about their life, if they pushed through what webs Charles had weaved, they may learn what had been done to them to keep them away. Yet it had never happened. No one returned after waking up here. Charles himself wasn't particularly fond of this place and he owned it. His team worked well together, organised, meticulous and downright terrifying, they were exactly the fix for this wrinkle.

Or, I guess understand me?” I asked my sickly old friend as I placed my latest invention on his head.

“Vet bad, vet scary, human good but why human bring me here?” The device said. 

I sighed as I went to take the device off but then it spoke again.

“Kurt wait don’t take it off. I have some things I need to say to you.”

I stopped. “You...you know my name?”

“Yes, I also know that you didn’t like dogs before.”

I was amazed. Not only that the device worked, but at the level of intelligence my best friend of 14 years seemed to have. 

“How?”

“You remember the first few days we met? When you found me in the park, you asked around to see if someone had lost their puppy. When I didn’t belong to anyone, and no one else would take me, you put ads up online and posters around the neighbourhood. While those were nice walks we went on, you were still trying to get rid of me.”

My heart was breaking with Buddy’s every word, but he was right. Initially I did want to get rid of him, but in my efforts he grew on me, so I kept and raised him. 

“Finding me was no accident.” Buddy said after a short pause. 

“What?” I asked, suddenly very confused.

“After your wife died, you started going to a therapist. She suggested that you get a pet to help you cope with the loneliness, but your apartment building doesn’t allow cats and you hated dogs at the time, so you never did. You told her about your daily run through the park, so she went out and got me from a rescue shelter, and placed me along your route shortly before you would arrive. She also took down all the posters, the ad online, and told people nearby at the park not to take me.”

“I always thought...I always thought some hooligans took those down.” I struggled to say through tears.

“I know why we’re here... and I just want you to know that I have enjoyed every minute of our time together. You’ve been the best owner a dog like me could ask for. I hope you get another dog after me and that you make it as happy as you’ve made me, and I hope that you find someone to be happy with. You deserve it Kurt, you deserve to be happy, you’re a good person.”

I didn’t know what to say, I wasn’t prepared for any of this, I didn’t even expect my device to work. Just then the vet came back in. 

“Wait, no I...5 more minutes please.” I pleaded.

The vet nodded respectfully and stepped back out.

“You’ve...” I struggled to get the words out “You’ve been the best...and first dog...I’ve ever had. I’ll never forget you Buddy.”

“I won’t forget you either Kurt. Thank you again, for everything.”

I hugged Buddy and he licked my cheek. After a long pause Buddy finally said,

“Okay, I’m ready.”

I went and got the vet, and stayed until Buddy’s chest rose and fell for the last time, and well into that night.

"[WP] The year is 2180 and the space elevator is mainstream now. You decide to visit Mars, your elevator shakes and suddenly stops. A space elevator rescue has never been planned for or been conducted.",lolxddabberhater,"I hate riding in these things

I always preferred the old school pods they used to send people to other places before this. I liked those PODS; you could go, watch the world become smaller and smaller and be relatively safe in the PODS. This elevator though was cutting edge technology. Tested thoroughly, true but only out for a few dozen years or so. Going up to the main orbital hub, I got in line for the mars outpost.

I Stepped up to the counter where they were letting people into the constricting pipe they called a elevator. 

""Going to Mantars?"" The man behind the counter prompted?

I froze for a second, slightly panicking thinking i was in the wrong line ""Uh no Mars""

""Oh youre in the right line then I can get you on right here sir"" he said revealing a grin ""You'd be suprised at how much dificulty The Kusarions have at single syllable words. It's hell sometimes""
He talked all the while scanning the card and pinning things into his haloprompt.

""That sounds horrible"" I replied sympathetically, I had worked with Kusarions on some occasion and they always looked down on humans.

""You're set just walk through there and stand on the platform and ill hit the button to send you up""

""Thanks man"" I replied gratefully doing as he instructed.

The doors closed. Suddenly I was moving up and towards mars. Hitting decent speeds of just shy of mach 1 I was able to see the entire planet beneath me. I always felt sentimental during these times as i reflect on how small I am to the universe. 

""-oligize for this inconvenience. Please wait while we try to fix this remotely""

Remotely huh? They had never even considered these things breaking down. 

""We apologize for this inconvenience. Please wait while we try to fix this remotely""

There it is again. It just keeps playing in the background. Whatever. Ill just wait I suppose.

I really hate these things.",Rimaka1
"[WP] The year is 2180 and the space elevator is mainstream now. You decide to visit Mars, your elevator shakes and suddenly stops. A space elevator rescue has never been planned for or been conducted.",lolxddabberhater,"*Foosh*  

A white wave of fresh snow curled and rose in front of the window, harder chunks of ice crashing against the glass while the crest and body of the wave of soft snow landed without much of a sound alongside the train as it blew through the track. The sound of ice clacking on the window woke her up. Opening her eyes, she was blinded by the whiteness outside; A whiteness that contrasted strongly with the blackness of the deep sleep she had just experienced on the inside of her eyelids. She was leaning her head on the cold metal border that separates train and window, hot air leaving her mouth, fogging up the glass and adding another grey cloud to the sky above. She reached up with a gloved hand and wiped the window clean, pressing herself upright and blinking intently- the type of blinking that comes immediately after a deep sleep with no beginning and a sudden end full of confusion and surprising restfulness. Quickly remembering where she was, she looked around the inside of her train cabin. She was alone in this First Class HyperTrain cabin, and it was on its way to the largest man-made object ever constructed in the history of engineering. Egyptians would have bowed to it, convinced that their Gods would have had to pray to other, more powerful Gods for the strength and wisdom and determination required to achieve such a feat. Romans would have shed tears of envy at the collective effort it took to build. And its beauty! The finesse! It wasn't just an object- it was art. An art piece that wasn't in the realm of imagination 100 years ago; One that the most prestigious and reputable museums in Paris or London or New York wouldn't even dare to dream about showcasing, put out on display for the cultured bourgeois tourists that came from around the world to see it and brag to their friends back home and say, ""I travelled there, and I was fortunate (and rich) enough to bare witness to all of its glory with my own two privileged eyes."" But this wasn't that kind of art. This was a collective effort that required help from all 193 countries of the UN. And by uniting the world in one project, by splitting the costs among the richest of the world- and not just by one privatized company- everyone in the world would be able to visit this great structure and ride it up beyond the clouds, beyond their childhood dreams no longer bound by technology or the need to pursue the rigorous career of an astronaut. 

She looked back out through the icy window towards the horizon, past the sea of snow and uninhabited lands to the destination of the HyperTrain- The Hub. Barely seen through the morning fog and the winter breeze flinging up snow,  but it was there, and it was unmistakeable. She saw the skyline of blackish-grey undetailed buildings made of rectangles and jagged edges, and the thin line of the glass dome that encased the entire micro-city. A barely visible black line shot up from the center of The Hub, checkering in and out of existence through the fog and the clouds, revealing parts of itself where the clouds chose not to wrap themselves around it, and hiding again behind the darker grey and bolder counterparts. She traced it up and up, spraining her neck to the limits of motion and pressing her face against the cold window to try and see how much of it she could see. It was lost to human vision as it stretched out beyond sight, seemingly with no end and getting thinner and thinner until it disappeared into nothing. 

The train began to curve east towards The Hub, frequent passengers aware that this meant that they were close. Lacie Moran was not one of those frequent passengers. He excitement tightened around her throat and chest, eyes dilating and reflecting the beautiful white snow off of her pupils to anyone who was close enough to look into her dark brown eyes. It quickly faded and turned into fear. ""What if a storm breaks the thread?"" she thought to herself. Winds would surely be stronger at higher elevation. *It's never happened before, Lacie. Calm down you're going to be fine.* There seemed to be a commotion on the other side of the train where Lacie heard mumbling and chatter. She got up, curious about the sudden rise in noise, and stepped out of her cabin towards the viewing windows opposite to her. The Hypertrain was wider than traditional trains of the past- Shared cabins, VIP and First Class Cabins, Bathrooms, and even a few bars lined the right side of the train. There was a center walk-way in each of the passenger cars, and on the left side of the train was the ""Viewing Platform."" Glass lined that entire side of the train ""For our viewing pleasure,"" as the man at the beginning of the ride described it. Several chairs were bolted into the ground for people to sit and enjoy the view of our two and a half our train ride from the city center to this remote area of the countryside where the world decide to build The Hub. All of the seats were taken, younger men and women stood around the chairs where their grandparents and the elderly were sitting, small children pressed their rosy cheeks and runny noses against the glass, palms spread wide and their mouths even wider, fogging up the glass with their tiny breaths as they looked over the horizon with awe- It appeared that there was a Pod slowly climbing its way down from the abyss above, through the clouds and into view where it would dock in The Hub and await its new crew and passengers: Us.

&amp;#x200B;

""Ladies and gentleman,"" said the voice of a cheerful man over the intercoms, ""we are due to arrive at The Hub in approximately 10 minutes. Please be sure to have all of your belongs with you before you exit the train, and we hope you enjoyed the ride."" People began to get up from their seats and headed back into their cabins. Lacie stepped forward towards the six-foot-high glass and looked out to The Hub. Of course she had seen pictures and videos of it back home- she even had friends who had gone up The Lift and to the Moon. But she didn't know anyone who had gone up to Mars before. How did she get so lucky? Because at the end of the day, it really was all luck. She wasn't scheduled to ride The Lift for another 7 years, 4 months, and 2 days. She followed the railroad tracks and traced them to the entrance of the large, glass dome now just a few hundred meters ahead of them. It was enormous, crystal clear and reflecting light from the scattered rays of the sun that sparingly broke through the clouds. Inside, she could now see the details of the buildings that made up The Hub. Tall, rectangular skyscrapers with long windows along every side. Shorter, rectangular buildings that had less windows but still had a certain elegance to them. There were parks with trees, so many trees, and a river that was suspended above the ground, held up by a system of poles and glass bridges that resembled an aqueduct. And at the center of it all was humanity's pride and joy, Earth's glory and the greatest tangible accomplishment ever created. The Lift had descended and docked by now. It was beautiful, it was enormous; majestic and terrifying at the same time. Shaped like a spearhead and whiter than the snow around them, it had wonderful curves and spirals that jutted out along its sides, and glass bulbs and viewing rooms that were scattered along its body. It was a large, white cone with intricate ornaments coming out from its sides, reminding us that we were living in the future, reminding us that we were officially an inter-planetary species, able to travel to and from our beautiful blue planet to the drier, redder counterpart 34 million miles away.

You live on the outside and have just received a letter requesting your presence in the nearby city.",mothrasboyfriend,"No one really expected the apocalypse to happen so soon. Most people knew the planet was dying, near the end. And don't get me wrong, there were people actually trying to help. They arranged rallies, told people how to ""save the Earth,"" cut down on energy use, recycled. The whole works. 

But no one expected the Earth to actually give out until it did.

It was terrible. Severe drought in some places. Major flooding in others. Wildlife and plants literally went up in smoke. Billions of people were dead within the first few weeks. And if people weren't worried before, they sure were now. A bunch of the major scientists and engineers from around the world got together to arrange a solution. What they found was a temporary stall.

They decided to gather up all the world leaders, as well as a few thousand 'randomly' selected individuals, and put them in completely solar-powered, closed-off cities until they could think of a better solution, or until the Earth became habitable again.

Of course, that left the rest of us who weren't so lucky.

People reverted back to a primitive, tribe-like state. If they saw outsiders close enough, they would fight with the makeshift weapons they had. Millions more died in the ensuing turf wars. Only those of us who were exceptionally strong or exceptionally lucky survived.

Now I estimate there are only a few million people left alive on Earth.

I am among them.

I never joined any of the major clans--they never appealed to me. However, I had my own clan, of sorts.

Sometimes, a child is born in one of those cities, and it makes them go over the population limit. So, the high-ups throw the kid out. Whenever I can, I try to help the kid survive. After all, they're no more than babies at the time. Most of the time they don't, but on rare occasions they do.

Decades have passed since this all started. A type of peace has settled over the land, in no small part, I know, due to the fact there are so few people left to fight.

Back when Earth wasn't this messed-up hell hole and things were normal, I was a Botanist. Not the most interesting profession back then, I know. But invaluable now.

My followers have swelled in rank from the kids I've saved and from others who want to join my cause that I've met along the way. I am the oldest among them, so I'm something of a father to them all.

The common thread between us is we all want to make a difference. Hopefully someday, probably long after I'm dead, we will.

So for now, I keep going. Even though we die, even from things I would have laughed at back when everything was normal, we keep going. We keep planting, from the few seeds we do manage to scrounge up. And I keep telling myself we *will* make a difference.

Mark, one of my older kids, rouses my from my musings with a shake of my shoulder.

""You thinking about that letter?""

I look down at the notice I got from one of the cities. They wanted to give me an award or something for 'significant efforts in rebuilding the planet.'

""It's complete garbage, is what I think of it.""

Mark just shrugs. Never a talkative one, that Mark. Even when we helped him from that landslide, all he said was a quick 'thanks.' He showed his gratitude more through actions.

I look out at the grove of trees we managed to plant here.

It's really not much, only nine, small saplings. When I look at how few there are, I start to doubt. We had more even bigger trees, not too long ago, but we made the mistake of planting fruit bearing trees out in the open. They were raided by another gang for food, and there weren't enough of us to stop them. We couldn't even find a single seed remaining.

 It was frustrating. Even when facing humanity's biggest threat, people were still apathetic and selfish. Up against ourselves, what could we really do?

""Do you think we can make a difference, Mark?""

Mark looks at me inquisitively, as if confused by the question. ""Of course I do.""

""How can you be so confident?""

Mark seems to think about the question for a while. He turns his head slightly, and looks out at the grove of trees with me. After a few minutes, he seems to decide on an answer he likes.

He simply says, ""You made a difference for me.""

I look at him and think about what he said for a while. I look back out at our small, grove. So small, but so, so much better than nothing. I nod.

Maybe I can't make much of a difference in the long run. Maybe all of this would be for nothing. Maybe I can't save the Earth.

But what can I say? I'm an optimist at heart, even after all of this. Mark is too. So are all of my children.

We *can* make a difference.

Together, I know we can.

[WP] - The Last Hero's body stand broken and bloody on the lawn of the White House. As they draw their last breath society begins to finally fall.,ohmyshittingcats,"As the few survivors crawl across the lawn of the former house of the most powerful man on Earth, the White House began to collapse. The twenty men that ran out before the building completely fell apart were covered in blood, sweat, and soot. Bodies covered the entire street and many smoking craters cover the entire city of Rastongina, formerly known as Washington D.C. 

Herbert Lackinfeld, the last president of the once great United States, was the last one out of the building. He carried a briefcase in one hand and a pistol in the other, both would be essential for his survival. 

Lackinfeld walked up to the only other important official remaining, the head of the Secret Service, and told him to try and find anyone that was still fighting for the United States. The man called twenty people and every single person did not respond, everyone was either dead or unable to contact them. 

In the distance, a small band of men waving a Canadian flag ran was running towards the president and his posse. Lackinfeld aimed his pistol and shot the man carrying the flag in the torso, knocking him to the ground. 

The Canadians began to open fire and soon half of the survivors lay dead on the ground. By the time the firing ceased, Lackinfeld was the only man who remained, and he fired shot after shot into the Canadian soldiers. Soon, they were down to only two men, and those two men began to run towards Lackinfeld and a frightening pace. 

One of the Canadians was slain by the last bullet the Lackinfeld possessed, but the other began to draw a sword as Lackinfeld pulled a knife from his pocket. The two remaining men began to fight, sword and knife, the long arm of Canada and the remaining stub of America, the tyrannical might of the new world and the weakness of the democracy. 

Lackinfeld was eventually killed and as he died, he uttered one sentence, ""Hockey was never fun anyway,"" and died.

ALONE.",unemployeddude69,"The ringing bell jerked me awake,I lifted my head and blearly looked around expecting to see the rest of the class.  No one. No one was there with me. My fog filled brain blearly wondered why it was so dark. 



I reached down for my backpack and pulled out my phone, 8:30 am, everyone should be here.  *Where is everyone?,* I thought. I noticed the text messages, five of them. All of them asking where I was.  I went to text my friends back, no signal. 



I frowned, *what was going on here? This had better not be a joke.* I got up and shouldered my backpack and went to the hallway. Silence.  As I walked down the hall I peered into other classrooms, still no one. 



*Click, click, click,* of toenails behind me.  I turned, nothing. I turned back around and started forward, a low growl behind me and the sound of lights being turned off.   I quick turned back around, in the darkness red eyes and a low growl. I turned to run, as I passed a light it clicked off.  Behind me was darkness and the growling creature with red eyes. 



The creature sounded like it was gaining, getting closer.  My heart was beating wildly and a stitch in my right side was starting.  I couldn't keep going like this much longer. My breathe was coming out in hot ragged gasps now.  *What the hell was this?,* my mind screamed. 



An open door, I ran through and slammed it shut just as the creature crashed into it.  It howled in rage, it seemed other howls answered it from deeper in the school. *I have to get out of here,* I thought frantically.  I ran to one of the windows, I was about to squeeze out of it when I noticed the sky. Blood red with sickly green clouds hanging low in the sky, my heart froze.  


The creature behind me seemed to be breaking through the door and he brought friends. “Shit!,” I screamed as I fell backwards out of the window.  When I hit the ground I must have blacked for moment, I woke up in the grass below the window. I looked around, cars going down the road, no red sky with green clouds.  



“I'm back! I'm back!,” I started screaming.  I checked my phone, it was only 9:30am. I only missed one class, I slowly made my way to the front doors, I was never going to fall asleep at school again.

You would think that Heaven was a bright light, a pearl as indescribable as it was beautiful. It was, and yet it wasn’t. If light could be found, Heaven was bright. That was the way it was, and that is the way it shall always be. I always view it as this: that while Humanity is flawed, it is truly capable of being great. Heaven is humanity at its height, where intellect meets beauty that can only be hinted at amongst the living.

Which is why some saw it as strange when I took to my position with an eagerness that belied the task at hand. To be a shepherd of the mentally ill, to voluntarily seek out something less than perfect, to sully my mind and soul with those that are forever tainted by means outside of their control… I was as applauded as as I was pitied.

I had always liked helping people. I had never cared about the money, but I had cared about my patients. Watching someone die while unable to help them was heartbreaking, but here I could make a difference. Here I could help and continue to do so.

Here I had all the time I needed.

“Mother!”

I froze as the voice burst into being, whirling as a shrill cry seared through my heart like the heat of a dying star. 

*That voice, it seems so familiar.*

Old memories jumped from the recesses of my mind, passing by with the speed of a bird of prey. My heart sank as the voice rose once more, pleading for someone who wasn’t there. Not truly. 

*Poor child*.

I spread my wings, leaping from my post and into the air, ascending hundreds of feet into the air in a single instant. White flame burst around me, a searing beam of light that could take as easily as it gave. It didn’t take long for me to find the child, so lost and alone as he was. 

*Where are the others?* I thought angrily, speeding towards the boy. *Where is his family?*

“Mother!” the boy screamed, tears flowing down his quivering cheeks as I landed next to him. “Where is she!?” 

He was young. Much too young. He wore simple clothing and a complicated expression. Long wavy brown hair flowed down to his shoulders, reflecting the light surrounding my current form. A beautiful child, who loved and was loved.

Fear- it bled from him as much as his eyes did. But it was those eyes, those bright blue eyes, that caught my attention. Even unseeing, they pulled you towards them, even as their youthful innocence cracked and bled before my eyes. 

I almost wept as I knelt before a vessel of purity, taken from his life before he could be molded into something uniquely his own. Taken too soon, and yet taken too late.

I tentatively raised a hand, moving to brush away the boy’s tears. The boy flinched, his unseeing eyes widening as he stepped back, arms raised protectively in a weak shield. “Please,” the boy whimpered piteously. “I want to go home.”

Tears gathered in my eyes as I furled my wings. *What a horrible disease, to be forsaken from both realms and terrified in both*. “Come with me,” I said softly, forcing my quavering hands to be still as I kept my gaze locked to the blinded boys'. “We will find your mother.”

“Where am I?” the boy wailed, stumbling forward to fall into my arms. “Where is mother? Where is my brother, where is Daniel? Where-”

The boy disappeared, flickering in and out of existence, out of my arms. A young boy, full of potential and good. *Flicker*. An older gentleman, just retired and approaching his fortieth wedding anniversary. *Flicker*. A young man, just married and beginning to start his family. *Flicker*. “Mother!” *Flicker*. “Daniel!” *Flicker*. 

I kept my arms around the rapidly changing body of the boy, now unable to keep my tears back. “It will be alright,” I whispered, hugging him close. “I will be here. I will wait.”

It never became easier, but it eventually it did slow. The boy calmed, growing into a man before my eyes. I sat back, and one of the boy’s family members brought us chairs. We waited, and I comforted him when delirium took him, when the boundary between life and death became too thin. The whole time, members of Joshua- the boy’s family- gathered, waiting silently. I comforted them too when I could, when Joshua suffered, and they cried and wept and raged, I helped as best as I could. It wasn’t enough, it never was.

But I tried, all the same.

It ended in a bright flash, with a scream of agony that shredded my soul. What was once a boy was now an elderly man, deceased at the age of seventy-five, leaving behind a lasting legacy and a family that he had loved.

But there was a family waiting for him here too, who had now been waiting for many years. Sometimes patient, sometimes not, but loving all the same. These were his grandparents, his father, his mother, his uncles, his aunts, his old friends and old lovers.

They were all here.

At this point, I stepped back, allowing Joshua’s family to at last meet him, to welcome him to their next life. At this point, usually, I am forgotten. Not cast aside but forgotten amidst the happy family reunion. 
But this time when I turned to leave, I felt a hand on my shoulder. I turned to see Joshua, a radiant smile on his face as he hugged me for the last time. “Thank you,” he sobbed into my shoulder, the rest of his family falling silent with happy and thankful expressions of their own. “Thank you for being there for me. For my family.”

I smiled, stepping back and cupping his chin so that our eyes met. “Always,” I said softly, giving him one last hug in return before I unfurled my wings and leapt into the air. 

I worked alone, but I was never bereft. 

*Thank you, Joshua.*

"[WP] Late in the evening on Oct 31st, reports start trickling in that people are unable to take off their Halloween costumes and that they’re starting to act like the characters they’re dressed as.",Becauseisaidsotoo,"It was madness.  Late at night, after kids no longer trick-or-treated and the last house light had long since been turned off, people were in their houses taking down decorations, sorting out candies, and taking off their costumes.  Only, they couldn't take off their costumes.  Zippers wouldn't unzip, velcro was stuck tight as glue, and masks may as well have become part of their wearer's face.  Halloween was over.  But the party had just begun.

The first reports that rolled in showed the severity of the situation: serial killer attacks, mobster shootings, and zombie attacks.  In the background of a grainy film of what was most likely Bigfoot, I saw strange people jumping about yelling about getting a ""Victory Royale"".

After I saw the local news reporter get possessed by a 5-year old demon, I'd had enough.  I thought to myself how to fix this.

*My buddy Tom and his gang are dressed as Ghostbusters, I could give them a call.  My younger brother is Rick Grimes, so he'll know how to take care of the zombies.  And the entire science department at my school dressed up as police officers, they'll be our best shot against the criminals.*

Who am I, you ask?  Nick Fury, director of S.H.I.E.L.D.  And I'm here to talk to you about the Avengers Initiative.",C732
"[WP] Late in the evening on Oct 31st, reports start trickling in that people are unable to take off their Halloween costumes and that they’re starting to act like the characters they’re dressed as.",Becauseisaidsotoo,"""v-veemo?"" The teen blinked as she looked into the mirror, her hands touching her suddenly more tentacle-esque hair and then the strange black stuff around her sapphire blue eyes. She didn't know what was going on, and was kinda panicking over this sudden change. It had to be a hallucination, right? There's no way she actually became an octoling, they were so unrelated with humans after all.. 

""t-this has to be a dream.. Yeah, that's it.. It'll all be over soon!"" she said to herself in the rather small bathroom, a soft, quiet yawn escaping her since she was quite tired and it was getting late. Good thing she didn't have school tomorrow, maybe she can find some info online on how to change back to a human. And thus, she left her bathroom, walked down the hallway, took off her clothes and curled up in bed, sniffing her hair a bit since it smelled vaguely like the sea. 

When morning came around, she wasn't awoken by her loud beeping alarm, but instead by the gentle sound of birds and.. Was that the inkopolis square music? 

She blinked a bit, completely convinced she was hallucinating, there's no way she ended up in the splatoon universe. Stumbling her way out of bed, she quickly moved over and looked outside, and sure enough, she lived right by inkopolis, right of the cafe where a certain sea urchin lived and worked on his laptop seemingly all the time. 

Looking over at the floor, she saw the fresh octo tee, white headband and cream basics, which she happily put on, not caring that she didn't look fresh at all. They were surprisingly comfy, and gave her the hope that she'd be just fine here. 

""I.. Uh.. I guess this is fine, its a fresh start after all!"" she convinced herself as she made her way downstairs, exited through the front door and took in a deep breath of fresh air, looking up at the clear sky ""well, I know where I'm heading first!"" she said as she made her way to sheldon's store, since he handed out free splattershot Jr's, and after that, time for turf war! Let's hope there won't be any level 99* japanese eliters..

"[WP] ""Woah, your decorations look so realistic!"". Little did they know how real they were.",DeathByAutoscroll,"“Wait till you guys see this,” Thomas smiled at the other three. The sides of his mouth pulled upward. Plastic fangs protruded from his mouth and the poor lighting in the bathroom made Thomas’ white make-up look yellow. Every movement he made was accompanied by the silky swish of his black cape.

“Why couldn’t we see it downstairs?” Megan asked. Thomas smiled at his date, happy for the question. He closed the restroom door and turned out the light making it completely dark.

“Every other room has windows,” He flipped the light on again. “I didn’t want to risk anything going wrong.” Thomas lowered his voice and leaned closer to the group. “If anyone from work finds out I have it,” he shook his head grimly, “Serious trouble.”

“So? Where is this amazing sight that will change our lives?” Keith, his best friend, asked.

“Obviously.” Thomas stood up straight and extended an arm at the closed shower-curtain decorated by a black castle. Keith chuckled.

“I bought you that,” he said.

“We’ve all seen it already, can we go back to the party?” Tina, Keith’s date, asked. She idly pulled each bright-red ponytail of her wig causing it to tilt to one side on her head, then the other. Thomas sighed.

“C’mon guys, it’s Halloween! Trust me, this is awesome. Alright, who’s brave enough to open the curtain?” He grinned. “I promise you’ll scream.”

“Fine,” Tina stepped forward and pushed the curtain aside. She peeked inside as she started to open the curtain, then froze for a moment. Thomas nodded to himself with an eager grin and waited for her to register it.

As if all her emotions responded at once, Tina screamed at the top of her lungs and pushed the shower curtain open. She turned, still screaming, and Thomas saw a grin around her open mouth. Her scream transitioned to light chuckles, but the smile remained. She stepped into the tub and placed her arm around the tall, glass display case. A black skeleton, as tall as Tina, stood in the case, shackled in place by metal at his ankles, wrists, and neck.

“This is a *beautiful* decoration, but not scary at all.” Tina pushed her face against the glass and looked inside. “Looks super realistic though!” She leaned forward and left deep red lip prints against the glass. “Why don’t you have it downstairs with the actual party?”

“Don’t!” Thomas rushed forward and grabbed Tina’s hand to get her out of the tub. He immediately started trying to clear away the lipstick, but it turned into a giant pink smudge. he sighed.

“I’ll clean that later. I already told you, it’s not downstairs because windows. I can’t risk sunlight touching these,…” His smile grew broader as he looked at them. “…VAMPIRE BONES!” He threw his arms up into the air and waved them around to make the announcement extra exciting. It did not work. His three friends stared at him with a familiar look of, “that’s nice dear.”

“Vampires don’t have bones,” Megan said.

“Yes they do!” Thomas responded with a harsh tone and a heavy stomp in the tub, then realized who he was responding to. “Sorry. But yeah, of course they do.” Megan winked at him to let him off the hook.

“Of course they do,” she said. “I meant when they die they don’t leave bones. Don’t they always turn to dust?”

“Yes!” Thomas pointed at Megan. “Exactly, that’s why I can’t let the sunlight touch these. Oh yeah, it’s not dead.” Despite their levity, the three outside the tub took a step back.

“You’re dying to explain it to us,” Megan said. She nodded her head encouragingly. “Just tell us instead of waiting for the right questions.”

“Please!” Tina said. She moved closer to the door. Thomas leaned on the glass box and smiled.

“I’m breaking a lot of rules telling you this, but it’s not like having this in my bathtub is on the up and up.  Okay, you guys know my job, right?” All three nodded.

“Yeah, but I don’t see how monitoring alarms earned you vampire bones.” Keith chuckled.

“Oh right, sorry. That was something I couldn’t tell you. I got a new job last year working at Sharp Labs.” Thomas waved a hand dismissively. “Long story. They upgraded their security, I gave them some pointers, end result is I’m working for them now.” A sudden clicking noise came from the area by the door. Tina turned the knob to try and get out of the bathroom.

“You okay, hon?” Keith asked. She shook her head.

“If Tommy says those are vampire bones, and he got them from Sharp Labs…” she tried the door again. “Why can’t I get out?”

“You haven’t even seen the coolest part yet! I planned this out perfectly, it’s a great night for it.”

“What do you mean?” Keith ignored Thomas and asked Tina while he tried the door.

“I’ve visited Sharp Labs a few times,” Tina said. “I’ve had to sign crazy NDA’s, probably like Tommy. I’ve seen enough of what they do there to be scared of that.” Tina used her thumb to point at the black skeleton without turning around.

“What’s the best part?” Megan asked a sad-faced Thomas. He leaned against the glass case with a ghost of a pout on his lips. Upon hearing her question his dark eyes sparkled again and his grin grew.

“Feeding time!” He pulled a small glass vial from his pocket. As he tilted it back and forth, a sparkling gold liquid moved inside. “I did say he wasn’t dead, remember?”

“With glitter?” Tina scoffed. “You ass!” she smiled and playfully shoved Keith backward. “You set me up. I told YOU I was scared of that place. You just used Tommy’s love of vampires to build up this story!” Though she smiled, Tina felt a genuine sting of annoyance. She did not hold back too much of her strength while beating on Keith.

“GUYS WATCH!” Thomas yelled from the tub. He held a dropper filled with golden liquid over a small hole in the top of the glass. He squeezed the bulb to release a single drop of liquid. All at once a brilliant golden glow emanated from the trapped bones. The skeleton tried to move, but its shackles kept it in place. It kept trying to break free, but Thomas stood next to it unconcerned. “Don’t worry it can’t get out.” He held up the vial. “He eats once a month. A drop is enough to keep him alive without restoring his powers.” His grin remained glued on. “You don’t know how long I’ve been planning this to show you guys.”

“So it’s real? Really real?” Keith stayed close to Tina, but he looked at the skeleton with renewed interest.”

“It is,” Thomas nodded. “And it only gets better,” he lifted the vial again and pulled the dropper out. Then, he poured all the golden liquid into the tiny hole. Even before the vial emptied, the animated bones broke free of one restraint.

“What are you doing!?” Keith asked. He stepped in front of Tina and Megan. Thomas chuckled.

“I can’t become a vampire without you guys. I’ll be lonely.”

"[WP] Where the only way to pay medical bills is through a GoFundMe type of site, and the public get to basically ""vote"" on who lives or dies while people plead their case online",DetectiveJackBoat,"Adrianne browsed through different entries begging for her favor. She had long become desensitized to many of the stories but occasionally one gripped her enough to donate. Secretly she did it out of selfishness, gathering intelligence on what made some posts stand apart from the rest in case one day she would be on the receiving end.

The picture was of a young girl, but that’s not what caught Adrianne off guard. The girl was dressed plainly in a white dress washed one too many times that had frayed and greyed with time. What stood out was the expression on the girl. She didn’t look miserable or self-aggrandizing.

Adrianne read her blurb.

“I’m Nadia. My parents are helping me write this but the words, and thoughts, and spirit are all mine. If I grow up I want to be a laugher because I’m really good at it. My parents say I’m a gift that came to them 5 years ago from the stars. The stars just want my laughter back. I know really we’re all stardust but they want me back a little sooner than the rest of you. It’s too silent up there. If you vote for me, or not, then maybe one day I can make the night sky laugh for you.”

Adrianne scrolled through the slideshow. There were more images of her making silly faces, her long hair flowing in the wind. Adrianne was expecting to find a picture of the hair shorn and the girl covered in IV tubes behind a hospital bed but there were none.

“Who the heck else is going to vote for you, Nadia,” Adrianne thought and clicked the vote button out of pity but also odd admiration for the dignity the parents presented in her case. She knew how some parents took pictures of their children at their worst, instead of giving them comfort because it made for a better post. In the end, those were the ones whose bills were covered in full, so the parents were doing it with noble intentions, but what did a 5-year-old or 3-year-old know except they wanted to be held tight by their mommy or daddy who were too busy taking pictures of them, asking them to look into the camera.

Adrianne kept scrolling. A few notifications popped up on her screen.

“We saw you voted for Nadia, you may also want to vote for Johnny.”

Adrianne never clicked on the pop ups. She didn’t want the entries skewed to a particular type, especially age group. There were only so many sick kids she could handle competing for her votes.

“I’m Jerry. I’m an old timer, as you can see, but not so old that I don’t know my way around a medical appeal. You look at me and probably think why help this old man who is bound to croak any second. Hasn’t he lived long enough? That’s valid. But ask yourself, where does that thinking stop? What about at 55? 35? 15? So maybe I look 75. Maybe a little older. But does that mean I shouldn’t want to live another day any more than a 25-year-old? Don’t be distracted by my wrinkled skin and hair growth in all the wrong places. I know things and can do things it would take a 25-year-old 50 years to learn! Think of your nana when you vote for me. Think of your granddaddy.”

In the slideshow Jerry had various pictures of him trying to look younger than he was. Only 1 picture showed him in the hospital in bandages but even then his toothless smile beamed. Adrianne moved onto the next poster. Jerry seemed nice but he *was* old. He did have a full life. Someone else deserves the chance.

Jerry never intended to rack votes. He was surprised with the 50 he had, that covered a few regular checkups. He initially made the post with the intent to dissuade votes on the elderly. If only they worked more on improving quality of life and not quantity of years. Sure the slippery slope was slippery but Jerry believed in people enough to know they could grip the slide to stop themselves.

There would always be more stories Adrianne missed, even if she spent her days going through the posts. Like the case of the burn victim Cat McJan. She was a beauty once but something about a campfire gone bad took care of that. She needed multiple surgeries for the next coming years. Tragedy comes in pairs, at her lowest her husband abandoned her and their son. With 70% of her flesh still healing from the burns and skin grafts, Cat was left alone to care for Grant. She couldn’t work. She could barely take care of her toddler son, who cried whenever she approached. Each night Cat rocked Grant to sleep, lulling him as he asked for his daddy. Softly crying to herself as he asked for his mommy to go back to how she was. The fund asked for 500,000 votes to cover medical bills and childcare. She only had 10,000 so far.

As Adrianne packed her bags she received a notification from the site. She caught the tail end of the fund’s purpose. Cancer. Medical Bills. Debt. Something about the picture struck her. The face looked familiar, even the name.

""You have used all your votes for today. Would you like to upgrade for more?""

Adrianne would see if it was worth her vote tomorrow. She hadn’t noticed the fund was due to expire that evening. A few days later she randomly thought about her distant cousin, who she used to play with as a toddler until she moved with her parents out of state. She tried calling but no one picked up.",ScribblesatDusk
"[WP]The farm upstate is real. All 'dead' animals live in a kind of heaven, unknown to their previous owners. One day someone stumbles across the farm...",DisripectfulLlama,"Almost as if he was in a terribly written book, where the pages go on and on about the color of the leaves, and the sway of the trees as if it were windy without a breeze, John walked out of the forest and into a meadow that he could never have imagined. Each step, John could hear a roaring thunder and a tremble of the earth beneath his feet, all the while stepping forward towards barn doors that shined red as if they had been freshly painted the day before. 

Closer and closer John walked, and farther and farther the barn doors seemed, still glowing in the distance and illuminating the surrounding meadows with a vanilla sky. Closer still the ground beneath John's feet began to shake even more as now John too was beginning to become unnerved. ""What is this place, where am I going?"" he wondered. John convinced himself, ""mustn't be worried,"" he was in a better place now, free from anxieties and from the disappointment of crushed hopes and dreams. 

---

John had few friends in the lonely world behind him, few to miss him now that he was gone. Few showed to his funeral, and even less said goodbye. The only friend John ever truly cared about was his Dog, a loving Russell Terrier that always had way more energy than John could handle, and who seemed to have more patience than John. He lovingly called the dog Spot, due to the spotted nature that adorns most Russell Terriers, and because Spot always hit the metaphorical spot when John was down. 

""Man, I could really use Spot right now,"" John often thought, and the good times didn't come any easier for him after Spot was gone. Nostalgia can kill you if you let it, and John was no different. It wasn't losing Spot that made the difference, it wasn't even losing a friend, but the evil that's inherent in this world. A cold and lonely darkness, growing ever larger as John grew older, ever desperate to make fresh and happy memories again. John looked into the mirror, desperate, desperate to remember anything, desperate to feel happiness, all he could think about was Spot, and it made him sad, he missed him. 

---

The thunder grew. John seemed happy not without being unsettled. He knew he was dead, how could he not be? He pulled the trigger himself. This place was real to him and it seemed so happy, so full of life and sunshine, how could it not be? He continued walking, taking each step as he was further and further from the forest but never closer to the barn, when suddenly   it was as the wind from 1000 hurricane's had swept through the plains, and the skies went from sunny to clouds. The thunder grew closer. John looked out in the distance towards the barn, the doors were open. A single howl cries from the distance, ""Spot?!"" John thought. Could it be him, was John finally going to feel an end to the loneliness that plagued him throughout life? He could see a figure running from the distance, hope grew within him, ""I'm finally free"", his mind racing with happiness. 

The figure runs faster and faster, clouds grow larger overhead, the thunder in the distance ever closer, the ground trembling. Finally figures break through the shadows, barks from the thunder; it was DOGs, and not just a large pack, but ALL OF THEM. They get closer and closer, and John begins to panic, ""Where's Spot?!"". The sound of sadness fills his voice, and John feels alone, again. The Dogs get closer. John turns to run, ""what IS this place he wondered?"", but it was futile, his feet could never take him as fast as the thundering pack behind him. 

The Dogs themselves were excited. This is the first time any of them has seen a human since their deaths. Starving for attention in life, the dogs receive none after death, and they too are desperate; for companionship, for a friend, for happiness. They smell John, and they run! It's as if someone just rang the doorbell after centuries home alone. 

John was doomed. 

In their desperation for companionship, the dogs trampled, frantically jumping on top of each other and John just for the chance to lick his face, to be in his arms, to spend time with a ""Master""; It was a stampede of friendly intentions. 

John reached for a breath, screamed for air, and grasped at the heavens, his soul forever doomed to be loved for all eternity, smothered by good boyes. John looked for something, anything to relieve his anguish, something he could hold on too, but as he looked around Spot was nowhere to be found. John wished now, he had never gone looking.

""Generating? You fools, you don't have to generate anything, you just take it! But fine, I'll pay your damned bill, so I can finally drink my coffee in peace."" And with that, Joe slammed the phone to the table.

I didn't know Joe really well. I didn't really want to get to know him at all. He just showed up on my doorstep one day, explaining he just moved in next door, and if I could help him set some things up. And after I agreed to that, there really was no way out.

I thought he meant assembling a piece of furniture or some question with our landlord. But Joe was quite peculiar. He needed help with the simplest things, like plugging in his fridge or getting his new phone to start. One would think he hadn't lived for the first twentysomething years of his life and was just born yesterday. And sometimes he would say really crazy stuff.

""So, how exactly does this free energy thing you talk about work?"", I inquired.

""Well, you know, it's quite easy, really..."", Joe began. ""There is these... particles and... stuff everywhere and you just have to, like, pick them out of the air.""

""How do you pick particles out of the air?""

""Of course you don't pick them. A machine does it for you!"" 

""And how does the machine do it?""

Now Joe looked really frustrated. I took this as the answer that he didn't know himself.

While getting up to leave, I added: ""By the way, if you think the electrical bill is ridiculous, wait till you get the hospital's bill for that nasty cut on your finger.""",leedzah

“Jake, my best friend and resident geek getting married to Taylor, prettiest girl in high school! Can you believe it?”

I said with a smile, getting a small chuckle out of the crowd. Jake had Taylor wrapped with one of his arms as he chuckled too. Another tear rolled down my cheek.

“It really came as a shock to me when he called me one day and practically screamed in my ear saying, ‘OH MY GOD, Terry! Taylor agreed to go out with me! WITH ME, of all people!’ It really was a shock. For the longest time, we had thought we’d be the lords of Forever Alone town for, well, forever.”

I looked away from Jake. Every moment I stared at him caused heartbreaking emotions to surge up within me. Those damned memories. Why did they surface up now? Out of the corner of my eye, Taylor was smirking at me.

“I remember as kids, Jake and I used to go out to the forest near the elementary school and play. We collected all sorts of insects and roll around the mud. Whenever he got scrapes from whatever, he was always such a crybaby. Who would have thought that one day, this muddy and bug collecting crybaby would be getting married? To this gorgeous gal of all people!”

I glanced at Jake while the crowd cheered for the bride. He looked a little surprised and bewildered. It was no wonder. After all, I had brought up an elementary school memory. Neither of us could recall anything before our high school days. Whenever we asked our parents or friends about that period of time, they would only give us vague recollections.

“But he’s not all that bad.” I smiled wryly.

“There was one day in middle school, I picked a fight with some of the bullies. We went off to a deserted lot and I got the ever living daylights smacked out of me. But like a knight in shining armour, Jake came rushing in. Of course, we both got beat pretty bad but we made it out in one piece!”

I laughed. It was a really touching moment. Honestly, how could I forget about something like that? Especially what he said after. To remember these things now, the world really is a cruel place.

“And I’ll never forget what he said to me afterwards. ‘I know you didn’t ask me for help because you think I’m unreliable. But I’m your best friend and I’ll always be by your side. So, trust me a little, Theresa.’ And I do trust you, Jake. I trust you with Taylor and that you’ll make her the happiest woman in the world. You’re in good hands Taylor.”

I clutched my hand to my chest as I tried to keep my tears from overflowing. This was for the best. I looked at Jake one last time.

A tear rolled down his cheek.

I get that Bill works three on three off down at the fire station and Mandy is always picking up extra shifts at the hospital but even the kid sleeps like a rock. Who ever heard of a kid in 2018 spending so much time outside? He's like... ten or something and every single day at sunset he shows up dirty and smiling. I've had that bed shaking like we were at six flags and the only noise they made before morning was the thunk when poor Bill slid off the side one night. Bastard woke up the next day mentioning that the solid floors had done wonders for his back.

&amp;#x200B;

It's not like they're **always** sleeping. I've tried getting them at meal times but I swear to god this family does not understand the meaning of portion control. Those plates are WAY too heavy to throw. The pots seem to have this magical property where they're bigger once you pull them out of the fridge. It's like they prepare for armies. Any silverware that goes flying inevitably gets blamed on Rover, the golden retriever and somehow it's not even annoying. They've turned it into a game.

&amp;#x200B;

Poor Rover. He's blamed for nearly everything I do. Ectoplasm on the sheets? Rover. Sulfer and Brimstone? Blamed on Rover. The La Z Boy starts shaking (Listen, I'd lift that if I could but those things weigh more than a Civic. Shaking is actually pretty impressive among the ghost community). And of course Rover just sits there in all his stupid dumb dogginess getting scolded while he wags his take and gets the eventual, ""Aww c'mere, You know I can't stay mad at you.""

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe if they were fat I'd be able to get them but they're up and down the stairs before I can shake a picture off the wall. All that food and it just seems to speed them up. Also, did you know that standalone garages don't count as part of the house?! They built theirs in the first year. Kayaks, Canoes, a small forest of paddles. This family rafts. They're never home. Ever. I'm starting to worry about the kid's education. Sure they're always doing these parties every nine weeks celebrating his straight A's but surely it can't be good to pull a child out of school to go on all of these family trips. It's just not right.

&amp;#x200B;

At one point I decided to just making one single part of the house creepy, I tried chilling the attic to the temperature of a sepulcher. That deep wet chill that should have at least made them worry their holiday things would get damp? You know what they do? Drill vent holes into the ceiling to cool down the rest of the house.

&amp;#x200B;

That's it. I quit. I refuse. I've been dead twenty years and I've never seen something so impossible. This is against union rules. There's regulations to protect against this kind of thing. I just. Dear God. How?! How can you possibly be this DUMB?! I don't understand. What a bunch of weirdos...",DirtiestTenFingers

"[WP] ""The pen is mightier than the sword"", they say. But you, the world's greatest swordsman, seek to prove them wrong. You search for the world's greatest writer to dispel this saying",WalrusSkullRaider,"My first writing prompt :D. It's quiet a bit of text but I hope you enjoy it!

&amp;#x200B;

It was the year 1450 and Sir, Admiral Paul Ebner Flitzgerald don't forget Max (we'll call him Paul for this one) had set sail on his great voyage to find the greatest writer in the world. He continued his family long heritage of one day disproving the saying ""the pen is mightier than the sword""... which is why his name was so ridiculously long (and ridiculous), if a family member couldn't find or beat the greatest pen writer, they'd simply make sure that their child would carry their name (you know... extra credit). However, lucky for Paul, he knew his target.

His name was, Joule le Grand. The world's most handsome and prestigious writer. He had the most fabulous moustache with all the right curls in all the right places. Joule was known for his witty dramas and snobby attitude. He is famous for his ability of ""murdering with words"", not literally, but it is said that some of his writing has brought some unlucky readers into suicide.

Paul had already tried to take down Joule in the past. He sent him a pen in a bottle a few months back taking the saying too literally. Joule simply replied with, ""come get, bro"". On another occasion Paul attempted to write him a strongly worded letter of complaint, but once again Joules proved his ability in playing mind-games, sending him a personally written book titled, ""Handwriting and Spelling: The Basics"".

Paul found himself in the middle of the ocean sailing towards a remote island in the middle of nowhere, where Joule hid from the rest of the world. Waves came crashing on Paul's epic Caravel called the ""Bringer of ~~Ebner's, Flitzgerald's, Max's~~ Paul's Fury"", which had been passed down generations, as the scribbled names might suggest. Paul only had barrels of potatoes and swords. He forgot any actual, 'drinks' and has had to rely on salt water. However, the nausea inducing, cold and hard seawater was never a favourable option so he avoided it as much as possible.

Weeks went by. Paul was starting to go insane. He was soon to meet the fate of his ancestors he was sure. But just when Paul was about to drop his final swear. The weather calmed and when the waves parted and fell back to equilibrium he saw it! His eyes glimmered in the bright yellow beams of the sun. Even though he was a fat, ugly and pompous brute he seemed... relieved and almost forced a smile, but all the salt that had dried on his lips in the previous months made expressing emotions difficult. ""LAND HOOOO!""

There he was. So close. So close to victory! Joule's mansion was great. A truly vast structure. 30 times the size of the ""Bringer of ~~Ebner's, Flitzgerald's, Max's~~ Paul's Fury"". 50 times the size of the largest tree in the world. It could probably house a billion million people in it. Joule had no guards or security in general. He was THAT confident. Paul spoke a prayer to himself and slowly staggered to the great front door. One step - at a time. Paul now stood before it. He was so close to achieving what his family couldn't achieve. 5 or 6 generations have failed. But clearly Paul was destined to be the one. But Paul was fading. He actually tried to grow Potato's on the hardwood floor of his Caravel, when he realised that a rolling Potato isn't a growing Potato. He ate it. He was sick. Extremely sick. But he persevered. He had an intense expression and burst in.

The entrance room was truly impressive, a grand design. One could call the whole building a 'monument'. A landmark that should be celebrated throughout the world. The wood was clean, too clean. Dark, purplish and very expensive. Paul forced his head up, but the building was so high, he became dizzy. He saw a sign with an arrow.

He followed the arrow. And to his (surprising) surprise, he found another sign. ""Ha, what a fool"" he thought, ""He must be an idiot to think that I would NOT follow the signs"". It was all perfectly orchestrated, the whole building was a maze. One wouldn't be incorrect to assume that even Joule may need these from time to time just so HE can navigate his own mansion.

Eventually, he made it to the final door. He opened it slowly. It creaked and made a pained howl as it opened. The stomach cramps forced his hand to make a jerking motion which pushed the door open in an instant. And there he was. Joule le Grand, sitting on his giant chair next to his giant desk. Paper skyscrapers fill the room. He was truly obsessed with the art of writing. He slowly turned his chair.

Slowly. Slowly. Slowly. He revealed himself. The ends of his fingertips were touching and his connected hand was in front of his villainous face. He disconnected the right and stroked his moustache. ""So, so. After all these years. Someone has found me. Someone has made it. To my lair. What's your name good sir?"", Paul was fading quicker now, he could barely force the syllables, ""Sir - Admiral - Paul - "" he repulsed but continued, ""Ebner Flitzgerald don't forget Max"" he fell on to one knee. Joule makes a ""nyee"" sound and continued the interrogation, ""What do you wish to accomplish... old fiend"". Paul could only whisper now, ""Prove... to. you. that the. pen- is not. mightier. than the sword"".

Time froze for a second. Joule laughed. Manically. Crazily. Fizzydizzily. He only stops when Paul was on both knees, slowly drawing his sword for battle. Joule got up from his chair and slowly walked towards Paul looking down at him. Paul 'attempts' a swing but it was ineffective. Joule kicks his leg in a forward motion and Paul lost his sword in an instant. Joule gave him his final speech.

""Look. Paul. I may be THE most popular writer in the world. But. Hehe. I still can't get over this. I don't use the pen as my weapon. I've been writing with lead since I was just a little writer. Look."" Joule shows a crying Paul his most famous work, 'Moustaches and Me'. He slowly flicks through the pages, ""Look. No pen. I can give you more proof. But. Well. You seem to be quiet. Well. Screwed. Make sure to tell your sequel to actually look after the right man. See you in hell"".

Paul faded. And left our world.",TheNuttyGamer
"[WP] ""The pen is mightier than the sword"", they say. But you, the world's greatest swordsman, seek to prove them wrong. You search for the world's greatest writer to dispel this saying",WalrusSkullRaider,"""...and, furthermore, this swordsman is an absolute idiot. It is frankly astounding that he stands unaided. His most recent adventure in Valisa was solved only by a local woman and her frying pan saving him and the rest of the hostages.""

It went on for another paragraph, but I growled and threw the papers down. Since Andial had heard I was after him, he had been publishing stacks of this slander. The incident in Valisa, for instance. Sure, Livianne *had* a frying pan, and yes, she helped; but I hardly needed rescuing, when I had the traitor count ay swordpoint. Her blow to his head simply made him easier to carry out.

Andial had been a spine in my foot for years; 'the pen is mightier than the sword' they said, as if they hadn't seen  how scrawny he was as a kid. I used to pick him up with one arm, and I was hardly the strongest in the village. Eventually I decided enough was enough; I sent him a message I was coming.

The next town over I found the first of the pamphlets. I hadn't realized anyone even knew about the goat incident, but apparently Andial knew all about it. Since then, I had been greeted with less and less applause at every town, and it took effort-such as in Valisa- to regain their adoration. Now I was nearly to Sarmell, where he lived. I shoved the papers back in my bag, kicked dirt over my fire, and walked the Long Road in the morning light.

He met me at the city gates.

""Hello, Carrian,"" he said, with his ever-present smile.

""Andial,"" I acknowledged, nodding. ""Been a while. You ready?""

""All bite and no bluster, as always, Carrian!"" he said, stripping off his jacket. ""Yes, of course. Let's get to it."" He pulled out a quill pen and cocked his head, waiting.

I lunged, my sword thrusting toward his shoulder; but he swiveled, and stepped toward me sideays. He held up his pen as I returned to my stance, attempting to swivel.
He poked the feather under my chin.

Then he started tickling me.

I hate being tickled. I can't even fight it off. I just go limp. So I did, collapsing to the dirt of the Long Road, laughing uncontrollably. He sat down next to me with a content sight, looking up at the blue morning sky. He stopped tickling me and waited for me to stop laughing.

""You yield?""

I rolled my eyes, then started laughing again. Me, the world's greatest swordsman, unable to defend against a feather. I'd call foul, but it was probably my fault for falling for it.

""Yeah, alright, fine. But you're rescinding that fake news you put out. Made it hard to threaten people.""

""That was kind of the point. I nearly won before you even arrived. Thanks to my pen, others lost faith in your sword. Proves the pen is mightier, wouldn't you say?""

Maybe there was some truth to the saying after all.",Genderfluid-ace

I whispered to myself as I walked up to the entrance of the Shady Acres retirement home. Soon I would be able to put my parents to rest, after years of pain and suffering, after living with the loss of my parents for my entire adult life. Finally, I would be able to put it all to rest and move on, maybe live a normal life.

I paused at the doors to collect my thoughts, a deep breath, I thought through my story once more and pushed through the door. 
""Hello,"" I said to the man at the reception desk. ""I'm looking for a resident here, Mr. Heatherfinch?"" The distracted looking man at the desk gave me a once over. ""Really?"" He asked, ""no one has ever come to visit Mr. Heatherfinch before.""
""It's a little complicated"", I explained ""I'm his grandson, he doesn't know about me, we've never met."" 
He gave me a sad look, ""Oh, well I think you should prepare yourself. He hasn't been well recently, his health has been declining. I'll lead you to his room""

The care aid explained Mr. Heatherfinch's condition to me as we walked through the sanitized meandering halls of the home. The design meant to make the residents feel like it was much larger, I'd read that somewhere, though couldn't recall specifically.

""Here we are, room 419"" he opened the door and cautious approached a figure in the bed. Mr. Heatherfinch was hooked up to several monitoring devices, the uses of which escaped me. ""Mr. Heatherfinch?"" The care aid said quietly, ""I you have someone here to see you""
""Hmuh? That's a first. No one visits me, Mark."" Mr. Heatherfinch groaned tiredly. 
He looked over between Mark and I, we locked eyes and I watched his expression change in an instant, he remembered me.
""I'll leave you two alone"" Mark said, obviously picking up on some tension, though likely misplaced.

Mark left the room, and I approached the bed, my hand drifting to the silenced pistol concealed in my jacket. The other four had resisted, no sense in getting sloppy now. ""Hello, Mr. Heatherfinch""

"[WP] You open your eyes and find yourself seated in a plane. You look around and you see everyone else still asleep. The people next to you jolt awake and confused, they ask you where this plane is going. Seems like no one knows where the plane is going, except for the man entering the cockpit.",kaptainkrispyskin,"Panic arose as murmurs filled the plane. No one knew what was happening, let alone the man that had just entered the cockpit. I got up from my seat and looked around. The air stewards and stewardesses were no where to be seen. Everyone looked worried, but seemed to be doing nothing other than using their phones trying to get some sort of signal. 

Suddenly, a man in a suit got up and strode towards the cockpit, looking around to make sure no one noticed him. Little did he know that my eyes were tracing his every movement. 

After he disappeared into the cockpit, I slowly and quietly made my way there too. 

On the way there, I gasp in shock to find the air stewards and stewardesses seating on their seats, unconscious.  

Alarmed, I glanced up, finding the door to the cockpit slightly open. I threaded lightly towards the cockpit, peeking through the small gap. 

My eyes widened in fear. The man who I saw before was currently holding a gun against another man who was controlling the plane. I looked down to see the pilot and co-pilot unconscious on the ground. 

“Drop the gun mate,” The man who was currently controlling the plane said. 

“I’m not going to let you ruin our plan,” 

“And I’m not going to let you destroy this world.”

“Well then, since you’re unwilling to cooperate, I have no choice but to shoot.” I heard the clicking of a gun and immediately shut my eyes, waiting to hear the bang. But it didn’t come. Instead, I heard a swift movement and before I knew it, the man who was initially holding the gun was lying unconscious on the ground. 

I let out a shaky breath, unable to comprehend the sight before me. Unfortunately, this did not go unnoticed by the man-who was now holding the gun. I gasped, backtracking before tripping on my own foot. I fell to the ground and hurriedly scrambled up, trying to escape. 

“Don’t move,” the man threatened. 

“W-what’re you doing?” I spluttered in fear. 

“Saving the world,” he smirked. 

“What do you mean?”

“You weren’t going on a holiday to Panama, I’ll let you know. This free-” he chuckled sarcastically, “-free trip you won was just part of their little scheme.”

“T-they?”

“You see, they have been observing you and all these people here for a long time. Your body statistics suit their experiment perfectly. They need you guys because no one else would be able to survive their plan.”

I laughed humorously, “You expect me to believe that?”

The man took a threatening step forward. “This is not a joke, lady. Ever wondered how you got that free ticket to Panama out of nowhere?” 

I swallowed as I digested his words. It was true. Apparently the people who sat next to me also won tickets to Panama. I thought it was just coincidence. 

“So what are you planning to do?” I responded suspiciously. 

“Well, it’s been settled. You guys are not going to Panama. They won’t be able to proceed their plan without you guys.” He replied nonchalantly. 

I slowly nodded my head, walking past him to the cockpit. 

“So where are we alighting at?” I asked curiously. 

I turned to face him, only to see a smirk plastered on his face while holding something. 

“What’s that?” I asked, squinting my eyes in suspicion. 

“A bomb,” he answered, “And before you try anything silly, just know that a pull of this trigger will set off the bomb.”

“You’re going to save the world by killing us?!” I asked incredulously. 

“In a matter of fact, yes. Your existence will only mean that their plan can still proceed. Do you know how long it took for them to find such perfect matches?” 

I gawked at his words- it was ridiculous! This must all be a joke, it can’t be real. 

“You’re going to kill a bunch of innocent lives because of your stupid theory!” I cried out in fear. 

This only earned a smile from him. 

“Goodbye Jamie,” 

He pulled the trigger. ",cmint7

I guess that school taught me how to procrastinate to well, and now years later I cannot break this habit. The soft sounds of violin streams from my speakers, filling the room with a quiet peace. As the song dips into a slow and low moment, I think that I hear something from the other room, and so I quickly turn down the volume and listen, and sure enough, I can hear crying from the next room.

I'm out of my chair in an instant, rushing from the room into the living room to see my daughter, sitting in front of the tv, crying. I look at the TV and see the red letters on a black screen, ""Defeat. Continue or Load Save?"" I rush across the room and scoop her up in my arms, ""What's the matter princess?"" I ask, cradling against her against my chest. She wraps her arms around me, and her sobbing is quickly reduced and she says, ""I suck!"" I smile and pull her back so I can look her in the eyes, ""Now, what makes you think that you suck?"" She points at the screen and says, ""I keep making mistakes and dieing!""

I put her back down gently on the floor, and reach over to pull out my controller, powering it on with my thumb, and sit down next to her and say, ""Now that's the silliest thing I've ever heard, and you know I'm well over a hundred!"" she laughs at this, a small tiny one, but a laugh nonetheless, ""Do you know what we call people who have never made a single mistake ever?""

She is at a jumping puzzle point in the game, and so I understand entirely why she was upset, I also hated jumping puzzles and the apple doesn't fall far from the tree. We both make our way down a path, and then step on a very narrow log that led across the stream. She accidently steps to the left and falls off, dieing, and I instantly jump off the edge too, ""Whoops. Looks like I messed up"" and then I look over at her and say, ""Oh hey, so did you. What can we learn from this?"" She laughs and says, ""Water will kill you?"" I join her in laughing and say, ""Okay, so how do we avoid the water?"" She thinks for a little bit and says, ""We could go slower, make sure if we make a bad step we can always fix it?"" I hit the Continue button and say, ""That's a very wise decision, lets try it."" We go much slower this time, creeping our way across the log to the other side.  When we get to the side, there is a ledge that we need to jump on, and she runs up to the ledge and jumps, but she can't seem to make it to the other side, I join her in jumping a few times and then I say, ""Okay, what can we learn from this?"" She jumps up a few times, pressing the A really hard and then says, ""I don't think we can make this jump."" I wait patiently and she continues, ""So it's probably not where we are supposed to get up from."" 

I turn and look at a rock off to the side and say, ""Do you think we could make that rock?"" I already know that this is where we need to go, but I want her to learn, not just follow. She jumps up a few times in the air and then says, ""I guess there is only one way to find out."" She runs over to the rock and jumps up on top of it with ease, and then jumps onto the ledge, and I say, ""Wow, you are already a pro"" and hold out my real life hand for a high five. She slaps my hand and smiles and I jump up to join her. We work out way up the wall, falling off several times but working together to reach the top. We eventually get stuck at a point, and I remember that there was something special that you were supposed to do, but I always had to google the answer. We both spend time jumping towards various points, failing to make it anywhere, until we eventually run out of places to try and I ask, ""So what should we do now?""

I'm hoping that she will want to look it up online, find a solution to a problem, but instead she walks around the ledge a few times, looking over the edge, and then she looks at me and says, ""Sometimes you've gotta fail right?"" and then leaps off the ledge. I rush over to the ledge to jump off after her, ready to fail with her, when I see that she's landed on an outcropping not too far away, and she exclaims, ""Hey! I found a cave that we missed."" Oh yeah, that's right. There was a hidden cave half way up that you were supposed to find. I look over at her in amazement, she didn't even need to look at a guide. I jump down off the ledge and say, ""Okay, lead on expert!"" and we head off into the cave together, her tears long forgotten.

It’s a sick sight to see, the kinda thing that would’ve driven people mad in the past—but we gotta keep moving, and he’s gotta keep growing up. We don’t got time to hide the horrors of the world.

He falls onto his face, and when he stands back up, he’s covered in blood. I shake my head, crouching down and holding my hands out, motioning for him to hurry up. If he can make it all the way to me, it’ll be first time.

Off in the distance, tires screech, causing me to perk up. Fearful screams are drowned out by gunshots and riotous laughter. Someone’s coming, and if they see us, we’re dead. Scavengers are vicious bastards. I don’t grab my son, but I whisper-yell some more. This may be wrong, but he’s gotta have a survival instinct. Gotta know we can’t ever afford to mess around, else we’ll be killed.

The car’s closer, but so’s my son. He’s almost in my arms, wearing a proud smile. He’s so close I could grab him, but that wouldn’t be honest. More gunshots. Louder and louder. I don’t know if they’re scaring him because he doesn’t slow down in the slightest.

Second he reaches me, I scoop him up and jump behind the nearest wall, leaving my rifle behind. My son’s giggling softly, but I pat his head, letting him know he needs to be quiet as the car pulls up. A second later, and he would’ve been dead. Me too, because I wouldn’t have left him.

They snatch the rifle, and after looting some of the bodies, speed off. I take a deep breath as I rock him back and forth. He’s asleep now. Today’s just another day out here, in nowhere. Another day in a world without rules.

And I’m just a father trying to prepare his son for *everything.*

[WP] The secret city.,secondaccount219893,"Johnny couldn't believe he had finally found it.

Johnny turned around, making sure that the rest of expedition was seeing what he was seeing. Amanda's eyes were jumping between the map and the huge gates that stood in front of the group. The thump of Rubin's machete against the jungle floor was deafening as the rest of team stared in awe at the large bronze structures that protruded from seemingly never ending flora.

Johnny was at a loss for words. Turning his head back towards the secret city, he realised that his life's work might finally have paid off.

""It's..."" Johnny started with a pause. ""It's real Johnny, it's real"" Amanda continued, placing her arm around Johnny's shoulders. 

""Yeah, you're not the quack job I thought you were Jono"" Rubin interrupted. ""I thought I'd get paid for hacking through this god forsaken jungle then spend some quality time with some local women but now I've got to make sure you two don't get the rest of these clueless dorks killed"". 

Rubin picked up his machete as the remaining expedition members finally started to snap out of their collective daze.

""All right everyone"" Johnny barked in a manner that he thought would hide his excitement. ""Now that we've found it, we've got to study the secret city. Amanda and I will be overseeing most of the work you'll be doing. 

This area outside the main bronze gates will be our base of operations. We will set up camp here, and will go on daily expeditions into the city with the relevant gear and enough rations to survive for two days, in case of emergencies.""

""In case of emergencies?"" replied Santiago. Santiago and Lorenzo were the local experts on the secret city. They had both studied archaeology extensively, but their English was worse than Johnny's Portuguese, meaning that a translator was frequently needed.

""Em case de perigo"" Rubin said at about three quarter speed.

Lorenzo shook his head ""No no no, we understand the English. We don't understand the danger. What is going to be dangerous ?""

""Well we are not entirely sure, but better to be too cautious than too gung-ho"" Amanda responded.

Lorenzo and Santiago both nodded in a way that confided neither affirmation nor understanding.

""So Lorenzo and Santiago, setup your tent with the archaeological tools outside. Rubin, do whatever it is I paid you to do""

""And me?"" 

Dennis had been so quiet that he had almost disappeared. 

""Dennis, you setup the scanning and cataloging tools, along with anything else you need. Rubin will be able to help you with getting a generator going if you need it.""

Dennis nodded thoughtfully whilst biting his tongue in between his lips.

""Amanda and I will go over the chart and plan out our journey tomorrow.""
""OK everyone well get to it"" echoed Amanda.

Everyone dispersed and setup their own tents. The tents weren't cheap, but it wasn't exactly comfortable living. Johnny and Amanda setup the large tent that they intended to use for planning. They heard Santiago and Lorenzo's archaeology tools clatter around and Rubin laughing at Dennis for forgetting to turn his scanners at the socket. 

As night fell, the clearing outside the large bronze gates now looked like a futuristic campsite. Along with the archaeological tools, Rubin had brought his cooking stove so that the expedition could enjoy good wholesome food. 

With the group eating just outside the gates, Dennis slurped a large spoonful of soup and asked ""Hey Johnny, why do they call it the secret city? I mean why not the lost city or the hidden city?""
Johnny had never really given much thought to it, which having spent the majority of his life searching the Americas for the secret city, seemed somewhat silly.
""Well"" started Johnny, ""a secret is something that you know but can't tell anyone else. So maybe other people ...""

Johnny immediately froze. He realised they weren't the first people to find the secret city. There must have been others that had come here before him.

""Amanda, get my flashlight"" Johnny yelled.

Amanda promptly pulled out Johnny's miniature flashlight from his satchel. 

""Why do you want it?"" Amanda replied

Johnny shone the light at the large bronze gate that delineated the clearing from the other large bronze structures. 
""Johnny, that is the same gate as before. What are you doing?"" Amanda said

""I can't believe we didn't notice. I... I am so sorry."" quivered Johnny

""Sorry for what you numskull ?!"" barked Rubin 

Johnny was not shining the flashlight at the bronze gate, but the structures behind the large metallic gate.
""Those pipes behind the gate aren't made of copper. They were reflecting the colour of the sunset when we got here.""

""So what colour are they? What does this have to do with anything?"" replied Rubin

""They're white. They're made of bone.""

Santiago and Lorenzo both mutter ""merda"" under their breath.

""Why are they swearing Johnny?!"" asked Rubin, more frantically than ever.

""Most archaeologists know that bones discolour very quickly."" Amanda replied.

""So they're either very fresh or someone is maintaining them to keep them white"" added Johnny.

""Big whoop, so maybe this isn't your secret city, but who cares if they look after some animal bones"" snorted Rubin

Johnny looked at Rubin sternly, replying ""This is the secret city. And they're not animal bones. The reason this city is a secret is not because nobody found it, but because nobody has been able to leave.""

"[WP] Your single father has raised you and your many siblings with a caring and involved hand... but as you look around at your incredibly successful siblings, experts in their respective fields, you realize your father has raised you all to take over the world.",ImperialArmorBrigade,"**Before the story starts, I slightly misread the prompt, but the story still follows the idea.**

I have huge respect for my father, having raised all five of us on his own, He would haggle in any way he could to keep us from starving. Despite his questionable actions to keep us alive, he raised us damn well. The oldest of us, my sister became a businesswoman, she’s the CEO of Dawn Corp; the world’s most successful technology company, as well as owning a plethora of other businesses that are far too many to list in a reasonable amount of time. My older brother became a scientist of sorts. He developed cures for the world’s worst diseases and made breakthroughs which brought humanity to a new age. The youngest two, the twins, became movie stars. Combined, they had over thirty awards. We were known as ‘The world’s family’. I suppose that was because just about the whole world knew our names.

I wasn’t like my siblings, however. My father always told me *I* was destined for something more than everyone else, but I never believed him. I was much later to my destiny than my brothers and sisters… they got a lot of the glory whilst I sat in the shadows. As the years went by, my father began to lose the energy he once had. I was the one to look after him. After all, my other siblings had important things to attend to. As a result, I stayed with him for many years longer and learnt much more from this wise old man. I realised just how similar we were. We both had a way with words, able to get what we wanted. I noticed his sneaky tricks when he wanted a discount on some watch or a fancy pendant. It would almost always work. Once he even managed to sell his old phone to a fast food restaurant manager *and* get a free side of fries with his discounted burger. He died at the mere age of 67, from a rare disease my brother so frantically tried to cure. It left all of us devastated. In his will, he gave most things to me, along with a letter.

*My son,*
*I know you don’t believe me when I say*
*that you are you are capable of much more*
*then your brothers and sisters, but I didn’t*
*raise you on my own to let your siblings*
*have the spotlight. Call me a fool, but you* 
*have my greatest qualities, and other I*
*wish I had. There is something deep inside*
*you, that will awaken, and you will echo*
*throughout history, my dear boy.*

It was short, but what my father told me in that letter spoke to me. Even in death, he held me up high. In those days after his death, I believed I was capable of much more, and his words changed not just my life, but the world as we knew it. It came to my attention that my siblings were merely the stepladder for my success. My sister’s money, my brother’s respect, and the twins’ publicity. I managed to put it all together, my father, a manipulative mastermind, who simply too busy leading us to a destiny greater than any other. I honed the ability my father gave me, the ability to get what I want. He always hinted that the others where a means for me to take my place, I only noticed it then. It made sense to me. *I* was much more, *I* would do greater things.
Today, as I reminisce tales of my father, I sit atop the world. Higher than my siblings, Higher than anyone ever has. I am the one who every emperor, every dictator, every tyrant in history wished they were. I rule the world with a cold iron fist and a warm heart of gold. Every country is a puppet of my authority. Though they continue to be independent, I am the supreme ruler. I decide which wars are won and which are lost, which nations prosper, and which ones crumble, which leaders rise, and which ones fall. It is I, the benevolent king of humanity, who decides fate. And my father would be proud.

It was normally considered a patient being, but facing humans had become so tiresome that Xd&gt; felt it needed to forsake its duty and simply rest a while.

“Ex-dee-sheeww. Wake up over there. We have 14 more gardenias to plant.” Xd&gt;’s boss, Cathy, shouted. 

Cathy’s face was weathered from years of landscaping work. Her heavy jaw, leathery skin, and piercing grey eyes seemed formidable, but she was truly a softy. She had adopted three misfit Trogolins--the Earthling name for the aliens who had become marooned on Earth in the “UFO Incident of 2052”--and had tried to teach them her trade. They didn’t take to it right away. They were a strange peoples who seemed to view the world the way a computer might. Or so it seemed to her.

“Oh, not now,” Cathy mumbled to herself. Xs\[\[ was toppled over in the grass, leaking a beige substance onto the newly-planted spray-rosebush. “Ex-ess-dih-dih, what on Earth do you think you’re doing?”

*Sometimes I think these Troggies are a bit more trouble’n they’re worth.* She bit her tongue. Hard.

*Not nice, Cathy. They are so far from home. You’re just a few miles away from your TV and your delicious Insta-Cook Escargots and your Tempurpedic bed. They are at least 44 billion miles (*or was it light years? She could never remember the difference*) away from all they...loved...or...at least...liked?*

The truth is, Cathy wasn’t sure what the Trogolins thought about anything. They didn’t, as a rule, express themselves much. And Cathy had learned that it was dangerous to tempt one towards self-reflection. So, when she asked Xs\[\[ what it thought it was doing--rather, what on *Earth* it thought it was doing--she didn’t realize that she had gone too far. 

A wild screeching sound interrupted Cathy’s pruning of the nearest newly-planted gardenia bush. She looked around wildly, feeling as though a tornado might be barreling through at any moment. Instead, she saw Xd&gt; float up to her right side and felt, rather than heard, it say, “Boss Cath-ee. You have found us amusement for days and perhaps years on Planet One-One-Seven, Earth, but with this question you have gone far too far. We do not know what we are doing on One-One-Seven. We may no longer be near your body, as your body’s brain seems to create torture-puzzles for our peoples. Xs\[\[ is leaking life force because of your body’s brain. We leave now.”

Cathy scowled, confused and hurt by her friend? or her employee’s? words. “Well, okay Ex-Dee-Sheeww, but where are you going to go now?”

Xd&gt; processed her last question. Where. Now. Go. Now. Where. Now. Now. 

“Nooowwww” Cathy heard it hiss as it, and its two companions, Xd\[\[ and fFf\^, started to sink into her client’s grass. 

She finally heard a POP when the three beings fully disappeared. *What the…*

She looked around and saw that the colors of the flowers were brighter, the willow tree was swaying even without any wind, and the koi fish in the pond were all staring at her. 

On the ground she saw three old smartphones, and no sign of her friends.

“Aw hell. I need a beer.”",cat-pants

He got his chances and now was being faced with the ultimate punishment.

Nobody knew what the government did to the crupples it gave up on. They left to some city and were never heard of again. Most believed that the government had some brain chemical in the city that made the residents slaves. Nobody dared investigate, fearing the same chemicals. And today, 0x44212a4 thought, was his turn to be dosed.

The guards who escorted him were normal. The vehicle nondescript. The ride was mundane. Then he entered the city. He sniffed. The air was not different. He looked around. He pondered. He imagined his crimes. Nothing changed. He was escorted out of the car. The office he entered might as well have been for tax collectors. Even the room he was finally deposited at was dull. May be he was to be bored to death?

A noble man entered, demonstrating age in his slow gait and his long service for the government with the medals floating just above his head.

""Hello Forry."" Forry, too used to being 0x44212a4, did not recognize his name.

""Hi... Hello, sir.""

""I am Absey and I am to brief you, briefly, on our stay in Whispille."" Forry nodded. ""I presume you have heard about the mind control and related nonsense?"" Forry nodded sheepishly. ""Of course, you'll know that that's all propaganda written to keep people out."" Though Forry nodded, Absey did not wait. ""If only we administer mind control drugs. The reality is a little more bleak, and such that I cannot explain. You will be given a house, meals, and a holoscreen. Should you try to kill yourself, you will be tied up so that all you can do is observe the screen and write. What we want from you is 10000 words in an alien language. These aliens are top secret residents 4 million light years away. We bend space-time to intercept these broadcasts to ensure that they are not hostile. They are of far superior intellect. Needless to say, this is a dangerous mission, so much so that only wastrels like you are wasted on it. I'll personally show you to your home.""

Forry remembered this innocence. The thought that he might eventually be free. The thought that he was going to be fed and healthy. The thought that suicide would not occur to him. It was all meaningless, he recalled, passing out from another migraine.

Forry blinked. No meaning. None he could describe. He could shout it and only the walls would hear. He tried to starve himself just to get a person to come in so that he could tell them. He passed out.

What was good? Was Forry bad? Was Forry? Darkness.

Outside was good. Home was good. Not being marked as a cripple was good. It was - another coma.

8980 words. None of them could mean anything. Not to Forry. He shouted again, just in pain and confusion. It had no meaning. Cripple 0x44212a4 knew it was over.",hugogrant

They call us the whispering race.",ThreeDucksInAManSuit,"“Come on, I ain’t got all day” the Golagan mugger said, while pointing his gun at me and at Ryve.

It’s been almost four years since I started hitchhiking across the galaxy. Meeting new creatures, planets, cultures... it was awesome, even though I always traveled alone.

That changed when I went to Eonus, home-world of the Denn race. The Denns were famous for having the best bars in their solar system (which was immense), so they were always crowded with tourists, hitchhikers, and the like. That’s how I met Ryve.

Ryve was a female Fluxan, from Desppot. The Fluxans look remarkably similar to humans - in fact, it wasn’t uncommon that other aliens confused the two - but Fluxans have a skin more pink than humans, varying from baby peach to bubblegum pink. Ryve had peach skin, and violet eyes (like most Fluxans). The only thing unusual about her was her fiery-red hair, which was about as rare for Fluxans as it was for humans.

Ryve *claims* she started talking to me just because she was tired of people coming up and hitting on her, but I know better. She always was the curious type.

Though I can’t deny that it wasn’t a good excuse. Aliens felt... uncomfortable around humans. Not exactly *afraid* (mostly), but no alien would feel safe while talking with a human, and *actively starting a conversation?* Forget about it. Our reputation didn’t allow it to happen. 

Sure enough, no other alien so much as looked at her while we were talking. We liked each other’s personalities, and she was also a hitchhiker, so after two lonely years, I finally found a traveling companion.

Fast forward to now: we were visiting Foffl, in spite of knowing full well the Golagans as a whole weren’t very hospitable or sympathetic. Their hideous faces made them somewhat of an outcast race among the intergalactic community, so it wasn’t rare to see a criminal Golagan roaming about. Just as we were about to leave, this ass came and cornered us with a gun.

“All right, all right. No need for violence.” Ryve said carefully, while slowly pulling her wallet out and giving it to him. I did the same. Most of our money was stored in the intergalactic credit card anyway, which we could disable and transfer to another one as soon as we got away from this stupid planet.

“You think I’m stupid? You’re gonna disable this card as soon as you’re outta here” the mugger said angrily.

Ryve shrugged. “That’s all we have.”

“Oh, I don’t think so.” The Golagan said with an evil smile. Then he pointed the gun at Ryve. “You stay.”

“What? What’re you going to do, kidnap her? What will you do then?” I inquired.

“Oh, I can think of some things...” the mugger answered with a grin. I suddenly understood what he meant, as did Ryve.

“Hey, hold up. You’re not gonna just-“ Ryve started, before getting punched in the face by the Golagan. She was knocked back, falling from the force of the punch. Her nose immediately started bleeding.

“Ryve!”

“I’m fine. Just... broke my nose” she said groggily, and put her hands over her nose. I could feel the rage building within me. That bastard was gonna pay.

“Ryve, white noise.” I said calmly. Thankfully she understood what I meant, she had earphones on for events like those. She tapped them, and they started humming in her ear. She could no longer hear what anyone was saying. I turned to face the Golagan. He was pointing his gun at me.

“If you wanna live, you’ll get outta-“

“Y’know, this could be a dream.”

“What?” He looked confused.

“Everything that’s happening right now... could be just your imagination. There’s no way to prove I exist.”

“Wh-what? Of course you exist. I’m seeing you.”

“And what does that prove? You could be hallucinating right now, and you’d never know the difference.”

“Well... well I-“

“As a matter of fact”  I continued, “there’s no way for you to know if anything is real. Maybe you’re the only conscience that exists, and everything you see and feel could be just your mind trying to feel something.”

The Golagan wasn’t talking now. He was mesmerized. Grinning, I thought it was almost *too* easy. He could just shoot me now, but yet he still wants to know where I’m going with this. Aliens are interested in those matters just as humans are, but they can’t handle the existencial crisis.

Even Earth scientists can’t say why can humans handle this sort of thing. Is it the structure of the brain? Cultural evolution? Something deeper? Whatever the reason, when humans first tried to have philosophical conversations with aliens, all of them have gone insane. That’s why humans have such a morbid reputation. ‘The whispering race’, they call us. I normally refrain from such cruelty, but this asshole... he’s just asking for it.

A pained moan from Ryve reminds me she’s still injured. I feel bad for forgetting her. It’s time to end it.

“And from my point of view” I say softly, “You’re a fruit of *my* imagination, and you can’t prove otherwise.”

That’s too much for him to handle. He drops his gun, collapses and starts making incoherent sounds. I signal to Ryve, and she turns the earphones off. I help her get up.

“It’s ok. I have medicine... in my backpack” she says while holding her nose. I search it and find an ointment for broken bones. I apply some on her nose after cleaning the blood, and she sighs in relief as the remedy does its magic. In that aspect, humans are *very* primitive.

When making our way to the next planet on that system at the back of a spaceship which agreed to give us a lift, I could see Ryve was barely controlling herself. She knew it was dangerous to talk with me about it, but she was so obviously curious it almost hurt to see her like that. At last, she couldn’t hold herself back.

“Ben?” she called, and I looked at her.

“Yeah?”

“What do you talk about, that’s drives us nuts?”

“You know I can’t tell.”

“Just the general idea. No details” she implored. I was really hesitant, but...

“Well, generally about logic at the edge of  science and outside of it.”

“Logic outside of science? Where does that come in?”

“Philosophy, spirituality, religion... that kind of stuff.”

“What’s philosophy?” she asks.

“A branch in the study of meaning.”

“Meaning? Of what?”

“The meaning of existence” I say, uncomfortably. This is getting dangerous.

Ryve seems very confused. “Th-the meaning... of existence? But... but how...” she started stuttering. Oh no.

“Hey, stop! Snap out of it!” I say, shaking Ryve, but she seems lost in thoughts. I start panicking.

“STOP!” I cry, and slap her. She immediately wakes up from the trance, and starts rubbing her cheek.

“Ow.”

“Sorry, I panicked” I say, embarrassed.

“It’s... it’s okay. Thanks” she says. “That was... really weird. You do this all the time in your planet?”

“Yeah. We don’t get hypnotized like you, but it confuses even us, sometimes. It’s complicated.”

“Damn.” she simply says.  After some time, she looks out the window.

“Well, that’s our stop. You coming?”

“Yeah.”

They call us the whispering race.",ThreeDucksInAManSuit,"Whispering race, those who stare, kings and queens of the deep thoughts-we’re called many things. 

Why is a strange story. 

Our first contact had been with the Ionians. We only called them that because they had set up a small outpost on Io, but they let us call them that. To them, we were a small, primitive, eager race. So, they sent us a signal telling us they were there, and with instructions on how to use our current tech to create a communications relay to speak to them. Scientific development flourished, and we began setting up based on Mars and Venus. Oh boy, we found weird stuff on Venus, but that’s another story. 

We got wind of how different we were when a scientist that was a little too tired began talking to an Ionian from a small ship mining resources in the asteroid belt. The Ionian asked who Nietzsche was, and that’s when it really went down. The scientist dropped a few quotes, but the line that broke the Ionian’s mind was the good old I Stared Into The Abyss And The Abyss Stared Back. It was like a thought virus spreading among them afterwards, until they figured out the phrase that caused it. They didn’t cut us off, surprisingly. Rather, they realized we were practically a super weapon. They contacted a few other races, and then we learned the full scale of what was going on. 

A giant collection of species, which we termed The Pantheon, was going about the galaxy with god-like technology, and the Ionians and their friends were the only races left. Except us. They sent us some physical reports of their anatomy, which is where we figured it all out. Something on our planet had caused our brains to develop very, very differently from every other species out there, making us the only ones capable of self-reflection. Other species’ brains, when exposed to this, attempted to process something they physically couldn’t, and often nearly tore themselves apart. Technologically, we couldn’t hold a dying candle to The Pantheon. But with this, we could wipe them out. 

That’s what the plan was. And so, in an effort between six species including us, operation Worm’s Whisper was launched. All we needed was one Pantheon ship. Luckily enough, one crashed into Mars a few days after we launched the operation. We hijacked the radio and patched our way into their system, and began whispering. 

See where the nickname comes from? 

We would randomly send signals through, various philosopher’s world and quotes. Reports of The Pantheon tearing itself apart and self-destructing began surfacing, and as we expanded further through our system and started to move beyond, we saw it firsthand. Then we launched the final one. 

We waited three months, long enough for them to forget, and then sent a message to all Pantheon radios. First off, a message to leave now if you wanted to live. Then we sent The Matrix through. 

Okay, sure, we got a little cocky. Worked astoundingly, though. Within four hours, The Pantheon had disintegrated, and we had stolen their tech. Black hole guns, pocket dimension generators, cold fusion reactors, all of it. 

Were we regaled with suspicion? Of course. But we also had a bit of advice for everyone. 

If you hear whispers, don’t try to listen. You don’t know what they’ll say.

The first patient that visited us, in a run-down alleyway on a tropical planet of the Andromeda galaxy, was a member of the Qual-tar-asra race, a bisexual insectoid lifeform.

*I never met my broodmother! We never meet the ones who breed. I was adopted to the Asdarla warrior tribe.* 

&amp;#x200B;

""Ah..that's it! The failure to meet your broodmother is the problem. You see, there exists a part of our psyche that yearns for the maternal touch, that needs to be fulfilled in order for it to resolve itself. The rest of your brood did not suffer from the problems, right?""

""You suffer from a problem of deviancy. Look, here, in our minds, in our spirits, we are all born different, each of us having different desires. You, sire, have an infliction of maternal desires. Contact with your maternal mother should fix the problem.

"[WP] The intergalactic community at large, while highly intelligent, never developed any kind of philosophy or spirituality. A five minute conversation with a human on the wrong topic can send most aliens into an existential crisis so severe they go insane. They call us the whispering race.",ThreeDucksInAManSuit,"It was mesmerizing to witness a debate between Philosophers. The Whispering Race had long ago become immune to considering the laws of universe, though exactly what it is they speak is... difficult to explain. My mentor claimed that it was explaining not the *what*, when*, and *how* but the *why*. I tried to press further, but he refused me. “I already drove one pupil mad,” He solemnly said. “But not again.”


I digress, back to the debate. The peoples of Earth, Humanity, could apparently contemplate the universe in ways scientists or even my races prestigious engineers could not truly fathom. Masters of this craft, the ‘philosophers’ were naturally masters of word craft normally, though their wisdom surpassed the cold hard logic quantum AI’s could not predict.


I sit now among peers from dozens of other races watching two such masters in the midst of an argument. We had been selected for our mental fortitude and unique way of thinking. Despite this (and the vast amount of genetic, cybernetic, and pharmaceutical improvements we receive throughout our training) it was mandatory that any and all translation devices be not only turned off but removed from the room, as well as all recording devices. The Philosophers sparred word for word, sentence for sentence, and I felt the power behind every one.


I saw how they seemingly danced with speech, when one made a point over their opponent, when an impasse was reached and a new rout was plotted in the conversation. The language they spoke in (as most languages of their kind) sung and echoed across the hall, and for a moment I could *see*. It makes no sense to you, but I understood what they meant, if only a sliver.


It was then I began to understand. I know no other non-human had done so before with out falling within the throes of insanity. It is something I face everyday, and something all humans face, even some succumbing to. It saddens me to know their might be no others to follow after me. But I hope that perhaps one day, one day, maybe we ourselves could learn to master that tiny sliver of understanding.
