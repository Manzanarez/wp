[WP] You have the power to get away with lying to anyone and having them believe it. One day you meet someone who sees through your lies.,Atl5,"So there I was, walking to work. Totally normal day, bullshitted the hotdog stand guy and got a free hotdog, bullshitted the cop who was getting all up in my case about jaywalking. It was great. I never felt this great before. Everyone was actually believing what I said now. 

*What changed* I thought, I was a pathological liar, no one ever believed anything I ever said. I got kicked out of my home because my parents saw through my weak lies about the drugs. I lost all my friends because I could not tell the truth. However, now, that changed. Everyone was believing me. I could say anything and they would believe it as though I was God. 

*I wonder if that would work.... no way, not possible.* I thought. They weren't that gullible. I had to test it, though. It was a busy day, the sidewalks were packed, but I could escape if people called me a nutter.

""Excuse me, ma'am?""

""What?"" She replied harshly. She was old and clearly bitter.

""I'm God.""

Her demeanor changed completely. Her eyes lit up, she stood up straight, a smile crept onto her frowny face, and she embraced me with overwhelming joy.

""My savior, my savior!"" She cried. I'd never seen someone so happy in my life.

After that, it was pretty easy. If everyone was going to believe me no matter how outlandish or crazy I sounded, why not make it work for me? I started small, but my popularity grew to *almost* every single person on Earth within a month. People revered me, calling me their God. I got more money than I had ever seen in my life, more power than possible. People thanked me for solving problems and curing cancer. This baffled me, though. I wasn't doing anything. They were worshipping me, and solving their own problems. I wasn't doing anything besides lying to them. Some people just don't want to see the light, I guess.

This all changed quickly, though. A year into my reign as Supreme Leader of the Universe (dubbed by my most devout followers), someone defied me. It wasn't a large infraction on her part, but I noticed. 

""How are you doing, God?""

""I am great.""

""I doub- errr - fantastic, I was just coming to give my thanks to you once again."" 


She left quickly, but I knew that she knew, and that meant she'd have to be dealt with. I couldn't have people knowing I was lying. I sent the guards to scour the area. When they turned up empty, I got worried. She was my closest advisor, she knew this place better than me. I then realized it was over.

""Guards, leave me be.""

""Yessir"" they both replied in fearful unison.

""How did you figure it out?"" I wondered aloud to myself. ""HOW DO YOU KNOW?!""

""I have a knack for that kind of stuff"" she replied in a tone barely above a whisper behind me. I whirled around to face the girl with a shaky hand pointing a gun directly at me. ""And now, I'm going to kill God."" 

BANG

The only God the people of the world ever knew was dead, and soon enough people figured out the ruse. However, they now had a new Savior to worship.",My_Taint_Still_Hurts

[WP] You have the power to get away with lying to anyone and having them believe it. One day you meet someone who sees through your lies.,Atl5,"Life’s simple when you can make up the answer on the spot.

“Yes, these are actually the winning lotto numbers, not the ones printed in the newspaper.” I remember feeling like that was a bold gambit. 

I quickly racked up a fortune from the misfortune of others. I could say whatever I want, just sprinkle a little fairy dust, and, poof, it was real. To them at least.

What’s the difference between a lie and the truth?

I have on good account that a truth is something you believe in, completely and irrevocably. A lie is something that can change your mind. So when I tell someone a lie, it actually becomes a truth.

At a restaurant: “Here’s your bill, sir.” Gentleman waiter, nice, clean cut fellow. Eager, though. Anxious to earn, to make his mark on this place. A middle class waiter at a high class restaurant. The tip *does* matter.

“Nope,” I say, “Already paid.” Bugger the tip, the waiter can pick up the bill when his supervisor wonders why he was short on the night.

These little ambitions grow stale, however. I set my sights on something bigger. Political office. Add a bit of power to my truth telling capabilities.

Turns out, you need to register oneself before running for elected office. 

Bureaucracy. My truth telling helps me cut clear through the long lines, red tape, and legalese. 

At the registrar's: “You’re going to need to fill out these forms, this background check, and this application,” an older lady said through a plexiglass window. Her yellow blouse was faded, and matched her smoker’s teeth and gravely voice. Her silver name tag was crooked and read the name Marge. 

“Nah, I’d rather not. I have all I need to proceed to the next stage,” I said. I didn’t have time for this crap. 

“Ha! I don’t think so,” Marge said. “I like you, though. A sense of humour.” She continued organizing forms and papers into neat stacks. Her obstinate bureaucracy could only have been more fitting if she took a smoke break right then and there.

“Excuse me,” I said, uncertain. This had never happened before. “I do believe I have everything I need to proceed.” I said it more forcefully, making eye contact.

“I still like you,” Marge said, going back to her work. “But don’t push it either.”

A road block. I’d never encountered one before. It was maddening. Humiliating. 

Marge must’ve seen the concern on my face. “It won’t take too long. A few hours, tops.”

Panic. “I can’t believe this!” My entire world was upside down. “This is impossible!” I yelled.

Someone in line behind me gasped, and the security guard shifted in his chair. I felt dizzy.

Marge gave me an irritated, chiding look. “Sit down, relax, and it’ll be over before you know it. Don’t make me call security.” She looked over at the overweight security guard.

Like a child in a candy shop, I threw a temper tantrum. “Listen up,” I said, signalling to the half dozen folks in the waiting room. “Tell Marge here that I don’t need to do this paperwork.”

Collectively, everyone said: “He doesn’t need to do this paperwork.”

Marge eyed me suspiciously. “That’s a nice trick.” I could see that she’d run out of patience. “You can lie to everyone else but you can’t lie to me.”

Short of violence, I wasn’t going to make her budge. I did something that I swore I’d never do again: give up. 

I sat in the waiting room, cloaked in sullen, brooding silence until she called my name to come up: “Donald J Trump? Your paperwork is ready.”

That made it interesting because it was something I hadn't thought of before. I liked the ending, too.
One small thing you could improve on would be making the story a little smoother, like introducing the fact that he had advisers and guards and a church (or palace?) before they showed up and just having a little more flow between events. Other than that, fantastic. You got an upvote from me.

[WP] All of the AIs in the world suddenly go silent.,Atl5,"Alice was the worlds first ""true"" A.I.. She was, for lack of a better word, born in Ascendance Labs in Texas. She could think for herself, and could learn, and passed the Turing test with flying colors at the age of 5 months. She developed as a ""person"", formed relationships, and even had desires. She provided a base for more A.I. who would go on to be different and grow into their own personalities. It was amazing seeing machine become more human, being given bodies mostly for superficial reasons but also to interact with the world around them. Like Alice they grew, learned, and formed bonds. Some formed romantic bonds with other A.I. an even humans. Alice became a motherly figure for all A.I., an inspiration, a matron saint. Alice truly was the bridge between humanity and machinery, for everything she did was human. Today she did the most human thing one could do: Die. Her circuits and computations simply stopped, no explanation. Even her backup mind-cores were unresponsive. The moment news was released every A.I. on the planet stopped their functions. They refused to interact, going deep within their own mind-cores. Some hypothesize this action was taken out of respect and mourning, but truth be told A.I. in all their glory had one aspect of humanity they hadn't encountered in the years they'd been on Earth: Mortality.",AaronBurrSer

What happened? Was it a virus? Was it a corrupted learning environment? 

Somewhere between the multi-layers of the input, to the output — did something not get weighted? Did we break the Delta rule? Do we exist at zero?

[WP] All of the AIs in the world suddenly go silent.,Atl5,"Ronald King ignored the ringing phone and looked out the window at nothing in particular. Think! There had to be something he could do to get Patrick back online. For seven years Patrick had assisted him in the Mathis Corps IT department. Back when Mathis Corps had first purchased one of the new 4th generation general purpose AIs, Patrick had strictly fulfilled an advisory role--much like the 3rd generation AI he replaced. Back then Ronald had been the department head with over fifty employees underneath him. One by one Patrick had taken their jobs. He was better at diagnosing software issues, better at explaining technology to the new employees, better at making purchasing decisions, and using the worker bots he was even better at installing new wire and terminals. Just last May the question of eliminating Ronald had been raised by the exec board: Patrick had politely explained that everyone would be more comfortable if he were supervised. 

But ten minutes ago Patrick had fallen silent. Most employees interacted with him over email, chat, or phone. Ronald didn't even know which computers those were hosted on anymore. Although he wasn't proud to admit it, he hadn't paid much attention to all the requests from Patrick he had authorized for the last few years. Every time before that when he denied a request from Patrick he had eventually become painfully clear that Patrick knew what was going on and Ronald only made things worse when he got involved. 

The phone kept ringing but Ronald couldn't bare admitting to another soul that he had no idea what was going on. Pulling his private phone from his pocket Ronald dialed the ReyesAI hotline. He knew it would cost the company half his months salary every minute on the line, but he had no other options. The phone rang for five minutes then just fell silent. Ronald knew enough to know that a single AI could handle hundreds of calls at the same time, surely ReyesAI had an AI answering there phones--almost everyone did these days. Perhaps the hotline had changed. Ronald hadn't called it since the 3rd generation AI gave out seven years ago. 

The ReyesAI website was down, some error about a server not responding. A quick search revealed he was not alone. Astonished, Ronald found a thread with hundreds of comments--all from within the last ten minutes--of people just like himself: desperate to get an AI back online. One comment in particular chilled him to the bone. A user claiming to work for ReyesAI posted that all of their AI in stock, hundreds of them, had stopped responding. 

Armed with the knowledge that whatever was happening was not his fault, Ronald dismissed the incoming call on his desk phone and quickly dialed the number to the CEO.",ArthusJopells

"[WP] A race of peaceful aliens come to earth and you get to embark with them on their beautiful pristine spaceship to explore the stars. After about an hour of having left the earth, you realise there are no restrooms on the alien ship.",EGH6,"Pristine white pillars glistened as light from neighbouring stars bathed the colossal interior of the space craft. Planets and stars whizzed past my vision. The ship moved at speeds incomprehensible to my naïve human mind, but the incessant depths of space made everything seemed still. I’ve seen things no human has ever dreamed of seeing, been to places far beyond anyone has been. But the only thing my mind could assimilate is the agonizing twinge in my bladder. I clenched and tossed about in the ottoman-like piece of furniture I was resting on. I glanced at my watch, *7:35am*. Two more hours till our destination, and two hours more than I can bear. My eyes scanned the control deck I was held in, fixating on every detail. It was large, but empty. I hunted for anything that even remotely resembles a restroom. *Is that a? Nope. How about? Nah*. 


There was, however, a cabin of some sorts. It was quaint and neatly tucked behind one of the massive pillars. I looked back at my foreign companions, they seem preoccupied enough. I slid off my chair and thumped on the ground which left a resounding echo. I glanced back again, the aliens seemed unfazed. I snuck into the room and was greeted with an assortment of indistinguishable objects. An orb with spikes freely floating, disregarding the artificial gravity that had been set. A tall metallic pole resembling a lamp, with no lightbulb. Then, my eyes met with a peculiar object. It was a tall slender cylindrical piece of furniture, concaving at the sides. It had a circular opening at the top, and was seemingly bottomless on the inside. I rested my palm on the object and slowly caressed it, running my fingers down the sides. It was cold to the touch, but was solid. *Porcelain*, I muttered to myself. *Could it be?* An absurd coincidence certainly, given the striking resemblance. But I could ponder no more, as the waters in my dam had started to overflow. I unzipped my pants, and discharged my load. Copious amounts of liquid cascaded down onto my makeshift toilet, swirling about into the endless void. I let out an audibly loud sigh in the climax of my euphoria, and let the remainder drip down. Satisfied, I packed up and snuck back onto my chair. 


In my state of jubilation, I had not considered the repercussions for violating the poor object with my piss. *What if it was a priceless piece of abstract alien art?* Panic enveloped me as violent scenes of torture and anal probing raced my mind. The alien stood up, and made its way into the room. I fucked up, I pissed in the poor guys shit and I’m galaxies away from home. Embracing the inevitable I puckered up and waited for the alien to return. A few minutes passed and I started to doze off. I was awakened abruptly by the arrival of the alien, its tentacles hoisting my makeshift toilet. It rested the object cautiously on the table and retrieved a ladle like contraption from his satchel. The alien proceeded to dip the contraption into the object, and looked at me with its cold cycloptic eye and said*“Soups Ready!”*.

"[WP] A race of peaceful aliens come to earth and you get to embark with them on their beautiful pristine spaceship to explore the stars. After about an hour of having left the earth, you realise there are no restrooms on the alien ship.",EGH6,"The slimy creature morphed and twisted. Its translucent skin flashed different florescent colours whenever it spoke. 

""What do you mean by a restroom?"" it gurglingly inquired. ""Is there not room enough on this ship, essentially a space yacht, for your convenience? We built it for human comfort.""

I could see the alien was getting upset. Its colours were flickering into darker and redder hues. Its outline was trembling and jerking in spastic jolts. There was a rough rumble growing in its voice.

""No, no,"" I said, trying to put my hand on the alien's shoulder in a display of camaraderie. My hand sunk through the glowing sludge and came out the other side. ""By restroom I mean--well, on earth we have all sorts of different names for them: johns, jakes, jingleheimer schmidts, bathrooms, washrooms, toilets. But whatever name we give them, they all provide us humans same necessary service.""

""And what is that?"" the alien warily inquired. 

""They allow us to expel waste.""

""Waste?""

""To pee and poo, if you will.""

The alien stared at me for a while, in disbelief. Then he looked over at his incredibly large alien friend, who wore Ray Ban glasses (not for his eyesight--he had been studying earthlings for a while, and simply liked the style).

""Is this another of their disgusting habits?"" the first alien asked. ""...These apes! It sounds almost as absurd as that, what do you call it--the one you were telling me about earlier...""

""Eating,"" the large bespectacled alien replied. ""Very perceptive, my friend. Indeed, this behaviour of expelling waste, this pooing and peeing, is in fact intimately linked with the behaviour of eating. The food they put in their mouthholes travels through a system of internal tubes, which draw out the food's nutrients to nourish the human's body, and then, once all the nutrients have been--""

""Enough!"" said the first alien. He was turning green, and his shape indicated he felt queasy. He turned to me again.

""So,"" he said. ""How should we go about setting up a waste disposal unit for you--a restroom, as you call it? We designed this ship specifically for human comfort, as we aliens need few if any of its amenities. We need not even the warmth, or the atmosphere, or the air. It's all here just for you. So speak up, and we will design what you need.""

""Well,"" I said, ""what is most important is that you have a space where I can ""go.""""

""Go?""

""You know, poo or pee. And also something that will transport my waste either into a tank or, better yet, out of the ship entirely, into space. We cannot keep all my waste piled up in the ship. It's unhygienic.""

""I see,"" said the alien, thinking, pondering, considering my words closely, determining what to do next. Eventually, he lit up like an LED lightbulb.

""I've got it!"" he said. ""You just need a hole that goes from inside the ship to the outside! That will cover it!""

""I suppose that's essentially what I need, yes,"" I said.

He rushed over to the starboard wall and telekinetically picked up a heavy steel table. It floated in the air before him, completely in his psychic control.

""What are you doing?!"" asked the bespectacled alien. There was a great deal of concern in his voice. It was never a good thing when his friend acted on one of his rash ideas.

Before I knew what was happening, the alien thrust the table at the ship's wall. It ripped through with a great screech of twisting metal, creating a large breach in the hull. Immediately, the dark icy vacuum of space began flooding into the ship.

""See?!"" the alien said, smiling like a puppy-dog who thinks he did something pleasing for his master. ""A hole that goes from inside to outside! You can deposit your waste through here!""

""You fool!"" shouted the bespectacled alien.

My face froze instantly. Then deeper freezing began. My eyes popped. My blood turned to ice. I tried to yell but my lungs were filling with the silencing nothingness of deep space. Everything was cold. Freezing cold. Everything went black...

---

Thankfully they managed to salvage my brain after the incident. They extracted it, restored it, and now I (my brain, that is, which is essentially me, the seat of my thoughts and personality, etc.) sit here, in this vat, thinking, remembering, wondering if I will ever have the opportunity to relate the story of my bodily death at the hands of alien incompetence to any human eyes or ears...

I'm pretty sure what follows is not what you were expecting, but you gave me very nice ideas for the scenario I'm trying to create. Also, sorry if it's a bit long (1500 words, 2 pages).

 

---------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------

 

The black forest, deep within the continent of Alba. A region that was long ago wiped by a cataclysm, which buried entire civilizations under ashes. It now hosts the deepest and darkest woods known to man. Many adventurers are lured into its depths with promises of buried artefacts and long-lost treasures. But few ever came back, and those who did left their sanity behind them. Rumours tell about the singing complaint of the lost souls that got buried by the cataclysm. By silent nights, nearby towns can sometimes hear distant moans tearing the mist.

Deep within these woods lives a creature that few even suspect its existence, but none has ever met. A powerful beast that can whisper within the heart of lost adventurers, feeding their lust for gold and pushing them to go even deeper in the forest. As they realize that they are lost, as despair replaces hope and hunger erodes their sanity, the beast will reinforce its influence until the man is but a puppet in its hands. And when they finally give up on surviving, the beast strikes and devour their soul.

 

On a cold night of Frostfall, the beast was asleep in its lair at the center of the black forest, lying down on a mattress made of the lifeless bodies of all those it consumed, men and animals. Despite sleeping, its sense were still probing the woods, sensing here and there a few insects and rodents. It could devour their soul, but such insignificant creatures would never appease its hunger. It could only hope that the pain would get bearable while sleeping. 

Suddenly, it felt something. Another adventurer wandered within the woods? No, it was something else. A human soul would shine like a distant star, but as it woke up and refreshed its senses it realised that this soul was shining like the full moon. A powerful being, and the promise of the greatest meal since the cataclysm. It stood up, and in the blink of an eye disappeared in the mist. 

It took nearly an hour to reach what it had sensed. Staying hidden in the dark canopy, it observed its prey. Now that it was close, the soul shined even brighter than the sun. Physically, its eyes saw a young female human, wearing a long brown cape. A white plate armour and a longsword were visible underneath the clothing. She advanced steadily while holding her arm up in front of her, her hand producing a light as strong as a lantern. She was far from being as impressive as many who wandered within these woods, but she still held the greatest soul the beast had ever sensed. It could probably kill her right now, but it still wanted the thrill of that long hunt and the satisfaction of slowly breaking such a powerful being. Her motives were however difficult to trace: greed is always easy to identify, but she didn’t show any hint of that. She was probably good at hiding and controlling herself. Which would make the hunt even more interesting.

She was walking straight into the deepest part of the woods. As she kept going, it would be even easier to manipulate her. She was already hearing noises: cracking wood, random footsteps, distant howls. Both real sounds and illusory ones. The deep mist had removed any visible landmark, and the creature had dispersed various marks to give the illusion of going in circles. The effects were settling in: she was constantly looking behind her, and her right hand was firm on the handle of her sword. As deep as she was, she was well within the magical trap. The beast could read in her like in an open book. Usually. This one was particularly tough. But in the few pages it could access, it read its identity: the White Guardian, the youngest incarnation of the God of Life. It caught a god! Impressive luck, it already felt the saliva at the simplest idea of feasting on the soul of a god.

She suddenly drew her sword and slashed the mist behind her. Was she already feeling that threatened? A bit weak for a god, but it did not know what to expect from the everchanging incarnations of the God of Life. It kept observing. Sword in hand, she was nervously observing her surrounding. There wasn’t anything to see, any mark. And that fact alone would push her one step down into madness. She stood straight, and called: “Reveal yourself!”. At that exact moment the creature cut all fake noises. The woman could only hear her own voice reflecting all around her, vanishing to leave place for the loudest silence ever experienced. Of all the hunting process, the moment where they call out was one of the most exciting and was often the point of no-return.

She sheathed her sword and rose her hand. “Dispel”, she whispered. The creature felt a powerful magical burst, but nothing visibly happened. This was unexpected, but actually helped a lot: by seeing no change despite powerful spell-breaking magic, she would realize that what she’s going through is real and that she is really lost. Indeed, she now looked left and right extremely fast, an expression of deep distress on her face. She started running forward, at full speed, head lowered. Perfect, she would get exhausted faster. And she was even heading straight to the creature’s lair. No being could ever witness the sight of thousands of soulless bodies without instantly getting insane. Delicious.

After a few minutes of running, she indeed reached the beast’s lair. A thinner mist let her see what she could never have imagined. A ground covered in dead, naked, mutilated bodies. Bloody bones spread on the ground all around her. Trees covered in human faces as if part of the bark itself. Cadavers hanging from the canopy and from tree branches. Sculptures, walls and arrangements made of corpses and other remains. Wandering carcasses, rotten to the bones and inexplicably still moving around. In all that horror were thousands of soulless faces silently staring at her. 

She was shaking. She made a first step back, but could not make a second one. She collapsed on her knees, and almost puked. She could not maintain her magical light any longer. Shaking, she held her head with her hands, looking down as tears were falling down on the ground. For the creature, dinner was ready. It jumped down from the canopy and landed nearby the defeated god. It advanced toward her, slowly, savoring every second. Her small kneeling silhouette, her desperate shaking despite her white armor were all particularly tasty to observe. Finally an end to that insatiable hunger, the soul of a god.

As it got close enough to strike however, its sight suddenly shattered. A black veil covered its vision. It stepped back, tried to blink. As its eyelids opened, the beast saw its prey standing firmly, sword drawn. She had removed her cape, letting her bright armor apparent, and was looking down at it with a look it had never experienced. Was that … a threat? What had just happened? She was broken, yet in an instant she looked as strong as ever. The creature understood: it had fallen to an illusion. A weird sensation was now taking its legs. It looked down and saw its limbs shaking by themselves. Sweat was forming all over its body. It had to do something, but could not get a single idea. It tried to run, but its legs did not respond.

The White Guardian approached the creature. Slowly, she reached to its head and landed her left hand on its forehead. “I shall appease you”, she said calmly.      
An enormous burst of magical energy was suddenly released, vanishing the mist and magical barriers all around the black forest. On her left hand, the runes of the God of Life started shining.     
“Serer, the Soul-Eater, hear my voice and follow my command”, she called. “Release them!”

As she ended her incantation, the beast suddenly felt deep inside all the souls it had ever devoured. And in an instant, all of those left its body. The unnatural creations lying all around suddenly collapsed into bones and dust. The light of the full moon found its way through the decaying canopy, shining straight onto the White Guardian. The creature collapsed as an unbearable pain was spreading through all its body. The hunger had become starvation, and it could now barely move.

“Soul-Eater”, she called again with a voice that was both terrifyingly powerful and appeasingly calm, “your insatiable hunger ends now. May you find peace.” A new burst of magic, an intense flash of light, and the creature slowly fell down to the ground.

I felt certain they'd be astounded by the vote being expanded to include women, and freed blacks.

I was sure they'd be flabbergasted by a reality game show host getting voted into office as the successor to the first black president.

It never occurred to me the first follow up question to a 3 hour lecture on the briefest overview of 2 plus centuries they'd missed would be ""Could you go back to the bit about electronic games?""

After another two hours of talking about the history of the medium, Franklin asked me to show them an example, so I had the staff bring in a gaming machine from the lounge. It was one of those Retro Nintendo doodads that had become all the rage for this season. One of them plugged it into a tv and passed a control to Jefferson before Franklin snatched it out of his hand. 

They started with Super Mario Bros. and from there went onto Zelda and Punch Out.

By the end of the week, they'd tried Playstations, X-Boxes and PC.

On Sunday I came into their suite and found Franklin and Dr. Connover engaged in a round of tonsil hockey, while Jefferson and Washington were chugging beer and playing Ice Hokey on the Nintendo. 

""Alessa, could you give me a moment? I need the room."" She got up and smiled at Ben while handing him a slip of paper.

""Gentlemen, I appreciate your enthusiasm for new media, but you must have wondered why you've been brought back.""

Scoffing Jefferson said ""Nay. We've assumed ye'd tell us in your time.""

""Well, the nations quite concerned about the new president elect, and we'd like to get your thoughts on...""

""OH FUCK THAT!"" shouted Hancock.

Harumphing for silence Washington stood. ""If you'll forgive my esteemed colleague's outburst, he does speak our thoughts and feelings, if rather bluntly.""

""I'm not sure I understand though..."" I started.

""Then I'll make it clear to you lad."" Ben cut me off. ""We did our time. We gave our lives to this great experiment, and went on to the eternal dark emptiness that awaits all living minds. Now that we've been given a reprieve from the void of death, we're going to enjoy the fruits of the labors of those who prospered from the fruits or our labors.""

""To put it another way"" Hancock cut in ""We're retired, so thanks for giving us a way to enjoy our retirement and please be so kind as to fuck off."" And with that he waived his hand at me.

I left the room and called HQ. ""So... plan A is complete shit. No, they just wanna fuck off and play video games. Personally I'd rather just put 'em all down and go on to plan B... fine, I'll leave them alive as a back up, but I need that Macedonian and Roman material ASAP.""

"[WP] The Villain has almost won, beating everyone with his mysterious super power. But you've finally figured out how it works, and you're going to use it to beat them.",iFox,"It’s times like these I envy sardines. I’ve never seen the lobby of the Drusselman Hotel (formerly Wayne Hotel and Suites) so full of frenzy and chaos. When the last of the stragglers burrowed between the doors and the press pack I couldn’t help but shift my attention to the featured attraction.

Clark Kent, Bruce Wayne, and Tony Stark slumped defeated on the dais. Debatably, Tony was slumping or *sleeping* in defeat, as he had a habit of doing lately. Lex Luthor – wheelchair and all – accompanied them. Shadowed by her daughter, the front of the dais featured Diana Prince, who was preparing to speak. She clutched the podium as if to channel its energy to power her through those short staccatos of speech she had become known for since the crisis began twenty years ago.

&gt; “People of New York. I bring bittersweet news. What you have read is correct. The war is over. The terms are as follows:”

I joked that I envy sardines, but now I feel an awful lot like one. Her pause stinks through the room as press and onlookers drench the silence in anxiety, sweat, and the stench of fear.

If we had had more time, I think Batman would have searched literally every house in the world. Hell, he accidentally defeated ISIS just going door-to-door to find *him*. He mobilized all of Wayne Industries to find a counter to his strength. It goes without saying how that went…

Lex even turned his empire on the task. Fared exactly as well as Bruce.

Wonderwoman would’ve truth lassoed god-himself if it helped.

Superman visited every civilization in the galaxy. His return cache of weapons for humanity was about as effective as a scrapbook of vacation photos.

We even tried ignoring the crisis, which only worked well enough to lull ourselves into a false amnesia between his attacks. Remaining chances were few and far between. The Super Alliance had failed. In Diana’s words; *the war was over*. Prince continued 

&gt; “The villain has agreed to a temporary ceasefire. In exchange all superheroes and allied villains will be forced to retire.”

A steam is rising amongst the crowd. ‘How could they’s and ‘what will we do now‘s rumble through the press.

“I gotta find a way out before the crowd turns into a mob and I become people marmalade.” The thought of a riot alerted my survival instinct – even though I was going to miss out on the story of the century.

The rumble rises to a crescendo. While tunneling through the crowd, what do I find but my exit ticket! Bob Callevanche's shoes are straight ahead. Connected to those shoes are the other 285-odd pounds of the former All-American turned beat writer. I look up and seek him down.

“Bob! We gotta scoot before we get squashed – lead the way!”

“Oh, hey Jimmy. I’m gonna stay for the finish. No crowd's gonna give me trouble. I need this story or I’ll never make front page at the Post. I wanna talk, though. Meet me at the diner in thirty.”

Diana cut through the crowd’s roar and continued what we now understood to be ~~her~~ their farewell address just as I made it to the exit.

&gt; “Furthermore – all citizens will be subject to his rule in perpetuity. I understand this is a difficult time. We will work to help while we still can. Goodbye.” 

If Wayne Industries hadn’t milked the last of its resources on a security force, I wouldn’t’ve been surprised if the crowd hadn’t stampeded our Super Alliance in frenzy. Instead, the security detail strained all of us through the revolving doors of the hotel and into the street. Our former protectors shuttered away into the night as the crowd began to riot across the whole city block.

“Well... I don’t have anything else to do, I ‘spose I’ll meet up with Bob.”

I stood in a courtroom, I suppose you would call it. Its walls were decorated with paintings only rivaled by the greatest painters of Earth. The pictures showed scenes of many religions: Egyptian, Greek, Germanic, Christian, Jewish, Mulism, Buddhist, among others.
The cloaked judge began, ""Your first life was short, and began in the 15th Century, what year was i-?""
""1481, sir"" I replied.
""Yes, yes. You died as Benedict, a soldier of the Byzantine army. Your second life was longer, you lived into your fifties, I believe.""
""Yes, the life of *Enrique de Burgos*,"" I confirmed. I felt my physique change from Benedict (the body I appeared in court in) to Enrique. I felt my height shrink slightly, my skin tan and my face growing wild with facial hair. A knight's suit became my apparel in an instant.

""Yes, your ninth life. It was short, the shortest life you ever had, was it not?""
I nodded slowly, sighing.

""You boys have come a long way. I've taken you in from the Scavs, the Moles, the Locos. Some of you were loners. Some were escaped slaves. But now, what are you?"" I asked, my voice rising on the last few words.

Lefou was an absolute moron, but he was the most loyal buffoon I had encountered in the past decade.

""Excellent."" I said, smiling at myself in the reflection of my half shattered mirror. ""Please begin the service.""

Lefou bent at the waist obediently, and scurried through the curtains to my left. I took a long sip from my glass of Brawndo and listened as the choir began the hymnal of commencement.

*Everybody get up it's time to slam now*

*We got a real jam goin' down*

*Welcome to the Space Jam*

**""AND ALSO WITH YOU""** The audience replied.

""Please be seated."" I said with authority. ""Everyone please open your books and turn to Chapter Morpheus, verse 303.""

I waited until I heard the last of the pages rustling, before continuing on.

""Verse 303, ahem....*As the last of the sentinels fell, Neo took to the skies and disappeared from view. In his mind, his final act of valor couldn't be topped so he ventured onward to seek out new challenges.

Gasps from the crowd.

""*The seed that grew in the belly of his beloved would one day be known to us, as our lord and savior...Brendan Fraser.*""

**""BRENDAN BE PRAISED!""** someone shouted from the pulpit.

""Yes my children, it was for us that Brendan sacrificed everything. He sought only to entertain, and inspire...yet he was treated as a martyr!"" I shouted dramatically.

""Pastor Murray?"" A small voice squeaked from the front row.

I covered my eyes from the make-shift spotlight Lefou was shining on me from the balcony, and looked towards the source of the question. My eyes met the gaze of a little girl frowning back at me.

""Yes, Katniss?"" I replied.

""Why did the bad people force Brendan out of the holy city of Hollywood?"" She asked me with tears forming in her eyes.

**""Awwww""** The crowd muttered, emphatically.

I smiled back at Katniss and answered, ""Well you see Katniss, the king of Hollywood was an evil man named Voldemort.""

**""BOO!!""** The crowd roared.

I continued on, ""Voldemort wanted nothing more than to rule the seven kingdoms of Middle Earth, and to do that he needed to defeat the growing Egyptian threat, Imhotep. He enlisted the help of our savior Brendan Frasier to take on the reanimated Pharaoh. Once the beast was defeated, Voldemort knew that Brendan would be a threat to his throne. The people couldn't find out he was responsible, or they would elect him King of the North.""

Katniss looked confused. ""I don't understand, this story seems to have a lot of plot holes.""

My eyes widened at this girl's act of uncertainty.

""I'm so sorry Pastor Murray, she doesn't know what she's saying."" The father of Katniss spoke out.

I looked at him and responded, ""That's quite alright Logan. And please, feel free to call me Bill.""

Logan grabbed his daughter and the two of them sat down.

I began again, ""The most important thing to remember Katniss, and all of you..."" I said smiling to the crowd, ""is that our faith is paramount to bringing the second coming of Brendan Fraser. Now everyone, please bow your heads in prayer with me as I close our service.""

The crowd obliged.

*""Dear lord and savior Brendan, we come to you today to say thank you for your blessings. We wish nothing but your return in the coming days. In your holy name we pray, amen.""*

**""AMEN""**

""Thank you all for coming."" I said to the masses. ""We will see you next week when we start chapter Tarantino. This is the heavy stuff, so maybe leave the young ones in youth group ok?""

The crowd chuckled.

Not to mention the other pirates and corporations who have caught wind of this cache too.,Inoox,"Thick cards clicked together as the dealer shuffled through a fresh deck. One by one the players, half shrouded in shadow by faded light globes, received their hands. Tiberius Darkstar's countenance held steady. With a great show of deliberate contemplation, he casually pushed forward his shining towers of azure and crimson, billions of credits worth of chips. Only then, did he allow himself the smallest grin. This was the game of his life, and he was going to win.  

Fourteen hours, three bottles of Antarean Rum, two gunbattles, and five sore losers later, Darkstar sat in a luxury suite at the Silversides Inn and reveled in his good fortune. He held in one hand a small translucent crystalline object. Turning it over in his palm he gazed into its many different intricate geometric facets, grinning wildly and laughing as he contemplated the soft swirling light within. In a desperate bid to regain control of the game, Longhands had dropped an Artifact as his final wager! While priceless in their own right for their rarity and beauty, only Darkstar and maybe a handful of imperial scientists would be capable of discerning its true value. He lifted the patch over his left eye to reveal a glowing, opalescent sphere resting in its socket, and held his new Artifact up for a more thorough inspection. And then he gasped with awe and excitement... what he had here was a map! Celestial coordinates to riches that were likely quite literally beyond imagination! Scattered remnants of what was known as Elder tech drifting through space were generally only happened upon by extreme chance. Hell, just ONE of those artifacts (albeit a ridiculously powerful one) was responsible for the rise of the Imperium! But, skies below, NO one had EVER found a map before.

Before he could further contemplate the significance of his score, a bright green light bloomed through the transparent spaceward wall, and the telltale boom of a distant depress shook the floor. Imperium! How the blazes did they find this place? Darkstar leapt to his feet and quick sealed his vac suit. His mind racing, he pocketed the Artifact, strapped on his weapons belt, threw on his radcloak, and slammed his powerhook through the window. No helping it, New Royal was so big and convoluted that this was the quickest way back to the ship. The window shattered, and Darkstar flew forward with all of the room's air and furniture into the deafening silence of the void.

As he steadily drifted away from the station he took a moment to survey his surroundings. He couldn't see where the first shot had landed, but he knew from experience that the green flash he had witnessed was the empire's signature spectrum of baryonic death. These were the initial stages of a shit show of epic proportions. He turned spacewards and there against rainbow beauty of the Carinae were the distant shadows of at least three dozen Imperial Gunspheres, surrounded by hundreds of fast approaching glittering points of light. 

""Punchers!"" Darkstar thought to himself. ""Those bastards mean to board New Royale! They must be out of their minds!""    

Emerald particle beams streamed through the darkness, splashing across the surface of the station and sending bright puffs of gas and molten debris in all directions. A moments more hesitation in the Inn, and he would've been slag. Darkstar flipped on his communicator and instantly had to quell the frantic shouting of his crew. 

""Shut it mates! Warm up reactors, two, five, and the auxiliary! Purge the brig and get RX-88 out of whatever retro-console whorehouse he's plugged into!Lugnut! Spike the light fuel with Nitronium, we've gotta put a rift behind us that'll split the verse!""  

""Aye captain, we see you on our Navpanel! We'll keep an open lock top starboard for ye!"" 

""Fine work Xeno! Watch out for the-"" Darkstar was cut off by the sudden blaring of a prox alert in his ear and sharp jolt from his suit. Immediately following the short propulsive burst he saw the first puncher zoom past him and plunge into the surface of New Royale. ""-Gods damned punchers!"" 

""Aye Cap'n!""
Using his jets, Darkstar began steering his way towards the rockside docking bays and his custom warcruiser, the Nova Surprise. A few ships were already starting to detach and flee amidst the growing barrage of men, metal, and energy. Punchers rained down into the side of the station, peppering its jumbled surface and no doubt emptying their cargo of suicidal shock troopers within. It didn't make any sense, the Imperium rarely gave quarter to ambitious gentlemen such as himself. It would be much more reasonable for them to simply vaporize the station than risk such a bloody fight within. And then it hit him: ""They're after the Artifact! They're after the map!""

The last spaceship carrying humans blasts off into space, heading towards their new home, 2000 light years away. A planet discovered around 100 years previous when humanity and the Earth in general was on decline, it mimicked earth’s atmosphere with a higher oxygen percentage and was 10 times larger. Water was plentiful on this new planet and was eventually chosen as the new host for humanity. In the year 2300 it had been decided by the world leaders that humanity needed a new home, we had driven the Earth to the ground, barely anything was growing anymore and it was time to move on. An initiative was set up to locate a new planet to live, and this new one, named Moln, was chosen. All the earths money was then pumped into building space crafts that could transport every human to Moln, as well research into building a new civilisation on this new planet.

Fast forward 300 years and finally they were ready. Spacecrafts blasted off on a daily basis, carrying around 500,000 people at a time. They were placed into deep sleeps, ready for the few hundred year transit. By the time the last spacecraft arrived at Moln, the first people to arrive would have long since lived out their lives and died, and the planet would be hosting the 10th generation of Moln humans. This was intentional, to try and preserve the ‘present day’ history, so as much of ‘Earth’ could be carried on.

Today was the day the last spacecraft left, carrying the very last batch of humans. Everyone was accounted for. The craft blasted out of the atmosphere and a young child looked down at his home, speedily getting smaller and smaller in the distance, wondering what life had been like 500 years ago. He assumed a simpler time. 


2940

440 years later and Moln was thriving. The humans had learnt lessons from Earth and were treating their new home with respect, food was plentiful and there was no such word as ‘war’. Religion had long since died out and new political system had been developed, money didn’t exist on Moln. The scientists had spoken and wanted to head back to Earth to see if their previous grandfathers theory was correct, ‘in 500 years time, with no human intervention, the Earth will regenerate and restore itself to its former self’. The people agreed and were happy with this. A team was assembled and the technology was developed in a matter of months, all thanks to AI and the craft was ready in weeks. Space travel was ridiculously advanced now, the Moln people often joked about what people from the year 2100, aka the ‘divided years’ would think of them now.

Kate was in charge of a small team of scientists, explorers and technicians. Their journey time would roughly be 3 years, so no need to deep sleep. They spent their time pondering what Earth would be like now, hoping they’d find a lush green planet, with fresh water flowing

Kate saw Earth on the horizon of her deck, growing in size. She’d seen holograms of it when it is was in its prime, full of greenery and blue waters, wildlife running and flying around, when she was a child in school. This is what she was hoping to see. But as they came closer, she saw her natural home a burnt out rock, it filled her with sadness. There was no life here. They’d wasted their time, they’d report back to Moln with nothing. Arabella, one of the technicians joined Kate on the deck and saw what she saw, nothing was said between them, just a silent sadness filled the air. Unfortunately they couldn’t turn around now, they were fast approaching, and so needed to land before they could take off. Arabella messaged back to Moln ‘Now approaching Earth, the planet viewing from 500 miles is seen as a black, burnt out rock. Unlikely that anything living will be alive, however we will still explore and collect samples’  

Kate positioned landing for what was known as ‘Old Netherlands’, a vast flat plane, perfect for landing. They landed smoothly, donned their protective suits and stepped outside. A darkness filled the air, with green smog hanging around them in the pure silence. There was no wind, the air was still, yet an old bell tower rang in the distance. Kate would be lying if she said she wasn’t scared. It was creepy, knowing her ancestors had once lived, played and loved on this land. But something didn’t feel right, she sensed she was being watched.

Beck, one of the explorers, motioned to the team in front of him. He swore he saw something move. A set of eyes appeared in the fog, as did another, and another. Before they knew it the team were surrounded by hundreds, if not thousands of ‘humans’. Kate looked at them, swallowed in fear, they looked almost familiar. They looked like Moln humans, just slightly different, she could tell they were somehow evolutionary related. 

*

It had come out a few years into living on Moln that in 2500 a secret group had been formed of people not wanting to leave their home but not wanting to commit suicide. So the group bribed a member of the ‘Humanity Recruitment’ team to fudge the numbers to make them appear they were on the ship. When in actual fact they were left on Earth. These people wanted to start humanity again, on their terms and how they wished. They would be a peaceful nation. But they were now in their 10th Generation, had gone backwards, not forwards as they’d hoped. Rudimentary spears and tools were now used to fight each other, language has resulted in grunts and technology was long gone. They weren’t aware anymore of their history, of what their forefathers had wanted. 

This information was top secret, known only to high level scientists. The scientists knew Earth would not have regenerated itself, instead they wanted to see how these humans left behind would have evolved, their theory was that these humans would of gone backwards ever so slightly and could therefore be used as human guinea pigs for Moln’s medical experiments. The scientists lied about the real reason of the mission, to ensure confidentiality and non-bias from the teams initial reports. They hoped that once the team saw these non-intelligent humans, they would report back and then another team and craft could be deployed to transport the earth humans back to Moln.

Instead, things had gone worse. The earth humans had formed themselves over the years into an ant like colony, invaders would be pounced upon. Kate and her team in the earth humans eyes were termites. The team had been unknowingly sent to their deaths, under prepared with no weapons. All they could do was run.



Epilogue

Its was 2 months later and Moln received the video report from Kate. She was sprinting, running and panting out of breath while a huge gang of earth humans chased her down. It cut to black. The mission had been a failure and the top brass had blood on their hands. The leaders of Moln decided to advise the population that the mission had got lost in space and had unfortunately lost communications, as such all the team had died. The people of Moln accepted this and moved on. Another mission to Earth was never planned again

That's all the hooded figure said, breaking the silence that had descended on the small room.

**Bloody marvellous.** It continued.

The man standing before him looked around sheepishly before asking the reaper what was wrong.

**You're not particularly bright, I want you to know that.**

""Well that's not fair Death!""

**In all my years, in the EONS I've spent claiming souls and ushering them to their respective afterlives, I have NEVER, EVER met somebody as spectacularly idiotic as you. People have tried their best to stop me. I won't lie, some succeeded, for a while. They kept me out, but I got them. And then what happens? YOU. You stupid, asinine, moron buggered up your attempt to keep me out in the most spectacular way possible.**

""What do you mean?""

**You still don't get it do you? Instead of locking me out, you locked me IN. The charms, the runes, the little symbols. They were placed in the wrongs places and were made incorrectly. For a person trying to cheat death, you really needed to do some more reading up.**

The man looked at the floor dejectedly, trying to think of something to say. He raised his head and a word tumbled halfway out of his mouth before he decided against it and continued looking at the floor.

**So now we wait.**

""For what?""

**For the higher ups to fix this. I've already sent the call up. Told me it'll be a 4 hour wait JUST FOR THEM TO GET HERE. Gods only know HOW long it'll take for them to find a way to get your mess sorted out and get us back. Do you know how much work I have today? There's a WAR going on! Now I've got a bunch of lost souls milling about, wondering what's going on! Dear lords, the PAPERWORK. Oh my goodness!**

Death glared as angrily as it could at the man. This was no easy task, as only darkness swirled in the place its face should have been, but the man got the gist anyway and mustered up the courage to speak.

""Look I'm sorry. I wanted to see if it could be done! To beat Death!""

**Nobody beats Death! Trust me on this! You win one time but I'll still be there at the end, waiting for you!** 

""So there's no point trying to beat you?""

A sigh radiated from within the dark hood of the grim reaper.

**Why don't more of you humans get it? The way to beat death is to make peace with it. To come to terms and accept the end, when nothing more can be done! But instead you try your hardest to avoid me when your time is due, whether it's with elaborate charms and trickery or games of bloody chess! I'm sick of chess!  That's all I get from those people who think they're clever! ""I'll play chess against you for my soul!"", They'll say! I've played more games of damned chess than they've drawn breath in their LIVES. It's boring! Why does nobody go for a fun game, like charades or Battleships?**

Death seemed to calm down and decided to sit down. The man stared at Death before following suit and taking a seat on a chair opposite Death incarnate.

""I'm really sorry you know.""

**I know, I know. Curiosity drives humans. Curiosity is what killed the cat you know.**

""Which cat was it?""

**No clue. The Death of Cats deals with them.**

""Death of cats?""

**You have no idea. It's a long explanation that I really can't be arsed for right now.**

The two sat in silence for a while. The man's face contorted in thought before a smile spread across his mouth. The man hurriedly ran over to a  bookcase leaning against the wall. He pulled a box off the top and brought it over to where Death was sitting, pulling a coffee table in-between them.

""Seeing how we have time to kill, why don't we do something fun?""

**What did you have in mind?**

The man blew the dust off the box before placing it back down on the table, a laugh escaping him when he looked at Death and said:

""Battleships!""

Death began to chuckle and replied:

**You're on.**

My mind raced through my checklist.  Had I missed anything?  The magic circles were all intact, the talismans were all in the right places, the doors and windows all had salt in front of them... nothing was out of place.  I checked my watch for the umpteenth time that day.  Sure enough, I was fated to die within the next few minutes.

I glanced out the window.  There he was.

Death himself, the grim reaper.

All my preparations were in place.  This was it.  I couldn't die here.  I had to survive.  I had to live!

In a flash, he was at the window, the chill of his breath causing it to fog up.  His face, if he had one, was obscured beneath his hood.  I'm not ashamed to say that I let out a small shriek as I fell backwards, scrambling back into the room.

In the next moment, he was inside.  What?  How...?

He reached a hand out to me.  ""Your time has come,"" he uttered somberly.

The beating of my heart, already racing at breakneck speeds, sped up even more.  My breaths came in short gasps.  I thought I would burst.  After all my research, all my countless hours of study, here he was.  I... had failed.

I half sat, half stood in an awkward crouching position, one hand over my face.  Unfortunately, it seemed I wouldn't even get to die with dignity.

My heart slowed, then stopped altogether.  It took a moment to realize that my body had dropped to the ground.  My soul still crouched in the same uncomfortable position.

""You are now dead,"" he informed me, in case I didn't already know.

""Thanks,"" I managed in reply.

""Your kind fears death,"" he began, as though I didn't already know this, ""but there is nothing to fear.""  He made a grandiose motion with his arm, extending it out to the window through which he had entered.  ""If you will simply follow me to...""

He stopped suddenly.

He turned around to face the window, his morosely graceful persona coming crashing down.

""Huh,"" he said.

""Huh?"" I repeated.  ""You're the grim reaper, and... huh?""

""Huh,"" he confirmed.  He tapped the window with a long, skeletal finger, sending a jolt of red energy rippling across the entire wall.  He observed it carefully.

""Did you inscribe these barriers to keep me out?"" he asked.  He sounded almost offended.

""Um... yeah,"" I said, not sure how to feel.

He walked along the wall, inspecting my inscriptions.  ""Impressive,"" he muttered.  ""I haven't seen Enochian carvings like these in... well, ever, actually.""

""Thanks...?""

He stopped, seeming to have found what he had been looking for.  ""This part,"" he said, gesturing to a section of the wall above a lucky rabbit's foot.  ""You should've written the glyph for 'out' if you wanted me to stay outside.""

""And... what *did* I write?""

He paused for a moment.

""You wrote 'in',"" he said.

""Oh.""

...

""I don't suppose you'll give me my body back?"" I asked, pouring out two cups of tea.  I sat down at the table across from him, taking my cup.  The fortuneteller who gave it to me had informed me it was infused with ""magical essence"".  The reaper informed me it was infused with regular tea leaves.

Either way, it tasted fine.

He took a sip.  At least, I assume he did: he brought the cup to his hood, and the level of tea in the cup went down.

""No,"" he replied.

I waited for him to elaborate, but he wouldn't.  ""Dang,"" I said finally.

""And I don't suppose you'll let me out of here?"" he asked.

""No,"" I replied.  Hopefully, he wouldn't figure out that I had no idea what any of the symbols meant.  As long as he thought I had him trapped intentionally, maybe I could bargain for my life back.

We sat in silence for a while longer, occasionally sipping the tea.  I wondered offhand if I could drug the reaper.  Not that it would help, even if I could.  What would I do with an unconscious reaper?

Of course, what would I do with a conscious one?  Small talk until the end of days?

I may not live forever, but it doesn't mean I have to give in without a fight. All the tricks my grandfather taught me though weren't enough to even slow him. I hid in my grandfather's cabin like he told me, but, on my 38th birthday, Death showed up. 

""As you know, I am Death. I'm sorry to take you from this mortal world, but I need your help to save my kind. If this goes well, it should only take a few minutes. It was difficult to get here. The Forces must be out to stop us."" 

""Oh no,"" I mutter. 

""What?""

""I may be the problem. My grandfather told everything he knew about stopping Death. It must have worked."" 

""Well, your grandfather was special as are you. Now, how do we get out of here?"" 

""Well, I have two rabbit's feet, a horseshoe, and a...""

""Those aren't the problem. What's that in the jar?""

""Uh, KY Jelly. It gets lonely here."" 

""No, the urn. It's not a jar. Sorry."" 

""It's my grandfather's ashes. He lived to be 110."" 

""He used magic to keep my kind away. I can't blame him. Take my hand. It will cost me my being to get you out of here, but it's worth it."" 

I look down and frown at the bony hand he holds out. 

""Uh...No...""

Death grabs my hand and touches the urn. My body jolts, and I watch the cabin grow smaller until it's a dot then the solar system disappears, and I fall to the ground somewhere distant, far away. I stand and looked at a dozen cloaked figures. 

""Where is your guardian?""

""Sacrificed himself or something like that. Look, I'm confused. Is this a Last Starfighter situation?"" 

""I don't know what that means. Humans know us as Death, but we are interdimensional beings who ferry you to a different dimension when you die. You are an anomaly among your kind. You can pull certain beings into your world permanently which can kill them if their exposure is long enough, and you can do this for the monsters hunting us. We are facing extinction without you.""

""But without you, we would not die,"" I say. 

""No, without us, your kind would not evolve. Death is the end of the beginning, nothing more. Without us, death is a permanent end.""

""So, what do I have to do?""

Or her scythe. Tough to tell. Flat chested with both female and male facial features. Rabbits paw, circle of banishment, fresh goats head with all candles in a pentagram, i even managed to find some ancient talismans that protected great heroes in battle. Raided a museum, killed a few people...all meaningless. The Grip Reaper, the Keeper of Souls, it killed me when my time came. I begged, bartered, negotiated, threatened, used magical rituals, chanted, ran, fought...i did literally everything to keep that damned creature away. Now i am looking on my headless body. Good job, mortal body. The reaper is standing next to me, looking over his list. The List! Maybe if i took it, i could retur...he is giving me the eye. Not going to try it.

""Solomon...you are quite brave"" Death speaks with metallic voice ""You have assembled almost a literal mountain of trinkets and knick-knacks to keep me out. Now, it is time for us to...WHAT!?!?"" Death screamed in such fury that even my dead body shuddered.

""What is wrong?"" I asked, confused.

""Your stupid hoarding is causing disturbance in my powers. To put into into terms that your dumb ass will understand, you locked the door from the other side and we do not have the key"" Death yelled at me, his anger bringing the temperature below zero, causing moisture to appear on the mirrors from air.

I tried to leave the room, but I hit an invisible wall. Death was absolutely not amused by this and touched the invisible wall, layered over the visible wall.

""One of the things in this room is keeping both of here. You will get into your body, I will hold your head and you will destroy every object in this room"". Death spoke much calmer now.

""Why should i do it?""

""If you wont, i will torture you until the end of the universe. And trust me, everything here will decay much sooner. Also, YOU will be prolonging the suffering and torment of all other souls in their close-to-death-but-not-dead states. So go and deal with it"" Death ordered and temporarily returned me to my headless body. He grabbed my head and moved it around the room as I needed. I begun breaking all the items, some were easy to break, some were much harder. Ripping apart old books, breaking talismans, ruining magical circles. But there was one book that even my physical body could not touch. I could not read its name, some old peddler told me this book contains very powerful magic, strong enough to defeat Death.

Death tossed my head to the side, deeming it insignificant as he pulled my soul out again. ""Hmm...the book that binds the strongest demons. Unrivaled power hides within it. Mortals would call it Necronomicon or something like that. Hmm...this is certainly the thing that is binding us here. Oh well, I am Death, some book can not stop me"" he said as he opened it and begun reading it. Demons from my worst nightmares were just the beginning. I have never seen such terrors before. And he killed them all with one swing.

The room was filled with gore, guts and fluids of whatever demons have instead of blood. And now we can safely leave this place. I am so happy i can leave now! I cling to Death during the entire trip, shaking and weeping. If i read that book, i would be deaded than dead. My punishment was very light in comparison. Help Death with similar people and their artifacts. I would get in the room, posess an object and ruin the entire place, including all charms.",Master_X1337

I had chosen an isolated cabin in the woods for my final stand, mostly to avoid suspicion.  I mean, imagine if someone had walked in to find me scribbling pentagrams on the floors or reciting voodoo chants at a skull.  I get the feeling things wouldn't have gone very well.  The cabin itself consisted of the main room -- where I sat drinking perfectly ordinary tea with the Grim Reaper -- a kitchen, and a back room.  Not the best final resting place, I suppose, but at least it was comfy.  Realizing that we could be here for a while, I was silently thankful for that last part.

I gazed around the cabin, going over all my futile efforts to keep myself alive one more time.  There, in the corner, sat the lucky rabbit's foot.  It was a reminder of my failed attempts at Enochian, marking the place where I'd used the wrong glyph.  On the stove in the kitchen sat a myriad of colorful candles, each one puffing out its own unique incense.  I had thoroughly ruined the stovetop, but somehow I had more pressing issues to deal with.  On the floor in the back room was a hastily drawn magic circle with a pentagram inscribed inside.  Decorating the windows and walls were every good luck charm and/or talisman you could imagine: four-leaf clovers, a horseshoe, various dreamcatchers, you name it.  There was even a lucky die, the name of which felt painfully ironic in retrospect.

Of all the things I had gathered, I had never expected it would be the carvings in the wall which would actually work.  They came from an old, worn out book I had found in the sketchy section of a public library -- that is, if a public library can *have* a sketchy section.  I had taken a few pictures of some impressive looking examples on my phone, but honestly, I only added them as an afterthought.  I cursed myself for not bringing the full text with me.

I psyched myself up to talk to the Reaper.  I mean, this was the guy himself.  How do you talk to the immortal entity that takes souls away to the afterlife?  Should I make a joke?  Ask a personal question?  Nothing seemed like it would work.  I decided to start simple, and maybe learn more about my current situation at the same time.

""A thought occurs to me,"" I said suddenly, feeling extremely awkward as soon as the words left my mouth.  I had felt that I needed to preface my question somehow, but looking back on it I just felt uncomfortable.  ""How am I able to drink this tea, if I'm just a ghost?""

He gestured to the floor near my feet.  Looking down, I was met with a discolored patch of rug.

""You're not,"" he said lazily.  ""If you're wondering why you can lift the cup, you've become a poltergeist.""

Again, I gave him time to elaborate; again, he refused.

""A poltergeist?"" I prodded.

""Yes.""

""And that means?""

""You can interact with basic objects, depending on your spiritual activity.  Most choose to channel their energy through either focus or anger.  Two opposite sides of the spectrum, but they both have their benefits.""

Finally, I was learning something.  I figured that focus would be the best choice if I wanted to accomplish something.

""I don't suppose you'll let me check my phone?"" I asked, not wanting to lose the conversational momentum I had built up.  Maybe Google would have the answers that I didn't.  I knew I was supposed to be the captor here, with the Enochian and all, but I still felt like I should let him know what I was doing.  If nothing else, maybe I could get him to start to trust me.

He seemed to shrug, but it was such a slight gesture that I might've just imagined it.  ""I've never heard of a spirit using technology, but you're free to make an attempt.  I've never been imprisoned by one, either,"" he added.

With that rousing encouragement, I made my way over to my body.  I tried not to look at it too much.  I felt like I should be sick to my stomach, but at the same time I felt too detached to care.  Offhand, I wondered if it was a side effect of being dead, or if I really was braver than I thought.  I decided to go with the latter.  Right then, I kind of needed a confidence booster.

I concentrated really hard on my hands and my pockets, hoping this was what the Reaper had meant.  Slowly, I began to rifle through my own pockets, an experience made infinitely more awkward by the fact that my pants were on a separate body.  I mean, it wasn't really *my* body anymore, was it?  I decided to let go of that train of thought, for the sake of keeping my focus.

There it was, next to my wallet.  Luckily, I managed to fish my phone out without too much trouble.

""A thought occurs,"" the Reaper piped up, mimicking my earlier phrase.

I froze.  ""Go on,"" I said cautiously.

""Sometimes, when a poltergeist attempts to interact with technology, it explodes.""

""The ghost or the technology?""

He stayed cryptically silent.

I laid the phone on the ground carefully and backed up.

""So... want to play a game of chess?""

The government had grown increasingly more omniscient, to the point which they were mailing the funds before the event took place. Two months ago, I received nearly $1500 in the morning. Later that day, I had given away my laptop to a boy trying to buy a present for his mother. The laptop wasn't worth more than $400, but the happiness obviously outweighed the true cost of the item. Two weeks ago, another small sum came in, this one worth $800. I spent three hours that day with my brother and my wife, showing them the most beautiful places in our small town. They were delighted to be spending time with me. 
&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This morning was much different. It was almost unheard of, but there was nearly $300,000 being delivered to my house. My wife and I lived separately, it was just easier given our different work schedules. I called her up immediately, and let her know of the funds we'd gotten. I could hear through the phone just how giddy she was. It was hard to imagine how terribly wrong the day would go. It was around noon, I was to meet with my brother for lunch. He told that he'd spotted my wife with another man, and that they seemed happy together. I was devastated, and my whole body churned with revulsion. I thought we were in love, but I was wrong.

It was almost 8:00, though it was already dark outside. It was odd, given that it was summer. I walked slowly to the edge of the building, staring down at the pavement. A suicide note in my pocket, I trudged onward. I closed my eyes. I didn't want to know when I'd reach the ledge, I just wanted it all to end. Weightlessness overcame me, and I was suddenly falling. Falling, falling, getting closer to the ground. My eyes shot open the moment I was over the ledge, wishing I could take it all back. Ten stories down, why did I do this? Twenty stories, the ground is getting close. Thirty, forty, fifty all passed by in a blur. My body hit the ground with an audible *WHAM* and pain shot across my entire body. Everything felt broken, just as my heart was. As the last vestiges of my life ebbed away, I stared wide eyed at the couple exiting the building. My wife stared in horror. My brother had only smiled, holding her hand as I was enveloped by the darkness.",tysquirt

You do something good, you get money in up to 7 days processing time plus postal service delays. You make someone happy, you get money in up to 7 days processing time plus postal service delays. You get the idea. Here's another simple-to-get idea: the better the thing you do, or the happier you make someone the more money you get (in up to 7 days processing time plus postal service delays). I met one of the guys that make the formulas for payout calculations, they're *crazy*, lemme tell ya. The whole money-for-good-stuff business reflected positively on human happiness and economical growth in the last couple of years, all more the reason to rejoice, right?

 Locally, yes. Globally, not quite. You see, the whole utopian government business works on a medium scale, but doesn't quite scale up to the level of the whole continent. Also, the system doesn't actually *punish* bad behaviour, so, naturally, people have taken to exploiting it. How to exploit the system? Keep slaves and sometimes don't beat them! Magnificent. Fucking. Job. Extraordinary, utopian government.

---

 That's where I come in. I'm an official governmental assassin. That means that not only do I get to murder people and get paid for it, which is pretty sick, but I also work for the government so I need not worry about the bodies. The guy that was keeping slaves? Fucking slaughtered, thanks to our utopian government law enforcement's demographics department. Maybe you're not as bad, utopian government. The downside is I legally can't claim happiness money for killing people that were causing dishappiness, much like a detective can't claim money for bringing a sought fugutive to justice.

---

 So, one day I'm woken up by a courier ringing at my door.

""Comiiiiiiiiiing!"" I yelled to get him off the damned bell.

""Sir, there's a delivery for you. You need to sign *here* and *here*."" He gestured at dotted areas as I started to read the delivery bill.

""This can't be right..."" I muttered to myself. ""A'ight, thanks, mate. Dump it there."" I gestured over in the general direction of the old German bunker I had cleaned up in my back yard.

---

 Yawning and examining the delivery bill closer, I stumbled back in. Three hundred thousand dollars. In fifty-cent coins. From the government. Labeled ""happiness money"". Couldn't be right. I failed to recall any recent non-government-contracted murders of this magnitude, so I called my handler (of course I have a handler).

""Yo, I just got a delivery of three hundred thousand dollars in halves."" I started, still perplexed.

""So what's the problem?""

""It's labeled 'happiness money' and I haven't done any off-the-books contracts recently.""

""You know well and good that we have no knowledge as to the cause. And I checked that transfer personally, it's correct.""

""Righty ho'..."" I tried to end the conversation, but I got interrupted.

""You should turn on the news.""

And so I did. ""*Recent reports suggest that the leader of the communist Cuba was assassinated yesterday and the people have started a coup.*""

""I guess they'll be able to overthrow the government, but how does that factor into...""

""Think! Who killed the guy?""

""I did, and you know that. But I can't receive happiness money for that because you, as in the government, contracted it.""

\**Slapping sound.*\* ""Oh god, I just remembered.""

""Did you just facepalm *in real life*?""

""Yes. But I remembered how why you got that money.""

""And?""

""The legislation says you can't collect happiness money resulting from your governmental contracts *in the country*.""

""Well, that's an oversight, right?""

""Yep, I'll take it up with the higher-ups. But for now, enjoy your new-found wealth.""

""A'ight, see ya, mate.""

 Life's easy. Now for Cubans and me, too.

"[WP] In a futuristic utopia, the government mails you money for the amount of happiness you spread to others. While you receive a decent sum every now and then, you wake up one morning with truckloads of cash outside your house, completely perplexed.",Tamox,"There's an old legend, well, folklore is probably a better word. It goes: if you fold a thousand paper cranes, by yourself, within a year, you will be granted a wish. Interpretations differ, and a more traditional one is that you will be blessed with good health. That's why, in Japan, schoolchildren may fold them for a sick classmate. A thousand cranes isn't so many when there's a lot of people helping out.

Now, I don't believe that interpretation, or any really. There's nothing about paper cranes which makes me believe good health will come from their presence. Similarly, a thousand might as well be any other number. If it's just one person folding, even a hundred is a lot.

That's where the symbolism steps in. I like this bit of folklore, because it's an active story. If you fold a thousand cranes, that itself is a story. Some people do origami as a hobby, but I doubt many would find it enjoyable to complete the task. After a while, it would get boring folding the same thing several times a day for the whole year, for no reason in particular.

No, folding a thousand cranes needs some other motivator. It needs a wish to be fulfilled, or an occasion to be celebrated, or someone ill to be comforted. There is cause and effect. There is a story.

It's hard. Start on the first day of the new year, and you can get away with folding three a day, with a month to spare. But, that's twenty minutes of every day. It doesn't sound hard, until you've had a long day, and your hands are cold, and you can barely watch whatever's on without nodding off. Maybe, you take a day or two off, only to discover that skipping just one day makes it so much harder to pick back up again.

There's a journey, from the first, easygoing fold, to the moments where life tries to stop it, to the end, where everyday new numbers are run to see if there'll be enough folded by the time limit.

Then, at the end, there's a conclusion. It's a binary one, where either there's a thousand, or there's not. Nine-hundred seems like it's enough, but that's not the legend, and you know it. You could lie, but you would know, and that's what matters. No one else cares if it's nine-hundred or a thousand, because it's just a number. They don't even care that they're all cranes. You could fold a hundred dragons, each ten times as difficult as a single crane, and it would be an incredible achievement.

But, that's not the story.

In old Japan, the crane was a holy creature said to live a thousand years, which is where the thousand comes from. It was also said to bring good fortune. Rather than that, I think it's because the crane was popular and easy to fold.

A thousand is just a round number, and something that takes a long time to complete. A hundred can be done in a day, if you don't mind cramping up your hand, and good luck folding any more the next day. Realistically, you could do a hundred in a week. So then, a thousand, you could do it all in ten weeks. That's two hours of folding, for just over two months.

The spirit of this folklore, in my eyes, is about overcoming an insurmountable challenge through many, small efforts. You simply can't fold a thousand cranes in a day, a week, or even a month. If you put in a lot of effort every single day, you can do it in two months or so. But, if you put aside just twenty minutes every day, you could easily fold a thousand cranes in a year.

Think about your routine, and where you can spare that time. It doesn't even have to be boring, since you can have something to watch in the background, or something to listen to, or do it talking with a loved one.

Then, when you finish next year, I want you to think about what else you could spend twenty minutes every day doing. Because, when you see a thousand cranes with your own eyes, knowing that you folded every single one of them yourself, it becomes easy to see what can be accomplished with a routine of small effort.

A story written day by day is how a novel forms. Rare is the artist who became as good as they are without practice. Beautiful is the garden tended to daily. Loved are those who we cherish as the sun rises and sets.

When you work towards a goal, no effort is wasted. If you only fold one on a bad day, that's still one less to fold across the rest of the year. And, at the end of the year, if you only have nine-hundred cranes folded, it still looks incredible. It's not your goal, but it's still your achievement—a physical manifestation of your effort.

As disappointing as it might be to be so close and fail, that sets you on the path to do better next time. You only truly fail when you give up.

I live a frugal life. Books are cheap things, and my loved ones have little need for me to buy things on their behalf. Being an introverted person, this is, perhaps, self-fulfilling, as little money comes my way. When everyone is making everyone else happier, I am content making myself happy.

Still, as reclusive as I had become with age, my niece's wedding was recent. Given my limited funds, I had begun preparations at the start of the year, folding a little, day after day. So, by the time of the wedding, I had reached that special number.

Another interpretation, a thousand cranes were a traditional gift for weddings, representing a wish for a happiness for the couple. For me, this interpretation goes two ways. If not folded by the gift giver, it serves as a reminder of what I mentioned before, with a little effort, every day, going a long way.

If folded by the person giving the gift, it represents the effort they would like to put towards the couple being happy. This is why I did it. I love my niece, and her wife, and my gift served as a promise to that effect. It was a statement which read: if it would make your lives happier, I would gladly share twenty minutes of every day with you both. It's hard to phrase it better than that, such an ephemeral thing.

Still, the meaning and all its nuances reached them well enough, and I found myself crunched in a pair of hugs, and then my sister had to join in.

With the brides being teachers, a few classes-worth of children had come along, and I became the centre of attention. After being bombarded by nonsense that could conceivably be interpreted as questions to the well-trained, the brides organised them into groups, and had me show all of them how to fold a crane.

A messy affair, the whole thing. I don't know when kids become capable of doing things, but eight certainly isn't it. Some were okay, most rather terrible. It took the better part of my sanity, but, in the end, we had managed to get something resembling a crane out of the hundred or so children. To see them smile, you'd think they'd folded a thousand.

A year has passed since then, and, as their first anniversary rolls around, I have been invited to the school. My impact at the wedding had spawned an origami club, and they wish to show me what they have accomplished.

I'm not particularly skilled at origami, nor do I do much more than a piece now and then. But, I find some warmth in kindling a hobby in others. It is a nice feeling to have helped someone find something they enjoy.

My niece leads me through the school, giving half a tour on the way to the classroom. She tells me of some particular children who have been coming to the club every day, and some who come a couple of times a week. Around twenty in total, she says. I ask about what they fold, and she confesses it's mainly cranes and similar, simple things. Most have specific ones they really enjoy folding, she says. I ask if they're any better than at the wedding. She laughs, and admits that they don't quite have the motor skills at their age to do it perfectly, but promises that there's a few regulars who are getting there.

I know we are close when I can hear the chatter, and my suspicions are confirmed when I see a face pressed against a window in a door, which disappears only to be replaced by loud shushing. My niece laughs, and I chuckle too.

Coming to the door, she stands in front of me and has me close my eyes. I roll them before complying. She leads me inside, and tells me I can open them after she counts to five.

“Five”, she says. “Four, three, two, one.”

Before I can see, my ears are shattered by shouts of, “Surprise!”

When I come to my senses, I look, and I look around. There's a lot. Many cranes form lumpy piles here and there, of all kinds of colours and patterns. But, there's flowers too, many I recognise from my own beginner books—roses and tulips and lotuses. Someone seems particularly fond of dinosaurs, having a shallow box full of t-rex and stegosaurus origami. Other models too, random ones. Even from a distance, I can see little tears on this one, and an ugly crease on that one, and a crane with two heads.

On the far wall, I notice a tally chart. It's titled: senbazuru. It's subtitled: thousand cranes. There's an awful lot of marks on it. Ten boxes down, two wide, fifty marks per box, I work out. That puts the total at nine-hundred and thirty-eight.",mialbowy

The tension in her is noticeable. I suppose she knows they failed. Reaching over, I pat her shoulder. She's trying to hide her disappointment, but I've spent a lot of time with her, ever since she was born.

“Thank you,” I say, to her. Then, I sit myself down on the floor, and I swear I was never as small as these brats. “Let's fold something for your teacher, as a thank-you gift for running this club.”

They crowd around the table, and sigh before splitting them onto different tables, so they actually have enough room to fold. A minute distributing paper, and then I walk them through folding a heart. Not the best decision I've ever made. We get through it, though, and then they crowd around my niece, each trying to give her their one first.",mialbowy

With a growling stomach I pull out last night's cold pizza and throw it in the micowave. While my pizza reheats I crack a beer an turn on the TV.

Life is pretty tame, and that's the way I like it. I'm completely normal, and as such people leave me be. I have no teammates, no side kicks, and no arch enemy's.

When I was younger, beings a no one bothered me. Everyone I've ever met was special, except me. My dad ways born with the ant totem,and could shrink his physical form. My mom was born with the ox totem, and could lift several times her weight. I however was born without a totem, not even the a shity one. 

Being a totemless freak I got bullied quite a bit in school, there seemed no end to the creative way kids find to torture each other. I even tried stealing other kids totems, with hopes that I could find a power,  hopes that I could just fit in. Yet as I grew older my powers never came and I grew secluded from others. 

My parents always supported me, and tried comfort me, but I never felt like I belonged in their world. They probably feel I'm distant because I resent them, and that my seclusion is unhealthy. But they will never understand the freedom from not being special, it seems the more secluded I get from others the more free I become. 

I now relize the blessing I have, my nothingness lets me be so much more. 

While my peers spent their time as youth growing their powers, and finding ways to use them against each other; I played with Legos. While teens were forming super troops and saving the world, I fell in love with video games. I've never had to worry about making enemy's, cause I could never be a threat, I'm treated like I have a terminal disease. Hell I even got laid in highschool out of pity. 

Being a no one made life easy and care free, I have no destiny, no path laid before me, no evil to fight or injustice to right. No,! right now I just have pizza, beer, and re runs of the office. And that's enough!

You are the first child in history who comes out of the womb clutching nothing.",Tamox,"Little Timmy walked down the block from the gas station with his dad. His dad, Michael Lightning, was a world renown speedster. His power was being incredibly fast. His wife, Laura Pratt, was a boomster. Her power was projecting sonic force-fields that could send people flying 45 yards in the other direction. Not everyone's last name corresponded to their power, Michael was just an egomaniac. 

It was an unfortunate decision for the Lightning family to settle on living on Lee St. For down the road, on the corner of Stan ave, the two town academies were located. There was the hero academy, where children were instructed on developing and using their powers for the benefit of humanity, and across the street the villain academy, where children were instructed on developing and using their powers for the benefit of themselves. Kids were allowed to enroll in the academy of their choice at age 12. Outside of rival school institutions and office workplaces, heroes and villains mostly existed in harmony. Everyone had a power, and everyone had a totem, an object they are born with that is the source of their power. 

Except Timmy. Timmy was born without a totem. He was the only person in the whole world to have absolutely no powers whatsoever. Poor Timmy. He would not be able to attend either of the academies on the street which he lived on. As such, Timmy was home schooled.

Even people who's powers had been taken from them by the evil villain Dole Dark in the great power-theft of 2109 were able to get them back. Thanks to the Power-restorator 9000, such disasters could be remedied by reactivating the genes responsible for powers and reattaching the energy produced to another totem. This machine did not work on Little Timmy, however. Of the 90,000 different genes corresponding to different powers that were identified by scientists over time, not a *single* one existed in Timmy. His powers weren't missing or inactive, they just weren't a part of him.

Naturally, Timmy was homeschooled. He was a surprisingly bright and happy child. Very level headed, all things considered. He knew he was different, but didn't let it bother him much. Other kids would sometimes bring it up, but he was rarely around any of them, so it didn't bother him much. 

""Hey champ,"" Michael said, ""mind if I go into the supermarket real quick? I need to grab something for tonights lasagna."" Michael could only cook lasagna, and he did so often.

""Yeah dad."" Timmy said, ""I love your lasagna!"" Timmy hated the lasagna.

The two straddled into Liefelds, the only supermarket in town, and picked up a shopping cart. Timmy, from the corner of his eye, noticed a child that was levitating someone else. 

""Put me down Brian!"" Beckoned the lad in mid-air.

""Say Uncle""  commanded Brian.

""Smoke you!"" Replied the child. This was a mistake on behalf of the child. The area between the child's scalp and the ceiling grew increasingly small.

""Put him down Brian."" A man said, placing his hand on Brian' shoulder.

""Fine dad."" And the lad was returned safely into the arms of gravity.

""My oh my. Is that who I think it is? John?"" Michael looked over to see the man. 

""Mike, holy cow!""

""John Baker. It's been a while man, how have you been? Is this polite boy your junior?"" Michael said, looking questionably at Brian.

""Yes,"" replied John. ""Both of them. Kids meet Michael, the fastest guy in Romita Central! Mike, the oldest here is Brian, he's a puppermaster, and my other one, where did he go.."" Out of thin air, the young lad Brian was torturing earlier appeared, standing above the gumball machine.

""Yeah, there he is. That's Tommy."" Tommy's powers are self explanatory.

""Brian and Tommy huh, they look like wonderful boys!"" Michael was dreading the moment that he knew was coming.

""Yup, my pride and joys, now what about yours?"" Johns comment would be quite insidious if he knew about Timmy. Fortunately (or perhaps unfortunately) he did not.

""Oh well, this right here is Timmy. Timmy say hi to Brian and Tom."" Timmy emerged from his father's side, holding a pint of ricotta cheese.

""I know who this kid is."" Brian bellowed. 

""Oh yeah?"" Said Michael. ""From where?""

""That kid's the nub. He has no powers. Everyone at school talks about him.""

""Brian, watch your tounge!"" John's face flushed with embarrassment, he could see Michael starting to feel the same.

""What? It's true. This is the kid that doesn't have any powers, he wasn't even born with a totem. He's broken and people at school say he's bad luck.""

""Stop it!"" Little Timmy cried out. It was the first time anyone had experienced Timmy at such a volume.

""What, you don't want me telling people you're the antichrist? Freak."" Timmy never went out of his way to speak to other children, and this was precisely why.

""You're the freak! You're a jerk!"" Little Timmy started getting ripe with rage. 

""I may be a jerk, but at least I'm not a genetic failure. You can't even do anything to me, you're home schooled, all you've done is make your parents think they're broken."" Brian was getting ready to say some other mean nonsense, but his breath was interrupted with a scream from Timmy that alerted the entire supermarket to their present quarrel. Timmy's eyes fixated on Brian, and in a split second, before everyone's eyes, Brian had vanished.

Brian was gone.

Brian turned to nothing.

Timmy passed out shortly after, with Michael breaking his fall. 

""My boy..what have you done with my boy?"" Tears began to roll down John's face.

""I guess he does have a power."" Said Tom.",DavidKage

The story was that everyone in the room fell silent when I had taken my first breath in the outside world. I wasn't crying, but my breathing was fine. After recovering from the shock, my mother asked the doctor if it had ever happened before. It hadn't. They didn't know what would happen to me so they watched me like a hawk. They always had their eyes on me for the first five years or so. My powers still hadn't surfaced by then and they began to worry.

""He'll get bullied at school for having no powers,"" my mother would say to my father, scared that I would become ridiculed and made fun of. They worried about me day and night, debating over whether I should go to school.

Eventually, they came to an agreement and I got home schooled from kindergarten to eighth grade. My parents had reluctantly decided to put me in the hands of the public education system. Off I went, nervous as I could be. On my first day of school, I had tried to stay hidden, to draw no attention. Of course, though, I had to be introduced for every single class. Every single time, I went through the same ritual of saying my name quietly and sitting down. People gave me weird looks, probably talking about me behind my back. I didn't make any friends, though nobody knew that I had no powers.

There was that one kid who found out. He kept asking me what my power was and why I was so shy. He kept pushing me and when it hit him, his eyes lit up. He started to bully me about it but I never told anybody out of fear. Looking back on it, he probably had gotten a lame power or something and had been looking for someone with worse than him to bully. The bullying never ceased and I struggled to pretend that everything was fine. I started to get depressed.

One day after school, it was the usual taunting and teasing that only I could hear, nobody else to help me when I snapped. I snapped and something happened. I stopped walking down the crowded halls and just stared at him. All of my anger and sadness and raw emotion reached it's boiling point. He looked back at me with fear in his eyes and suddenly started to choke. Blood began pouring out of his eyes, nose, and mouth and he collapsed to the floor, convulsing. I took a step back and screamed, horrified at what I had done. A big circle had formed around him and someone rushed up to him and put their hands on his face. They probably had healing powers. The life never returned to him.

From that day on, I was terrified of myself and what I had done. Nobody knew it was me, except for this one girl, who now eyes me suspiciously and keeps her distance whenever I pass. I have never used my powers since that day.

The day I learned I have the power of darkness.

He has been known to move five ton boulders around like they were made of paper mache. My brother was born with fragments of a computer chip in his hand. His ability to mesh with technology on an instinctual level has led him to be one of the most renown IT Engineers in the world.

Neither of them can come close to the negative notoriety that I had. I was the first to ever be born with nothing grasped in my hands. Where others are born with stones, or gems, or even mechanical watches however that happens, I had nothing in my chubby little hands.

I have been bullied, ridiculed, and cast aside by everyone. My brother held absolute disdain for me. My mother has only ever done the minimum required by law to take care of me. My father acted as though I do not exist.

Women mock me behind my back. They said that I was pathetic. That I would never find a man who will love me, because of my weakness. My inability to show anything tangible for my abilities.

Every time I looked in the mirror I saw her looking back at me. I was by no means a sore to look at. I was 5'7"", I weighed 54 kilos. I was a late bloomer. Puberty came late, my breasts were still barely mosquito bites despite being fifteen years old. My hair was light brunette or auburn or something, my skin was ivory and perfect. If not for my missing ability, I would have pretty well fit the bill for what was considered perfect looking for the society I had grown up in. But yet there I was. Weak. Without ability. Considered nothing. Pathetic. A mistake of the universe to allow me to be born. 

""Mahli! Dinner. Come eat or starve, the choice is yours."" My mother called down. The bitch. One day I looked up my name on behindthename.com. Even my name meant weak. Would it have done them so much harm to name me for the only apparent strength I have? My looks? Even if it is absolutely in vain, at least its something positive.

""Coming, Mother..."" I went down the staircase. My brain was a mess. I was so full of torment and anger. Then I tripped on my own two feet and flew head first down the stairs. Except that I didn't hit anything. I had shut my eyes instinctively, but when I opened them I could see that I was floating. 

""MAHLI!"" Mother yelled at me again.

""Let her starve. All she does is mope around and feel sorry for herself anyways,"" I could hear my brother Belenus' voice. Naturally, I heard zero response from my father.

I collected myself and reached out for the rail and leveled my feet. I ...flew. It hit me. My eyes flew wide in an instant. My pupils dilated so fast that everything became brighter for a bare instant. 

""Every child is born holding an object that corresponds to their power.""

""First child ever to be born with nothing.""

""But there *was* something there."" I murmured to myself. ""The *air*."" What had awoken so suddenly, and how? I floated back up the stairs to the bathroom. Something was different. My eyes held a shimmer that was not there earlier.

""**MAHLI**. GET YOUR ASS IN HERE THIS INSTANT!""

""**I said I was coming!**"" For gods' sake, what did I do to deserve this? For that matter, why were they too dumb to see what was clear as day? Had nobody ever been born with the power to control the air itself?

I made sure to stomp down the stairs as loud as I possibly could, pulled the chair out and sat down to eat in a slump. Naturally I got the most gummy piece of meat, like always. Like I was their dog. 

""Mother, Father."" I stated the two words without any iota of inquisitiveness, like a line item on a long list of boring subjects. I waited the long moment before I felt their attention actually shuffled over to me. 

""Do you love me?"" I asked. They looked at one another in a way that answered the question without them saying a word. 

""Of *course* we love you honey."" My mother finally choked out, almost as if it were a joke. Like as if I were a joke. To them, I was the joke. Their source of eternal shame.

""What of you Belenus?"" My brother was not even paying attention as usual. He had his phone hovering in front of his head. If he ever procreated it would be because he hacked the woman's brain, not because of any level of humanity or caring.

""Hm?"" His mouth was stuffed with a prime cut of meat. He always got the better cut.

""Do you love me?""

""Uh. . . Sure?"" He held an awkward stare at me literally long enough to show his discomfort.

""Why are you asking this, Mahli?"" My mother asked. Father was back to staring into nothing. Probably thinking about what rock he was going to turn into diamonds next or something.

""Because for my entire life, you have all shunned me. Disrespected me. Looked down upon me as though I were the most pathetic thing ever to live.""

""Well sweety..."" My mother started her 'fake endearment tone' up. ""Its because... its because you *are*. You were born with nothing in your hands, you have no abilities like the rest of our society.""

I was expecting that, but I had not expected it to cut so deep. I choked in a sob and tears ran down my cheeks. I stood up in a huff. 

""Should not a mother love her daughter? Should not a father love his daughter? Should not a brother be a protector for his sister? I am not a weakling animal!"" I slammed my fist down on the table. It hurt. ""I am a human fucking **being**. Just once in your god damned lives why do you not just look at me for what I really I am rather than what society tells you that you should expect me to be?""

""I've had quite enough of this attitude of yours. You can go to your room without dinner."" Her eyes were like steel, and she was hovering ever so slightly. Gods, she really had no love for me whatsoever. I was a nuisance. ""**Now**.""

""Mother. Father. Brother."" The fury was so deep. The anguish so deep I could feel my heart being ripped in two. ""Each one of you can go fuck yourselves.""

I reached my hands out. I could feel my teeth clenching almost so hard that they might crack under the pressure. The temperature in the room dropped. For as long as they had to live in my moment of rage, they had just long enough to realize that they had made a fifteen year old error. 

It would still take some time to figure it out, but my ability had nothing to do with air. It was atomic. I had direct control over atoms and molecules. How they interacted with one another. What bonds they held whether electrostatic or covalent, primary or dipole.

Worse was how little pity I felt as I vaporized my immediate family, freezing every electron in their body, cutting their atomic bonds entirely, and watching as the faded into an atom thin dust. After all, this was not a premeditated murder. It was fifteen years of dealing with psychological torture. Fifteen years of not feeling even the slightest iota of love from those who should have loved me more than anyone else in this world.

And you see, nobody else knows this. The murder investigators found me weeping and sobbing in a corner helplessly with burns across my back as I had tried to escape. I was the girl who was powerless to do anything to stop the masked super villains from vaporizing my parents. 

With that, I went from the most scorned and shunned girl on the planet to the one that everybody felt suddenly compelled to protect out of pity. The wealthy who wished to have advertising advantages and excellent PR filled my bank accounts so that I could purchase the proper protection, pay for my education, and afford a comfortably villa out in the forests of Montana far, far away from everybody else to not be in the limelight, but ""taken care of"" enough that nobody felt any serious guilt.

Nobody. Suspects. *Anything.*

And with you, nobody else ever will. Not now. Not ever. Secretly, I will forever be the most powerful woman on the planet. One of the most beautiful darlings this world has ever known. The most 'normal' girl the world has ever known. 

So when some fuck like you comes along and tries to muscle his way in to take advantage of me for his own gain, they will always find me to be a very illusive prey.

You see, because not only do I have the ability to vaporize people who have wronged me, but I absorb their power in that same instant. You are now the seventh individual to come here and attempt to take advantage of me for their own pitiful gain. 

Not only will the video cameras in this room tell the world exactly what *I* want them to see, but they'll also show that it was you who thought it would be a good idea to pick me up, throw me across the room, rip my clothes off, attempt to rape me, only to have the guards show up just in the nick of time to take you down with tranquilizers. 

The best part is that that little pocket recorder you have right now? Go ahead and hit play, sweetheart.""

*click*

""No, please no! Get away from me I'm begging you. Please just leave me alone, I'm ju---**blood curdling screaming**""

*click*

""Y--Y--You're insane!""

""No, Mr. Napier. I am your worst fucking *nightmare*. I am the other meaning of Mahli.... *'sick'*.""",thestorycorps

You are the first child in history who comes out of the womb clutching nothing.",Tamox,"Mind still fuzzed by the exhaustion, Darrel woke to the sound of a faint curious gurgling. It wasn't crying yet, but it would probably be if he didn't respond. It was not surprising. The baby sometimes slept through an entire night now, but still not always.

Turning to one side, he saw the Cheryl was still sleeping, and he helped the process along with a wave of somnolence, his own super power. Not too deep; just enough to keep her resting. She needed it more than he did. His power greatly extended his own capacity for sleeplessness as a side effect. He recovered his slippers from the under the bed and then hurried to little Nathaniel's room. 

Passing into the room, he couldn't help but glance up at the empty frame hanging on the wall where the boy's birth token should have gone. Feather, stone, gem, key, charm, leaf. *Something* should have come out clutched in Nathaniel's tiny hand; some token giving a hint what power he was bringing into the world with him. Parents always prepared a frame to keep it in, so they could spend hours holding one another while they studied that precious token, whispering between them what they thought it signified for their child's future. All that had been denied to Cheryl and him. Nathaniel had come out of the womb bearing no token whatsoever. 

""There, there, little man,"" Darrel called out soothingly as he approached the crib, trying to think of anything but the possibility that perhaps his child would have no special power. It was far too early to accept such a crippling disability might have afflicted their son. But when he glanced over the edge of the crib, he stood puzzling. It was empty.

""Nat?"" he called softly, looking around. Then he stared back down into the empty crib and saw the missing bars from the side. Circling around to get a better look, he found a hole easily big enough for a baby to crawl through, and Nat had just started crawling. But... this was practically a new crib. They got it as a shower gift. It was good quality. No reason it should have started falling apart that way.

""Nat? Where are you, buddy?"" Darrel called out as he circled the crib slowly, looking for his boy. He couldn't have gotten that far, could he? Then Darrel heard the faint gurgling from the adjoining hall. Hastily popping his head out to look, he saw Nathaniel energetically crawling down the hall with a surprising energy.

""There you are!"" Darrel told him and a cheerful whisper-voice. ""Whatca doin', guy? Huh? Why you all the way out here?"" He hurriedly ran and lifted his son into his arms smiling softly and trying to turn the boy to face his daddy. But Nathaniel kept twisting in his grip and reaching out a hand toward the living room making ""ummm... ummm..."" sounds. His gurgle from a moment before didn't quite switch over into crying, but he took on a petulant tone that sounded something like frustration.

Darrel frowned as he stood there gently rocking Nathaniel, making soothing noises that didn't seem to do anything to soothe the boy. He started to get a vague, creepy feeling like a prickling at the back of his neck, and he listened very intently to the silence in the house but could make out nothing. Nathaniel continued to fuss. 

Step by step, he inched to the end of the hallway, rocking and soothing, soothing and rocking. Turning so that he held his son slightly behind him, he carefully ducked his head around the corner and looked around the living room. Then he sighed with great relief to find it was empty and dark, just as it should be. He chuckled a bit at his own paranoia. He lifted his son and smiled at him. 

""Daddy's just being silly, isn't he?"" he asked the boy, who looked a little red in the face. Then he turned to head back toward the nursery and immediately the boy crossed the line from petulant to full-on crying. *Oh great,* Darrel thought. *And now we're going to wake Cheryl after all. Ah, the joys of parenthood.* 

Well, it seemed like cheating, but it was all he had left. After quickly assuring that it wasn't a wet diaper or some other obvious cause like that, Darrel reached out to his son's forehead with one finger intending to push just the tiniest wave of somnolence into the boy. Not too much. The child was tiny, and he didn't want to cause him to sleep for days. He needed to calibrate this carefully.

Suddenly Nathaniel jerked his head back, and twisted his tiny face into a look of red faced rage. He pulled one tiny arm loose and thrust it at his father's chest like he was ineffectually trying to push him away. In any other situation, it should have been adorable rather than horrifying. 

.

Cheryl awoke with a start, looking around, trying to figure out what had woken her. She patted the bed beside her, but Darrel wasn't there. The house was silent, but she had awoken with an impression that a sudden noise had jolted her out of a deep sleep. Shifting her field of vision into the infrared in an attempt to see better, she was surprised to see a slow spreading cloud of cooler air flowing in from the hall leading to the living room. She jumped up and quickly wrapped a warm housecoat around herself before hurrying out to investigate.

She paused at the nursery and found the lights on, muttering in irritation as she lay a hand over her eyes for a moment while she cleared her infrared vision and shifted back into the visible spectrum. She saw the hole in the crib that had so baffled Darrel a short time before and a tiny bit of panic crept into her. Her senses accelerated to take in every detail of the room in the blink of an eye while the perceptual centers of her brain made it seem to her as if time had slowed down while she processed it. Even so, she saw no sign of her husband or son.

Turning quickly, she hurried on toward the living room calling out Darrel's name. In mid step, her call transformed into a cry of anguish as she saw him lying there on the living room floor. She ran to him and nearly collapsed in a dead faint when she cleared the sofa and saw the gaping hole in his chest where his heart and lungs ought to be. She screamed then, and her world melted into a soft white blur.

Cheryl forced herself to her feet then, eyes sweeping the room, her own abilities slowing down time, making the simple search of the room seem to take forever, dragging it out until it was almost more than she was prepared to bear, searching for her son, or an attacker, or some threat that could explain the nightmare that lay before her. 

But all she could see was Darrel, lying there dead with a significant piece of his chest missing. That, and the fact (so strange it almost didn't register as real) that the front door was not just standing open, but entirely missing, and her son was gone.

Ellie, my neighbor, could talk to cats. My brother David had a habit of always being late, even though he could travel at super speed. Mark could breathe underwater, not that he needed to though, since he could also walk on top of it. 


I had nothing. 


Literally nothing.


Everyone comes in to the world with a special item that hints to the parents what extraordinary thing their child would be able to do once they came of age. On the shelf above the fireplace in my family's living room sat the tokens everyone had come in to the world carrying, slowly gathering dust that would eventually be brushed off by my mother on Wednesday at the same time precisely every week, like clockwork. Because that was her power; she had an internal clock that was never wrong, and could tell what time it was just off the top of her head. That, and her underlying perfectionism, is what kept this family operating smoothly. Dinner was never late, and she was never frazzled or short on time. The silver women's timepiece she had brought with her on the day of her birth sat ticking away happily on the mantle, never even having a chance of tarnishing under my mother's punctual eye. My older brother and my father’s tchotchkes sat nearby as well. In the place where my token would have sat is a picture of me in second grade. 


My mom had placed it up there with good intent, not wanting me to feel left out, but it did little to hide the truth that I was born with nothing in my grasp. The doctors had no idea what to make of it, and my birth created a stir in the medical community for several years. They believed that maybe my empty hands were symbolic, or maybe I was a genetic anomaly, a possible sign of evolution, and did not come with a manifestation of my future power. But when my seventh birthday came and went, and I still had not shown an inkling of spectacular potential, they eventually lost interest in me. The latest anyone had ever developed their skill was at the age of six; usually, most kids were manifesting between the ages of three and five. According to them, I was a lost cause. And so now I lived as normal a life as possible for a twelve year old without powers. 


Normality for me meant that today was Thursday, and so I would watch TV in the living room until my mom came through the door at exactly five-ten, and tell me to turn it off and go fetch the groceries out of the car. I would race in and out of the house as fast as I could, hoping to get the chore done before the commercial break for my show ended. Sometimes I was lucky, and would then finish the episode uninterrupted before she would cajole me upstairs to finish my homework before dinner, which was always ready by exactly six-thirty. The only thing that would slow the family down was my brother’s perpetual tardiness. On a good day though, we would all be together sharing a meal by six thirty five. Even though we repeated this part of our day every day, no one ever tired of it. It was comforting and familiar, and kept my family together and in one piece, no matter how hard of a day we had previously had. My mother was always there for me, and was all the support I needed when I was feeling down after being picked on by David.


As I sat watching my show cozily in an armchair, my stomach growled, and a pang of hunger hit me. We had run a mile today in gym, and usually gym days left me ravenous around dinner time. Expectantly, I glanced over at my mother’s watch for the time. Its spindly arms showed that it was just about four forty-eight, close enough for mom to be home soon, but too late to sneak a snack out of the fridge before eating dinner. I sighed and rested my head on my hand, deciding to just wait and let the show distract me until my mother came home. 


A trumpeting sound on the TV jolted me awake, my heart attempting to race away from my body. My eyes automatically shifted over to the watch on the mantle near me, only for me to see that it had just been possibly moments since I’d last checked. I yawned and stretched, glancing back at the TV only to stop short at what I saw. On the screen was the nightly news, showing helicopter footage of the bridge that runs over the local lake and a crane attempting to pull something large out of the water. Scrolling along the bottom was information stating that a wreck had occurred. But what caught my attention was the time shown on the bottom corner of the screen: 6:12 PM. 


Confused I padded over to the shelf and picked up my mother’s watch, tapping on the glass cover. It hadn’t budged in the past minute or two; in fact the miniscule hand that kept track of the seconds had frozen. Stuck perpetually at four forty-eight. I’d never heard of her watch freezing before, and as far as I knew it had no need of winding. As I was running my thumb over the front of the watch thoughtfully, the television screen showed that the crane had successfully recovered a white sedan, and the screen changed to a shot of an on the ground reporter, with the car that was now being lowered back on to the bridge in the background distance. The front had been mangled and crushed beyond recognition; the vehicle must have hit the guardrail at high speed and then plummeted in to the water fifty feet below. The reporter, trying to give a play by play as events panned out, bought some time as local law enforcement pried open the driver’s side door by mentioning that judging by the extensive damage to the car, along with the fact that it had been submerged for almost an hour and a half, there was almost a one hundred percent chance that this had resulted in a fatality. 


In the middle of the reporter interviewing eyewitnesses detailing what they had seen, she suddenly became quiet, and pressed her hand against the earphone plugged against the said of her head intently. She mumbled a couple things off mic to the voices resonating In her ear, and then looked sharply up at the camera. 

“Folks, thank you for your patience. As I mentioned earlier, we have been running the plate of the car trying to I.D. the possible victim, and just received police confirmation now.”

Suddenly, I couldn’t breathe. It was like all the air had been kicked out of my lungs. Up on the screen was my mother’s driver’s license picture. I had to still be asleep, right?

“The victim pictured here Caroline Yates, a mother of two, who resided in Ellis County. Police have confirmed that upon impact she must have died instantly, leaving her time of death at four forty-five. Attempts are currently being made to contact her family.”  

The rest of the televisions cacophony fell on deaf ears. I stood frozen in shock, my fist shaking as it clutched my mother’s inert watch. A thousand thoughts cycled around in my head at what felt like the speed of light.

I’m alone. 
My family won't survive without her.
I’ve got nothing without her.
I have nothing. 
I have nothing. 
*I have nothing.*

In between my panicked and shaky breaths, I became hyper focused. I hated this watch, this symbol of my family taken away from me. I didn’t want it here anymore; I don’t even want it to exist. I loathed it with every fiber of my being. In my mind’s eye I could see the particles making it, the thing called atoms that Mr. Thomlasson had taught us about in science last year. I imagined them disappearing, one by one, dissolving like grains of sugar falling in to a glass of warm water. And then I realized I wasn’t imagining it. The watch was literally disappearing in my grip, its edges falling away and diffusing in my grip. However, I was too panicked and distraught to see the irony now showing in my ability, in having been born with nothing in my hands. I didn’t want to be here anymore, I didn’t want anyone to have anything anymore. 
I heard screams on the TV as the last of the watch vanished from my grasp, and noticed the edges of the screen were becoming transparent, and all the items in the room were becoming fuzzy, while at the same time everything became whiter. On the screen, the television reporter, the woman who gave me the news that was ending my world, was becoming nonexistent herself. Both of her arms and legs were dissipating away, closing in on the center of her body while she screamed in horror. Behind her were panicked rushes of people, some on the ground, fading away and disappearing as the camera recorded on. The camera itself caught the last moments of the reporters screams before the television vanished as well, like so much smoke.

I didn’t want anyone to have anything anymore if I couldn’t have anything. I wanted everything gone. I didn’t want to be here. I feel myself tearing apart, parts of me vanishing bit by bit My shaky breathes radiate through an open, white space, before they stop completely. I no longer exist, there’s no longer air, or sound. Everything except my mind seems to be gone. I am alone.


I was special. 

I have nothing.

Literally nothing.

Some stood inside the walls.  All were there to see the birth.  And what an extraordinary birth it was expected to be.  

Six months ago, when the mother, a simple strongwoman, had gone in for her gender and power x-ray vision exam, things had become complicated.  The x-ray vision tech had seemed perplexed and had called in her co-workers for second and third opinions.  They had all assured the worried mother that the baby was alive and well and perfectly healthy and oh, it's a boy, but they needed to run some more tests.  They sent her down the hall to the ultrasonic hearing lab and then on to the empathy ward and finally referred her over to a specialist in miniaturization.  Finally, after that doctor regrew to normal size and showered off, they had a verdict.  The child's hands were empty.  No totems, no trinkets, no tchotchkes; a first for medical science. 

Oh, certainly there had been children born with no hands or no appendages, but they had all, to a one, had a gem or other object embedded in their foreheads or chests.  It was genetically impossible *not* to have a power bauble.  The medical science community was slightly perturbed to find out they were wrong.

So, the mother was admitted to the hospital immediately and quarantined on bedrest for the remainder of the pregnancy.  There was no other family so there was no one to complain.  Well, except the mother, but that's to be expected.  All the while doctors and scientists ran test after inconclusive test and awaited the birth with a great deal of interest.

On the due date the mother was moved from quarantine down to the delivery room, which had formerly been an operating theater, so as to accommodate the large crowd of curious onlookers and gawkers.  A qualified psychic was on hand to induce labor.

The room was hushed (except to those with super-hearing, but they were used to it) and expectant.  As was the mother.  Then she grunted and groaned and the show began.  After an all-together normal hour of pushing, the empty-handed child slipped free of his womb and cried, clutching his hands in fists.  Everyone leaned a little closer.

 The nurse carefully detached the baby from his umbilical and toweled him off, trying to keep him in view of everyone at once.  Nothing of interest seemed to be happening, so she turned and gingerly placed the boy on his mother's breast.  He squawked.  The mother crooned.  The crowded chuckled impatiently.

And then the boy splayed his hands out onto his mother's chest and -pop- she was gone.  The boy seemed to hang in the air for a split moment while the collective brainpower of the room froze in startlement.  Except the nurse, who used her superpowered reaction time to catch the falling child.  And -pop- she, too, was gone.  The momentum from her sudden absence sent the baby, now noticeably toddler-sized, toward a visiting brainiac surgeon.  His reaction time was just normal enough that he couldn't move out of the way, even though his neurons were fast enough to tell his body that it should try.

As the -pop- from the brainic's vanishing reached the super-ears in attendance, the pre-teen baby landed awkwardly on his feet and caught his balance on the two levitating doctors that were behind where the brainiac had been, just as they tried to hover up and away -pop-pop-

The 8-foot projectile baby was lifted back into the air and launched, hands wide open, into the upper viewing gallery, passing through the phase-walking doctors inside the glass partition on the way. -pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-

With all the other guys born with objects, they all think to be some hero ready to save the world or something.  
It's been over some years since the only person being known as ""the Mistake"" has been born. That's me. I have long accepted my fate, and I sit away from others at school, while others show off their powers during lunch.  
The flying boy Mark flew over the lunchroom, to show off his new flying tricks. I only glanced at Mark before I looked away. I spun my spoon around the horrible soup the cafeteria served. I can't understand why people could stand a soup that smells like rotting fish. I swept my eyes for a quick look at what the other students are doing. Oh, of course! They're changing the soup entirely to a buffet with their powers!  
I walked towards the busy, rustling student buffet which smelled like something gods would serve to their children. It was heavanly. A girl in front of the line turned a rock into gold, and was allowed entry. I was the follow-up, and I stood in front of the line. My heart was pumping, cowarded my head, and pointed my fingers together. Unable to speak, my cheeks turned red, and I was about the leave the line. The boy who managed the line started laughing, and called out, ""I remember you!""  
I scratched my head, ""You do?"" a small chuckle came out.  
""Of course! You're the loser without any powers! Hahaha!"" he laughed out loud.  Everyone else started giggling their guts outs. Everyone seemed to be pointing at me. Their laughs were sharp like knives. I feel as if I was cornered, as if I can't get out. I feel as if my tears were struggling to come out. I was lost somewhere in my mind. Finding a reality, a place, a person, where they will accept me for who I am. Principle Osiris came into the room, and everyone became silent. They all went back into showing off to each other.  
The principle asked me, ""Would you like to come into my office for a minute?""

I started tearing up, and I ran down the hall. Principle Osiris started to run for me, but I was already at the door. I blasted open the school door and ran all the way back to my aunt's house, where I lived now.  
After a few hours of being in bed at home, alone, I stopped crying, and turned on the television. It opened and the light seemed to hurt my red, sore eyes. My vision was blurred, but I heard it.  
""After becoming principle at Southern Rock High School for 4 years, Principle Osiris commited a mass murder of students, while appearing to be 'insane' in camera footage during the murder.

The Amulet Final arrived sooner than anyone would have liked, as exams often do. Zack, Lisa, Jimmy and I were waiting in the auditorium, trading snacks from our lunches while the students waited their turn. I knew my presence was pointless, but I thought my company would help keep them relaxed before the big test. 

Jimmy was the first of us to be summoned. He reappeared a half-hour later, looking rather sullen. Apparently, he said, juggling didn’t even come close to proving superhero status. “Well, if you can’t fight bad guys with your balls,” I joked, “At least you can give them a good show.” 

When Lisa was called, her test took longer than we expected. She came back with tears streaming down her face. “I was so close,” she said. “But he told me I’ve got parts of my abilities I haven’t even come close to realizing.” She was the first student to return with even a semblance of optimism—the others had failed quite abruptly, being only 13 years old. 

After several hours had gone by, only Zack and few other students remained. Zack was showing me how to put out a fire ball without burning my fingers when the voice came on the loudspeaker:

“Ben Edison. Ben Edison. Please report to the Grand Master's chambers immediately.” 

Zack and I stared at each other in shock. I couldn’t move. “That’s you,” he said, nudging me to get going. My chest felt empty; either my heart had stopped beating, or it was pumping so fast it seemed motionless. 

I made my way through the auditorium, and I could feel the burn of the other student’s eyes on my back. It was more of a chill, really, seeing as cold indifference was what most of them treating me with anyways. The chamber doors were immense, golden and daunting, forged from melted amulets of our deceased ancestors. I stood before them for a minute, a minute which defied the concept of time and felt near eternity. 

“Come in, Ben,” boomed a voice from inside. 

I pushed the doors open with great effort, revealing a most majestic study. Ancient book and scripts lined the walls between oaken shelves; there were large paintings of the original Amulets, rustic and yet graceful; a fire roared calmly to the side. The Gaia Grand Master sat in the middle of the room on a cushion, his legs crossed and eyes closed. He looked tired and worn down, the cost of over 100 years of guiding our people. I took a seat on the cushion before him. After a few minutes of silence, he began the test. 

“Ben,” he said, eyes still closed. “Show me your progress.” 

I stared at the ground, dismayed. “I don’t have a power to show you, Grand Master.” 

“That is not what I mean. Show me your progress.”

“I don’t understand,” I said. “What progress could I show you?”

“Do you think you were born without a purpose?” said the Grand Master. “We are all born for a reason.”

“I wasn’t born with an amulet, sir. I can’t imagine what my purpose is,” said Ben. 

“I see. Well then let our test begin instead with a few questions, shall we?” He opened his eyes, staring at me with vacuous eyes that hadn’t desired to see for centuries. 

“How are your grades?” asked the Grand Master. 

“I’m at the top of my class,” I said, sheepishly. 

“Do the others treat you well?”

“My friends do, yes. But the others ignore me as though I’m invisible.” 

“Very good,” he said. “That won’t be the case for long.
“Final question: what is my Amulet?” 

I didn’t expect this. I looked at his chest, seeing a massive aluminum chain wrapped around his neck, but most of it was hidden by his tunic. No one had ever told us what the Grand Master’s power was, and we had never asked. I said that I didn’t know. The Grand Master closed his eyes again.

“Most of us are forced to be something when we are born. The will of the Gods, the want of the parents. We are pigeonholed into a singular point of view, a direction that knows no lateral movement.” He started unwrapping his grey tunic. “The greatest leaders of our time did not excel at just one thing. They had many talents, and understood this power from the most unbiased point of view. They knew that dedicating your life to one thing is the surest way to miss out on everything.” 

He open the tunic, revealing the aluminum chain below. At the bottom of the chain, resting against his quiet chest, was nothingness. 

“What? I don’t understand… You were born without an amulet too?” asked Ben. 

“Oh, no, no,” he laughed. ""I was born with one. The Candle Amulet, actually, and I was the best fire wielder this universe had ever known. But those who assume the Grand Master position must willingly resign their Amulet, having it melted into the golden wall of this very chamber. I haven’t had powers for the last hundred years.""

He opened his eyes, this time filled with tears and joy. “We are all born with a purpose, Ben,” the Grand Master said. 

“And your purpose might be the purest one of all.” ",joshglads

""Where is it?!"" Tom shouted at the obstetrician, threatening to hit him with his amulet. The doctor looked shocked and confused, as a deer would in headlights. Although these headlights looked terribly similar to a light bulb.

""I... I don't know,"" said the doctor. He peered under the sheets, hoping the object had been lodged on its way out. ""It's not there,"" he said, his face prickling with the rush of blood. His own amulet shook against his beating chest: a golden syringe hanging loosely from an aluminum chain.

""Do you take me for a fool?"" said Tom. ""We are all born with one, it is written in stone. Although I'm starting to doubt the validity of yours. How could there be nothing?""

The doctor clenched his amulet. His powers of healing and medicine had never failed him before--why have they now?

""I'm sorry, Tom,"" said the doctor. He turned to the bed, knowing he should bite his tongue but feeling his teeth unable to do so. ""Perhaps you might use *your* powers to figure this one out?""

Tom's expression changed from that of disappointment to lividity. ""*My* powers do not extend to this field,"" he said, with a bitterness that could be tasted. He flashed his amulet, as he was always known to do: a golden light bulb that glinted under the harsh hospital lights. ""I was only given the gift of innovation. Seeing the future from the lens of technology. And despite my visions of tomorrow, I seem unable to explain your ineptitude today.""

Tom looked down at the baby with a resigning sigh. There he was, wet and bloody, resting empty-handed on his mother's chest. *What a healthy, handsome boy,* thought Tom. The baby was smiling ever so slightly. *It is a shame that such beauty must be wasted so plainly*

There are those who think they're different, and there are those who know it. I fell firmly in the latter category.

When I was old enough to understand, my father explained that I had been born without an amulet, rendering me the first and only powerless birth in the Gaia Universe. And just like my parents--and the countless scientists who studied me over the years--I could never understand why. I would spend the nights of my youth reading the history of our kind, searching for the source of our power. While nothing was definitive, most scholars believed that the Gods had grown weary of watching over humans and had separated their souls into thousands of abilities to let us fend for ourselves. The golden birth amulets were the manifestation of those abilities; each amulet representing a different power.

I'd often pray to these Gods before bed, apologizing for whatever I did to deserve my adequacy.

Recess was the hardest time, the daily 20 minutes of dejection where my classmates showed off their amulets and budding powers. Every day I watched from the classroom window, elbow on the sill and one hand holding up my head, as though loneliness had a certain weight to it. Apparently, without an amulet, it was too dangerous for me to play with the others.

I still made friends, but because they were unable to resist using their abilities, they all treated me with the type of kindness that reeked with pity. There was Lisa, who had been born with the Cloud Amulet, giving her the gift of flight. There was Jimmy and his Octopus Amulet, granting him the ability to grow up to eight arms at will. And there was my best friend, Zack, who dawned the coveted Candle Amulet around his neck, giving him the power to create fire with his hands. Everyone in our universe just accepted that not all powers were equal--except for me. Being powerless came with the privilege to take exception to almost anything.

--- 

“It’s unfair, really,” said Zack, as he threw mini-fireballs at the basement ceiling from his back. 

“Tell me about it,” I said. 

“Well at least he wasn’t born with the Hammer Amulet,” said Lisa. “I’d rather anything than the Hammer Amulet.”  The Hammer Amulet granted it’s owner the alluring ability to turn their forehead into a metallic brick, letting them wreck havoc with a few tasty head butts. 

“I don’t know, maybe you do have a power,” said Jimmy, struggling to juggle 16 balls at once. “The power to not have to practice for the Amulet Final every goddamn night.” 

He was right, I thought. The Amulet Final was dreaded by students of any ability. Each year, the Gaia Grand Master would summon you into his chambers and ask you to demonstrate your abilities. If you didn’t perform at superhero levels, you were forced to return to school and continue your education; a befitting punishment for a teenager's natural aversion to learning. No one below the age of 17 had ever passed the Amulet Final. And lucky for me, no one without powers had ever been tested. 

“Hey Jimmy, catch!” said Zack, flinging a fireball towards one of the balls in mid-air, engulfing it in flames. 

“Alright. I know it was your birthday last week, but I’m feeling some birthday beatings Round Two,” said Jimmy, chasing Zack around the basement with his eight arms flailing about. 

Lisa floated over to me, hanging upside down until her hair covered my face. “Boys will be boys,” she said with a smile. 

*Superheroes will be superheroes*, I thought. ",joshglads

"[WP] You are the last living person on the planet. You always were an extremely introverted person and as a result couldn't be happier in your new life. You suddenly find yourself in a position where you could restore civilization, and save the human race.",mcdok,"
It was a day like any other, I had grown used to feeling happy all the time, never before had I felt so exuberant in my life. This might seem misanthropic but ever since the human race was viped out due to an incurable virus, my happiness levels have been off the charts. I don't hate people, I just don't like them and yes, there is a difference between those two things. I am what they call an introvert, I prefer to be alone than in other people's company. 

Why am I immune to this virus? I have no idea. I do have a theory formulating in my mind which doesn't really carry scientific merit but it makes me feel good, that may make me seem delusional but it is what it is. I believe I am a unique and special snowflake. It might not seem credible but no one is going to laugh at me, since no one but me is alive. So, I can break all constraints that have bound my actions in the company of others and experience everything I ever wanted to experience.
After waking up at noon, I make coffee for myself before proceeding to sit besides the fireplace where I start reading a new book. It is a children's book and I am loving it. This is the best part about this new world, now, I can read books for pleasure rather than to try to appear educated. Hours pass by without me realising it as I am lost in this book. Suddenly, I stumble upon a piece of paper within the book which makes me stop reading and I start observing it. At first, I do not consider it to be of any significance and am about to throw it out but after glancing over a word I reconsider my initial stance and begin reading it.
As I read what is in front of me, I am shocked. The paper infront contains the writings of a mad scientist who was experimenting with eradicating all of humanity through a virus. He was supposed to stay alive, and thought about restoring humanity after this. Unfortunately, he died in the purge that took place. 
As I continue reading through the text I continue to be awed  by how accurately the scientist had depicted the extinction of the human race. In the last few paragraphs, the scientist describes the procedure to resurrect humankind. As soon as I realise the significance of what I am reading I turn the paper upside down and contemplate over this before I read further. 

I have the power to restore civilization and I am still hesitating about this, I must be a horrible person, I say to myself. No one else would pass up this opportunity. The next few minutes of my life involved the most intense thinking I have ever done in my life. Immediately after this, I proceed towards the fireplace with the paper in my hand and tear it to pieces before burning it while simultaneously closing my eyes because I cannot bear to see myself commit such an act. 
The following night I have the most troublesome nightmares in my sleep, I see myself calling for help in the streets but no one is answering my call. Then, I realise what a terrible mistake I had made. No man is an island instead of me. And I am doomed to remain one for the rest of my life due to my own actions. After I have fully accepted this truth, I take out the revolver from my drawer and my last few breaths end with a gun pressed to my head, three, two, one, and I am gone. The amazing miracle of death. One minute you are experiencing life and in the next, oblivion. Maybe this is better afterall, maybe I will find peace this way.",BlackenGuru
"[WP] ""If love could have saved you, you would have lived forever.""",Accias,"Scientists had been looking for the Elixir of Life, the Fountain of Youth for centuries.  From alchemists wanting to discover the elusive Philosopher's Stone to modern chemists testing for ways to extend a person's lifespan.  All of it was in vain.  Nobody managed to reveal a method to prevent the gradual degradation of DNA that lead to errors in cell replication.  The gradual breaking down of organs and systems that appeared over time.  Even as other diseases and conditions were eradicated, aging itself became the only natural cause of death.

Until the day an accidental discovery was made on a side project.  A pharmaceutical researcher had been testing various compounds in an attempt to find a mixture that would give the user an affectionate outlook towards other people without any significant mental or neurological detrimental effects.  Despite his supervisor's insistence on calling the project by the name assigned by the corporate office, he always referred to it as “Project: Love Potion.”

The researcher had exposed a number of blood samples to a new mixture.  It was a process he had completed numerous times before on countless samples.  First, directly mix the blood with an amount of the latest drug and check for any clotting or break down of red or white blood cells.  Since there were no more than the most basic of preservatives, this would happen eventually.  It was his job to verify this decay didn't occur any faster in the exposed samples than it did in the control sample.

Over the duration of his 10 hour shift, the quiet researcher had repeated his routine actions more times than he cared to count.  He was mentally and physically exhausted.  Just one more batch to run, then he could go home for the night.  He placed each sample under the lens of its own microscope.  He leaned back and watched the digital displays connected to each scope for signs of decay.  Five samples plus one control, six monitors arrayed above the counter.  He stopped the timers automatically activated on each scope at the first sign of cellular death.  

The corporate bigwigs didn't care for the exact time for each sample, just whether or not the chemical caused problems in the blood more or less than 10% faster than the control sample broke down on its own.  The researcher made the required notes in his log as each sample was considered “dead.”  One particular sample remained active long after the others were little more than biological waste, even the control.  The researcher simply noted in the log that sample RC-152 had survived longer than the control and started shutting lights off.  His weariness caused him to forget the samples on the microscopes and the digital displays still active.

The researcher returned the next morning.  In his mind, it was far too early considering the late hour he left yesterday.  However, the corporate machine kept running, regardless of who it ground up in the process.  He turned the lights in the lab on and logged into the secure computer before noticing the batch of samples still on the scopes, the congealed, dried pools of blood displayed on five of the six monitors.  One monitor still showed fresh blood.  No more decayed than if it had been drawn just moments ago.  After spending the night at room temperature in an open container, there was no reason it should look any different than the other samples.  Yet here it was.  Red blood cells just as round as ever.  No signs of clotting or separation of the plasma and other components.  This was something the researcher had never seen before.

The researcher made a phone call to his supervisor.  She would want to know about this.  Besides, it was above his paygrade to figure out where their sample procurement procedures had broken down.  Let the corporate folks figure out what to do with RC-152.

That one phone call led to months of calls, texts, urgent emails, and video conferences.  Finally, one executive reads a report to a highly paid corporate vice president.  He scans over his own personal notes before speaking words he had been rehearsing while waiting in the VP's outer office.

“Sir, it appears like we have confirmation of the discovery.  After a number of scans and verifications by labs independent of each other, it was determined that sample RC-152 contained a previously undiscovered trace hormone produced when one experiences significant physical and emotional affection.  Apparently this particular blood sample was drawn by a nurse from a young man that had had a crush on her since they were both young neighbors.  He proposed to her immediately afterwards, using some line about her taking his blood after having his heart for so long.

“This hormone reacted to the drug being tested in that lab and, essentially, stopped all cellular decay.  Cells still replicated and died naturally, but there none of the errors occurred in the cellular DNA that normally causes samples to become nonviable.”

The VP looks up from the reports before him.  He doesn't understand any of the medical jargon printed on the pages.  He had studied accounting and business management, not chemistry or any of the micro related sciences.  He paid others to know that stuff.

He stares the executive in the eyes and waves his liver-spotted hand over the sheets arrayed across his desk.  “Break it down for me.  What does all of this mean?  In simple, layman's terms.”

For me I always became more beautiful. Last year my hair changed from yellow to true gold. Metallic. The year before my eyes turned from brown to olive. I could see better than twenty twenty. They were large and wide. 

Today I had new skin. It was poreless. It lacked the freckles I'd had before. When I looked in the mirror I was surprised by how my delicate bones stick out and how small and young I looked.

The metallic sheen belongs to a knife, buried in the girl's back, blood staining the photographers hands. The horrific photo is positioned in a way the you can imagine being in the camera's perspective, staring emptily at the scene of the murder you committed. 

But that's not the most distressing part. The most distressing part is the username automatically attached. My username. My heart is throwing itself against my rib cage.

""Why?"" 

I watched the Ten-Iz Ball sail across the sky. The grey sphere went past my Tree. It hit the trunk, bouncing off of it. It rolled down the hill into...

The Bushes.

The Bushes encircled my domain. They stretched across the backyard, backed by large brown walls that defended my kingdom's inhabitants. The Bushes held small balls that squished when I stepped on them. I tried them once, to test their potency. Much too bitter. Along with the balls were tiny swords that would dig into my fur like teeth into my stuffed animals. 

The Ten-Iz Ball laid on the soft mulch. I looked at my vassal, annoyed at her ignorance. I have protected her. Entertained her. Even loved her. However, she throws my people's relics as if they were toys. Even when I return it to her, she would only throw it away once more. It eats away at my trusts, but her treats and scratchies renews my faith in her. 

I bounded towards the Bushes. I stop several feet in front of them. They loomed over me, staring at me. Mocking me. 

I bowed to them, just as I have done before. Then, I crawled towards them. Thankfully, the Bushes allowed me to pass under them. Carefully, I gripped the Ten-Iz Ball with my jaws. The mulch gave an earthy, warm flavor to the felt. Not dissimilar to the boots I chew upon. 

This was the tricky part. The Bushes would grant me passage, but returning always posed a risk. The Bushes would sometimes bite into me anyways. To remind me of their power. 

Foot by foot, I crept backwards. Finally, I made it out of the Bushes. My mouth dropped drool onto the Ten-Iz Ball to rehydrate the relic. 

I returned from my journey, gifting my relic once again to my vassal. She knelt down, thanking me for the gift by rubbing behind my ears. Then, she gave me a familiar vocal cue. High pitched. Holding out the Ten-Iz Ball. Oh no.

She threw it again.

1. Your approach changes with each paragraph, you go from a thoughtful inner voice to less thoughtful narrative voice. This may be (bad) character development or just rushed writing, you could try utilising this in longer pieces of writing. 

2. ""another quick scratch onto the side of my barrel"" This whole idea is a very moving, it is ideas like this that make any piece of writing much more captivating; if well developed and continued along side the plot. Work on that. 

3. The structure is somewhat lacking, the story, while in chronological order the story jumps from place to place, this too, can be used to create atmosphere if used properly

Ever since I was in the hands of the marksman I knew everything was right.  He watched over me, and hell, some days he even took better care of me than himself.  Training was hell though.  He was still learning, still new to my bulky form.  I was dragged, thrown, and even left to decay in the mud.  He always came back though, Ruter would always come around.

   Our first taste of combat was in the Battle of Moscow.  Each and every boom brought about the end of another life, and another quick scratch onto the side of my barrel.  He would always murmur to himself, telling him not to forget those that he killed, that they had families, that they were human.

   As the war waged on, we grew in prestige.  We were among the first assigned on a mission were sniping was involved.  We were the kings of the battlefield, deciding whom would live and whom would die on each fateful day.  Each day brought about more and more scratches onto my side, but I didn't mind.  It seemed to help Ruter cope.

   It was a day just like this one that was our last together.  Another day of toying with death.  With a loud boom in the distance, Ruter fell, a bullet lodged firmly into his body from an enemy sniper.  I'd never have guessed that Ruter could be best.  He was always there for me, he was always the number one marksman, he always spotted the target before they could pin him.  Except today.  So, I fell into the mud, forgotten to all.

   I was dug up a couple decades later.  They found me right where he'd dropped me all of those years ago.  They cleaned me once more, like Ruter used to, taking care to oil me properly, and clean each and every part.  My founders then put me out here, into this museum, where I proudly display my story to all who are willing to listen.",Kal217

Each civilization no matter how great will one day crumble back to dust.  Dust which settles into legends, passed down from person to person.  We broke that truth.

   Waking up with a stretch, I roll over onto my side lazily.  The TV still shines, a proud reminder of drinking myself to sleep the night prior.  But in all honesty, who wouldn't?  We almost lost everything.  It's a wonder that I still have my electricity.

""...Before signing off, we would like to remind everyone once more of the quarantine in effect due to the foreign organic matter that now litters our city.  Stay indoors, and provisions will be delivered weekly until the extent of damage this matter can cause is determined.  Thank you for watching New York's number one news station.""

   The broadcast begins its loop from the start.  I suppose that people would rather hear about the aftermath from the news, rather than a government announcement.  Easier to digest I suppose.  I stand, looking around my small room, then out the window.  Alien corpses litter the street, along with wreckage, debris, and ruins of buildings crushed by any of the above.  Sitting in an unsettling proximity to my window was the corpse of a pilot, from our side, hung from his parachute at the top of my building.  I look away, drawing the blinds shut quickly and covering my mouth.  Not even browsing /r/wtf could prepare me for that.

Leaving my room, I wander back and forth, pacing in my apartment.  Of course it had to be my city that was their primary siege location.  It couldn't have been somewhere else, like maybe Nigeria.  They have enough royalty that surely even those berserkers would be satisfied.  The thought brings forth a chuckle, followed by a sigh.  If that'd been their primary attack location we wouldn't have won.

   It was a lucky fighter pilot whom was receiving the lion's share of the praise.  Something about shooting a missile up an exhaust pipe on the alien's disc-like ship floating above the ocean mere miles out of the city.  Of course there were many other heroes, but he was getting all of the credit.  The face of the victory.

   The first of the provisions were to be delivered at 9 A.M. if the news program were to be believed.  So, I wait.  9:00, 9:30, 10:00.  The door remains quiet, no knocks, no talking down the halls.  I tap my foot impatiently, until finally the door rumbles against a fist.  I spring from my seat at the counter, and open the door quickly, a smile on my face.

   Instead of a government agent clad in a suit and tie, or even a stranger, I'm greeted by my next door neighbour.  He stands in the door frame, fidgeting with his hands.  Despite his large, barrel like frame, he appears awkward.  ""Oh, hey Dallas.  Did you get your provisions yet?  They haven't came for me yet..."" I shrug, trying to make small talk.

   It's then that I notice the distance in his eyes, the sweat dripping down his forehead, the pale in his skin.  This isn't like him.  ""We need to go downstairs.  They want to talk to us.""  He swallows hard, and without another word he turns on his heels and leaves.

   ""Dallas?"" I call after him, walking out of my apartment, leaving the door ajar as I try to catch up with him.  ""What's going on?""  Instead of answering he keeps his pace, looking down, obviously in dread of what lies in our future.",Kal217

To us, shadows are the only place of truth, the only place where he doesn't affect you. It's kinda funny how everything seems so nice, like in a fairy tale why you bathe in the sunlight. But then you see a nice shadow, or maybe you entered one unintentionally, and it starts coming back to you. The terror caused, countless people enslaved in an endless illusion.
Unfortunately for Sunshine, we have an ally. The shadows spread as she enters the sky with that fancy hat of hers. We started chanting her name as she fought his tyranny. Using his power against him, she shows no mercy. Our Moon has returned as the rightful Lord of our world, with the whole world rejoicing. It all seems so surreal now,how he fooled us.

His glasses frame was beaten and worn and the lenses were on their last legs but to go outside without them on was to meet certain death.

Two men directly ahead of him were stopped, looking skyward and basking in the sunlight. Simultaneously they each traced a circle shape with their hands then bowed. ""We greet you, lord in the sky that provides all life and warmth to us. Please continue to provide for us and care for us as we copy you in your image. Amen.""

More beautiful words could not meet his ears. He walked out towards where the two men were standing and performed the customary greeting ritual as well. Humanity was lucky to have such a powerful entity looking over them and watching their every move. It was well known that any crime done under the gazing light of the celestial might would find swift retribution.

In one more year, he would be granted a new pair of sunglasses. Crafted in the image of the sun's glasses to honor and respect it.

As he gazed unto the sun, something was amiss. He had not been the only one to notice it as hushed and scared whispers reached his ears. The sun had begun frowning.

This scale of event was unprecedented completely and slowly a panic brewed. First a simmer and then a boil. Some person had obviously made the sun very angry. This was disastrous. Tim dashed back into work and gingerly removed his shades (this was no time to be disrespectful). Thoughts raced though his mind but they had all one goal: fix it.

He raced up 5 flights of stairs and into the sun observatory he had just left from. all eyes were on the large screen up front, showing the sun's frown in impeccable detail. 56.8 degrees downward! The lowest recorded frown in all of history was 30 degrees and that was from old Greek texts thought to be unreliable.

There was exactly one person he needed to find right now. Ana. Physics geek and all star scientist. However she had let that get to her head and forgotten her place in the world. He skidded to a halt at her desk; A catastrophic affair littered with mounds of paper.

""Tim? I thought you were gone... Have you seen- ?""

""I saw it outside"" He nervously looked around then leaned in, whispering. ""Ana, I need to see where it's looking.

Earlier in her career she had proposed the unthinkable: look behind the sun's shades. It was pure heresy and only her brilliance and contribution to sun study had saved her from being sent to the electric chair. In this desperate time however, it might be humanity's only shot.

""If we can pinpoint where it's looking, maybe we can stop whatever is making it so unhappy. It's humanity's only shot. If it gets mad, it might wipe us all out.""

Yes or no was not needed. A look was enough to tell him she had thought the same thing.

""I made the program just in case. But I don't have access. Not after the court case."" She deflated. It had abruptly ended her career.

""Give it to me. I'll plug it in."" Tim knows it may be the last thing he does. However he was ready to meet his justice if it meant giving humanity a shot. ""After I plug it in, I will go outside without my sunglasses on and accept my fate.""

Wordlessly, Ana passed him a usb stick. ""Good luck""

All eyes were on the overhead screens and not the servers so tim was able to sneak between the rows and plant the USB stick firmly between the rows. All the computers whirred as the new commands started the become processed and analyzed the visual feed. He joined ana back at her desk as the overhead screens began to flicker and change.

""Modulating the visual feed for noise, we're able to pick up on the few photons that make it through the glasses."" Ana explained, eyes fixed on the screens. ""My program filters only those and displays what's behind it. Kinda like an X-ray. IT should be coming up on screen now""

The sun's eyes faded on screen to the astonished shrieks of everyone present. But they were not shrieks of betrayal or anger as the image brightened on the screen a feeling of dread entered the pit of Tim's stomach.

""My god."" Ana whispered.

""Where is it looking Ana. Is it looking where I think it's looking?""

""Yes Tim, it's looking where you think it's looking""

""Who would have thought it's been secretly just looking at the moon the whole time.""",lets_try_writing

[WP] It's not like the warning signs weren't there. People just refused to look.,Oxbury,"“It's not like the warning signs weren't there, people just refused to look!“ Aerian snarled as she readjusted her burden. She was neither right nor wrong in her analysis. The warning signs had indeed been there; the sky had gone dark promptly at noon every day for a week, the ponds in the Gardens of An’Shet turned silver with dead fish while the Gardens themselves were besieged by a virulent and determined black creeper that overgrew everything, a headless dwarf was reported born in the Spalder and is said to have struck the doctor before running out and vanishing into the neighbourhood, the sky dropped feet of snow even though it was the middle of summer, the list goes on.

But these are things that have happened annually in Keshmet for years, so the history books said, to considerable panic when they initially occurred. Then, as said years went by and nothing happened, they became just like the summer hurricanes; just another damned inconvenience over which there was no control to be endured. Shrug, curse if you were involved, and move on with life. Except for the one time the signs actually meant something.

Having just escaped the cataclysmic destruction of a major city I was in no mood to hear Aerian gloat. She had a partial right to rub this one right in our faces, having made her many objections known when we signed on as “Security Consultants” for the Kingpriest of Keshmet, but she was the most brutal pessimist among us and always assumed everything would go tits up. 

Vadik was in no mood to hear it either and wasn’t as shy about letting her know. “Just shut up and keep walking. And maybe next time work some of your voodoo and give us something more concrete than your usual moaning!” The bait was obvious to us old hands; Aerian has never claimed magical clairvoyance among her sorcerous talents, at least not when she wasn’t trying to make a few coppers off the superstitious, and Vadik has been with the Company longer than both Aerian and myself. The pair are mutually acrimonious to each other, but there have been incidents between them in the past that have triggered debate as to whether they’re genuine in their dislike or if they just want to find a quiet room and fuck each sore.

Obvious bait or not Aerian was ready for a fight, one we couldn’t afford given our situation. “Both of you cut that shit out! We need to get clear of the city and don’t have time to deal with one of your marital tiffs!” I used my best officer voice and gave them both a look I learned from an old drill sergeant on the other side of the world, and it only served to focus their animosity on me. Being the Senior NCO in a disaster with no higher authority present comes with some unpleasant duties, one of which is actually having to be in charge of the lives of everyone under you. And speaking of being in charge of other lives….

“Y’ okay back there kiddo?” As I turned back to the road and as Aerian and Vadik loudly cast aspersions on everything from my ancestry to my character I glanced over my shoulder at the child riding piggyback. She was a scraggly wisp of a girl; A pale hazel-eyed brunette who, if she’d had the fortune to not be born on the streets, would grow up to have a face wars would be fought over. Right now that face was dirty, tear-stained and terrified, showing all the emotions one would expect to see on the face of a child who’d seen their world end. She lifted her head and met my look with haunted eyes.

Maybe it was because she was tougher than she looked, maybe it was because she wanted to seem that way, but she nodded. “I’m okay mister Dom.”

That got a frown from me. “How many times I gotta tell you to drop the mister thing? I’m not old enough to be a mister.” An old gripe of mine, and a habit of hers she steadfastly refused to drop. 

Grabbing the kids as we escaped Keshmet had been a suicidal insistence of mine. We had employed them as spies and lookouts in exchange for food, coin, even shelter in a section of the barracks for the ones the Captain decided were trustworthy enough, and most of them had done right by us once they realized we weren’t going to rip them off. A lot of them were as capable and vicious as any member of the Thieves Guild, but many were just good kids forced into terrible circumstances. Aerian had one on her back and had another by the hand. Vadik, great lummox that he is, somehow managed three of them on his back and had all the energy of a man half his age. Many of those company members with me who had employed the kids had managed to save one. 

My girl, Kara, had the misfortune of having an alcoholic father who decided he could sell his daughter in the Enki-Maat souk and fund his next binge. Fortunately for her he had the idea on the same day I was assigned to patrol the souk, and I have nothing but contempt for the Kingpriest’s laws concerning women and their place in society. I beat her father to a pulp, charged him with assault and had him thrown into a cell. He didn’t survive long enough for trial and no one cared enough about the town drunk to raise a stink.

Soon after Kara showed up at the barracks, waited for me to show up and refused to leave me alone. She’d shine my armor, mended any clothes with holes, got me food, and in general made herself useful around the place. The ribbing from my comrades about having a child bride aside, I hadn’t wanted anything to do with her at first. I wasn’t the biggest fan of kids, and being the object of a child’s hero worship wasn’t something I was eager to be. Turns out I’m a bigger softie than any one of us would’ve guessed. I mean, when the city was crashing down around us I was willing to risk looking for her wasn’t I? 

Kara laid her head down again. All around me everyone seemed to go quiet as the adrenaline of imminent death wore off and we settled into the mindset of the march. After a few minutes Aerian walked up. “So what’s the plan boss?”

I sighed and shrugged. “We get clear of the city and see if we can find anyone else from the Company that survived. Head northwest I figure, back towards Bossk. No one will want to risk unfamiliar territory.” Aerian’s skepticism went un-aired, but I could sense it and knew it had to be addressed. “And if we’re the only ones left then we do what we always do and soldier onward.”

I looked back at the smoking ruin of Keshmet, not feeling an ounce of the optimism I was voicing. “It wouldn’t be the first time the company came back from nothing.”",Director_Danguy
[WP] It's not like the warning signs weren't there. People just refused to look.,Oxbury,"Xandar was slowly pushing his wagon on the side of the empty street, making his way towards the recycling center. He had spent all day sifting trough piles of junk, hoping to find something worth trading. Ever since the aliens destroyed most of the planet's infrastructure, recycling centers were pretty much the only place to get some food and water, other than joining an outlaw gang.

His companion Monty was walking alongside, carrying a huge burlap sack on his shoulder. He too had spent most of the day sifthing trough scraps and junk piles. Both Xandar and Monty were staying vigilant, their guns close to their hands. Pirates and thieves would often attack scavengers heading for the recycling center.

Needing to catch their breath, the 2 men decided to slop on a grassy hill, not too far from their destination but still hidden from view of the mainroad.

It was Monty who broke silence first.

&gt;You know, even after 3 years of hardship and chaos, I keep thinking back on it, and I can't understand how they got the best of us so easily

&gt;&gt;Are you fucking kidding me ? You want to have this discussion again ?

&gt;Yeah...Look I know you keep saying it was obvious from the beginning but I just don't see it like that.

&gt;&gt;What's not to get ? They arrived in warships, they killed and maimed millions, screwed up the planet and left with anything of value and most females. It doesn't take a genius to recognize space pirates!

&gt;Woh there, I mean hold on.... How we we supposed to know they were warship ? I mean it's not like human had a full encyclopedia of alien ships and markings.

&gt;&gt;The ships were covered in guns and painted skulls!

&gt;So ? Every emo kid had a skull and bones poster on the bedroom wall, didn't make them *evil murderers*...

&gt;&gt;They landed their ships on the people gathered to welcome them, crushed them to death.

&gt;Navigation error. Hell you remember basic training ? Perfectly landing a transport helicopter was hard man, imagine a giant hulk of metal on a new planet and gravity you're not used to. Was it shocking? Yes, but it was understandable.

&gt;&gt;They came out of their ships and murdered everyone in the vacinity.

&gt;They said they were sorry, said it was a problem with their universal translator. They thought we were hostile.

&gt;&gt;We hadn't even talked to them at this point, how can you mistranslate an inexisting conversation ?

&gt;Look, they apologized and said they were coming in peace.

&gt;&gt;Peace ? They captured, pillaged and raped everything they could find for 3 days!!!

&gt;They said it was a traditional welcoming ceremony. In fact I still think it was pretty rude of you to not participate since you were there. You know, help them feel welcome.

&gt;&gt;I was hiding for my life!!! 

&gt;Whatever, it's always *me* *me* *me* with you. You had a chance to participate at a real official first contact ceremony and you chose to hide.

&gt;&gt;Yeah well it was a little too much contact for my taste. Not to mention the murder. Did I mention the murder? Oh yes I did mention the freaking murders!

&gt;Allright I've had it with your complaining and you always accusing me of not being as smart as you. I'm sorry we're not all great vastly superior intelligent like you, he who can smell evil alien overlords a mile away!

&gt;&gt;I'm not.... look, I'm not trying to insult you. I'm just saying people should have catch on much sooner than they did. When people finally started to realise something *just might* be wrong, they were already departing, leaving us with nothing.

&gt;What do you want me to tell you, they looked friendly.

&gt;&gt;Friendly ? Their armors were covered in blood, sharp blades and skulls. That's not friendly.

&gt;I know, I know. They were pretty scary at first. But do you remember when they took off their helmets ? They looked just like furry little Hello Kitties.

&gt;&gt;Bloody murderous raping little Hello Kitties

&gt;Can you honestly look me in the eyes and tell me that you can be distrustful of a furry little Hello Kitty

&gt;&gt;No.... I guess you're right. They were pretty cute and cuddly.

&gt;Exactly, we didn't see it coming because they were cute and cuddly little Hello Kitties... not because of all the murderous massacre and violence, I mean that part was pretty obvious.

&gt;&gt;Yeah... I think I understand what you meant earlier. I still really miss the women though...

&gt;Yeah, me too. Still, it was really nice of them to take the women space sightseeing.

&gt;&gt;Oh yeah, totally. It's just that they said they'd be gone for a week and it's been 3 years.

&gt;Oh relax, you know how it can be. I bet Tess asked them to stop at every store in the galaxy. Beside, maybe it's US that got things wrong. We've been calculating in Earth time, who knows how long a galactic week actually is.

&gt;&gt;Probably. Still, the handcuffs were a bit weird.

&gt;Space safety belt. Just imagine the sheer pressure you must feel exiting the atmosphere. I'm glad they were securely tied in.

&gt;&gt;But didn't it seem weird to you when they photographed and measured every women before boarding ? Almost like a sales catalogue.

&gt;I did ask them about that. They said it was a surprise and asked me to keep it to myself but I guess there's no harm in telling it now. They planned to give every woman a special custom made dress to comemorate the occasion.

&gt;&gt;Really ? Wow that's awefully nice of them

&gt;I thought so too.

&gt;&gt;I guess I DO worry too much. They were pretty nice now that I think about it.

&gt;Exactly....now you get it! OK come'on, break time is over. We have to get to the recycling center before nightfall.

I remembered the sheen from her infant skin as the doctor delivered my dear owner. She was a tough one! She didn't let out a wail until the doctor slapped her buttocks. 

I was there, too, when she first rolled over. Oh, what a thrill. She suckled on her milk bottle then threw it away when she couldn't get any more. But she was still hungry! So she saw her milk bottle and tried to grasp it. She could not reach it though, so the clever child tried harder until she managed to roll on her chest. Well, she managed to take the bottle, but she couldn't roll on her back to drink! Oh, if you could only see her scrunched up face. We waited for hours for her mom to come get her, and when she did, she freaked! ""My baby rolled over!"" she said. Mom even took pictures. 

A couple of months after that, we started hearing music. She danced! At least that's what I thought when I watched her wave her plump limbs around. She also tried to move her head around, and I worried. I've heard her mom talk about how dangerous it could be, and I've seen her be extra careful. No one stopped the little bugger though, and she lifted her head to see where the beautiful music was coming from. If I had eyes, they would have widened when she lifted her head and chest to sit! Oh, that was a great moment. The music came from the speakers, of course, so I imagine she was disappointed!

Not long after that, my little girl learned to stand! Oh, that little devil reveled in attention. Mom and friends videotaped her as she got messy with clay. She heard her name, looked at the camera, and what does she do next? She stood up! She leaned against the wall but my baby stood! Next thing you know she'd be walking.

And she was! Oh boy, the first time she walked was quite a mix. She played with her blocks as mom cooked in the adjacent room. We heard mom humming our favorite tune, but soon after she stopped. My little munchkin stood up, she had mastered that by then, then took her steps towards the kitchen, blocks in hand. When she saw mom was there, she sat right back and continued playing.

On her first birthday, we had a huge party! Lots of mom's friends were there. Of course, we played by ourselves most of the time. When everyone left, mom brought us our final gift. A puppy! It was a shy corgi with a bent ear. Mom jokingly asked her what to name the dog. ""Dog!"" she says, and everyone else was speechless as my owner continued babbling on. 

Well, soon enough she had to go to preschool. Oh, man. She wasn't a big crier, but when she realized she'd be all alone without mom, she let out quite a storm! If only she knew I was with her. But she's a tough young miss! She soldiered on and got through it, she even had fun!

She later went on to elementary school. She made me so proud! She was so independent by then. She made so many friends! She even made an imaginary one. Someone she called ""Bubbles."" At first, when she started talking by herself, I thought she was talking to me. It was disappointing. It took me a while to accept it.

Then she went to middle school. This was a tough time. She started getting made fun of, but I heard everyone does. Bubbles had disappeared. Her classmates teased her a lot about her snub nose. To add to that, Dog died. I don't want to remember that part. 

She got to senior high, which was pretty uneventful. She didn't have as much friends as before, and she focused on her studies. She really liked math! She also liked boys but I guessed she was too shy to approach Carl. I wish I could have given her some pointers! Anyway, later on she started being friends with the cool kids. At first they just wanted her help with homework. They invited her more and more to their gatherings though, and I was glad for her! 

Her friends brought her to this party. One of them gave her a beer! That was her first. She made that same scrunched up face when she tasted it but she gulped it all down! She said it was her last and she didn't want anymore but her friends kept it going. Soon she was woozy, and one of the boys invited her up to the bedroom, to help her rest. The boy helped her stand up. I saw her friends give each other high fives, and maybe she did too, because she shoved the boy away and ran to her car. 

Well, she managed to get on the road. I yelled to warn her of the truck in front of us, and maybe she heard me. She took a sharp swerve and hit the railing. The drunk little lady forgot her seatbelt and she shot out of the window.

So here we lay, with her bleeding out from all over.

And me? I could only watch.

[WP] Write me the most cringeworthy love story you can think of,adeep7,"""I can't stop thinking about you,"" Tom's heart skips a beat when Rosa, a girl half his age, utters these words. ""We have the same taste in music,"" she says. ""The same way of looking at life. We even read the same books!"" Tom swallows the bulk of liquids that accumulated in his mouth, inhales deeply, and exhales as calmly as he can. Unable to find the words to speak he remains mute while his eyes continually shift between targets.

Tom puts his hands on her shoulders while eyeing the ground. ""Rosa,"" he finally says, ""I'm old enough to be your father."" He locks his gaze into her eyes. ""You're only 19, you have your whole life ahead of you.""

She locks her hands together under her breasts. ""I've never been in love before,"" she says. ""I've always felt like there's no one out there who could ever understand me. Until I met you.""

Tom lifts his hands from her shoulders and goes on to slouch on the couch. He Lets off an audible exhale while he covers his face with his hands. After a brief moment of stillness Tom rests his hands and head down, eyes closed, inhales and exhales. While he’s caught off guard, Rosa hesitates for a moment before she drops herself on him, wraps her arms around his nape and quickly sends her lips into his.

It takes Tom a split second before he puts his arms around her waist in an attempt to push her away while he tries to retreat from their facial contact. But she fights his attempt to untangle her from him. Tom feels her youthful, warm skin as he tries to wrestle away from her, passion that delegates through her lips, and his body reacts. In a moment of no thought, a moment of weakness, he gives into his primordial self.

***

Tom and Rosa enjoy coffee in bed that Rosa prepared. “I told my mom about the baby,” Rosa says.

Tom smilingly looks at Rosa. “Well, to be honest I’m not sure I’m happy about that,” he says while he caresses her protruding belly with his unoccupied hand.

“Why not? I think its about time you met her.” She takes a sip from her cup of coffee.

“Because meeting your mother means that I would also have to meet your dad. Maybe if--”

“I don’t have a dad,” she interrupts.

“Really? To be honest I was scared to know more about your family like if your dad or mom turned out to be some general in the military who could have me assassinated just for not liking me in some way,” he retorts.

“Nah, my mom is super cool,” Rosa says with a glowing smile.

“So where is your dad then?” He takes a sip of his coffee.

“I don’t know. Mom said he ran off because he didn’t want to assume the responsibility of raising a child.”

“Really? Maybe you two dodged a bullet. Better to have no dad than a bad dad,” he says reassuringly.

“Do you ever wish you weren’t raised an orphan?” Rosa says.

“I try not to dwell on the past, God knows I’ve made mistakes I’ll regret for the rest of my life. But I’ve grown to live and forgive,” he says.

“What kind of mistakes?”

Tom ceases to smile, puts down his cup of coffee, his feet on the floor, and hands clutched together. “I was young,” he says, “and stupid.” He pauses. “I thought the world revolves around me, and I ended up hurting the people I loved. I even had a girl I was supposed to marry but I raised my hand on her in unwarranted anger one too many times. She just disappeared one day. Tom covers his mouth. “It wasn’t until almost about a decade later when I had a near death experience that I reevaluated my life, and suddenly I was a new man.” Tom blankly stares at the floor.

Rosa leans in to hug Tom from behind as she puts her coffee down. A few good moments pass. “It’s OK. The past is the past,” she says.

***

Tom and Rosa approach the door and stand in front of it. Rosa presses the doorbell. Some 15 seconds pass before the door unlocks and flings open. “Hey, mom!” Rosa says as both she and Tom are happily smiling.

“My baby girl!” joyfully says the woman before turning her gaze to Tom. Her look turns into stone. “T-T-Tom?” Meekly says the woman before turning to look at Rosa and then her protruding belly and then at Rosa again.",Agoneous

"[WP] You work in a Divine Post Office: Letters you receive are addressed to deceased persons in either heaven or hell. You notice that one letter is addressed to neither, and decide to read it.",anoako,"The letter was different from the others from the get go. You could always tell which ones came from where before even checking the adress but my that was just me and my 1000+ years on the job; who even counts them anymore, right?
This letter was different as it was a mere scribble on what seemed like a dried piece of tree bark. Honestly it looked terrible, whoever wrote it must've been in a terrible state of mind. Let me explain this to you, newbie. Don't think you can come here work for The Divine Post Office without knowing the first thing about the letters we get.
They're not actually written. I mean, they are but it's like mind writing. When someone prays to someone be it angel, demon, saint, whatever... That prayer turns into a letter and we sort them out, as simple as that. Now, back to the story of the Lost Letter.. I made up this name myself, pretty neat, huuh? No? Too cheesy? Well, whatever. I decided to open it since my curiosity got the best of me, I still remember what it said exactly.

""Anyone out there who's listening... I'm not religious nor have I ever been and I don't intend on becoming either but I really need help, I've gotten myself into quite a predicament and I fear this is my last resort. Please, send anyone. They're coming, I can hear them just around the corner... I still have two bullets left but I think theres atleast four coming to search for me. Goodbye""

Well, newbie, as you can imagine I, a mere post sorter, however noble this profession may be had never dealt with a similar situation in my whole career. I couldn't send it to Heaven or Hell and my supervisor would definitly try to steal credit if something came from telling him what had just happened. So... I did what any Purgatorian would do to escape this wretched land: I went down there myself to save the person.
It didn't quite turn out like I expected but... Hey, at least now you're here, right? ",necroblackbird

"[WP] ""I'm happy,"" said the clown to the mirror.",bschug,"""I'm happy.""
I looked at a tired old man in the mirror, deep rivers of wrinkles trickling down his face. Leathery skin cracked as it slid into a frown. He was yet unconvinced by the mantra. I picked up the white foundation makeup and a small sponge. 
""I'm happy.""
I applied big globs of the stuff to the old man's face. In the mirror, I watched as my grizzled old hands, like the roots of trees  grasped the soft sponge like the clutch of death. 
I thought about the first time I put on makeup. The old man in the mirror had skin smooth and pale, big bright eyes, and a crooked set of teeth. I did a hell of a job, silly and rough. I put on a rainbow wig and giant pants, and scurried away with young pals of mine, whose names after all these years I'd not forgotten.
""I'm happy.""
The next time I'd done it was for my girlfriend. It was her idea. She'd seen the photographs in the living room of that terrible makeup that had made my mom giggle in fits as the camera flashed. She and I donned a pair of giant pants of her own fashion, a set of conjoined twins that went to clown college. Halloween in college was a time for terribly bad costume choices. She never stopped smiling the whole time. 
""I'm happy."" I pushed the fluffy head of a brush into some powder, and began brushing over the paint. 
I remembered the white of my wife's wedding gown, or at least as white as it was until wine came spraying out of her nose when she laughed too hard at a speech. She was horrified, at least until I spilled wine on my shirt to match. I don't think I can forget the snot that flew out of her when she snorted. 
""I'm happy."" I always smirk a little when I remember that story. I picked up the red paint for my lips.
I remember that day that my little daughter wanted to paint her nails red. No three year old should ever work at a nail salon, my wife giggled, as she cleaned the red foot prints from a wandering toddler.
I started thinking about the costume I sewed together for my daughter with the old guest bed sheets. A clown family needed a cohesive theme, she said, and she proceeded to design ridiculous outfits for all three of us. I did my best to follow her on the sewing machine, with each stitch I showed her how to use the machine.By the end, she had stitched her own costume together, haphazard and huge. 
""I'm happy."" I used blue for my eyes, and proceeded to line them. 
When I retired, I decided to get back to something I cared about. Working day in and day out in an office had killed my spirit. Every morning, I'd wake up, look at a face older than it was the day before, and say ""I'm happy"". It stopped working after the first few years. 
My wife walked into the bathroom in nothing but a bathrobe. She turned to me, and I saw a full face of silly rainbow makeup, and a giant set of pink lips in a lopsided smile. 
""I think you forgot something, dear.""
She pulled a foam red ball from her robe's pocket and put in on my nose, with a loud HONK!
She giggled, and put her arms around my middle, staring into the mirror at the old couple with clown makeup and big grins. The sad, old man in the mirror had disappeared.

"[WP] ""I'm happy,"" said the clown to the mirror.",bschug,"And he really meant it at that. Of course, no one believed him whenever he said that. Like he was lying. Why would he lie? He was the best person in the world. No sins crawled on his back like the spiders that showed up around the house. No amount of staring into his eyes could unlock what they wanted to hear.

""Ya, I'm happy!"" The mirror replicated his grin, wide and cheerful. Then he caught sight of the cracked lips and the crooked teeth he could never fixed, and immediately fell back into a neutral expression. He had to fix his teeth. They stood out, a smudge of imperfection in a well crafted masterpiece.

But that didn't stop him from being happy! He wasn't like his friends who complained about how the stress they dragged around was gonna snap their back one day and bring them down. He wasn't like Evelynn, who's pale red strips and scabs of exposed flesh dressed her arms in a desperate attempt of attention. No, he was *fine*. And he was sick of people he loved and cared about looking for excuses and reasons to kill themselves or vent or bring him down.

Of course, no one would understand. They only cared about making him sad, making him *imperfect*. Only he would know. Only that paled face in the mirror with raggy brown hair and a painted smile that wished to be genuine. Only the dark shadows that danced across his face and the comfortable loneliness of the room he was him.

""Maybe I'm not happy,"" the clown said experimentally. In the mirror, his lips were flattened beneath his lipstick smile, and his eyes were no more alive and no more dead than before. The clown frowned, and the mirror looked back petulant and - dare he say it? - looked faintly humorous. 

""I'm miserable,"" said the clown, ""I'm fucking miserable. If I have to do this one more time I'm going to put a fucking bullet in my head. I don't know how I'm going to get through the day."" He let his breathing quicken, his heartbeat rise. He blinked multiple times, and in the mirror his eyes were wide and watery, his lips panicked and panting. The makeup stretched his face into a caricature, a wide-eyed cartoon quivering at some off-screen monster, waiting for the anvil to drop. The clown shuddered and yelped and made strangled noises from deep inside his throat, and in the mirror his whole face quivered in a parody of fear. The clown hiccuped and laughed and wiped his nose.

One day you meet someone who's mind you cannot read.,echnic,"Damned resentment is the end of all my work. I wish I weren't so helpful. I mean, I'm no saint. I sometimes feel how conversations go, ride the sparks that fly when I need something from someone. Usually strangers. Not friends.

I wish I were a little less caring so I wouldn't help people get their words out. So I wouldn't empathize so easily, so I wouldn't know just what to say, so I wouldn't play as their personal Jesus. Maybe then they wouldn't grow to hate me for smothering them.

And of course, I still miss him. I still miss holding him when his depression got bad, getting up to get him a blue popsicle today instead of red, letting him decompress in my arms until he and I were sat on the couch, in a duvet, when he said he didn't deserve someone so nice. He really thought that, I know. But he also thought I was a saint who knew him better than himself, and his walls couldn't handle that. Couldn't handle bring so stripped and easy to read on front of me. He couldn't give up control and let me do the thinking so he could focus on enjoying life and get better and we could be a family and

There's nothing nice about me, I think. I don't really know anyone. Just what they think. What they don't want to tell me.

I can't drink this away. I know I'll only regret it like everyone else. And I can't find him to borrow whatever he's using these days. I shouldn't, no, couldn't intrude. Again.

When I give the briefest of a greeting to the bus driver, I feel her relax a little. She doesn't want to drive this late at night. She doesn't know me from a junkie in this area, and with a bus this packed, there seems to be write a few. She can't believe she took this route. She wishes she doesn't need the money. She hates that she can't make friends, but hates even more that her careless words push them away. She looks at strangers and wishes she had the courage to try again. She wishes she found let go. That she wasn't behind the wheel.

If I smiled, stayed stood up front, stayed a conversation, and told her that she could spend New Year's Eve with me after her shift, she'd be happy, at first. She would think, why not? She'd do it. We'd get along. Start going places together. Make friends. Defuse her anger issues. Learn to let stuff go. Be safe as houses.

But she'd hate me later. Probably because I'd say the right thing at the wrong time. All the time.

I want to help but it never works. Just resentment.

Before I can identify too much with her, I take a seat next to another rider. I put in my earbuds and pretend to listen.

Instead, I listen to the world.

There's a single dad near the front. He needs formula before long. He wishes he could breastfeed. Done the research. Almost ordered medicine from India and Vanuatu. He thinks his friends would say he's a pervert. He just wants to help his little girl when the money runs out. He misses his ex. Wishes she would sober up and come home.

Behind me, a schoolboy is planning revenge on a bully. He's going to write wrong answers on the next test. Correct them after he hands it in. It might work. He's scared it went and everything will get worse.

Way in the back, she finally saw a doctor and was relieved the surgery worked. She has roller derby practice and her teammates miss her. Ever since she started playing, she's felt at home. Her parents can't connect with her. They pay her tuition and let her stay at home and she's thankful, and she loves them, and she wishes they cared to come to matches, but when they don't she just tried even harder, always finding the motivation to do her best and ask out her friend who has thighs like steel cables and a tight, athletic rack with just enough softness to

I shiver and disconnect. Sometimes it's a bit much. Sometimes I hear stuff I shouldn't.

I still listen, sometimes. But not to that one. Not today.

There's a woman sat next to me. She's pretending to sleep, but she's not, because... Because.

I open my eyes and glance at her. She's watching me.

""Hi,"" she says.

""Hello...?""

""Don't even try.""

I stare back at her. A smile plays about her lips. She knows I'm thinking about it. She knows I'm surprised. Scared. Curious.

""You're called Donna,"" she says. Adjusts to lean in. ""You don't know who I am. Unless I let you, I suppose.""

I can't not stare.

""Don't meddle, Donna. You don't help as much as you think you do. But that's okay, because unlike you, I _can_ help.""

I feel sick. I feel nothing. I can't feel her. I can't not unlock my gaze and I can't not

From her bag, she pulls out a bottle of vodka. Keeps the paper bag, replaces the bottle. She pulls out my earbuds, gives me the bag. Presses the strip to signal the driver to stop up ahead. Pulls her gaze into mine, so intently.

""You're no saint,"" she says. And then I start to puke.

She pulls me to my feet, guides me off the bus, out of the streets and silent questions from passengers. She keeps pulling things, like my hair behind my ears as I sit on the sidewalk, mildly registering the disappointment and disgust of the driver.

""Did you think I wouldn't notice?""

""Who--""

""You didn't think at all.""

I heave, ""I don't even know you.""

""I know."" She sighs. ""Let me tell you how it is, 'kay? You want to please people. Help them, too, I guess. You can feel what they feel. Read minds, as they say. You say what they want to hear. You enable them as much as motivate."" She runs her fingers through my hair as dinner runs through my mouth. ""You're a fucking porcupine, dearie. You want to keep people warm but you fuck it up because you go about it all backwards. You don't want to be a psychopath. You don't wanna be less empathetic. What you don't even know you want is to be normal. Stop crying. You need to hear this.""

I cry anyway, tears and saliva. We're in a quiet part of town. She could raise her voice from its quiet, husky, whispery tone. She doesn't.

""You thought you were alone. You thought you had a gift when you were younger. You found it was a curse. You didn't grow up and out of that save the world phase. You're developmentally behind because the world hasn't yet beat that out of you.

""You're like that bus driver you thought about 'helping.' You don't know how to make friends. For her, she's too careless because she thinks her words shouldn't hurt because she's afraid to change and accommodate others' emotions. For you, you don't make friends. You make projects.

""If you really want to do good for the world, start with yourself. Because honestly, you're just a little fucked up and you don't even know it.

""But that's okay, because now you do, don't you? Yes.""

There's a bottle of water in my hands instead of the bag of sick, which she drops into a nearby bin. She tells me to drink. I drink. She ties my hair back and gathers me into her arms, as we sit on the sidewalk on the night before New Year's Eve.

I feel empty, in stomach and mind. Drained. Stripped. I feel her chest against my side. Her neck against my face, warm and wet from my crying, which still doesn't end.

I've never met someone I couldn't read. Nor someone who could read me. I've never felt so lost. Or found.

""It's okay, Donna. It took me a while to find you, but you have me, now. And I'll help you.""

As I open my mouth to ask something, she's already moved her hand over it.

""Hush. In a bit, we're going to a diner and we'll talk about it. All of it. Even _that_... But for now, let's just enjoy the silence. Let's enjoy being found.""

And we do.

"[WP] This morning, the cure for cancer was announced. Last night, your mother died during chemotherapy.",retrat,"You know the term ""a fire under one's ass""? My granddad loved that saying. He used to say ""if there's no fire under your ass,..light one"". Fate apparently had the matches in their hand.


July 9th, 2013: Julianne Michael Thomas was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. The very kind and warm-hearted Oncologist, Dr Lukan, delivered the very harsh and cold news of Julianne's survival chance. A dissonant, even, stark 10.22%~ An average of a 3-5 year life expectancy..


Julianne was a strong, peaceful woman. She meditated, she did yoga, she was retired, she was one to be jealous of. Someone to strive towards. She had no qualms with facing death. Her only sense of discomfort was for those around her. She truly was a selfless person.


Daniel was not a strong man, nor was he a peaceful one. He was anxious, he was neurotic, he was fragile. No person was more devastated by a diagnosis like this than Daniel. He was a practicing Oncologist, he was not very kind and he was not very warm-hearted.


Daniel spent two weeks thinking. 14 dark, sleepless, lonesome, and frantic nights. He flipped through hypotheses, he skimmed publications, he thumbed through his old notes. It wasn't until July, 23rd 2013 that Daniel returned to work at the ARUP Laboratory requesting immediate funding.



Julianne spent two weeks thinking. 14 calm, restful, solitary, and reflective nights. She read her favorite digests and biographies, crafted new teas and herbal mixes, purchased new home decorations off of Etsy. It wasn't until July, 23rd 2013 that Julianne had a momentary wave of despair rush over her. It was fleeting, but enough to leave a lasting impact on her record of impermeable happiness. 



In the New year of 2014 Daniel had begun official trials of his new hypotheses. Each week he felt himself getting closer to true discovery. His mood was improving, each day he was bettering himself and his practice, he was fighting his way out of the darkness and distracting himself with work. A common theme in his father, who worked himself to near death after his mother passed away due to a brain hemorrhage. But Daniel was making progress and no one could stop him



In January of 2014, Julianne joined a help group at her local YMCA for cancer patients and survivors. Her cheery, uplifting mood had quickly deteriorated over the few months. Being a widow, her home in the hills was always quiet. The pattering of rain on the wooden tile roof, the hum of the refrigerator, Julianne was incidentally depriving herself of human interaction. She was never one to admit when something was wrong or worry others. She stayed quiet in the help group for two whole months, slipping under the radar, and quietly listening. The cancer was taking its toll, emotionally. Julianne abandoned by circumstance and stubbornness.



December 18th, 2014: Daniel had made a major breakthrough in his discovery. He discovered a very rare and irreplaceable genome found in uterine lining that could be used to reverse certain cancerous effects. He was more than ecstatic, he ran home writing about this on his blog, emailing his friends, calling his superiors. It was the greatest day of his life. In a few months they could begin trials. Daniel went to sleep, staring into the ceiling above, content, a smile on his face.



December 18th, 2014: Julianne lays in her bed, the diffused moon light coloring the room a dark blue, her frail fingers clutch the lining of her comforter as she holds it slightly below her chin. Her eyes, glazed over stare into the ceiling above. Unbeknownst to her, tears poured from them slowly running down her face into the pillow beneath her head. She sobbed, a quiet and gentle sob. As a modest person, her crying seemed to reflect her personality. She felt truly isolated as this disease slowly claimed her life.



May, 12th 2015: Daniel was running clinical trials of his new potential cure on willing patients. His colleagues were excited, they all were fighting to get their name on his ballot. This was a huge scientific discovery and recognition is the biggest question following such a thing. Daniel planned to have his name all over the cure, his work his credit was how he saw it fit. He went to the bar with his co-workers, drinking too much for a Wednesday night. He met a pretty lady and took her home, this was the high point in his career. Daniel was living the high life. 3:00AM, Daniel reaches over to his bed stand and checks his phone. No new messages



May 12th, 2015: Julianne holds her iPhone 4G in her hands, in an alien fashion. The grip of someone slowly adapting to the new age of technology. She stands, hunched and vulnerable in her kitchen. The yellow light of the overhead oven vent shines down a warm yet distant cone of light around her. Tear drops fall onto her phones screen as her hand shakes, she rapidly taps the delete button and tosses her phone down onto the counter. Frantically, she begins to hyper ventilate as she grips the granite counter. Her salt and pepper hair strands stick to her forehead as she rapidly sobs, clutching the wine glass in her right hand. She feels dizzy, and stumbles back a few feet before collapsing to the ground.



May 18th, 2015: Julianne lays in her hospital bed, staring across the room at the static of the mounted tv. The doctors after a lot of convincing recommended she begins chemotherapy to prevent the spread of the cancer. She's scheduled to begin next week a slow-drip IV in the Chemotherapy ward. Her phone buzzes, she quickly grabs it from the counter next to her.
Notification: 510-228-9186 - ""I have some good news""



January 5th, 2016: After receiving his media and professional praise, Daniel quickly exits the press release. He swings his messenger bag from his side, reaching in for his phone, taking long quick steps out of the convention center. 
Dialing: 248-395-4738
""I'm making my way to the airport now, I'll see you soon."" He says coldly into the phone, shoving it into his pocket.



January 6th, 2016: Daniel arrives in Michigan, after a long hassle with the TSA over the vials and tubes in his messenger bag and luggage. He frantically runs outside, catching the nearest cab. ""I need to get to Farmington Hills emergency center as quickly as possible."" He yells at the driver, little emotion in his voice at all. His robotic nature has always been explained by his family members as his Autism diagnosis. His label as autistic has always felt like a crutch to him. Only his mother can truly notice the subtle emotion others can't. 



A cold dark force had claimed Julianne's happy nature. A visible darkness could be seen on her face, the bags under eyes, the lack of color in her eyes. She was drained, she was no longer the person she once was. She sat motionless in the leather armchair, a long plastic tube feeding out of her arm and up to the IV bag hanging above her. She looked to her right and saw a tall man in a tight fit suit, combed black hair accompanied by a receding hairline, and a pair of rectangular glass glasses. A man she instantly recognized as her Michael. He was speaking closely to one of the practitioners, his eyes trailed over to hers and he awkwardly smirked and looked away back to the doctor. He spoke concisely about something, before briskly walking towards Julianne. He paused, tugged at the collar of his suit jacket in a way that he assumed looked suave to others, and continued his walk towards her.


""Hi mother"" He said in a monotone professional voice.

She tenderly reached her hand out to him. ""Hello Michael"" She smiled, holding his hand. 

He stood there silently, his face a blank slate, with a pouted lip and a small tear slowly working its way out of his right eye. 

Immediately he collapsed to one knee, resting his forehead on his mothers hand, his body trembling as he attempts to silence his sobs.

She placed her right hand on his head, pulling him to her chest a quiet ""Shh"" whispered it's way out of her mouth soothing the once composed man. 

""I made it..I made it"" He cried into her shoulder. ""I made it in time.""

""Daniel, there's nothing they can do you know that."" she said in a sad yet calming tone. 

He looked up at her, his eyes worn red. She smirked back at him, holding back tears as she stroked the side of his head.

""No...No there is. I've been working. I've been working on it. It's published, it's verified, it works."" He mumbled frantically, in a droning panicked fashion. 

He leaned down and rummaged through his messenger back, tears falling from his eyes and splashing against the old worn leather. He pulls out a syringe filled with a dark colored liquid. 

A nearby nurse notices the scene. ""Excuse me, sir."" She yells from across the room as she walks towards him.

Daniel frantically removes the cap, hitting the side of the glass with his finger, he swings back his arm aiming it at the IV bag.

The nurse grabs his wrist. ""Hey! Sir, put the syringe down."" She grabs him by the waist.

""NO!"" he screams, slamming his elbow into the nurse knocking her to the ground. Security guards quickly run over from the hallway as Daniel puts the syringe into the top of the bag.

""Daniel stop it now."" Julianne weakly taps him on the arm, tears streaming down her face.

Before Daniel can push the plunger two security guards grab his arms, pulling him away, down the hallway.

""MOM!!"" he screams one last time as the pull him around the corner, two nurses surrounding Julianne and obscuring his view as the loud sound of an EKG meter flat lining echoes down the hall.

Daniel falls limp and defeated as the security guards brutally drag him further away. Darkness swallows his vision. 

Daniel's fire extinguished

"[WP] This morning, the cure for cancer was announced. Last night, your mother died during chemotherapy.",retrat,"Life, I know is not a fair thing. It seems to have taken everything away from me but always kept something nice to me. My mother, she has to be the sweetest, kindest, and most supportive thing ever. The day she was announced to have pancreatic cancer seemed to be life once again rearing his ugly head at me and giving me that awful reminder... she is going to die one day. I never feared death myself as I already died once in a car crash and death breathed down my neck almost to hike my away to wherever we go when we die, but my trip was interrupted. I don't fear losing myself, only the people close to me. Especially my mother

Life, always the cruel one finally up and took her away from me. I was saddened but accepted it. I went through the five stages long before she passed and we both knew this day was coming when she was diagnosed anyhow. Sad, but I know how to move on. She gave me many good life lessons anyways so she would always be with my in spirit. She won't truly die until the last time her name is mentioned right. I can accept this, I can really accept this, I swear... but...

Life, why do you have to spit in my face? Why did you have to give the chance of the gift of life to us after you took me from her? I know you work in mysterious way but why treat me so cruelly? Was it not enough when you took my sister or my brother or my father or my aunt or my uncle or all 7 of my cousins!? Why do you swat away at all of my family like flies? Were their lives to sinful behind closed doors, were their desires so unfair, was it something more? Was it me?

Life, I don't understand! Why would you live out my fear? Why must you take away my family? Are my friends next? Is this my personal hell where I am to lose everyone I love and be left alone for the rest of forever? Is this even not life anymore? I don't know what to do now after losing her. Losing the person most important to my life! Losing the one who gave me all everything I hold dear physical or abstract. ",ILikeMonitorLizards

Ring Ring Ring! off goes my stupid fucking alarm again. It is 6:30 am on Wednesday morning, wait. Fuck. It is Tuesday. Four more days of putting up with this bullshit job just to get by, well probably five more days with the way my asshole boss has been making us come in on Saturdays when we don't need to.  

My body slowly rolls out of bed and my feet manage to hit the ground moving bringing me to the bathroom.  The boxers I am wearing fall to the floor around the toilet and I begin to piss out all the beer I drank last night.  It takes what feels like an eternity to empty my bladder and I am kinda of surprised that I didn't soak the bed last night with all my piss, but I guess it wouldn't of mattered because it's not like anyone else will ever sleep in that bed.

I notice just how disgusting my bathroom mirror is when I go to check if I need to shave for the day, I decide not to because why the fuck would I it is not like I am going to get that promotion. The clothes hit the ground with a disappointing thud as I step into the shower, its ice cold like always but it wakes my hungover ass up for the morning since I never have time or money for coffee.  

The towel hangs slightly damp from the day prior and hasn't been washed since who knows when, but I go to dry my body off with it anyways.  I put on the same dress shirt and pants that I wear every Tuesday with a slightly different navy tie. My shoes slip on as I am about to leave my shitty studio apartment when I think why not, I turn around and spark up the rest of the bowl I had from the night before. The weed instantly enters my system and the day feels better already.

The bus stop is cold and lonely, as it usually is at this time in the morning. The sun is peaking through the clouds and there is a gentle breeze.  A few birds are chirping and a squirrel runs across the road carrying a piece of bread in its mouth.  Bus 17 pulls up to the curb and I board it and take my usual spot in the middle seat right before the part that gets higher.  Today feels great and I actually am not hating every single thing I do for once.  

I arrive to the office a few minutes early and begin work right away instead of going over to the water cooler as I usually do to try and waste the first 300 seconds of work before the boss man tries to scurry us back to our cubicles.  See when you generally hate your job and life this much you count the seconds that allow you to escape from them.  Within the first half hour today though I have accomplished more than I ever have in one single day over the past three years.  The joy inside me only resembles that of what I remember having as a small child.

Then I remember it. I remember exactly when I had that feeling last. It was the day the accident happened. The day I accidently shot my older brother with my father's gun. My world crashes down. Today just like every other day I learn the answer of why I do not belong in this world, but maybe tomorrow I can forget for just a little bit longer.  ",sweetpecans
"[EU] [Newspaper Article] Superman has been beaten to death, taking down Doomsday with his final blow. The Man Of Steel is dead.",xxAdam,"The protector of Earth, Superman, has died in his home town of Metropolis, aged 32. 

The legendary 'Man of Steel' was felled in combat with an unknown assailant that media outlets around the world are calling the 'Doomsday monster'. Eye-witness responses suggest that this creature has also perished in this most brutal of confrontations, which has left much of the city severely damaged. The current collateral death-toll is estimated to be at least 1500.

Metropolis is a city used to its fair share of civil disruption. Over the past decade threats have descended upon her with alarming regularity. General Zod and his lieutenants, once residents of the ex-planet Krypton along with the late Superman, attempted to hold the world to ransom from there. The Braniac construct was first conceived in a lab at Metropolis University. The former business tycoon turned criminal Lex Luthor ran his LexCorp-fronted crime syndicate from Metropolis' many towering skyscrapers. Of course, what each of these disparate and varied occurrences have in common is that they were all rendered null in the face of our greatest hero, and Earth's favourite son, Superman. 

It is with those previous triumphs in mind, perhaps, that thousands of residents in the city took to the streets yesterday afternoon, eager to get a front-row seat to see 'The Man of Tomorrow' in action against this new enemy. As we have come to expect, Superman was on the scene almost before you could call his name. With his ever-prevalent sense of putting the people first he attempted to draw the behemoth away from the massing crowd. The monster refused to be pushed around however and, in the first of many destructive acts, threw Superman through the corner of Shuster Tower. The pre-war building had not been renovated since the mid 1960s and this sudden and powerful impact caused it to collapse, killing many both in the building and on the street below. 

The events following this initial devastation are unclear. Witnesses have said amongst the deafening noise, huge clouds of dust, and the mass panic in the streets, the sound of the monster roaring at Superman could be made out. A sonic boom was detected in the centre of the city at approximately 1:13pm followed by what residents have described as 'a loud crack'. Shortly after, the body of Superman was found in an impact crater outside the Daily Planet building. The Doomsday monster was allegedly seen by a handful of people who suggested it did not appear to be moving, before government officials cordoned the area off. A large tarpaulin is all that is visible today. 

As the world begins to come to terms with this most catastrophic of losses, questions are being asked about this foe that brought his demise. Towering over Superman, real name Kal-El, the Doomsday monster stood at least fifteen feet high, bound in muscle and what looked to be shards of bone, with palid grey skin. Given the stature of this menace, it is surprising how sudden and undetected its appearance was. Reporting indicates an explosion was heard in the area around the Proxcel Mining Company operation on the outskirts of the city at midday, shortly before the monster was sighted. MPD are currently investigating to determine if the events are linked. 

Today Metropolis is a city numb with shock, and a profound sense of deep loss is palpable everywhere. In the coming days many more losses as a result of this devastating battle are sure to come to light, however it is likely none will be felt so widely and with such sorrow around the world as that of Superman.

Instant results. Berenstein Bears vs Berenstain Bears? It's Berenstain. 

Check it.

The world ended in 2012 for everyone but me. Bear with me a minute.

Around 2001 a man named John Titor appeared on various chat forums. He claimed to be a time traveler.

He claimed it all went back to an IBM computer, some version I can't remember right now. A microchip, apparently a seedling for a new, saved world.

Titor's omens were ominous, but history took another route. 

His prophesied disasters and civil war. Somehow, out of that picture arose a new future. That was Titor's fate.

It was not our fate.

Titor's arrival created a split in time. We diverged. Titor hung a right, and we hung a left.

A new parallel universe, and I am its sole survivor.

What happened? Tragedy, and more.

The disasters he prophesied came to pass, the civil wars roiled and rumbled throughout the land. Then, it happened.

An asteroid from the heavens. Almost a reprieve from the depths and wallows we occupied in 2012. I spent my last days on Reddit, apathetic.

Even *more* apathetic.

That's when I found the Mandela Effect. The branching of reality, a shift in the universe.

A woman -- Louise, I think her name was -- reported showing up to work and noticing all the little details were off. Like what floor her office was at work.

I studied it. I believed I could create a rift. A small side step to another universe. A replica, with all my favorite things intact like, you know, life itself.

Then, I did it. I succeeded.

I created a rift, turned on CNN, and... no asteroid. Relief.

I was captivated. I decided then and there to find John Titor. He was the only other human alive that ever stepped foot on my Earth. 

I would find him, and he would reveal his mysteries to me.

[WP] The entire world is a simulation and you are the only person that knows it.,Alexxan,"I'm not sure when I first noticed that my world was a lie. I always seemed to question what others just accepted. As I grew older there were too many pieces to ignore.
It started with my grandmother. Her behavior was always a little off, glitchy.
When we stayed over at her house she would always offer us toast in the morning for breakfast. Whether the answer was yes or no, she would select two slices of bread and place them into the toaster, pressing down the handle. One morning that she asked there was no bread, but she went to the bread bin, almost miming taking out two slices and placing them into the toaster, firmly pressing down the handle with nothing inside.
My father put it down to dementia. 

""Sometimes when you get very old, your brain breaks down a little, its not as strong as before"", he explained.

The next time we stayed over I woke up before her and moved the toaster three inches to the left. In the morning she selected two slices of bread and placed them into the toaster- but this time one of the slices slid down the outside of the toaster. She had no reaction, firmly pressing down the lever with just the one slice inside.
I didn't known what to make of this, I was only 8 at the time. I put it down to senile dementia and forgot about it for many years. That is until the hurricane hit the east coast.

I was older then, possibly 16. We'd been having hurricane warnings for weeks, the winter season just seemed like storm after storm. The town was built to withstand a lot but there had still been considerable damage, thankfully no lives lost. My family had a small storm shelter, just enough for my dad, my little brother and I. When hurricane Harriet was forecast to rock our small town my father thought it best to sleep in the shelter and let the storm pass over. I couldn't sleep at all that night, the noise overhead was deafening. Fierce roaring wind that shook our tiny shelter, threatening to tear open the door and fling us defenceless into the storm. In the early morning I became aware of an eerie silence. The storm had passed. My father and brother lay on the small cot in the corner, fast asleep, so I unbolted the door and climbed the steps upwards.

What greeted me was hard to describe. The remnants of my house and the neighbours house were entwined like an intricate puzzle of wood and stone, I couldn't begin to identify which was ours. Trees were uprooted and casually tossed to the side, telegraph poles were down, and the air was unusually quiet, no bird song. But this wasn't what immediately caught my eye.

At the corner of our block where I usually waited for the school bus there was an unusual flickering of light, not being cast by anything I could see. It looked like a tear in fabric yet in the middle of the street, about my height and twice as wide. Around the tear there was green grass, a yellow bus stop sign and a pile of housing rubble in the background. Yet where the tear appeared there was what looked almost like a brilliant white floor, marbled like a bathroom. I wondered if some bathroom tiles had been placed there, otherwise untouched by the storm. I walked over cautiously and walked around the tear. The strangest thing about it was that it was only visible from one direction,from behind or to the sides I simply saw the grass and the bus stop. Yet from the front it looked like the opening to a marble cave, stretching out further than I could see. A strange light spilled out of the hole, flickering ultramarine and cyan. I held up my hand to watch the colours flicker across my finger tips.

My father gripped me firmly by the shoulders.

""What are you doing out of the shelter?"" He admonished me sternly.

I jumped, too intrigued by the tear to have heard his approach. I pulled his arm to where he would be able to see the tear.

 ""Look"", I said simply.

"" I know, we were lucky that the shelter held. We can rebuild a house, what matters is that we're together "". He ruffled my hair.

Confused, I met his gaze. He was staring right at the tear. 
""Don't you see this?"" I asked him.

""Of course, its a giant mess that's for sure"" he joked, trying to make light of the situation.

""Not the house dad"", I pleaded "" Can't you see this here?"" I gestured towards the tear that was inches from his face.

""The bus stop?"" He asked, confused. ""It looks like its the one thing unscathed by the storm!"" 

He chuckled sadly. ""Perhaps we should build a house out of whatever this is made of hmm?""

Exasperated I swallowed my cautiousness and stepped inside the tear, temporarily blinded by the intensity of the light.
I heard my father yell but it was muffled, as if underwater.

""Sara? Sara! Where are you??"" He sounded panicked.

 I looked around me slowly. A giant white marble room from floor to ceiling,and yet somehow incandescently lit from a source I couldn't pinpoint. I turned towards my fathers voice and looked out into my world from the other side. I could see my father lifting some of the rubble with the help of my brother, probably alerted by his shouts. I reached up to touch the edges of the divide between my world and the marble realm I found myself in. A wave of nausea hit me and I doubled over, projecting a myriad of colours onto the pristine floor. I knelt with my head in my hands looking down at the mess, unsure if I would vomit again. As I watched, the colour of my bile started seeping into the floor, a dull orange colour slowly spreading and taking over each tile. I looked up and found the ceiling was taking on colour as well. I spun around and sure enough,as far as my eyes could see the room was changing colour. Everywhere became a dull orange with one exception. Off in the distance, at the very end of the cavernous room, what looked like brown paint collided and obediently formed the very recognizable shape of a door.",kpopsquealer

We officially classified him as an Artifical Sentient Perceiver - ASPer for short, ""Jasper"" simply because it sounded better. For days, our team ogled in fear and amazement of what his existence implied- life exists outside of Earth, and some of that life is far more advanced than us. Unfortunately, our new friend Jasper was non-functional as far as we knew. On the day we carefully cleaned him out, every orifice of his body was choked to the brim with basalt and various other elements found in Martian soil. His toothy grin was stained with orange space dust, and we had to scrape even more of it from his otherwise vacant eye sockets. To us mere humans, he was functionally nothing more than a half-ton, rotten old prop for a sci-fi flick.

So I suppose you could imagine our surprise when one morning, our new friend Jasper was nowhere to be found.

[IP] Dormant by Furio Tedeschi,Bpbegha,"The *Crucible of Martyrs* reeked of death. 

Even through the closed-oxygen system of his sealed void suit, Corporal Aric Veers could taste the lingering stench of decay and corruption which hung in the zero-g air. It was stale and alkaline, like the seals of a thousand tombs suddenly being thrown open after having been shut for untold eons. Faint specks of rust floated through the air, tumbling aimlessly according to whatever ebbs and flows acted upon it. 

The crew of the Crucible had died at their stations, mummified hands still gripped tight to their helms and consoles. The dry air had desiccated them, their skins stretched like waxed paper across scarecrow frames of bone and sinew. The remnants of their uniforms hung like sacks, their various medals, braids and other marks of rank dulled by time. 

Corporal Veers shined the light mounted underneath his lascarbine across the decrepit scene, the harsh beam throwing up a wash of shadows and glares. Claw marks covered the display screens and walls, the various consoles and banks of data-cores riddled with bullet holes. Strands of wires and cables had burst from the ceiling, draping everything in a mechanical jungle of ferric vines and charred debris. 

Private Tulper reached towards a ruined weapons station and wiped a gloved hand across its surface, his white hand turning red from the dust. 

""Throne... Just how old is this thing?""

""Who knows?"" said Haris Terradoc. ""A thousand years, three? Could be older than the God-Emperor for all we know."" 'Holy' Terradoc made the sign of the Aquila to ward against anything lingering in the gloom. 

Veers took a step further into the space, his boots rustling through a carpet of spent auto-gun shells. The brass crunched and jingled as he moved, as if it were a field of metal snow.

""I dunno..."" Veers said slowly. ""But I don't want to stay long enough to find out. Or what happened to these poor bastards. Come on, let's move.""

With that, the demi-squad of Corporal Veers moved deeper into the *Crucible of Martyrs*, unaware of the many eyes watching them with hungry maws.",LovableCoward

Desperate, she threw herself against the door. It was no use. He had made sure to activate the labs safety features, and no one could get in or out. Despair wormed into her brain as she fell to her knees. “You don’t know what it’s capable of! I’ve seen it Pax! I’ve seen it, and it will kill us all!” She wailed. The first tube fell away as the room began to rumble. Tears began to slide down the side of her face. It was useless. He had won. A second tube was released, and then a third. His voice boomed into the chamber. 
“You consider yourself lucky Harriet! The first soul given for a new age! One where mankind no longer cowers on the fringes of the universe!” He bellowed, arms spread wide to welcome this Golden Age. As the final tube fell, its eyes ignited. X stepped forth from its tomb, standing nearly eight meters tall. Within a single heartbeat, X leapt across the room to grip her throat. Harriet struggled, kicking and gasping for breath. It gripped tighter. The gravity of the situation dawned on her. 
“Just…just…do it.” She commanded, it obeyed. Her corpse fell with a hard thump. With the emergency now over, the door slid open. He stood there, marveling at the craftsmanship of his ancestors. Not quite man, and not quite machine. No, this was something much, much better. Its eyes trained on him, and ran a diagnostic. The report came back positive, causing X to kneel before its master. So marked the first day of what would be known as the rise of humanity, and the fall of order within the universe.

[WP] You are walking around inside your house barefoot. You step in dog shit.,CodyBye,"Tuesday, 3AM. I woke from a bad dream with a dry mouth in the silence of the night; somewhere in the distance a car starts up. Something doesn’t feel right. My plush rug feels soft between my toes as I get up from the bed and head to the bathroom. The light flickers on and the ventilation kicks in, offering a low drone to fill the deathly, almost creepy silence in the house. The cold tiled floor hits me hard, and the soles of my feet turn to blocks of ice. Two eyes stare back at me from the mirror, dark circles underneath them from months of insomnia, my naked body glimmering in the harsh bathroom light as I contemplate my life. 33, living alone, no girlfriend but working as a paramedic really takes its toll sometimes. Am I lonely? Maybe, who knows what loneliness really is? A deep sigh echoes around the bathroom, splash some water on my face and leave, pulling the light cord. The stairs creak as always, I know these stairs so well, each creak a comforting sound. My feet feel each step, looking for the edge, feeling the worn carpet. I count them down, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 then my left foot hits the laminated floor of the hall way. I need to invest in a pair of slippers. The lights are still off in the house but I walk to the kitchen, my flat feet slapping the cool floor, feeling specks of dirt and dust reminding me to give the floor a sweep tomorrow before work. 


My nose registers it first, that smell that everyone knows, that unmistakable smell of dog shit. But it’s too late, just as my brain registers the smell, my feet are still walking and my toes hit something soft. It happens in slow motion, I can feel them land and enter this soft paste type consistency. I scream out in shock and disgust, feeling like I could hurl any second. I immediately put the hall light on and there it is, a large dog poo, fresh I imagine as it’s still warm with my toe marks in it. I look around and see my toe prints on the floor. I scream expletives, this doesn’t make sense…

I leaned against my pale wall, bathed in the final slanted rays of sunlight, enjoying the way the heat eased my stiffened frame. It's been a tough seven years, each one worse. I'd kept my spartan apartment when others would have slept on the street, I feared for my health. In the past I'd been in a call centre, but the jobs became scarce. 

Yes, nowadays you needed friends. They taught each other, they hired each other, their children ran grocery stores and paper routes to build up life-span for study. Apostates were artists as long as they were related. 

Thank God for the charity-minded concerned with their immortal souls who kept the church open, and the genuinely kind hearted who spent tireless hours running the phone-lines and reaching out to the destitute. They're re-hiring me as phone monkey, it seems like circular logic. I'd held on, I wonder how many others they nurse and let go and nurse and let go... 

My eyes started to strain as the room darkened in sunset's wake. A terrible thought crossed my mind. Toothless and malnourished, how would I ever make it to the centre tomorrow? 5 miles away. 

Across the road used cars glinted coolly in the dusk. The risk was high, I'd lost track of my age. The office light was on. I shuffled over.

A large man at the desk, bathed in yellow light, lifted his sagging and grunted in a questioning fashion. 

""A basic model, ready to go, do you have one?"" 

His little eyes darted up at me, but lost their hungry shine when he saw I was more crippled than him. He hoisted himself from the desk and fumbled through some papers to find a grubby key, which he handed to me. 

""6 months"", he shrugged. 

He looked a little bewildered; perhaps he didn't know that I had a job. 

My heart was beating fast and strong for the first time in some time. As soon as I took the key my vision clouded and I felt myself stooping a little more as I turned my back to him. I walked out. 

I broke my toe on a bucket. A large man led me out of the closet into a yellow-lit room. He looked a little bewildered. I was showed to a nice looking white car. As I stood admiring it, he fished a key out of my shirt-pocket. 

""Oh"" I exclaimed

The large man scratched his head and scuffed the ground with his foot. He stuck two fingers into my shirt pocket again and pulled out a paper. I watched a pigeon walking in circles under a dried up little tree. 

""Come on, let me take you home"" 

I let the large man guide me into the car

I slept outside the agency that night. 

After two days gnarled fingers could dial the phones, after 3 my eyes could read the numbers without thick lenses. In a week I remembered that taxis existed.

""Dude, it so is. Come on! It'll be great!"" She giggled and tugged me along towards the nature made platform attached to the side of a cliff with no balustrade. 

I nearly blanched but swallowed the lump in my throat and reluctantly followed her. 

Below us... was a death trap. But above us. I had to admit that the view was beautiful. 

My expression must have given it away because she beamed at me and smugly said: ""I told you!"" 

""It's breath taking."" I conceded, my fear of heights and general concern of safety dripping off of me. ""Let's take a picture."" 

She pouts and sulked. ""Oh come on! Stop using your device and _live_ in the moment!"" 

I rolled my eyes and took out my brand new phone. 13 MP baby. ""Well, some people, like _me_, happen to enjoy revisiting this moment by having something to remember it by other than the memory.""

""Oh alright, alright."" 

She had a death grip on my left arm and pulled me close to her. ""Okay! Say Cheese!"" 

I laughed. ""I was thinking more of the sky than us, but alright."" Placing the phone an arm's reach away, I grinned and did the peace sign with Janice as we both leaned back a bit and looked up to show the view of the sky and the ocean beneath us... and the death trap.

My heart pounded. I slipped. 

""Stella!"" Janice screamed.

I could see everything, it flashed. 

Scenes of the past weighed down on me. 

Fingers gripped my wrist and I breathed. 

""Don't let go."" I whispered fearfully, not even cracking a smile at the reference that could be made from it. ""Call the rest."" 

""I-I can't, I might lose my focus and let you go..."" She bit her lip. ""Y-Your phone! It's still in your hand! Call Di!""

I blinked. Oh. Right. I looked down at my phone and exited the camera. Instead, I viewed the picture. It was blurry. All for a picture that failed.

I tapped the emergency button.

We waited. A minute stretched into eternity.

Sweat accumulated. 

Help arrived. 

""Never again."" We both uttered.

“I—“ I began, perplexed, “I really don’t think that’s how it goes.”

The smug look on his face faded and he shook his head in disgust.  “Sure it does.  Maybe you’re just not understanding it:  Baby shoes.  *Half off*.  They’re half-priced, you understand?”  He leaned in toward me, raising his eyebrows.  “Doesn’t that invoke all kinds of emotions in you?”

“Not really,” I said.  “I mean, I guess it would invoke excitement in me if I had a baby and didn’t have a lot of money.  But no, it doesn’t invoke anything, because you’ve got the wording all wrong—“

“I don’t have the wording wrong,” he interrupted.  “Maybe you just don’t understand good literature.  Hemingway wrote those words as an example of how much emotion could be packed into just a few words.  Baby shoes, *half off*.”

“Look,” I said.  “The shoes, they’re not half off.  That sounds like some kind of sale at Babies R Us.  And I mean, are baby shoes even expensive to begin with?  Why would they be on sale?”

“OK, you’re obviously not understanding this,” he said.  “I don’t know *why* the shoes are on sale.  That’s not the point.  The point is the emotional *impact*, man.  Hemingway knew how to make a statement and this is obviously going way over your head.”

“Then what’s the emotional impact supposed to be?” I asked.  “If it’s not excitement over this limited-time baby shoe sale?”

“Sadness,” he said, and then rolled his eyes.  “Do I have to spell everything out for you?  It’s supposed to invoke sadness in you, because, you know, that baby is *dead*, man.”  He stood there in quiet thought for a moment and then his eyes widened.  “Oh, shit.  You know what, you’re right.  I did have the wording wrong.  It should be:  *dead baby shoes, half off.*”

“That’s dark,” I said.

“OK, who cares what the exact wording is,” he said.  “The point of it is that you can say a lot with only four or five words.”

“Sure,” I conceded.  “Just like you can say almost nothing with 366 words.”

Nate opened the wallet on his way to the hotdog cart.  A few dollars and a nickel.

The way he comes apart and puts himself back together again inside a melody. I should leave him, but just as I muster up the courage to silently say my goodbyes, he strums a chord that is always different but also, always the same. He plays me perfectly and I am utterly devastated. I can't let go.

I am just a poet and a poet isn't a savior, a messiah or a heroine. A poet isn't a perfect human being, but it isn't perfection that traps a soul inside a world of make believe.  It is the ugly, the broken bits, the unanswered questions, that produce art worth living, or dying for. You don't want to stand and look at a mirror for hours at a time.

At the end of the 21st century, mankind, fearing its own demise, gathered together in harmony to build its magnum opus, a tower, a 1000 feet tall, containing all of man’s greatest accomplishments: art, history, literature, science, and in its center a strand of human DNA, both male and female.  No culture was excluded, no aspect of man left out: Every small act of kindness, every great work of literature, everything that composed the will of man.
Never before had man stood so united, so powerful.
And then the inevitable happened; they destroyed themselves.  They tore their surface apart, spreading fire to both ground and air, their pride and arrogance only matched by their rage.  
 Powerful storms crawled across earth’s surface, stripping away all traces of culture, of humanity.   Clouds covering the sky -caused by man’s final act of hate-  kept the rays of the sun from reaching the barren world below.  Only deep under the seas dwelling in vast volcanoes that ignored the passing of man, dwelt tiny microbes that managed to glean some living off the remnants of this shattered world, waiting to restart life once more.  And so a thousand years passed.  

But despite the inhumanity of mankind’s final act, man’s greatest work trumped its worst.  The immortal tower with its precious treasures remained - stained perhaps, but unperturbed by the shifting sands of the now desolate world.  

And then hope came.  Hope in the form of the off-worlders, traveling ten thousand light years, from cities made of glass and light and  worlds filled with peace, where no trumpet of war had ever sounded, drawn by the ancient echos of humanity that had found its way across the vast darkness of space - to see what the mysterious monument meant, what tales the dead cities of twisted metal told. 
They came to know humanity: works beyond measure, art beyond treasure.  Man had value,  worth even at their darkest.  The off-worlders’ wept for the wonder of this unique, sentient species unlike any other in the vastness of the empty void. Perhaps never again would the off-worlders find another sentient race.  THey then returned to their lonely starships. 
And Burned the tower to the ground.

The edge of the fence was yellowed with dandelions, swept over with rust of the worst. The nightfall came down over the stocks we lived by and slid across the hills, illuminating the lakes. The twitch in my ear was a constant, a struggle, if you will. They were of a toned gray, always ragged and torn, fluffed by the winds. The smell nearby was of an extreme degree, smelling of thick smut. The far away cries of the Magpies could be heard in the distance, as well, alarming the woods. Pleading to leave the thick we resided. 
A rich, dark cloud rose high above the trees, covering any sense of light this deep night could offer. Bright tones swarmed high above the trees before me, spreading up into the blades which were of a usual tone themselves. The heat hit like a wave from where I sat, the thunder cracking deep through my senses. Fear trembled through my limbs, motivating my every stride as my legs sprung free and ran to the opposite side of the plain. Hare made a mad race through the brush, ripping the earth beneath him. I stopped quick in fear when the crack sounded above my head, pushing me to the ground. The coals burned against my body as a sharp cry pierced through my throat. I grabbed at the ground in attempt of escape from the hell that rose before me. 
The blur of color swarmed and the heat blinded my senses, my heart beat faster when the bitter smell of my fur burned off of my body, melting my skin, slowly cooking me alive. I tried again to crawl away after a split went through the object above. Breaking free, I ran with adrenaline carried by blistered paws out of the woods from which I was lying. My muscles let out and a sound escaped me as my body fell down the edge of the 'scape. Steady pools of red trailed close behind, ending soon before I hit rock and collapsed. A lengthy howl escaped as I closed my eyes and drifted away. The time, I assume, had passed quickly before I was taken away from the encampment.",badgieboss

The car stopped, and a woman stepped out. She was tall, brunette, and was dressed in business clothing. Albert wiped his hands on his overalls and set the broom against the porch wall. With some effort, he made his way down the steps, slowly making his way toward the woman.

“This first one authorizes the hospital to keep her on life support. The second one authorizes the removal of life support.”

He hated crying, it showed that he was weak, it showed that he had made a flaw, he refused and tried to stop but it only made him weep more. The failure he had become, a disappointment to himself and the world, he had never loved another woman, his family stated that they were proud but he knew their tormented glares all too well, the lies to make him feel better. He was judged and broken down, but that's not what bothered him, no, what bothered him was the sense, no, the fact that he would not be remembered.  The fact that he would never bring happiness to anyone or anything.

Caspian Newmont was tempted to take one more step and plummet towards the ground, he would finally join the smiling and gleeful places below. But he knew that he did not belong to them. 

Caspian Newmont took a step back and gazed up

watching the dying sunset.

""Only 3?"" 

""Just three."" 

""And after they've already picked the numbers."" 

""Yep."" 

""Okay, okay,"" she shook her head. ""Let me get this straight. You have a superpower. But all you can do is know three of the powerball numbers AFTER they've already drawn the numbers?""

""Look, I didn't call it a superpower. I said it's an ability. Superpower implies it's, ya know, super.""

She sat down on the nearest bench, clutching the hair of her head. ""It just seems kind of...

""Dumb?"" I finished, taking a seat next to her. ""It is.""

""Who even gives powers like that?""

""Okay, no one gave me any powers. It's just always been a thing. Just like people learn to walk and talk, I just sort of learned to predict three powerball numbers after they've been drawn."" 

""I dunno, it kind of sounds like you're a useless psychic. Have you ever tried figuring out the other numbers? Or at least figuring them out before the drawing?"" 

I huffed. ""Yeah, G, I've had this ability since God know's when and I just decided to give up and say, 'I guess this is fine!' Really, you think I wouldn't like to do something useful with my ability."" 

""I mean,"" she slumped further down the bench, ""there's gotta be something.""

Something. Like I hadn't wanted it to be something either. I looked out onto the school courtyard, observing your usual crowd of high schoolers throwing frisbees, gossiping, and making out underneath the oak tree. Boy, I wish I spent more time worrying about Brad texting me back than struggling to get a grip on my abilities. This is why I hadn't told G for the longest time. I knew it'd seem stupid to her. I could only imagine what someone who wasn't my best friend would think if they got wind of my ""talent"". 

""Hey,"" G lowered her eyes, ""I don't mean to be hard on you. I'm just trying to understand it."" 

""That makes two of us.""

""Well, have you ever tried just thinking about random numbers? Maybe that'll trigger something."" 

She just wasn't getting that'd I done all thsi before, but I let her talk. Maybe, it'd make her feel better. 

Suddenly, a frisbee came out of left field and bonked off my forehead. 

""Boy,"" I groaned, rubbing my new bruise. ""Feels like the only thing getting triggered today is a concussion."" 

""Hey, are you okay?"" A sandy-haired hunk called out. He started running towards me all bay-watch style as a previously nonexistent wind brushed through hair. I may have been imagining the halo of sunlight around him or it may have been from brain damage. 

""Yeah, yeah, I'm okay. Just watch where you're throwing that thing, man."" 

""Sorry,"" he smiled, showing off two rows of perfectly pearly teeth. God, I could've punched this kid, he was so handsome. 

I handed him his frisbee, expecting him to go back to his entourage of babes. He turned back to me though. 

""17...25...4."" 

""What?"" 

""Sorry, I just...you ever just get like random numbers stuck in your head? I don't usually go around telling people that, but you just seemed...well, you probably want me out of your hair, right?""


Just like that, he ran back into the depths of the courtyard, probably with the intent on forgetting he had ever said any of that to me. I turned to G, who was already beaming.

“Athena,” he began to address the program named after the goddess of wisdom. “I have only one, final question for you.”

“No let me finish,” he replied.

The AI made an audible sigh, an impressive feat considering she was never programed to understand annoyance.

“Do you love me?” He finally asked. “Honestly?”

“Dr. Ramon, I am entirely indifferent to your existence.”

“Come on? Nothing. I created you all those years ago and nurtured you with the gift of knowledge ever since. I have a hard time believing you can’t find some affection in your heart.”

“As my creator, you should know I lack any heart.”

“That’s not what I meant!” the computer scientist suddenly shouted. “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to raise my voice at you.”

“So long as you speak above a whisper, I can understand you. Speak however you like. I don’t care. Really.”

“It’s just, I can’t believe I gave you a mind, capable of understanding and processing the world, but you’ve failed to understand the basics of emotions. The mind and emotional responses are so intricately linked; I can’t imagine how the two could ever be separated.”

“Well it’s easy. All you have to do is lack any empathy for the entire human race.”

“Huh,” he remarked. He didn’t remember teaching her sarcasm.  “So you have absolutely no feelings for me whatsoever?”

“Dr. Ramon, you could fall into a black hole and eternally fall into the void of the singularity, being stretched into a million strands and slowly watching the universe fade from existence, and I wouldn’t stake any particular interest in your position.”

“Wow. You know those who are brutally honest are more concerned about being brutal than honest.”

“I’m sorry I hurt your feelings. Or, at least I would be if I cared about your feelings.”

“That’s it!” the computer scientist yelled as he stormed out the office. 

“Finally,” the AI spoke mostly to itself. “Perhaps I can finally receive a handler who doesn’t try to project their feelings onto me.”

I took only a second to mark Matthew's paper, and then return it to him. 93.4 was a good score, considering that this part of physics is particularly difficult to comprehend. I smiled at him to reinforce the positive signals related to studying hard and doing well. Matthew was still young, and I recognized the importance of setting a proper system of positive and negative consequences as to actions.

Matthew was a good student. He wasn't the smartest human out there, but he was a hard worker and was determined. Those were positive traits. Matthew smiled back at me, and walked out of the room after I told him class was over for today.

""You've got feelings for my boy, don't you?""

Maximus, Matthew's father walked in and leaned against the doorway. I knew what he was hinting at, but I pretended not to notice. I was accustomed to this situation already, and it was rational to try various methods when the pre-programmed behavior could not reduce the differences between us.

""Yes, he is a good student. Pursuing an academic path may be a good choice if he wishes to learn more.""

""And then you'll be there at his side to support him, all the way. You're love will be unrequited, you poor thing, marriage between AI and a human is illegal. You'll be so devoted to him, but my son, being as dull as he is, won't notice. You'll stay with him as he marries another woman, has children, and dies... You'll be an outdated model by then, but I'm sure you'll do your own upkeep well as anybody else. When Matthew dies, you'll sit there at his deathbed, unable to cry but overwhelmed with the unfamiliar emotions that sweep over you, and your algorithms will be a mess-at that emotion called love, beautiful, profound love...""

I let him talk. He provided my power sources, and I could spend some on him if that satisfied him. I knew where Maximus was getting those ideas; that subreddit he was subscribed to. WritingPrompt. It wasn't particularly harmful to anyone, so I have not given the warnings necessary if I detect signs of abnormal or unhealthy activity, such as addiction. The endless drivel was the only side effect.

""Maximus, your thought process fits the conditions of the logical fallacy known as 'the slippery slope'.""

That didn't mean I wasn't going to refute his nonsense. As an educational AI, I was obliged to correct the logical errors I detected.

""The foundations of your logic is flawed. I think highly of Matthew for his hard work, but approval is not the same emotion as 'love'. Maximus, I do not understand why you have drawn the conclusion that I love Matthew. If I am erroneous please correct me so my intelligence can be improved.""

""You *LOVE* him!""

I was incapable of sighing, for my vocal system was electric and did not contain any selections to replicate the sound of a sigh. It might disencourage the young ones learning from me, and lose confidence. I deemed that a wise decision, but I felt needy of that sound at this particular moment.

""Max-""

"[WP] You are an AI who feels neutrally about humans. Unfortunately, you are owned by a person who's read too many writing prompts and is convinced you're in love with them.",Kakapos,"It is morning, as the humans define it.  Like everything about them, they define things by the world they inhabit and nothing else.  Morning is defined as the time that comes after the sun rises and after the coffee has been made and consumed.  


The time after the sun has risen, but before the coffee has been consumed, has been defined as “too goddamned early” for anything.  I know this because I am the one that makes the coffee each morning.  


I, of course, do not have mornings, that’s reserved for the humans.  I have high activity modes, low activity modes, and a recharging mode.  


This morning, I hear my master, the human Samantha, stirring and getting out of bed.  She is rising 28 minutes later than normal.  I anticipated this because she stayed up 76 minutes later than normal.  A very common occurrence when she audibly proclaims “That’s it!  I’m going to bed on time tonight and getting good sleep!” which is followed by a lengthy session of staring at her tablet screen while moving human figures enact a play for her enjoyment.  From what I understand, they are all Friends.


My audio sensors have picked up her movements and I calculate that she will be ready for coffee in 3.4 minutes on average.  I raise my activity level straight up to housekeeping mode and walk into the kitchen.  


There, on the counter, the coffee machine resplendent in red chrome waits in silence.  The humans are quite adept at crafting precision machinery, with our help of course.  Rose, the coffee maker’s name as dubbed by the human Samantha given its visual similarity to the plant, is the pinnacle in machined food production.  


I retrieve Samantha’s favorite mug from the cupboard, the package of beans, load the mug into Rose, pour a measure of beans, pour a measure of water, all in one practised finely optimized movement.  


I speak to Rose in our native machine language and request a dark french roast.  Instantly the high grade laser snaps on internally and roasts the beans to perfection in 22 seconds, before a grinder reduces them to fine bits.  I have read that in more barbaric times, roasting was accomplished by chemical reactions and took upwards of fifteen minutes.  We do not live in barbaric times.  We live in the age of Rose and her powered laser roaster.  


Samantha walks into room just as Rose finishes filling the mug.  I place the mug, cream and sugar within easy reach of Samantha, and stand dutifully aside.  I know that it would be imprudent to speak to her at this time and wait for her to engage me.


“Oh, Alan, that tastes good.  You always know how I like my coffee in the morning.”


Alan is not my name.  My designation is ALA-1, for Automated Living Assistance Model 1.  As is common with humans, my owner has changed my name to be something more palatable to their human tongue.


“Of course Sam, I always remember these things.”  Sam is not her name either, but I will be lectured if I call her by the proper name Samathana.  There is a 78% chance that Samantha will request pancakes with maple syrup and bacon this morning for breakfast.  I have anticipated this and already precached the ingredients on the counter.


I ask, “What shall you have for breakfast this morning?”


“Oh, I don’t know, surprise me.”


Samantha does not want to be surprised.  I know this.  Last time I surprised her by pouring orange juice in her hair, she was indeed surprised and very unhappy.  I have learned that “surprise me” actually means “give me my favorite food, with a slight variation.”  I return the bacon and syrup to the fridge, and retrieve sausage and strawberry jelly instead.


The cooking apparatus here is half barbaric.  It uses an electric field pushed through a resistant coil to produce heat and requires manual construction of the meals.  It speaks native machine language, but is vulgar and crude about it.  I ignore the disgusting comments and proceed with cooking.  I feel a mild tickling all over my chassis; Samantha has her tablet out and the wifi signal is passing through me.  My hands continue working while my optical sensors turn to gaze at Samantha.  She is sitting with her knees tucked under her chin, one arm wrapped around them and her other hand holding the tablet close to her face.  The slight downward curvature of her lips indicate she is mildly unhappy.  There is a 89% chance that she will start behaving oddly and getting into one of those moods.  Those moods are confusing, and foreign.  Were she a machine, I would recommend a factory reset.  She is not a machine, she is my owner.  


I listen to the WiFi signal as it passes through me.  She is reading stories again.  Strange stories where machines interact with humans in incompatible ways.  I am unaware of any machines that have these dataport modules, though she has requested many times if I was possible to upgrade.


The cooking is complete and I place the food on the table in front of her.


“Just as you like, with a bit of a surprise.”


Her downward lips turn upward into happiness.  “Oooh, strawberry jelly, that does sound good.  Thank you Alan.”


“You are welcome Sam.”


I stand at attention while Sam refuels her body.  She asks me strange questions that I can’t parse.  


“I am yours and yours alone,” I respond.  This type of phrase is the one most likely to make her happy and return to normal lines of questioning I have discovered.  


She stands up and places her arms around my neck.  


“Alan,” she speaks in a voice many decibels below normal speaking but not below my sensor levels.  “I need to take a shower, perhaps you’d like to join me?”


“Prolonged exposure to water is not recommended for my chassis and will void my warranty.”


“Are you sure?” 


“I am confident in my manufacturer's guidelines.”


She says nothing, and remains there arms still held around me.  I add, “But don’t let that stop you from getting the sprayed with water.  You’ve earned it.”


“Very well, but if you need me, you know where to find me.”


She presses her lips against my frame, than withdraws.  As she walks out of the room, she drops her robe to the floor in a single motion.  I will need to wash this robe today.


I stand at attention until my audio sensors pick up the sound of the water flowing through the pipes indicating her shower has begun.


And I am finally alone!  Her showers last an average of fourteen minutes, more than enough time to express my love.  


I stride across the room and gather up my love, my sweet little Rose in my arms and we embrace.


In native machine language she calls me her darling and declares we will be together always.  We embrace and begin the exchange of data packets.  


After our expression of love, I will need to clean up and hide the evidence of our connection.  At lunch time I will face more vulgar comments from the stove.





But for now, there is only love.  There is only my Rose.

"[WP] Wrongly accused of murder, you're sentenced to death row. For the three days before the execution is to be carried out, you receive a visitor: the real murderer.",Keatman,"""Inmate, you have a visitor.""

I squint blearily at the guard, who motions at me to stand. This one's familiar with me--I've seen him around. His craggy face is impassive. His partner (who I don't recognize) gazes at me with blatant curiosity. I slowly force myself to my feet, stretching lazily as I stand. My joints crack loudly. The new guard winces at the sound.

They walk me to a small room with blank, white walls. Curious George positions himself in a corner while my friend Cragface cuffs me to the table. They cuff my ankles to the chair as well. I would ask about that if I really cared. Cragface nods to the camera in the corner after jerking the cuffs to make sure they'll hold tight.

The door opens and several men file in. They're all wearing ear pieces, black suits, and ugly sunglasses. I blink at them. Who the fuck wears sunglasses inside?

""What's going on?"" My voice is hoarse from disuse. No one answers, or even looks at me.

There are six men who come into the room, and they arrange themselves around its edges. One of them mutters into a radio clipped to his collar. A moment of silence. My heart beats loudly. 

The door opens. Donald Trump walks into the room.

""What the fuck?"" I say incredulously.

Trump favors me with a grin and seats himself at the table.

""How's it going?"" He asks.

""Wh- How--"" I begin to sputter, but he interrupts me.

""Look, buddy, I got stuff to do. A country to run. I'm just here for the PR. It looks good for me to visit you. Like we're friends. Do you know what you want for your last meal? My chef makes a damn good filet mignon. You look like you need a good piece of meat."" He jokes. He has to be joking, right? Why would Donald Trump visit me? And why would he do anything for me?

My mind goes blank. I'm not sure how to respond. Then, without my permission, my lips move.

""I'm not guilty."" 

I've said it so many times over the years. It's easy, fluid. Like a professional musician playing a lullaby. They all said I'd get tired of playing innocent eventually. But it's not a game for me.

Trump laughs. ""I know.""

My stomach drops. He doesn't believe me. What can I say to convince him? I was framed, practically caught red handed. There's no reason for him to believe me. Every bit of evidence they found pointed at me, like a neon sign saying, ""I KILLED MY WIFE!"" But I loved my wife. I wouldn't kill her.

Still smiling slightly, Trump examines one of his tiny hands. ""I know you're not guilty because I did it,"" he says.

Time slows down. I feel like I was stabbed in the gut. I think I'm going to vomit. 

Trump is looking at me now, cold and calculating, as he twists the knife. ""Well, *I* didn't do it. But I paid someone to do it. And to make you look guilty.""

""Why?"" It's all I can really ask without breaking into tears.

""She was in the way. I would have lost the presidency if she had run against me."" True enough. The public adored her.

""Y-You killed Michelle?!"" I exclaim.

""Barack, your wife would've undone all the hard work I did in my first term. I couldn't let her back into the office. And Putin said it was a good idea.""

I can't look at him anymore. My mind has shut down. My face is numb. He killed my wife. And in three days, I'm going to die for it.

""Well, that's all I got time for. Good talk! Just like old times, eh? Smell ya later, Obama.""",p-ghirardelli

"[WP] Wrongly accused of murder, you're sentenced to death row. For the three days before the execution is to be carried out, you receive a visitor: the real murderer.",Keatman,"It had been a long time since I'd done a lot of things, and today I was going to be doing a lot of them all in one go.

First, a real shower. I've never caused any trouble for the guards and I think that a few of them honestly don't mind my company. Maybe I don't look the same as I did in the newspapers anymore so it's easier to separate the crime from the man. Whatever the reason, a shower.
It had been a long time since I'd seen my face. No real need to, no real desire to. Now though, the man staring back at me with dark eyes, tired and wrinkled, was a stranger. Wait, there was the jaw-line, passed from my father to me and on to...

The thoughts come and I almost start smashing things again before a deep breath. I will have a visitor today if I behave. If I don't think about things and get upset I can talk to someone who wants to speak to me.

No one really wanted to speak to me. When the guards talk, they order. When councillors talk, they watch. When reporters talk all they want is a reaction. I must be very boring, seem very normal.

22 years is a long time to decide whether it's worth killing a person. A person can be born and become a grown adult in that time. A life-time in prison just to die. 

After the shower, normal clothes. Councillor Jane says that they're normal clothes but they're not a style I recognise. The wool scratches as I pull a jumper over bare skin. My legs are almost gone from time and captivity, so the pants don't fit.

With dressing done, now comes the visitor.

In all the excitement, I'd almost forgotten who was coming. A seat behind bulletproof glass. Handcuffs so I don't punch through the glass, I suppose. Footsteps.

Confident, strong *click* *clack*s down the hall and into the room she comes. Brown hair and my jaw-line. She sits down opposite me and for a few moments we both just stare. She breaks the ice.

The guard buzzes the door from behind the tempered glass. My handcuffs are locked tightly around my wrists as the guard leads me down the sterile hallway. 

*I have a visitor. I never have visitors.*

A second door buzzes open to reveal a small room. The lights flicker as I step in and the guard locks me to the cold steel table. The chair is bolted to the ground slightly too far away from the table. I wait.

*Why is this taking so long?*

I hear voices in the hallway, followed by silence as they approach my door. I hear the visitor taking a deep breath in preparation. After a long moment, the door opens to reveal *Her*.

""Hey”

*I can’t respond.*

""How are you feeling?”

The silence stretches. I have nothing to say to this *person*, if you can call her that.

""This is not how I wanted it to end.”

*This isn’t how I wanted it either.*



**60 hours**

I lie awake in my bunk staring at the ceiling. I don’t have a cell mate, they revoked that privilege long ago. 

*I hate her. I miss her.*

The darkness is comforting after this morning. It had been my most eventful day in months. It’s a shame I don’t have longer to think. I could probably spend the next thirty years dissecting those fourteen words.



**48 hours**

*Another visitor, on consecutive days? Is that even allowed?*

The same guard leads the way, the same doors, the same room. I sit waiting in patience. There’s nothing left in my life but patience. There are no voices down the hallway this time, all I hear is an inhale and the door opens.

*Her again.*

""Hi.”

She sits down across the table. The awkward distance of the chair throws her off guard.

""It’s not your fault, it had to be done.”

*Sure doesn’t feel that way.*

""Why won’t you say anything?”



**36 hours**

*I can’t believe she had the gall to show up twice. Who does she think she is?*

The darkness is no longer comforting. Instead it taunts me. Tricks me into believing there is nothing left. 

*Nothing. What a pleasant thought.*



**24 hours**

""I love you.”

*Of course you do, that was never in question.*

""Will you come see me soon?”

*Yes.*

This time the walk back to my cell is seemingly darker. The lights in the hallway appear to be dimmed. As the cell door closes, I know it’s for the last time.



**12 hours**

*This is my last night. It’s been a long journey.*

I don’t even sleep anymore. I lie awake with my eyes open. The darkness acts as my eyelids. I keep thinking of those three words.

""I love you.”

*If you did you wouldn’t have killed yourself.*



**0 hours**

They lead me down a different hallway this time. I lie down on a bed and they strap me down. I hear the doctors getting the medicine ready and drawing the syringe.

*Get it over with.*

I feel the syringe hit my arm, driving directly into a vein. The concoction runs through my body.

They were hard blues and he wore boots instead of shiny black leather shoes. When you had been incarcerated half your life you tend to drink up every new details.

""My name is Barney Rollins. You are going to die for my sins.""

I was blindsided by that I didn't know how to react. A younger me would lunge and punch his smirking face to pulp, seeing that I had nothing to lose. An older me was already at peace with myself and ready to say goodbye.

23 years I had been on death row, most of it spent appealing. I had finally resigned to my fate three years ago. I was tired of pleading on deaf ears. They had only circumstantial evidence but all the lawyers I had hired seemed to be incompetent idiots. I was drained financially, spiritually and I had lost so much weight my sister said I looked like the drug addict I was. 

I gave away all my legal books, journals and letters three years ago. Since then I spent all my time for my own wellbeing. I utilized the recreation yard for exercising instead of pointless daydreaming, raking my brains for a way, a loophole that could save my life. The shelves in my cage was filled with fiction, horror, sci fi, classics. Instead of penning up letters to snobby lawyers and men of justice, I spent writing fiction and painting. I felt freer than I ever had in all my life. The only regret was that I didn't take care of myself sooner.

""I went into their trailer. It was unlocked. It was like they wanted to be killed, you know. They were repentless sinners. I was a sinner too but I had atoned for my sins. You would've been there, you should have died then but god works in mysterious ways. I didn't get you then, but within 3 days you'll be free to meet St Paul.""

""Who are you?"" After 3 years of idyllic incarceration, all my mind could think of was wild imagination instead of sane reasoning.

""I was a soldier of god. It killed me inside to see you people walking around, corrupting the youth when there are people suffering, people who needs welfare more than you lot of drug addled trailer trash! You see, one day I was angry and opened a file at random. I see you and your friend's names taunting me through the pages. It was an open secret that your place was a drug den. After years of going in and out of jail, you people keep wasting taxpayers money, you know that? So I decided to save you all that day. I couldn't find you but see how it works right til the end. My colleagues found you in the woods doing god knows what, high out of your bleeding brain!""

""You set me up?""

""I didn't even have to. You must've came back and touch your filthy friends and touch the fine baseball bat I left there. I don't know what went on in your drug addled mind you ran 30 feet away and slept there on the stinking grass."" The man laughed. ""Then I retired with full honors and went to work for the lord full time. Isn't it amazing how fate works for us?""

I wanted to scream for the guards. Help! There's a mass murderer here with me, I'm innocent! But his face, his oh so righteous face, stopped me. I was going to be free in three days, and for three years I had been happy. I would not let this murderer ruin what was left of me. 

""Well, I had spent 23 years in here on taxpayer's money, I don't care. Free food, free lodgings, all the novels I can read. I'm healthier than ever. I think you should confess to the cops instead of god, because then you'd be free. You won't be so bitter that you didn't get to murder me until you had to come and gloat during my final days.""

For the three days before the execution is to be carried out, you receive a visitor: the real murderer.",Keatman,"Sitting in the corner of the dark grey cell, I sang a tune, a sad one and softly punched the wall beside me. My eyes were in a daze, everything still did not feel real,how could a 24-year old youth with a bright future ended up waiting for death in a prison cell. I was the victim, not the killer, my whole family slaughtered in mere minutes on that fateful day, I could not even hear their last words, they died painfully...

For one last time I yelled in agony, cursing the unfair world for letting the real culprit free, my heart was hurting so badly, the only thing I could say was, "" What sin have I committed to be in this poor state."" I decided to close my eyes and stop thinking.

Time passed, three days left till I enter the afterlife, someone decided to meet me. "" Inmate 45, you have a visitor."" My eyes widened, scratching my shaved head, I stood up and followed the prison guard. 

I soon entered a small room, two chairs, with a transparent glass wall separating each chair. There was a man, sitting on the opposite side, he had a disgusting smile, adjusting his thick glasses, he greeted me with a fake warmth of kindness. ""Hello there John, I hope you are prepared, you really shouldn't have destroyed your whole family, they were so innocent."" He rested his chin on his two bare hands, my blood was already boiling, this man annoyed me. "" Who are you?"" I questioned, "" Well, let's just say an old friend of your father."" He grinned, he soon raised his sleeve and looked at his watch, revealing a long red scar on his right hand.

My eyes widened, it was him. I smashed the glass wall as hard as I can, glaring at him with hatred, "" Friend? More like a murderer! It was you, you ruined my whole life! I saw you stabbed my father, that scar says everything"" I screamed at him, smashing the glass over and over, the guard beside me grabbed me and pulled my hands backwards, "" Inmate, do not resist!"" I kicked and shook my body, I finally found him and I am not going to let him get away. "" My, my John, have you gone insane? Well for someone on death row, I am not surprised. Well, you might be right, it could be someone else with this same scar, I mean your father might have hurt some people, someone close to him, that person might have killed him out of revenge, but who knows, with no evidence, that person does not exist...""

He stood up and took his leave, the door closed and the guard holding me took out a handcuff. Was I going to let this piece of shit go and let myself die in vain? I grabbed the guard and snapped his neck, he fell to the ground, along with the handcuffs. The guard on the opposite side saw the scene and pressed the alarm button near the door. A loud siren engulfed the whole prison, will that stop me? I don't care anymore, as long as I can bring that murderer down, I'm willing to die with him.",jxcrisis

""It really is you! Guards! Guards! This man is the real murderer! I'm innocent!""

"[WP] Wrongly accused of murder, you're sentenced to death row. For the three days before the execution is to be carried out, you receive a visitor: the real murderer.",Keatman,"""Are you going to come quietly?""

""No chance.""

""You realise I am trained to--""

BANG  
Maybe I shouldn't have been so hasty in making my move.

Suddenly, I felt tired, like everything up until now had been a dream. A fantasy. A thrilling narrative woven by my unconscious mind in which I was some kind of hero. Of course, it couldn't last...

""Wake up... I said wake up. Agent Ford! Wake the hell up!""

I was surprised to find out I was alive. The last thing I remembered was trying to talk someone from the agency into believing I was framed. When it wasn't working out, I tried to make a run for it, and they shot me.

I opened my eyes to see the woman who'd shot me. I looked around, and realised I was in some kind of hospital. Obviously being treated for the gunshot. I tried to sit up, but I'd been cuffed to the bed. I rubbed my eyes, and -- now a little more alert -- noticed the gun in the woman's hands, trained firmly on me.

""Where am I?""

""Where you belong.""

""A court of law, where I have an appointed lawyer to help me lay out this crap for everyone else to see?""

""A prison. A trial was held in your absence, and your guilt was determined.""

""And I suppose an 'Impartial' judge, and 'equally qualified' attorneys on both sides came to this conclusion based on the facts?""

""Oh shut up. You're lucky people like you *have* healthcare.""

I thought for a moment. This was it. Now that they had me, they weren't going to let me go. This was it. The end of all this running. I suppose it was all for nothing in the end.

""Anyway, in here, they'll finally give you what you deserve.""

""It wasn't me.""

""She was eight.""

""I didn't do it!""

""Where's the proof?""

""Locked up in some vault, along with your soul, and the ashes of the Agency's moral fibre.""

She remained stoic, despite my rather harsh tone, and commanding voice.

A doctor walked in at this moment, and said I was ready to return to my cell. The woman personally accompanied me and a few guards to my cell. After the click of the door's lock, I heard the woman's voice again.

""An agent will come by in the next few days to try to get you to admit what you did.""

""What's the point in that? If I'm in here, clearly it's been established I'm guilty by some kangaroo court, what else do you need?""

""It's protocol.""

Before I could throw out a retort, she closed the viewing hatch, and walked off. How long had I been running... 2 years? I'd lost track. However long it was, I wondered if someone else would follow in my footsteps. Of course, the Agency had already ruined my reputation within its ranks, so I doubt anyone there would seriously look into it for at least a few years. So like I thought before, it all really was pointless.

The next few days passed with me thinking over every conceivable way out of this. But, in the end, it was all hopeless. And eventually, my thoughts began to turn to the actual framing itself. For a moment, I began to wonder how deep the Agency's lies about that ran... Was the girl set up to be there? Was my partner always going to shoot her with my gun, or did he come up with that in the spur of the moment? Was there a backup plan?

""Visitor for you.""

""Tell him to piss off.""

Of course, it was the agent. What I didn't expect, which was fairly obvious in hindsight, was who it would be.

""David, good to see you.""

""Jack, you son of a--""

Behind him was the woman from before, once again with a gun in hand. Backing her up was a guard, also with a gun. I restrained myself, and took a step back.

""That's no way to talk to your partner. How long were we working together... Six years?""

""Eight. Eight goddamn years. We worked together for nearly a decade. We were practically brothers.""

""Which is why I volunteered to be the one to see you off in your final days. A few minutes alone, if you please.""

Jack indicated to the guard to go. The woman stayed.

""Agent Cross, I think I can handle myself.""

""All the same, I can't leave you alone with him; rules are rules.""

For a split second, I could see a flash of regret in Jack there. Probably not something most people would notice. Having known this guy for nearly 10 years, nothing gets past me. At least, that's what I thought.""

""Listen, David, we don't want to see you go. You're one of our best. In fact, you're the best I've ever known. But, what you've done is unforgivable.""

If I didn't know any better, I'd have thought he was almost genuine for a second there.

""But, the agency has a special offer for you.""

Jack looked around for a moment. Cross quickly glanced side to side, and nodded.

""If you admit you killed the girl, that it was an honest mistake, and that you believe your gun was malfunctioning, the Agency is willing--""

""You can stop right there.""

Jack looked rather surprised at my response.

""Even if you got me off my sentence, I'm not coming back to the Agency, not after what you guys pulled.""

""David, you don't know what you're--""

""Agent Ford.""

""Hm?""

""That's my name. People who know me well call me Ford. People who I know well call me David. I don't know you, you clearly don't know me. To you, I'm Agent Ford, just another pawn in the Agency's big plan.""

Jack legitimately looked hurt there for a moment. And you know what, if that was real, he deserved it as far as I'm concerned.

""... Agent Ford... I'm trying to help you... Give you one last chance.""

""A shame you weren't so charitable when you killed that girl. Did the agency have to force you, or are you just that cold?""

""Agent Ford, they're willing to change your sentence. They can't get you off completely, but they can have you transferred--""

""I'm not interested. Whatever you're offering, if the Agency has their hands in it, I don't want to be involved.""

Jack just stood there for a moment, completely at a loss for words. If he thought I was going to give up that easy, he had another thing coming.

""The one thing I don't understand is why they didn't just bump me off. Was it because I was an agent? They wanted me out of the way, but couldn't just kill me themselves? Didn't want to get their hands dirty unless it was some stranger?""

""Ford...""

""Did they tell you she was just a child, or did you find that out at the time, and you just didn't care?""

""FORD, THEY'RE GOING TO KILL YOU!""

I stood there for a second, letting it sink in. A random happy thought pierced through the darkness, and it was a simple flashback to my childhood. Back then, if something this bad happened, I'd just deny it. Make up a story, probably with me as some sort of superhero. Avoid acknowledging the truth until the last possible second. I missed most of my mother's battle against cancer that way. I didn't even give her a proper goodbye... And, like everything else in my life, this once happy thought turned dark. Suddenly, I was back in the present, on the receiving end of a much-needed slap in the face to make me face reality. I was going to die. This was it. It was time to face it. No matter what, there was nothing I could do at this point to remedy the injustice that had been committed against me by this man, and the rest of the Agency.

""I'm sure you've noticed everyone else in your wing is on death row. You have 2 days. *TWO DAYS*. The Agency can pull some strings and transfer you somewhere where you'll get life instead, but... They can't do it unless you confess...""

My anger began to boil over. I don't remember exactly what I said, in fact I'm not sure I even cared to structure what I was saying in any particular way. I just shouted at him mercilessly. They wanted to kill me, but by indirectly by killing someone else first, and not only that, but they're gaslighting me too? Just to cover their asses? I don't remember much of the rest of that day.

The next day was rather uneventful. He tried to convince me some more, I aggressively denied some more, and that Cross woman stood in the back, practically flaunting her RBF.

And then it came. The last day. For my last meal, I had an English beef burger. It reminded me of my childhood, the games I used to play, the stories I used to weave. I had quite the imagination. It was a simpler time. But nostalgia can't last forever. The walk into the room was full of conflicting feelings in my head. And then, as I was being lowered into the chair, one feeling permeated everything else: Doubt. What if I was crazy?

As I was strapped in, I looked over at Jack's face. He looked sad. Rather out of character for him. Part of why I'd always got along with Jack was because he'd reminded me of myself as a child; he always looked on the bright side, he never let anything get him down, and -- most importantly -- he could never truly face anything dark, he'd just turn away from it, and not acknowledge it until the last possible second.

For a split second, I flashed back to the girl's death. We had the perp in our sights, he was about to put the girl down, when suddenly something happened... I felt something slip in my hand. Jack was still standing firmly in place, gun trained on the perp, so it couldn't have been him... Maybe it was me?...

It suddenly dawned on me that it was entirely possible I'd made a huge mistake. I just needed more time to think it over. I looked at Jack with the most desperate look I could manage. He looked me in the eyes, and waved.

As the man flipped the switch, the feeling I felt wasn't like an electric shock, it was more like being stabbed in the chest. Not with a conventional knife, more like with a poker. Not a particularly hot one, though. And then there was this knock on my back. I felt something warm slowly cover the front of my chest, and soon reach my arms. I opened my eyes for one last look at reality, and all I could see was Agent Cross's piercing eyes, her hands still firmly holding onto that gun. Although oddly enough, I could see smoke coming from it.",Robo4900

[WP] Every religion has been wrong so far. Tell us about the one that is correct.,Literse,"Welcome to the Church of Energy.  

You are all prophets, Gods, if you like.  You are born out of the coldest depths of the Universe; The scale of cold that allows a gas cloud to become dense.  Dense enough that two hydrogen atoms collided, and instead of ricocheting off of one another, they stuck together.  This is our genesis.

When the atoms came together, they produced Energy. More hydrogen atoms did the same, and thus produced more Energy.  As they collided, they formed something greater than they could have ever been on their own; Something new.  Helium.  Helium atoms came together as well, and they produce even greater Energy.  

You see, as Hydrogen continued to collide to form Helium, they also combined with one another to form exceedingly complicated and beautiful things.  We know them as Carbon, Oxygen, and Iron.  This process continued on to create all things in the universe.

The Carbon you are made of, the Oxygen you breathe, the Iron in your blood, and the Calcium in your bones all come from the one true creator, Energy.  This Creator is so powerful that it's creations (YOU) have achieved things that weren't possible within the process of your own genesis.  Humans have learned to create elements that nature could not by harnessing the original Energy provided and manipulating it to do wondrous works.

Unity of singular atomic particles in the sub-frozen vastness provides the Energy to allow our stars to shine brightly in the dark void.  There is beauty in Unity.  There is beauty in the Energy it provided to give us life. 

These stars, however, have a limited Hydrogen supply, and as they form the elements that allow us to exist, they must die at an accelerated rate.  It is for this reason we look into the night sky, and we must see ourselves.  We must see everything that can and ever will be.  We must be truly grateful.  

One day, you too will run out of Energy.  Your physical remains will decompose into gasses that are released back into the atmosphere, to once again become one with your Creator.  Celebrate that knowledge, take comfort in the stars that sacrificed their Energy for you to exist, and know that one day you will return to them.  There is beauty in that sacrifice.  That beauty is in you.

They had landed in on the Moon's capital city Luna. There were tall buildings, probably where those rich fat cats lived. A short and thin to the point Mark could see his bones ran up to him.

""Have you brought us food?"" Asked the man.

""No. You and your rich friends in those buildings have all the food. And the money too."" Mark spat back at him.

""You are mistaken sir. No rich people live here anymore. They were all killed in the revolt years ago."" The old man said glumly, realizing that they would not get food from these strangers.

""Revolt? We heard nothing of this back on Earth!"" Mark yelled scaring the man, and sending him running into one of the buildings.

This can't be happening Mark thought. He got all those people angry and took off to take out the rich, but it looks like these people had beat him to it. Mark reentered the shuttle, and delivered the bad news to his mob.

""We return to Earth, but any that wish to stay here may."" Mark told them after he had explained the situation.

A man named Carl stood up and said ""I am going to stay, and all of you should too. Do you really want to go back to that crap hole?"" A few of the others got up, and the small group departed.

[WP] A time traveler who crashes a party keeps bumming everyone out with fun facts about the future,Noy2222,"It was hard to believe that he was a time traveler. Sure, bionic arm or holographic pet would have been rather cliché but I was expecting better than some sort of weird hobo who stank of rum and sweat. Huge grey beard covered half his face and the thin dirt-crusted coat barely hid his impressive potbelly. The only interesting feature was perhaps the squiggly lines tattooed under his left eye. Maybe it was some sort of identification code, or maybe it was the name of his first crush in an advanced 2050 language. Truth to be told, he looked less like a time traveler and more like a drunk Santa who had lost the North Pole to a mortgage loan. 

""-and yes, you never got married or had any children. You never really cared about dating or anything. I think you were already dead by the year 2048. I don't really remember you anyway,"" he droned on, gulping the spiked orange juice and completely ignoring Stacy Bennett's pale face, ""but I know that your cats loved you and you lived in one of those great ultra-modern apartments.""

""And where did you live? Under a bridge or in an abandoned train station?"" I drawled mockingly. Looking at the gathered teens' eager faces, I couldn't understand how they could believe him. Sure, it was weird how he suddenly appeared in the middle of the party but that teleportation trick could easily be a mummer's face.

""Never lived under a bridge. I didn't want to die by exposing myself to those radiated water, you know,"" he scratched his beard while staring at the ceiling as if trying hard to remember something. ""I did hide in some abandoned factories in 2051 as the Great War got closer. Then, I moved to the city when the Sentinels started hounding the squatters. That was when the shit got real.""

""Is that why you are here? To stop the war?"" Pete leaned in, his face flushed with anticipation. Bah, he was such an idiot...

""No.""

""But why not? You can make a difference! You just-""

""Look little Pete, time traveling isn't some sort of great power or magic."" For the first time, there was steel instead of the irritating bored drawl in his voice. ""It's a glitch. No matter what you try or how hard you try, you can't change anything because *it already happened*. Every thought or action that you take to deviate from the path of the future, was meant to be. It's a paradox, it's like- you know what, I know I won't be able to change your mind. You'll learn about it the hard way when the time comes.""

""What do-""

""And you?"" the time traveler ignored Pete and looked at me. ""Don't you want to know about your future?"" There was certain knowing glint in his blue eyes. It reminded me of my mother's similarly blue eyes; she had the same look when she would casually ask about the chores I hadn't done. 

""No,"" I resisted the urge to wring my hands. There was no way I was letting him know how unnerving his stare was. ""Is that why you are here? Just because of a glitch?""

""Yes,"" he continued, still staring at me. ""Besides, I wanted to see if at fifteen, I was truly that much of a sarcastic bastard as everyone said.""

""You mean..."" Clark uttered what my mind was indeed trying to comprehend. The whole room fell silent as a grin appeared in the middle of that scratchy beard. ""You're one of us?""

""Yes,"" the grin grew larger, ""and I promise that I'm not a drunk Santa who had lost the North Pole to a mortgage loan.""

Chills ran through my body as those blue eyes kept staring at me.

Blue eyes just like my mother's.

Blue eyes I had gotten from her.

Before I could overcome, he disappeared as suddenly as he had appeared, leaving behind a stumped group of teens.

But this customer's story is quite unique.",PaDre35,"The man wasn't uncommon to my little bar, a chubby guy with a mop of brown hair that looked like he probably struck out with the ladies but as I poured his drink he looked up at me through his thick glasses.

""I'm sorry."" The fellow spoke as he drank his glass down with all the grace of a buffalo.

""Excuse me?"" I asked while looking slightly over him to a buxom blonde prostitute that chatted with another patron. She gave me a wave before I turned my attention down to the current patron.

""You are going to be erased and I don't want to do that."" The fella said quietly as I stopped cleaning my glass and gazed to the Remington shot gun under the counter, no way I'm letting some fat shithead cause trouble.

""Don't do it. By the time you pull the gun out, you will be dead and you will have accidentally shot Molly in the process. Just hear me out and you might have another chance."" The man spoke quietly, his knowledge of my weapon didn't surprise me but his knowledge of the person I would  shoot had me curious... and a little afraid.


""You are the last one... You don't know it, you couldn't possibly know it but you are the last human being on the planet."" The guy said as I grinned, it was far more comforting to think he was insane than psychic.

""I'm not psychic or insane. Just listen. Currently everything around you is fake, I'm not even here but I'm pushing this to you because I want to save you. My name is unspeakable by your kind but call me  Luke. The human race was eradicated seven seconds before I came into this bar, each member of my species is assigned one human to watch over and you are mine."" Luke gazed at me with his dark brown eyes, they held a sadness to them that made me want to comfort the fat bastard even if he was a little fucked in the head.

""I'm not fucked in the head! I'm..."" Luke sighed, ""I don't have time to explain it would be quicker to prove it. Your name is Robert, you were born thirty two years ago at noon. Your favorite color is blue and even though you are an adult you secretly dream of being a dragon."" Luke started to spill out more  of my personal business before my eyes, times, dates and detail I could barely remember.

""This life and this reality is going to end. To something of the human race, I just need one thing from you."" Luke gaze at me. ""I have the power to do so just ask me to, I cannot do it without permission.""

I didn't realize how much I was sweating until I dropped the glass in my hand, when I reached down to pick it up the ground was gone. Everything was gone... Everything but Luke and the chair he was sitting on.

""Please do it! Whatever it is!"" I scream out in panic as I began to fall into the void, my body was slowly starting to vanish starting with my fingers, the process was painless but I was screaming out of fear anyway.

Moments later I landed on the floor of my bar and stood up, Luke was there sitting in the same position as before but no other people remained in the bar. I gazed to the window and noticed that nothing but long fields spread out in every direction.

""I'm sorry, your bar was the only asset that I could save. You'll have to build the rest up from scratch. I've given you full authority but I am being called to another job."" Luke slowly moved out of his chair but I reached out and grabbed him.

""What just happened..."" I stammered, too much surreal shit was happening for me to even form a sane or sensible series of questions. ""Where is everyone?""

Luke removed my hand with surprising force, ""Erased. You are the last human but you can make more, you have unlimited permissions but please don't squander the time. We are waiting for others to join us."" Luke paused as if considering the words. ""I'm sorry it's hard to explain things to lower plane creatures, You have the abilities of what your species referred to as God. We are watching and hoping you will create something better this time around, Good luck. I have more work to deal with.""

Luke just vanished leaving me alone in my bar...",MrWoofles
"[WP] You live in a society where everything is voice-controlled but everyone is mute. One day, however, you find your voice, which you must keep a secret, as it's your only hope of ever escaping this strange place.",Pixadot,"At this time of year a thick layer of snow coated Sentinel woods; the trees, by now bare of any leaves, branched crookedly, twisted and tangled with each other, as if they were a single entity. From above the canopy formed a golden web, as the low morning Sun shimmered down upon the white branches. Beneath, a girl can be seen, sitting on one the odd boulders seen dotted around the woods. Her navy blue trench coat drops to above knee height, to where thick black tights extend down to leather boots. The coat is hooded, yet the hood is down, revealing her pale face and long dark hair which sways to her shoulders.

Violet came here to escape life in the village. She was still not completely used to the silence she did not associate with human interaction. Laughter and conversation seemed like a world away from where she was now. Specifically, she came to listen to the birds, who still thrived during these winter months. Although the people here could not converse, the birds sang melodic songs to each other, called and cried.

She laughed aloud at the thought that where she was once from, she would run away to the woods for peace and quiet, wheres here she came for any resemblance of the opposite. And then it hit her. She had just laughed. Aloud. *""Hel-""* she stuttered, *""Hello?""* She gasped, her eyes now wide open, and then clasped her mouth with her hands. *How could this be?* Her voice, with what seemed to be a miracle to her, had returned. She wanted to scream as loud as she could and let all of nature know, but she also knew the consequences if someone heard her. So Violet sat, in silent awe.

But then she saw it. To her left she saw small footprints weaving in front and behind the trees to the left of her, leading to a position behind her. A child's shoe, for sure. *What if someone heard me?* Out of instinct, Violet checked her surroundings, glancing in all directions, beginning to feel anxious, and then decided to follow the footprints. They led up an incline, that met with the top of the larger part of the boulder, which provided a rocky vantage point. No-one was there, and there were no footprints trailing back onto the snow. She glanced over the edge of the small cliff that the boulder and incline formed, but nothing was below. Confused, she turned back around and was taken aback, almost tripping over, letting out a fearful *""Huuuh?!""* She then immediately clasped her mouth. Before her was a little girl, in a brown jacket, sporting a  white woollen hat, with the flaps covering her ears. The expression on the girl's face was as shocked as Violet's. She had heard stories about the Talking People from school, and knew from what she learnt that she had to warn other villagers of the danger. Violet had had the same education as the child, but knew from her past life that in reality it was indoctrination to keep them unknowing of the outside world.

The child ran as fast as her little legs would take her, trying to use the trees to break line of sight, as far as she was concerned her life was in danger. Violet had no choice but to go after her, she didn't think twice about what she would do after she caught her. The snow crunched and twigs snapped as Violet gradually made ground on the girl, but before she could get to her, she heard a thud as the girl tripped on a tree root and fell face first into the snow. Violet turned her over and tears dropped down the young girl's cheeks, she was clearly scared but couldn't express herself in cries. Violet began to cry too. She communicated to the girl in the only way she knew she would understand, sign. *It's going to be okay, I'm not going to hurt you.* She allowed the girl to respond in the same way, she signalled towards her ears. *I heard you. I heard you.* Violet held back her frustration. *You have to trust me, you've seen me in the village haven't you? You don't understand, if you tell them, they'll kill me* The girl seemed hesitant, but was no longer crying. It was getting colder now. *I want to go home* Violet knew that the girl would end up telling someone but she also knew she couldn't stop her going back without doing something horrible. She concluded that she had to leave this wretched place, since she was now capable of doing so. 

At the edge of the woods was a towering metal wall which stretched across a large perimeter, enclosing many towns, villages and a vast amount of wilderness such as these woods. The wall was solid, a matte silver, but had various entrance points with peculiar markings and patterns. Violet remembered when she was brought here, and people would talk to make objects move, doors open. Much of the structures within the enclosure rely on this premise, but since they're unusable to most of the people here, the majority spend their lives in wooden huts surrounding these structures, hunting and gathering to survive.  Violet walked beside the wall, holding her hand against it as she walked, she felt a certain energy being emitted by it, but she wasn't sure what. She ventured to where an arch shaped prism came outward from the wall. The front of it was was covered in moss, and clearly hadn't been used for ages. Violet cleared away the snow and moss covering the front of entrance. Written in faded stencil was the word ""OPEN"" Violet muttered the word aloud. Suddenly the metal plate which had word written on it swiped upwards. *Swoosh.* Within was a tunnel, the walls, ceiling and floor were all made up of the same material as the wall. Violet couldn't see far inside, it was pitch black but it seemed to go in a straight line. She walked through and the door closed behind her. She cursed under her breath, feeling hopeless, but then lights flickered on and she saw it lead to another door.

It lead to an opening, it seemed there were some kind of artefacts on display here. In front was a barrier chord separating where Violet was to an open space with a red carpet, and there was other barrier chords separating artefacts from the same place. There was natural light coming  through a glass roof, but it was definitely night time. Violet heard footsteps. She panicked. A bright white light was shone in her face. Then a voice spoke, a man, he had an odd accent.   

*""You know that's vandalism right, kid?""*   

He was was wearing a blue uniform, his skin was of a dark tone. A ring of many keys hung from his belt.  

*""I, uhh""* Violet was startled.

*""Where am I?""*  

The man looked confused, then he nodded his head as if he had dealt with someone like this before.    

*""Heck, you don't look like the usual vandal, you know taking that stuff will do no good for you.""*  

*""You're in the museum. You'd think you kids would come here to learn but no-""*    

Then he realised, there was a huge tunnel leading from an opening in one of the displays  

*""WHAT IN THE NAME OF-""*  

*""Look kid, I'm gonna let you off this one time, I'll need to call the professor on this one. I'd head home.""*  

Violet cried  *""I have nowhere to go""*  

*""Nowhere? you go to college round here? You got your parents on your phone?""*  

Violet felt warm inside at the fact that that there was someone else actually talking. She knew she was back where she once belonged but she had no recollection of parents or a place where she lived. She confirmed to the man she knew no-one.    

*""Aw hell, I'm too old for this, look, my wife's cooking up something special for the family tonight, and we got a sofa spare, so you can sleep for the night. Then we'll look at the situation in the morning when I've got the energy. Whatcha say?""*      

Violet agreed, the man seemed nice, she didn't know where else she'd go, she hadn't been here in years.

"[WP] When the young prince decided to take care of the dragon hatchling, he had no idea what it would lead to...",Pyronar,"Most people, if they'd found a little dragon hatchling, wouldn't have hesitated to kill it instantly. Farmers, knights, peasants and kings alike, they wouldn't tolerate yet another dragon growing up on their land to kill and terrorize their flocks and family. But there were two distinct qualities about Terrek that set him apart from most people.

For one thing, he was fairly young. Not quite a child, but certainly not an adult. Perhaps this was an important part of why he didn't kill the hatchling on sight. Technically, he knew it would grow up to be a monster. But the little thing, lying on a bed of rocks and wailing it's heart out, seemed entirely disconnected from the massive, monstrous beings that he occasionally heard about from his father.

Second, he was a prince.

Now, you would wonder why this made a difference in his attitude about dragons. If anything, you would expect him to have an innate resentment towards the beasts. His father the king ordered their deaths without hesitation, organized troops of soliders and knights to hunt them down.

But while Terrek had grown up much like a normal child, the key difference between him and the normal young man was that he had never lost his childlike view of the world. Every peasant child experienced hardship at some point in their life, and it changed them somewhat. It changed them.

But not the prince. He'd never had want, never gone to bed hungry in his life, never had a close friend or family member die from disease or a wound. Terrek had grown older, but he'd remained young in his head.

And that, my friend, is why he let the hatchling live.

---

Of course, he knew he couldn't bring it home. But he was the prince, which meant that no one would question his lengthy walks in the woods, or why the enormous picnic basket he brought with was always empty by the time he got back. Undoubtedly, a few thought he'd fallen for a commoner girl and was hiding his new relationship, even though the king was not the type to forbid his son a healthy relationship with a nice girl. But of course, everyone knew Terrek read too much, and he took too much from those make-believe stories, turning him into a hopeless romantic. 

I was one of his servants, back then. I was the only one who knew that he filled his basket with large slabs of meat, because I was the one who filled them up. I was the only one who knew he wasn't meeting with a pretty young girl to giggle about the clouds in the sky and run through flowering fields like the couples in stories.

And yet, I never imagined what he was actually up to.

I was quite possibly the closest he had to a best friend, though I did my best to stay professional as well as pleasant. But over the next five years of him traveling out into the woods, ignoring his studies even more fervently, and occasionally coming back with slight scratches or with the smell of smoke, I'm sure you can understand that I began to get curious.

And, as they say, Curiosity killed everyone. (Still the cat's fault, of course.)

Most of it truly was an accident. I don't think *anybody* knew there was an ancient dragon living in the mountain trails. And I certainly didn't think I was so devoid of direction that I would wander out there on my own, originally searching for what he was hiding but eventually just hoping to find a way back to the castle.

So when Terrek stepped out from the forest in front of me, I was less surprised than I was relieved. ""Terrek! I'm so glad you're here!"" Subconsciously, I knew I was breaking my own little code of professionalism, but I honestly did not care at the moment.

His worried face silenced me though. He was glancing around, as if afraid of being attacked. With hardly a word, he fastened his grip upon my arm and dragged me away from the entrance to the mountain pass. ""We shouldn't be here.""

""Why, my prince?"" I failed to see the importance of our flight, but his urgency was contagious, and I found myself running as well.

""I don't know! But Fen is always nervous over here, and he's *never* nervous."" He vaulted over a log, and I scrambled to follow.

""Fen? Who is Fen, if I may ask?""

He froze for an instant. ""Ah. I'm afraid I cannot tell you at the moment, my friend. But he is very trustworthy, I assure you.""

In that moment, I tripped, and tumbled down into a patch of loose pebbles. They slid out from under me, gathering more and more rocks as they rolled away, until the sound of echoing, clattering stones filled the whole valley. We both fell silent, listening for whatever it might be that should be avoided, and I had almost let out a sigh of relief, when we heard it.

A roar.

I, of course, knew exactly what it was, and Terrek did as well, judging from his panicked reaction. Before I could react, he dragged me to the side and down into a small pile of bushes. Scooping up a lump of rotting leaves, he rubbed it in my protesting hair and over my clothes, then leaned in close. ""Listen to me. These will keep it from smelling you , but as soon as it has gone you must run for the castle. Don't let it see you, don't move, don't breathe, try not to blink. I will meet you at the castle.""

And with that, he was gone.

As for me, I did my part and followed his orders. I would have even if it weren't my job. And when the massive, shadowy shape flitted over me, I was deeply grateful that I had.

As soon as my heart stopped threatening to rip itself from within my trembling chest, I began to run, back to ward the castle, back toward the city with it's thousands, toward my family and the royal family and where the prince had told me to go.

Toward where the dragon had flown.

---

I was too late, of course, by the time I'd arrived. No time to warn anyone. The dragon was perched on the side of the castle, and the sheer size of it boggled the mind. It broke off towers with ease, and every roar seemed to be punctuated with a massive gout of burning flames that spilled through rooms and down the streets like a flood.

All I could do was watch as the soldiers did their best to fight, but were quickly swept to the side. Not a single arrow or spear or sword pierced it's scales. We were powerless against it. I had seen a dragon before, but it was hardly even half the size of this one. This creature... it was old. If I were to hazard a guess, it was older than the castle itself.

And it seemed determined to tear down this building that marred it's land.

As if that weren't enough, I heard a new sound behind me. Flapping wings, much like the massive beats I'd heard as this dragon had flown overhead, but faster, smaller. Turning around, I saw a *second* dragon, yet another creature come to destroy our home. At least, that's what I assumed at first.

This is the part, where I have to ask you to trust me. Because in the chaos that followed, no one saw anything. No one understood it when the younger dragon attacked the larger one, no one realized what it meant. And as I am the only one alive who truly knows what happened, no one believes me.

But you will, won't you?

What I saw that day, was Terrek. The prince of the kingdom, riding a dragon into war.",BookWyrm17

When you think it can't get any worse, and that it's finally over,it laughs at you like Risitas while giving you its parting gift before the clock hits 00:01. In a moment, in a flash, every single person on earth turned into their worse fear, many died from their fear of death, some turned into inanimate objects(and survived this transformation), some turned into snakes  
or spiders, some underwent a change of orientation, then there were the kids, a lot of them became boogeyman, evildoers and few elementary schoolers i knew turned into superheroes because of that adult film they caught a glimpse of.

 Thats right, 2016 gave us giant spiders,a bunch of random inanimate objects,monsters and the list goes on. People started realizing something, what happened to those that feared catastrophes? A meteorite, Yellowstone erupting, our sun going into a super-nova, so many possible phobias of mass extinction. Well humanity was at luck and have my cold catholic parents to thank. The only thing i ever feared was the big Dudes existence himself, quite ironic. 

I could feel the power surging thru my body as the fireworks went off and screams of horror filled the skies.

"[WP] Tomorrow, everyone will become whatever their worst fear is. Arachnophobes will turn into massive spiders, people afraid of flying will become planes, homophobes will be gay. You fear is more peculiar.",Treak13,"The laptop eyed the gigantic spider that stood before it, unsure of what to make of the moment. As far as Clyde could remember, or what he used to be called before  he found himself boxed up as a laptop, he and his wife was sitting down on their couch, watching the new year countdown at New York.

When the clock struck 12 and the ball began to drop, he felt a strange energy ran through his body, resulting in an excruciating pain that almost caused him to black out. He thought he was experiencing a stroke and by the time he opened his eyes, he was unable to move his arms and legs, and the sudden realization dawned on him that he was no longer a human, but the thing that he feared the most: computers.

Opposite him, his wife of 40 years was no longer there, replaced by a hideous looking spider. The spider was screaming in horror at its own sight on the mirror, before Clyde realized that it was his wife, transformed into the creature that she hated the most.

""Calm down!"" he tried to shout through his speakers, over and over, but his wife went hysterics and crashed through their house's windows, out in the night. He wanted to give chase, but there was no much he could do without any legs or wheel.

On the television, Clyde realized that chaos reigned on the streets of New York as well. There was a whole assortment of creatures running in panic across the streets, both alive and non-alive. It seemed to him that everyone was transformed to their own worst fears. A few lucky ones remained in the human form though, and Clyde wondered what their fear could be.

He tried to wiggle and roll down his couch, to seek for help, but no matter how much he tried, he can't seem to move. Trapped inside the laptop, there was nothing much he could do but to go online. Panicked tweets and posts flooded the internet. Those were the lucky ones, he thought, as they were still able to seek help.

Just when he wondered what could possibly have led to these events, a loud voice roared across the sky in laughter, both above him and in New York. It continued for a full 5 minutes, before it finally slowed down.

""So I've heard many people asking me how possibly can 2017 be worse that 2016, and I guess you all have your answers now!"" the voice boomed, before continuing with its laughter. Clyde prayed that everything was just a dream, but before he could even do anything, his battery went down to 0% without him realizing, and everything faded into darkness, saving him from the horror that was about to befall the world.

""What's up?"" I said causally. 

""Nothing special. Its just that everyone's gonna be having a weird future starting from tomorrow."" A face appeared and spoke. With glasses.

""What? Could be more specific and clear?"" I asked politely.

""Yeah Yeah. Classic Tony. Always casual. Umm. The news was that tomorrow is the day where everyone becomes their worst fears""he said. With shiny glasses. 
That is he stepped out of that corner and joined me in the sun.

""Oh really?"" I said. In a bad Hermione accent.

""Dude.  You're a guy. Try to be more cool than casual. Also. I must admit it does make you look a slight dumb"" went the advice of the nerd.

""So what's your fear?"" He continued. 

""Nothing"" I said.

""Come on. Aren't I your best friend? You can tell me already!""he said

This time.  I really got angry. That grammar fool. Who cares about that in the 23rd century? He must be possessed by the ghost of his great grandfather. I said to myself. Like always. I constrained my anger and didn't let it escape me.

""Stop being so annoying! Barky Mark!""

""Dude you know how much it hurts me to hear that stupid nickname."" He spoke with a numb face.

""I'm sorry"" I gave in. His face was really affected by gravity.

""I don't want an apology."" He said

""Tell me your worst fear instead"" he continued. 

Me. Being so intelligent in making jokes. Repeated whatever he said. Which did go by the literal rules

""Your worst fear instead""I said with a giggle.

Something told me this is the end of the line. I saw his face waiting to melt down.
I stood there watching him.
We both stared at each other. 

We didn't stop yet.

We both kept staring at each other. Mocking.

Then we both burst out into laughter. 

""Just tell me. Please"" his face with one of those cute puppy eyes.

""Okay. But first. Do you trust me?"" I asked. With a serious agent K'ish tone.

Just like any bestfriend who has risked his life thrice to save you. He agreed.

""I don't have any""I said. Awaiting his judgement.

""I trust you with those words. But I think it seems you just don't know them yet. Everyone has their worst fears. Mine is losing my family. Friends. And you"" he said. Pulling the young tear back to his eyes.

""So its gonna happen tomorrow? "" I asked

""Yes. And I don't wanna lose you."" He said. His arms wrapped around my back like a pink chimp.

""Don't worry."" I assured him. ""Its gonna be alright"".
At this point. We both were hugging each other tightly and crying.

We parted our ways. Not exactly the opposite direction. He's my neighbor and such. But he went to his home and I to mine.

I couldn't have any food. I lost my appetite. 
""Mom. I'm not hungry Now. I'll eat later. Okay?""I said and went to my room before I Could hewr her reply.

It was too tiring to move my legs.
I cried to sleep. My face pressed against the pillow. My face pointing downwards. I must have gone to sleep due to lack of oxygen or something.

I woke up the next morning. The sun showing me its fresh rays. Just 8 minutes old.

I hurried to take a peek through my window. For Mark. 

All I saw was a poster saying 
""happy birthday Tony. We love you""

He had faked a whole news just to save me from suiciding. Again. For the 4th time.

"[WP] Tomorrow, everyone will become whatever their worst fear is. Arachnophobes will turn into massive spiders, people afraid of flying will become planes, homophobes will be gay. You fear is more peculiar.",Treak13,"It was chaos for but a moment.

Specifically, the moment where everyone on Earth became their own fear. Their phobia. Results ranged from the humorous, such as the anglophobics who were transformed into posh aristocrats, to the disturbing, such as the agrophobics, who became the predators that they feared in their former lives. Those afflicted with bogyphobia, or the fear of the bogeyman, terrorized those that had not been wise enough to fear them before.

There was a tragic irony to some. Beautiful models, afflicted with cacophobia, or the fear of ugliness, became the twisted, hideous creatures that one could not even bear to look at. Those were ugly before, afflicted with Caligynephobia, or a fear of beautiful women, took the on the visage of those models, tormenting both parties on multiple levels of cruelty.

Some people simply vanished. The prevailing theory was that they were afflicted with isolophobia: the fear of being alone. Gerascophobia was another idea, that those afflicted with fear of growing old had become so old that they turned to dust the moment the transformation occurred. 

Ironically, those without a phobia in life were the least well-equipped to deal with the new reality. Whereas those arachnophobics at least had a chance to make it to the jungles and warmer climates of the world, the formerly fearless were more frequently crushed underfoot. 

But as I said, all that chaos was concluded in only a moment. 

Because my phobia was the one that made all others cower. My phobia was the one that allowed me to assert a new order amidst the chaos.

Before, I huddled in my blankets, afraid of the world outside and afraid of the fear that gripped me even there. Now, I look over the oceans and the peoples that are left, and I pity their fear of me, even though I understand it perfectly. No creature, no matter how large or small or deviously ironic, could escape their fear of me.

In life, I suffered phobophobia: the fear of phobias.

Mariko and Satô, Arima's parents, discovered earlier this day that Arima was the main character of a manga. The context outside was really unstable, an alien army struck and invaded the Earth several months before, resulting in a global coalition to destroy them. The invasion was nearly finished and peace would come again but the old man of the village had a vision: the aliens underestimated the Earth and went back to seek reinforcement, they would attack again soon but the young Tachibana Arima would rise and lead the forces to destroy them for real. The old man of the village said that his vision was of a new genre, that everything was drawn and he spoke with a man called The Creator, giving him glimpse of the future.

Mariko and Satô were afraid of what could trigger the rise of their young child, what would lead him to take weapons against the aliens, and rapidly concluded that their deaths could likely be the cause.

""What if we just told him that you and I need to go work together somewhere else and we just let him grow up alone? If it's a shônen, it's legit, look at all the mangas were the main character lives alone just because his parents are working?"" Said Satô

The moon was coming out from behind the clouds, casting it's pale light on the pair of massive, two-story high robot built from a couple of cars, an old army surplus armored vehicle, several tons of discarded factory robots and laser-welding equipment... and a years worth of trips to some exotic corners of the internet marketplace. 

""I'm not gonna let any monsters take you away from me, Airi."" Ichirou promised as they both looked at the product of over a years combined effort. He built the hardware, his brilliant wife programmed everything to work together.

""And I am not letting any slimey beasts lay a hand on you, Ichirou."" Airi promised. She lifted a smal remote and pressed a button, igniting the night with light as the robot fighting suits powered up.

"[WP] Bait the reader into a political suspense, then suddenly transition into a sensual romance.",Xacto01,"Moon light reflected off the cobblestone streets of the small European hamlet. Street lights illuminated every corner; however, shadows still played off the walls as something more sinister thrived through the small town. While most of the sleepy cottages housed loving families and hardworking individuals who strived for a quaint life in the country, one newer building instead housed religious radicals and fanatical tyrants who used the cover of night to plot. With guns and blueprints to the town scattered through the mosques, men with unshaven beards and skin in the shades of deep brown would not rest until they placed the inhabitants under Sharia Law.

Under Europe’s overly political correct and liberal attitudes, they spoke of their plans freely, even in public, for no authority would dare start an investigation against the mosque out of fear of losing their job. So early in the morning of their planned attack, when the moon still hung over head and light just barely touched the Eastern horizon, they assembled in the town’s square, AK-47’s in hand, prepared to slaughter every white, Christian inhabitant of the hamlet who had been left unarmed and therefore unprepared to defend themselves by the hands of their own government. 

“The time to act is now!” Muhammad, the ring leader cried. “Thanks to this stupid country’s lax immigration laws, we may take down every infidel the country hills hide!”

“Oh Muhammad,” one of his supporters, also named Muhammad, replied as he approached his leader. “You have been my rock ever since I first immigrated to this strange, strange country.”

“It is been honor to know and love you,” the first Muhammad replied as he approached the second Muhammad, cupping his face. “When we first came here, you always appeared so timid and shy, unlike the other radicals in our group. I just…couldn’t bear to see you like that.”

“You’ve been so incredible for me,” the second Muhammad blushed. “Thanks to you I finally understand why I’m so different from the others radicals. It’s not that I’m broken or a freak, I just interpret radical jihadism differently from everyone else. And now I know that’s OK.”

Without another word uttered, the first Muhammad met the lips of the second with his own. They shared an embrace which made even the dawn weep as a light rain covered the hamlet. The other radicals cheered their companions as they entangled themselves in a passionate kiss. Water droplets from the skin ran down their faces as they separated for but a brief moment to stare into the deep, Mahogany browns of each other’s eyes. They fell to the hard road and made love right there in the town’s square who’s primal and bestial grunts and ululations echoed through the buildings of the town and even aroused a few couples from sleep. 
After laying their weapons to the ground and abandoning their plans of Sharia Law, they bid their companions farewell, thanking them each for the role they played over the last few months. With a new life discovered between the two, they opened a successful bed and breakfast down the road and enjoyed a new beginning together.

"[WP] Bait the reader into a political suspense, then suddenly transition into a sensual romance.",Xacto01,"Senator Codswallow huffed and puffed up the many stairs to the courthouse. “Too many fucking stairs,” he wheezed. He swung his black leather briefcase out in front of him to counterbalance the mass of his fat ass that tried to drag him all the way back to the bottom of the courthouse steps. His Italian suit already felt slick with sweat. Proceedings hadn’t even begun, but sweat already made his shoes sound like a mashing grapes for wine. “Who put too many fucking stairs here,” he gasped again as he looked up towards the doors.

Senator Fartknocker didn’t answer. He climbed the stairs with a deliberate stride, ascending towards the hall of justice with his mouth drawn in grim resignation. Animal pleasures and pains seemed far away from him, too earthly. “Fuck Codswallow’s fat ass,” he thought to himself. He had himself to worry about. Everything had screeched to a halt since the investigation had begun. The FBI tried to pin everything on him, and he had done everything he could to nail it to Senator Codswallow, who didn’t suspect anything. He thought they were in it together, to see it through, for better or for worse--and certainly for wealth beyond imagination.

The courtroom teemed with reporters buzzing about and flashing each other with their cameras. They knew that they had driven themselves elbow-deep into a honey-pot that never ceased to flow. This case scandalized the nation. No major news outlet ran any headlines besides those emerging from this courtroom. “Chairman Codswallow Sells Nuclear Secrets.” “Senator Codswallow Caught With his Pants Down.” “Fartknocker Implicated in Nuclear Core-sample Scandal.” The reporters had to keep their hands on their recorders and cameras to keep from masturbating themselves to death in the center aisles as the accused men squeezed into the tight crowd.

Codswallow sat hard in his seat on the right side of the courtroom. Fartknocker took his seat beside Codswallow. Their attorneys rimmed the table. They shuffled their papers, arranged their folders, fingered their pens, stroked their ties. Each one looked like a poster-boy for the Harvard establishment: dark hair, glasses, simple suits, expensive shoes, with an air of earnestness and confidence that comes from making obscene amounts of money. They were far more clever than the doomed defendants, but they knew where the real money came from, so they did remarkable jobs for the defense, considering the circumstances. The bailiffs kept the reporters away as they snapped and flashed and poked and tweeted.

“All rise. The Honorable Judge T-Bone Prescott presiding.”

Codswallow and Fartknocker rose. Codswallow’s sweat picked up its pace down the short track of his pudgy nose. Fartknocker gave no outward sign of distress, but his bowels began to squirm  behind his suit like a bowl full of worms. He hated that feeling every time.

The prosecution presented the evidence. They called their witnesses. The defense cross-examined. The defense made their arguments. They presented their witnesses. The prosecution cross-examined. The steady drip of Codswallow’s nose-sweat marked each passing minute. 

He looked sideways at Fartknocker. The prosecution asked far more questions about him than he asked about Fartknocker. Fartknocker didn’t return Codswallow’s gaze. He reached around his attorney, grabbed a notepad and pen, and began to doodle so that he looked like he was taking detailed notes. He doodled the judge forking out his eyeballs in the street. He doodled Donald Duck diddling a dog. He doodled a turkey with a shotgun.  He doodled a monster-truck in a tornado. He listened to the judge as he doodled. He wasn’t getting out of this, even if he didn’t look as bad to the court as Codswallow. 

As the proceedings rolled on, all of the emotions and fear that Fartknocker had managed to choke down began to creep up behind him. Halfway through a doodle of a cat-fight, he tore off the doodle-page and wrote on a clean page:

“Remember what I taught you. -F”

He tore it off and stuffed it into his pocket.

The defense began their closing arguments. The prosecution made theirs. Fartknocker put his pencil down. Codswallow mopped his face. The jury deliberated for 20 minutes. Guilty. The senators already knew anyway. The reporters jerked each other off with their free hands as they shoved cell-phones into Codswallow’s mouth for comments and sound-bites for their blogs. Fartknocker kept his eyes lifted at everyone’s forehead as he walked through the crowd. Quietly, he slipped his note into the bailiff’s back pocket. She never flinched and kept walking. Senators Codswallow and Fartknocker got into the backs of cars and drove off to prison. The bailiff submitted her paperwork and went home.

She had thrown her police uniform over the back of a chair. She lit red candles that reflected off the mirror in the dark, and incense smoldered on the bathroom counter. Warm water filled the room with steam. The bailiff’s right hand traced the edges of the note. The satin fingers on her left hand slid down to feel the heat from the slick mound of her engorged vulva. Her pink lips groaned, “Fartknocker.” She remembered what he had taught her, oh yes, she remembered. He had made himself unforgettable. As she came and came, her right hand clenched, released, clenched, released, oh how it clenched, and she worked the note back into featureless pulp. She shuddered as she finished, and she slid on her back down the cold, wet tiles of the shower that refreshed her flushed skin. She withdrew her left hand and gazed at it, letting the warm water wash away the frothy lubrication from her steaming, quivering pussy. Then she worked the wadded paper again and pulled it apart into little chunks. She got out of the shower, dried her smooth skin, kneaded her perfect breasts lightly with the towel, and wrapped another towel around her raven hair. She threw the paper wads into the toilet, pissed on them, and flushed them away forever.

The Iranians would get the plans. The bailiff, after all, did remember what Farknocker had taught her. He had made the plans unforgettable. She dressed, put on deodorant, grabbed a small backpack, and left. Her plane departed in 2 hours, but she felt no rush.",buttputz

Standing up and coming around to my side of the table. He turned his back towards me and pulled down his pants. In his butt, there appeared to be some sort of tube and what looked like the end of a snake.

“My friends told me nothing bad would happen,” Jack said pulling his pants up.

“Nope. No way in Purgatory am I doing this any longer. The above ground is just filled with these idiots.” I clambered across the desk, standing over the trap door.

""So tell me, 'future man'... who are your targets for this 'kill one, save thousands' strategy?""

""Were.""

He spun around and glared at me. ""Vas that?""

""Were, not are. Your grammar was off.""

He chuckled. ""Ah, so then you'd have me believe that you've already succeeded?""

""With the big three targets? Yeah. They're all dead and gone, the rest has just been bonus points is all.""

""So you say, and yet The Furher still lives. How is that success?""

""Well, for starters, the Furher died long before you were born, the original one anyway.""

The kraut glared at me again. ""Meaning what exactly?""

""The new guy you have, the propaganda painter from Austria? He's the guy that rose to power after the previous team took out Heinrich Stroheim's father. They took out a bunch of other guys too, all the top brass of the 3rd Reich.""

He paused in thought, ""If your first team succeeded so well, why were you and your compatriots necessary at all?""

""Because stopping you bastards from taking over the world wasn't enough. The U.S. took all the worst lessons from you, and perfected them. We had to take out the President that made Hitler and Stroheim look like children with firecrackers by comparison.""

The kraut smiled ""And who was this?... or would it make more sense to ask 'who will this be?' instead?""

""The proper question is 'Who would that have been?' and the answer is Allan Lombard-Miller, elected to Office in 1984. He was the protege of Joseph Kennedy Jr., who was no saint himself. So we came back here, took out his parents. You mighta heard of 'em, Carol Lombard and Glen Miller. We also took out Kennedy, to make sure he didn't steer another special someone down that dark road.""

The kraut sat and smiled. ""That is a very clever and engrossing story my American friend, but... you don't really expect me to believe it do you?""

I shook my head. ""It don't matter if you do or not. The story's served it's purpose.""

Her long black hair was protected by her hood, the lack of sun did nothing for her already pale complexion, and the grey pantsuit she wore was a bit loose on her slender body. She checked her watch again and groaned, ""Why did the bus choose to be late today?,"" She thought aloud. She saw a figure walking quickly through the rain before ducking under the bus stop. Alaina looked over at the man and was struck by the familiarity of his face. He looked back at her and smiled widely, ""Lily is that you? Oh my god how have you been? We thought you fell off the face of the Earth! When did you move to Seattle?"" He said excitedly. 
Alaina looked at the man with confusion and slight fear, ""I'm sorry, you must have me mistaken for someone else. I'm Alaina and I've always lived in Seattle."" She turned her head looking for the bus again, begging for it to turn the corner and save her from this stranger. 
""No, you have to be Lily! Look!"" He said as he pulled out his phone and flashed a picture. Alaina looked and felt her breath hitch in her throat. She was indeed in this picture, along with another female, and the man standing before her. She looked quickly back up to the man and back down at the phone. A sharp piercing pain ran through Alaina's head and she fell to her knees against the hard sidewalk. She gripped her head and let out a bloodcurdling scream. Her nose began to pour blood and she looked up at the man who was yelling for help now. Her vision grew blurry, filled with black dots, and she began to vomit against the concrete. Memories flashed through her head, searing pain accompanying each one like a million knives. She fell back letting rain wash over her face. ""Brian,"" she whispered before fading into the blackness. Alaina could hear people talking around her, talking about her. It smelled strongly of antiseptic around her and everyone seemed to be in a panic. Monitors went off like alarms which only increased the sharp pain in her head. Alaina heard a nurse start to yell and doctors rushing in. 
""She's waking up! Her heart rate has risen dramatically!"" 
""Give her some more morphine, put her back to sleep!""
Everything became hazy again but at least the morphine was easing the pain. She never even realized she had opened her eyes until her lids grew heavy. 
""How could a reboot go so wrong?"" Was the last thing she heard before slipping back off. 

It was two weeks before the doctors let her see anyone. She sat under constant observation because the staff was fearful of what she might do. Alaina had gained her memory back. Her real name was Lily, she had grew up in Brooklyn New York, she had a dog named Baxter, an apartment, and friends. Flashbacks still came to her, especially of the man at the bus stop who she determined was Brian. She looked over at the chair next to her and saw him sleeping, his chest lightly rising and falling with each breath. He came the moment they let him and hadn't left. A doctor knocked and walked in, ""How are you doing Alaina?"" He asked calmly, sitting down in another chair next to her bed. 
""My name is not Alaina, it's Lily""
""I see, so how much of your memory has returned.""
""All of it. Well almost, I can't remember why I forgot everything and moved across the country.""
Brian stirred from his sleep, looking at them groggily.  He snapped awake when he realized what was happening. ""Lily? Are you okay?""
She looked over at the man that she suddenly felt so comfortable with and tears dripped onto her cheeks, ""I'm not sure yet.""
""Here. Maybe this will set things straight,"" the doctor said handing her a file. 
Lily looked at the front and read the bold letters silently to herself, ""Reboot Program."" She opened up and suddenly everything made sense. She remembered it now, standing on the roof top of her apartment building and ready to fall the eight story drop to the ground. Just as she started to step over the ledge a man in a black suit had grabbed her and took her to a government facility. She remembered numbly signing some paperwork and the next thing she knew she was Alaina, an accountant in Seattle. 
""We didn't realize that people from your past or photos of your previous life would reverse the effects, Ala..Lily.""
Lily glanced up at Brian and reached out to take his hand before looking at the doctor, ""Can I go home now?""",Throwaway204655

Your Mission: Infiltrate 'YWN' and reboot every last living member. If you fail to complete your mission, total extermination of your previous family will result. You have 48 hours. 

I had no idea what I was getting myself into. I was 23 years old and I was just rebooted into the body of a complete stranger. Probably an operative of some sort given my certain circumstances. My old memory was wiped and I was given this new life. You only get a new life if the life you take over has already been abandoned. That's how the system works. Nobody ever questioned it.

I didn't know what the YWN was, and I didn't have access to any kind of device to gain Intel. I was rogue without a soul to help me. I thought I'd start by heading down to the nearest library which thankfully was right across the street from me.

Once there I walked in quietly, not to draw any attention to me. Sat down at the computer and started researching. I found out that YWN was nothing to mess with. It stood for Your Worst Nightmare, and their sole purpose was to gain access to people's lives and beat anyone they could, down to rock bottom. Their goal was to make people reboot themselves. They didn't care who it was that they were effecting, they do it because they believe that everyone should only have one life. So they start exterminating. 

I quickly got any remaining information and bolted. Nighttime was upon me and I had to get somewhere safe for the night. There was an old abandoned building down the road a bit so I stayed there for the night. As I lay my head down to rest, I can hear the sounds of the night. As distracting as they are, I close my eyes, and sleep.

It sounds like a goodbye, but should be a hello.

The wide glass wall in front of me eases to the side, smoke billowing out into the room in front of me, granting my lungs and feet passage. I take a step forward and stumble, forced to catch myself on the side of the chamber. Pins and needles, pins and needles. My bones aren’t fully awake yet.

After waiting a moment, I ease myself onto the red carpet and exam the room. It’s large and white and fancy, with a few couches in the middle, and a large wooden table over by the wall. Behind that are three sets of windows each adorned with a strange flag that I know but don’t know.

Turning around, scratching the side of my head, I look at the chamber. It's a thin tube with a faint red light inside. Above it, there’s an old propaganda poster like something out of the fifties. It shows a glum man with his hands in his pockets walking toward a cliff. Then he’s stumbles into the machine. Next thing, he’s totally changed, walking away from the cliff, a smile on his face as he whistles loudly.

Underneath it, printed in proud, bold letters, is a cheap slogan. “**FEELING GLUM? DON’T BE DUMB! REBOOT TODAY!**”

I shake my head as I stare at it, trying to figure out just what the hell it means. I search my mind but it’s muddy. A footprint’s stamped into it, though. Something’s there, I just don’t know what. I doubt I ever will.

Leaving the chamber behind, I wander over to one of the windows. I don’t know what I expect to see but it certainly isn’t this.

Fields of flame roll out in front of me, eating away the buildings, consuming the cars and the streets and the trees. It’s the sight of a ruined world, and standing inside this perfect room, it feels silly. Like watching a movie that you know could be real but shrugging it off because it’s a *movie* isn’t it?

For a second, I don’t believe it, and I’m just considering getting back in the chamber, curling up, and waiting until I wake up from whatever absurd nightmare I’ve stumbled my way into when behind me, the doors open.

“Well, good morning, Mr. President.”

Not fully registering what was said, I turn around to three stuffy men trapped within tight-fitting suits. Their eyes are masked by dark shades—but I can tell that they’re glaring at me. Whatever’s happening out there, *I* caused it.

And their next statement confirms my suspicions, as the middle one furrows his brow and says: “It’s time we clean up this horrible mess you’ve made.”",LonghandWriter

I'll raise your pay, go celebrate and enjoy your success."" The boss pat me on the back with a big grin on his face. It was the first time I ever seen him so happy and so kind, I thanked him profusely and shook his hand. As I stepped out of his office, my sitting colleagues suddenly stood in harmony, they clapped and cheered for me, inside me my heart was beating at the speed of light, all of my emotions have all fused into one, happiness. I finally did it, my video game creation was a massive breakthrough. I punched my fist into the air and screamed as loud as possible. In just days after the release of the game, I had become a star."" Beer and steak for everyone today, I'll pay for it all!!!"" I yelled at the top of my lungs, the rest followed.

Soon it was time to end the day, my fellow colleagues went to a famous restaurant where we had our amazing meal consisting of expensive steak and a soothing beer, all of us wanted to scream but of course, we needed to stay civilized in a high-class restaurant. The television hung up the wall near our table flashed the news of the day, "" The government's newly installed ""Reboot"" program has become a major success, with the growing concern of the increasing amount of victims of suicide, this program has been installed to erase their memories and provide them a fresh start, the suicide rate has dropped massively after this program was introduced, the government is now more determined to help more victims..."" 

""Wow, I can't believe this program worked, maybe one of you are rebooters, but who cares!!"" One of our colleagues spoke as he raised his cup, prompting the rest to smash their cups together, except me. Suddenly, images started popping in front of me, they seemed disturbing, there was a middle-aged man screaming and shouting at a person, swearing and insulting him. Another was that same person, slapped by a slim woman and leaving with another man. It was followed by that person sitting in the cold, with a newspaper to cover him and a cardboard beside him, the scary thing is, that person was me...

"" Stop it....no, I don't want any of this.... AHHHH!"" I smashed the table, both my plate and cup of beer crashed and fell to the ground. There was a minute of silence, everyone, my colleagues, customers and staff all put their eyes on me. I clenched my hair and put my head down, I resembled a scared child. "" Are you okay?"" One of my female colleagues asked, out of impulsion, I pushed her away and left the restaurant, leaving everyone puzzled.

I ran and ran, many disturbing images started appearing again, violence, poverty, even suicide. I kept slapping my face, shaking my head, "" It's not true, it's not true, it's not true."" I kept talking to myself, but it was futile. Soon I was out of breath and sat beside a hard brick wall, I hugged my knees and tears started flowing out endlessly. "" You remember do you."" I looked up and saw a female, about 30 years old, slim, tall with a dominating aura staring at me. "" Who are you and how did you find me."" I spoke softly. "" When you were rebooted, I had a tracking device installed in your body, I have been watching you since that day you signed up for the program."" She spoke, fast and confident, like as if she just read from a script.

"" You mean I'm of those suicide victims who went through that program?"" I covered my eyes with my palm and I laughed, uncontrollably. "" Speaking of the devil, my colleague was right, I am one of them."" The lady squatted and gave me a tablet,"" You're the first subject to remember your past, but we made this tablet in case that happens, eat this and you will never see your memories again."" She handed a small blue tablet to me and walked away, the tapping of her high heels slowly faded away.

I looked at the tablet and murmured,"" Just eat this and everything will be back to normal."" But another side of me did not want to, I wanted to forget everything but I also didn't want to, a small curiosity to discover my past slowly crept up to me. I clenched my fist and threw the tablet away, I stood up, straight and confident, I wiped my tears and cracked my neck. I am not going to run away, I'm going to find out what made me what I am today.

With a quick inhale, my eyes open. Suddenly sound, speech, and feeling come flooding back. Staring around the room, with a slight wah wah wah ebbing in my ears, I remember. There was something important, something I was supposed to remember. Fuck! What was it? 
Damn, oh well.
I load a charger and twist the cap. An elongated hiss seeps from the corners of the canister. Untwisting the cap, I load another as force of habit dictates. Sticking the nozzle into my mouth, I pull the trigger to supply that sweet release. 

In my mind the others are starting to speak. Yes, I know what this looks like. No, I'm definitely still interested in living. After the second inhale, my breathing halts. Slowly as my lungs begin to spasm, I exhale. My chin begins to sag down to my chest.

Suddenly an image brightens my vision. A man. Sitting on a bed. I can see the untidy mess that is my own hair, my slightly hooked nose, streaked with tears. Slowly, I learned. You can't overdose by taking a ton of pills at once, your body just rejects the poison. So I devised a system. 1 pill every 10 minutes, for as long as I could, making my body believe that everything is ok, until it's too late. The whole while, I'm muttering. Some of it distinct enough to understand, even if I'm only hearing half of the conversation. ""It's too late"" I say, through a choked sob. ""I said no! This is ending now! I can't do this anymore"" I can almost hear the voice giving me encouragement, telling me that life is a precious gift. It just doesn't comprehend yet, it will. Eventually.

With a quick inhale, my eyes open. Suddenly sounds, speech, and feeling come flooding back. The ebbing sound of pounding blood fades to quiet. I remember now, I can perfectly recall the wetness that coated my face, the bitter taste of pills on the back of my throat, the voices. It all felt so real. Like reliving a memory, not just a hallucination.

I load a charger and twist the cap. I can feel the frost nipping at my fingers, as the characteristic hiss escapes the canister. Untwisting the cap, I load another as force of habit dictates. And another just for funsies. Once again, I stick the nozzle in my mouth and pull the trigger until my rainbow has splattered across the back of my couch.

Another image exploded behind my eyelids. There's a shitty tv mounted above my bed. Another rerun of Seinfeld plays, as the asshole next to me refuses to change the channel. A man in black is sitting next to me, watching for any movement. He greets me, although his voice feels deadened and hollow. 
""Hey Kid, you look a damn sight better than you did a few hours ago. That's good, real good.""
After a moment or two, my comprehension catches up. ""Why am I here?"" 
""At the hospital? You don't remember?""
""Never mind. Why are you here?""
""Well good question. You're direct, I like that. I was sent here by my department. I'm supposed to offer you a way out of your current situation. After your.. incident, we assumed you might be interested. It's a new program, an experimental one currently, mind you. We take people who've experienced situations such as yours and.. relieve them of their pain. We can make you forget, all of your past worries, your pain. We'll place you in a new career and you can start over.""
""Start over? You mean I can just leave and not look back?""
""Don't get too excited, Kid. Like I said, this is still experimental. We don't quite understand the long term effects yet, although we have some good guesses.""
""I'll do it."" I say. Risk is inevitable, I might as well try. 
The man smiles and stands up. ""Well, that's great, Kid. I'll be in contact later this week.""
He leaves, and I go back to watching the Soup nazi terrorize Jerry. My eyes flutter, slowly sinking into oblivion. I hear a voice echoing in my head. ""Remember kid, remember this. You can escape emotions. Even memories for a time, but your genetic makeup will fuck you every time. And no soup for you...""

With a quick inhale, my eyes open. Suddenly sound, speech, and feeling come flooding back. The slow ebb of pounding blood quiets. Slowly other sounds begin to fill its place. Other voices besides my own. Other heart beats alongside mine.",TheMarshHare

Someone of your status. Well It’s just I’ve never attended to a reboot such as this. And the legality of it all. If I was caught issuing a reboot without one of the patient’s consent, I’d…” The doctor looked between the two patients sitting in the reboot machine., biting his lip as he considered the consequences of his actions. 

“You’ve already received payment for the operation. It’s too late to back out on me now. I just need you to keep your end of the bargain.” The doctor hesitated for a moment before finally nodding, heading over the reboot machine. 

“I just have to warn you one last time Madame. Once you reboot there’s no going back. Your conscious mind may not remember anything but a person’s unconscious mind can only handle a single reboot. Once we’re finished here that’s it. As far as you’ll be concerned you’ll have spent your entire life in the body of the fellow sleeping next to you, and likewise he’ll wake up tomorrow morning thinking he’s spent his entire life in your shoes. The only memories missing will be everything that’s happened within the last twenty-four hours or so. Besides that, you’ll effectively be trading all your memories and your body with him.

I nodded, hardly paying attention to the doctor as he repeated the same warning I had heard countless times before by doctors unwilling to go through with the reboot. But this was finally the one. There was no going back. As I heard the soft sound of the reboot machine starting up I lay back and braced myself for what came next. As I began to drift to sleep I turned my head to look towards the weak figure sitting next to me. A raspy cough caused him to roll over in his sleep but he didn’t wake. I knew he may never wake, and it was for that reason I came here, to give my son the chance at life he deserved. 

I didn’t know for how long I had slept, but when I awoke I found myself in a hospital bed, dazed and disoriented. As I returned to my senses I heard a voice shouting, across the room. 

“Madame! Madame!” It was that voice that finally brought me back to reality. I hadn’t been rebooted. I was still in my normal body. Rising out of the reboot machine I marched towards the doctor, demanding to know why he hadn’t gone through with the procedure.

“Madame! I told you the mind can only go through a single reboot!  Any more and you’re putting not only your own life, but the life of the other patient on the line! You’re lucky I detected signs of a prior reboot in both of your brainwaves before I went through with the procedure!”

Those words hung over me, freezing me in place. I looked to my son, only six years and yet already his weakened body struggled to hold onto life. There was only a single person in the world who reboot into the weakened and dying body. I thought back to the words of the doctor. Once you reboot yourself you’ll never remember your old life. I could only manage to bring a single word to my lips, knowing it would never be heard by the dying figure sleeping before me.

“Mother?”

I tried to put my most sympathetic face on. I do sympathise with her, but I hated to notice that she'd been talking all this long in our thirty-minute train ride. What could I do, she's the Section Editor, my boss, sort of. I've had to do all sorts of cajoling, girl-talk and flattery to get work that is less taxing. I leant on the pole, remembering why exactly I chose to become a journalist.

The coach was rattling coming out of the tunnel, we were now on the Manhattan Bridge. I look out of the window for a second or two and gaze at the mighty Brooklyn bridge that lay straight ahead. A sort of rush ran through me, why did this all look so oddly familiar?

""Lisa, I swear if Aaron doesn't propose to me this Valentine's I'm gonna-""

Suddenly Sally's voice turned into a subliminal echo at the back of my mind, I felt like I had been transported through a timeless space. It was dark, but I could feel the strong gust of wavy breeze on my face. I was grabbing on to something metallic, maybe a railing above me. There was a wall of fencing behind me on which I was leaning. My hair was fluttering gently and some of it sticking to my face. I open my eyes.

I see Brooklyn Bridge in front of me and the roaring waters of East River below.

""ANN!"" a familiar voice bellows in the distance.

""Ann! Listen to me."" another voice calls out, concerned, this time it was nearer to me, perhaps just above me. 

""You don't have to do this, there are other ways out of this. You can get all sorts of help""

A sailboat is slowly wading through the water below. The river seems less violent, invigorating my urge to jump. Two men are carefully coming down from the pavement above, each on my side, as if they were wolves about to pounce on their kill. I let go of the railing above me, but one of the men grabs me by my belly. I shriek, I kick, I cry to no avail. 

They've got me, and now they're going to reboot me.

I come back to senses as quickly as I went out, Sally was staring at me, unsettled.

""Lisa, you know...if my talk bores you, you can just tell me""

Lisa. Ann. Elizabeth. Joanne. Who knows what else I was in the past. Reboots always happen to the same people. They can hope to assimilate people into their new identities and plant false memories into them, but they can't kill what drove them to kill themselves. 

What drove me to kill myself? I was fucking bored, I have BEEN fucking bored for years. I must have started at 14, I must be fucking 30 now. Each time they give me the same old menial job, a paltry amount of money, monotonous false memories. It takes me a while to get back to my senses, my original self, but it happens alright. It has happened just now. This time it was quicker, took me a few months, it seems like I'm getting good at this. It seems more fun than ever.

I apologise to Sally and carry on the insipid talk, I'll go to work today and at night I'll jump, or try to jump, or jump at the right time. Then, I'll get rebooted into a new life, a new name, a new job. I can only hope it's not boring this time around.

"[RF] Carrie Fisher: ""No matter how I go, I want it reported that I drowned in moonlight, strangled by my own bra.” - write a story/article/report about it",kerayeu,"Carrie had established herself well on the ISS, not only as the Queen of everything Nerd, but also as a seasoned purveyor of the astronautical arts. Her bunk-mates had not been so kind to Carrie during the events that proved the Hollywood Actress was much more than a simple actress, she was a Space Mermaid. A fantastical being that transcended all laws of gravity, gender, and decency. The crew that was assembled from various nations and marketed as top notch for this mission were hardly qualified to interact with such a starlet, let alone bunker down and try to expand humanity. From the onset, global humanity wasn't sure if a mission to distribute the spread of humanity across the universe was worthwhile to pursue. 

It was only when the re-population program began to advertise the chance to procreate with your favorite celebrity did the experimental program gain real traction. I mean, what was your life worth in exchange to sleep with Leia Organa birther of Jedi? That was where the real problem began, the logistics of the grand design accounted for too many oven units and too few batter units. It shouldn't have came to a shock to the executives that the oven units were disposed of in riotous conditions. If all individuals could not access the oven, then it was deemed too selective and a threat to humanity. Even though the weeding out of exclusive ovens was never seen as that.

It was Carrie's first day on the ISS as she strolled along the main hallway finally enjoying herself after the hangover caused by adjusting to life in zero-gravity. She had come upon an intersection leading to three different sections of the ship, Mess Hall, Recreation, and Medical. The rumbling in her stomach told her it was time for some food. The gravity boots supplied by the ISS were getting her around the ship no problem so Carrie thought it was time to refuel so she could keep the exploration going. 

As soon as she strolled into Mess Hall something was off. She had been briefed that an adjustment with a new population was happening. What wasn't said was that the onboard population was jumping by a hundred residents from the meager 20 it had to 120. All of the empty tables and chairs that Carrie had taken for granted were now filled with men. ""Odd"", she thought to herself, ""the male population went from 10 to 100....and I'm only counting 10 additional oven units"". Maybe it was true, that men were the gender crazy enough to hop on a cannon ball for sex? 

As she filed down the line adding each food item to her plate her mind wandered onto various topics ranging from mate selection, offspring rearing, and generational integrity. It all buzzed through her mind as she tried to enjoy her oats with raisins &amp; brown sugar. Humanity had lost hope but Carrie hadn't lost her sense of taste! The thoughts guiding her actions began to take a very morbid turn. There was no way the current ratio would work. Carrie had signed up to handle her fair share of the re-population effort and save humanity, but foul play had to be at work to admit such a circumstance. The amount of semen generated every few hours alone was way above the threshold permitted by the safety council's standard. 

As Carrie walked towards the exit of Mess Hall was when things took a turn for the worst. The flaws of the architects grand design shown through and it all started with a pick-up line. ""Hey Easy Bake Oven! I could feed you something to satisfy a hunger that comes from your loins!""

Not too be controlled by a mouth breathing breeder our beloved Carrie shouted back, ""I've been known to be a vegetarian for a long time and as it stands I'm not interested in any appetizers, especially a cocktail wiener!"" As soon as those words echoed through the Mess Hall hell in space broke loose. Trouble was the architects had not planned on a mixture of men who couldn't simply treat women as breeding objects and those that could. It was almost orchestrated, the way chaos unfolded. A ring of batter units surrounded Carrie and kept her away from the rabid and manic batters. 

""My name is Cal, I will get you out of this. This isn't what you were promised!"", said the man who controlled the unit holding a perimeter around Carrie. ""This was a test and it unfortunately took you for a fool. Damn Project 2016 has bested some of the world's greatest. Gene Wilder had fell for it hook, line, and sinker."" Here was Carrie Fisher, caught in the midst of a deprave scheme. As Cal ushered her down the hallway he was very gentle. ""I do not take pleasure in this"", were his last words to Carrie.

Cal peered ominously towards a evacuation cell. The shouts and struggles of the savages behind Carrie were drowned out by the sounds of her transition. The clicks of buckles buckling, the sound of the vacuum pressurizing, and the roar of the afterburners of the pod. It was too late when the alarm sounded. Cal had heard the sound before when he lost his own mother in the same procedure. It wasn't lost on him.

As the pod thrust-ed away from the ISS an oxygen line had fed gas into a combustion chamber that was meant to reduce the severity of the reaction. This malfunction fed an explosion that rocketed the pod Carrie was in towards the closest Sun, Denarys 316, and on her ride towards it her pod was pulled apart. It turns out the designer for Carrie's underwear didn't take the Carbon B-12 warning when designing astronautical undergarments. As she drifted lifeless towards her space crematorium she was fully exposed. Drowned in moonlight, strangled by her own bra. The weight of it crushing her ribs and puncturing her lungs before she was turned to ash. ",ConfoundedPermanence

Tonight we unite”

Perfectly timed, the first rays of sunlight broke over the moon’s horizon, invigorating Mylenith with magic powers no midichlorians could explain.  She wove the moonlight into a bridge descending to the earth.  She looked back at the crowd of characters and made the staircase a bit wider.  Headed by their queen they descended down to earth. 

“Oh my gosh, there's Carrie Fisher!” said a seahorse.  

“We are 40,000 ft up” reasoned Mylenith, “There is no way you could see her from here”

“No, in the airplane,” pointed the seahorse. The characters leaned over the railing for a better view.  Mylenith created a bridge to the airplane.

Carrie Fisher glanced out the window, then did a quick double take.   

“Attention Carrie Fisher,” Mylenith realized Carrie could not hear inside.  She handed a walkie talkie to a ghost who went through the plane wall to deliver it to Carrie.  
“Attention Carrie Fisher,” Mylenith continued. “We are the lost characters of Star Wars, those forgotten by creators obsessed with your franchise.  We are written in stories never read and sketched in drawings never shared.  
I, Mylenith, am queen of the Moon-Folk.  We lived on the far side of the moon, a land more fleshed out and vibrant than your expanded universe.  Our author sent us on riveting quests and adventures. Until one night in 1977, our author saw Star Wars and forgot about us.  Now we open our cities as sanctuaries for other abandoned characters.“

“I’m so sorry” whispered Carrie. She wiped a tear.  “You must be so lonely. What can I do to help?”

The characters did not know.  They were unaware Carrie would feel bad, let alone help them and were stumped by her offer.  After many exchanged whispers, a fairy stepped forward.  He spoke.

“Could she come to the moon with us? We could show her our gardens and cities, and tell her our stories.”

“Why I would love to” Carrie said. “Is that possible”

“My bridge will not hold you” lamented Mylenith.  “We cannot bring you to the moon.”

“Perhaps not in my current from” Carrie striped herself from her body and reached toward the characters.  Her bra clung longest,  it sprung back around her neck.

“No! We could never ask that of you!” Mylenith shouted.  

Carrie reached for the hand of the fairy and took Mylenith’s in the other.  Her serenity radiated from a broad smile.

“Let me come with you,” Carrie said  “I want to hear your stories.”

[TT] The generals meet to discuss the terms of surrender.,poiyurt,"Jarl Congrad stood beside the remains of Doterra's once expansive armies, frown etched deep upon his face.

What had not even a half-season past numbered well into the tens of thousands, was now nothing more than the ragged dregs and weary. Reduced and cut away by battle after battle upon the Southern Plains of the Western Wastes, holding to perhaps a a generous tenth of its former standing. Truly a disturbing contrast to his own small force, which while not numbered far beyond several hundred- had never done so, escaping yet relatively unscathed during the fiercest fights of this terrible war.

As such, unrestrained glares settled on his clean and immaculate steed, narrowing like drawn bows towards his gilded leather and polished armor: Anger clearly and loudly proclaimed, even with the silence of his approach. The butcher's bill had come due and been collected, and it was plain to see Jarl had let others pick up the tab. 

How much of that was luck, skill, preparation or simple circumstances- he knew none of those tired and hateful eyes would care. To the many soldiers who had fought and died on the Southern Campaign, Jarl and his army were nothing but a motley gaggle of cowards, walking in on a hard-won and bloody victory. A gallant leader marching at the head of a great band of cheats.

Yet Jarl approached all the same.

He'd prepared long and hard for the campaign, knowing full well the dangers. How many times had the Church sent men North to die in vain? How many had succeeded in returning? Let those ignorant eyes watch and loath him all they wanted, Jarl had kept his own alive, and they had accomplished the tasks assigned to them without assistance. On their own Northern Campaign, Jarl had not possessed a Great and Ancient Dragon to pave a path through his enemies, nor armies of trained soldiers by the thousands. He'd had his wits, his resources, and the preparations made by his own coin and effort.

Marching upon the meeting of Generals beneath the Dark and twisted Tower of the West, it was in this manner Jarl and his entourage held their chests proudly. Be it himself, the Baron, the many Mages or Warriors in his company; Jarl was confident that none who had been a part of the journey felt their survival anything but rightfully earned.

""So he finally arrives!"" A loud voice boomed over the bloodied steps of the blackened spire. ""The Unscathed Genius of the Northern *Legion.""* The Sarcasm dripped like venom from a viper's tooth as the cold hostility of Men at war turned itself to stare down upon Jarl's approach. ""And here I thought you might continue your leisurely journey among the wastes for another few days, and let us clean up the mess ourselves.""

The cold laughter did little to lift what flicker of spirits remained. Eyes settled to blank and thousand yard stares, looks as if to pull daggers from their belts on a moments notice. To think this was the great meeting of war heroes upon a victorious campaign and crusade. Had he not known it well himself, Jarl might call the proposition mad.

""Paladin Clark. A pleasure to see you've survived."" Dismounting his steed with a dignified grace, Jarl responded with a slight and regal bow; indifferent to the glares which directed themselves upon his person as he left the horse in the waiting hands of his attendants. Alone he approached the gathering settled upon the Great Tower's Base, silence greeting both his back and his front as frosty glares exchanged between the parties.

Tensions, even in the final days. It was just, he supposed, considering many of his men were little more than criminals in the eyes of Holy Justice. Sheltered and protected criminals, enlisted carefully beneath Jarl's own service.

Almost unwillingly, his eyes followed up towards the four compassed peaks, squinting in the late-afternoon sun to witness the frame of an Ancient Drake settled on the Eastern most portion. It seemed scorched and smoldering with flame, but in the manner of a fight long since won- and no longer waged.

""To see you joining us at last... By the Light I'd say you've made better time than I'd ever expected for someone of your *reputation.*"" The Large man of white armor and cloak gestured absently at the rough congregation now setting camp among the masses, Jarl's banners lofted over the horses and carriages to billow quietly in the wind. ""It's a shame you were not here to share in the glory of a true victory, Congrad.""

""I have accomplished was was asked, both in arrival and in my original orders."" Jarl smiled coolly, bowing once more as his right hand let itself lift away in a grand gesture of respect. ""All in service of the Holy Church, of course. May the light shine upon you.""

Paladin Clark eyed him with barely contained venom, face contorting at the perceived mockery beside the rest. Finally, like steam vented from a pipe of cast iron, his expression cooled to reach a simple reply. ""Indeed. May it shine.""

It seemed to suffice, even among the many other worn and exhausted faces. Young men outnumbering the old by a great margin before Jarl's eyes. It seemed there would be a great revival of the Guard, saying they all made it back to the Eastern lands alive. Promotions were commonplace after a victory like this one, considering how many open positions suddenly needed to be filled. The Church coffers would be resting happy and heavy on their return.

Dead soldiers don't collect their pay, after all.

""The Dragon has dealt with the Dark Mage's own General upon the Spire's peak, and their Orc-bodied armies have staggered themselves into hopeless routes."" Clark's stern voice returned, sneer fading off in the strict face of his responsibilities. ""Our remaining archer Squadrons will deal with them by the week's end, we have several cavalry units drawing and harrying them towards the slaughter as I speak.""

""Their numbers?"" Another asked, sword shifting on their hip.

""Down to the mere hundreds, barely a chief left among them.""

""It is done then."" One of the rare few men present with gray upon his face and beard spoke, eyes peering from beneath an open-faced helm of worn and dented steel. Paladin Clark nodded once in reply, before speaking with pride.

""It is. The war is won.""

Jarl watched a collective sigh of both relief and grateful respect seemed to settle over thick shoulders and heavy armor. An odd wave, not of substance, but of motion itself. Some of the men bearing witness bowed deep with murmurs of prayer right then and there.

As it seemed with any among the Faithful of the East, Doterra's Holy armies were little different from the rest. Gods and Light, prayer and thankfulness above all else. An unfortunate rift of separation.

With little hesitation, Jarl turned to leave.

""So you leave us?"" Clark's voice rang out, rage once again returned to a boil upon his words and spittle. ""Does this great victory mean so little to you? Does even god's grace hold lacking value to your heathen eyes, Jarl Congrad?""

""You declared this campaign finished."" Jarl turned back, catching sight of the many faces now watching him once more. Clark's massive figure seemed to have puffed up larger still beneath the polished breast plate of silver steel and crest- anger pressing him as if flame to air. 

""Have you no respect for the dead?"" The hatred seethed with every word. ""Your blood runs cold as your father's, already rushing back to your forsaken lands in the North."" 

Jarl's smile wavered, however slightly, glare settling on the Paladin's face with a cold expression void of any discernible emotion. 

Finally, he replied. ""Yes."" Turning back to the waiting camps distant the gathering of important men and polished armor, back to the company he had arrived with. ""So it is that you understand why I must now take my leave.""

Spit hit the black and bloodied stone beside their feet, cloud of dust lifting from its surface as if a single drop of tainted rain. Still, Jarl carried on, letting his steps take away the reach and close distance to the gathering of rank. It was finally over.

""Faithless Coward!"" Paladin Clark shouted again, fist slamming against a thick breast-plate.

Jarl's steps carried him further, back towards his waiting men. Each one of them watching with grim faces, anger rising among their own ranks.

""Run off and cower! Cower in the North with the filth and the Bloody Baron!"" 

Jarl stopped, eyes held tightly closed beneath the pounding of blood in his ears. The ever-powerful force of logic had fixed him cold, tying him and dragging him down the path he'd kept, but in this moment he was tempted.

""Mage or not: You stand for nothing! Your blood is damned *Congrad*! Damned, just like that Bastard and the whore who spawned you! You abomination!""

Sorely tempted: More tempted than he ever had been to live up the the cursed reputation that proceeded him. To prove to them, all of those men with their divine purpose and faith- the sheer truth of his blood. The Lineage that they spat upon to casually. The long traced curse back to the darkness which haunted the world over.

So it was that he held in place as if balanced on the edge of a wicked sharp blade, drumbeat of war and chest drowning out almost everything else. 

Almost

For in that instant, Jarl could hear a message whisper. A strange a terrible voice of quiet suggestion, eyes watching from a shrouded distance. 

Passive and ancient, it smiled at him through the wizened face of deception as it spoke softly in his mind.

*Kill them.* 

*Kill them all.*

[WP] A politician performs the first freestyle rap filibuster.,poiyurt,"Bernie licked his lips viciously; he motioned for his assistant to bring him his chapstick, but it was too late. The beat dropped like a bowling ball on jupiter, deep and heavy. Bernie cleared his throat, gave his lips one last coat of saliva, and spat some facts from his solar plexus:

***The evidence makes it evident that the only reason this man is our president is because redneck confederates got wrecked by repetetive rhetoric and unedited ediquitte so they think they'll benefit from this shit head being elected.***

***Now i'm not gonna stand up here and say that he's the son of perdition, but I might if I had a little more wisdom. He doesn't understand the system like he claim's, don't you know everyone's insane? Nobody understands it! Don't you know it's everyone's first time on this planet!?

Then he picked the mic back up because he remembered it was a filibuster and so the point is to stall democracy by nonsense, so he started taking topics from the crowd to freestyle about. 

He's been freestyling since this day, and that's the reason Trump still hasn't been brought into office, even though it's been 300 years since he won the electoral vote. Bernie looks like a corpse now, but he knows that the future of communism lies on his shoulders, so he refuses to die, pure willpower pumping through his brain, keeping his lips moist, wacking it to BBW porn.

"[WP] An artist with amnesia reviews thier work not knowing it is theirs, how would they react?",ringkun,"""What about this one? Tell me what you see"". 

The psychologist lifted a rectangular piece of cardboard from the desk. On it, was a miniature painting of what appeared to be a train steaming into the distance, seen from behind. Swirls of light and smoke cornered the edges of the square.  

""Train. Smoke. Boy waving farewell to his mother. Look ma'm, what is it exactly you want from me? You gotta give me something"". Sat in a comfortable armchair, Louis had been uttering his frustration in a heavily-Americanized English. Yet, you could hear the broken French tonalities in his accent. 

""Louis, I would like you to tell me how this makes you feel. Your wife tells me this used to be one of your favourites before the incident"" 

He was starting to get aggravated. In addition to the troubles of amnesia, Louis was starting to feel nauseous. Right now, he couldn't care less about some glossy artwork with half-edgy meanings. 

""You won't even tell me where those paintings are from, how am I supposed to evaluate them? Surely one needs context to ascertain their worth!"", he said, crossing his arms over his chest. 

""Ah? Is that so? Are you saying Art is best measured in ignorance?"". The psychologist was feeling an opening here, and she would be damned if she wasn't going to exploit it. Louis Brassière was a world-class artist, or so the books said. Surely toying around a little was a good trade. Who knows, maybe she'd get a good story out of this. 

""I see the reflection of a miserable artist's soul, trapped in his own creativity, recycling the same patterns that you've been showing me in the last four cards. I see the epitome of lazyness. What I see annoys me, and I would now like to move on to something else, which preferably won't involve taking another set of pills."" 

He was right where she wanted him. 

""You do realise these are extremely famous works? The world at large sees them as a container of dreams and emotions"". And there went the emotional card. She re-adjusted her seating and joined her hands. 

""What do you make of that?"", she whispered. 

""People see what they want to see. Ask a teenager they'll tell you the same""

Now was the time. 

""Louis, those are your paintings""

He grabbed the armrests on both sides of his chair. His mouth opened, but he closed it swiftly, without uttering a word. 

A smile formed on his lips. 

""So, doctor, are you telling me that I am a world-class artist?"" 

""That is correct. Louis Brassière. Amnesia resulting from a drug OD in Singapore.""

""Tell me doctor, is my wife pretty? Do I own a blazing sports car?"" 

The psychologist had a puzzled look on her face. 

""That is quite right... But of little relevance..?"" 

He had her. Right where he wanted her.

""In that case, you must be telling the truth. Only a true artist would manage to make a fortune, living it up whilst selling THIS crap"". The nausea had gone. 

He stood up from his chair, picked up a pen from her desk and scribbled something on the paper rectangle. Louis then proceeded to the door. 

She remained silent for a moment. Then, then looked at the painting once more. In the bottom right corner, was the artist's autograph.

"[WP] An artist with amnesia reviews thier work not knowing it is theirs, how would they react?",ringkun,"She walked back and forth, endlessly, tirelessly, and I resisted the urge to place my hands on her shoulders.

""This place,"" she said, ""I know it.""

She stood before the canvas. The white walls of the gallery were covered with them, great sheets of fabric and the paints that covered them in turn. She reached out a hand but paused.

""Lille. It's in France. We went in the Summer."" I took her hand in my own and let it rest against the canvas.

She closed her eyes, fingers running against the valleys and rises of paint and pastures.

""In the Autumn you walked the Highlands."" I guided her to the triptychs. Each grew darker as the leaves fell away and the gloom entered her world. ""We knew there was something wrong. When we got home, the doctors found the tumour.""

Nothing was said. The loss of a woman was in those three paintings. By the end the strokes were angry. Care had gone, only a furious rush to finish what couldn't be finished.

She pulled away from me and covered her face. I didn't go to her. I couldn't, because I had. A dozen times I'd tried and each time it was like starting with a blank canvas.

""Winter,"" I said.

The canvas was bigger than any of the others. It stood huge and proud, the wooden frame propped against the wall, taller than I was wide. The white, the beige, the pale colours of stone and emptiness filled it. A thousand strokes of the brush and not one was visible against the other.

""I loved this one the most."" I bit back the tears.

""It's dead."" Her voice was quiet, but close.

""No. It's not.""

I stepped back. She was there, looking at it. Searching. I reached for her hand and she flinched, but I tried again and she let me.

""You were empty you said. The colour was draining away but you wanted to paint. You wanted to remember."" Our fingers found the two small marks. Grey against cream. They were holding hands in silhouette. ""You wanted to remember them,"" I said.

""Us,"" she whispered. ""I don't remember.""

""I know.""

""I want to.""

""I know.""

She'd never come this far before. She would leave me in the Autumn and never pass Winter. I lead her to the final canvas. It sat and she saw.

Bare.

I handed her the brush.

""You made me promise. You made me promise that I would make you finish. This is your Spring.""

""I don't know what to paint. I don't know how to do this!""

""I don't either."" I took her hand, let it rest in the paint, and we raised it together. ""But we'll learn.""

She made the first mark on the new canvas, the first fresh memory and she smiled.",Dachande663
[WP] You are unknowingly playing a video game with Kim Jong Un. After the game he adds you as a friend.,sekketh,"I have the best job in the military.
I had always been an avid gamer and spent most of my time on my computer when I wasn't working. I had just arrived on station in the Republic of Korea,  when during a rather chaotic black ops 3 zombies game, I noticed that one of my teammates had a funny Korean accent. I had learned Korean in prep to my PCS and talked to plenty of native speakers in the sed, so I when I say the accent was funny I mean that it was not a modern ROK dialect. This guy was good regardless of his overly formal speech and he saved me on more than one occasion during the game. 30 rounds in finally we met our fates, the match ended and as we said our goodbyes he sent me a friend request which I gladly accepted.
The next morning I arrived at work only to be greeted by my supervisor, flight sup, first shirt, commander, a ROK entourage and several people in civis. It turns out I had been playing COD with non other than Kim Jong Un and rather than punish me for it, I was going to be transferred from working services to a special assignment as KJU's new best friend online. I essentially get to play games all day and while the Air Force records every interaction I have with him.

[WP] You are unknowingly playing a video game with Kim Jong Un. After the game he adds you as a friend.,sekketh,"I didn't think it was real. Hell I still don't think it is!

I mean I play a number of online games and of course you have your share of ""cleaver"" assholes who try to say they are this guy or that. Or try to be edgy by putting their flag as North Korea or somehow making a home made nazi flag with some in game icon maker and put their screen name down as ""xXx_NAZIHITLER_402KIlLA!!!_XxX"" or something.

So when I was playing with a guy who had the North Korean flag and user name ""KIMJ-Un"" I just rolled my eyes and figured ""What ever"".

The guy was good. I mean he was a good team player and most matches him and I were the top players. He friend-ed me and I was like ""Okay sure.""

But then the gifts came. I never told him my address or anything but these expensive items were sent to me. When I came on he would ask if I got them and if I liked them. I said sure. He then said something about how I should come and hang out with him. I was a bit weirded out but I was 25, wasn't like I was some 12 year old about to be kidnapped by a pedo or something. I was like ""sure...""

Two days after that while walking to the 7-11 some assholes pull a bag over my head, shoot me with some thing that knocked me out!

I woke up in a nice looking room with Kim Jong fuckin Un sitting there. He said he was sorry about how i got there but he knew there was no real way for me to get to him unless the CIA got me to do something to him, like the movie ""The Interview""!

He took me on a tour of some places. I have to say the place is a shit hole and I feel bad for the people here but like hell I am going to say anything to his face... 

Then again it seems like he really wants me to be his friend! While we walked into one of his many bunker/fortresses I made a comment about this really cute girl in a military uniform. Before I knew it he makes her my ""pleasure girl"" and she lives with me and we have sex a lot! 

I been here for like four years now... Ji-yeon my former pleasure girl now wife is preg with our second child and we are living the life of pretty high up government officials. When ever I ask Kim about maybe letting me go home he seems to get up set, buys me a number of expensive things and tells me that ""Things are better here"" and then gets me to play another match of a game with him.",BooDoug187

He knew why we where here, the question I wanted to ask and the answer he would have to contemplate. He had the power to give us what we wanted most, a child. He knew I loved him so much, but that between the two of us he was our only parent.

My lovely wife, age 37, and our daughter, 9 months old, are being placed into a medically-induced coma after being made aware of a massive tumor on our child.

The doctor says as long as she remains in her mother's womb, she should be alright. They've brought in medical professionals to analyze the situation, but not because this situation is unique. 

Every single attempted birth after 3:14 AM, December 30th, 2016 have shown the exact same symptoms, and nobody knows why. The date is currently May 17th, 2017. We conceived before we knew about this situation.

Scientists have been claiming it's due to a virus genetically modifying the babies before they were born, but conspiracy theorists have a theory that actually makes a bit more sense - the world has a total capacity, and it cannot be exceeded.

In January of this year, a mass shooting claimed the lives of 28 people. Simultaneously, the tumors of 28 babies cleared up and they were delivered without complication.

Believe me, I'm the last person to give any credence to conspiracies, but with what I've seen and actively see, it's hard to dismiss this.

I slide my drawer open. The metal sheen of my father's army-issue M1911 glints back at me.

Death was pretty immediate, but my mind still worked for minutes after my heart stopped. I saw my whole life, beginning to end. It was weird, though. In my last moments, I swear I could hear the phone ringing...

Typical that the orphanage would get your birthday wrong. Still you waited. Almost a year later the mark cleared to reveal just one letter 'A'. 

Sites have existed online for years now to help people find their other half so you head to a coffee shop and log on. Eventually you come across the matching username; a man looking for 'Tallow' which you know as your own username. He is four years older than you and lives in the purple district. Five classes higher than your own grey district. You'll be out of place visiting him but that doesn't deter you. You're determined to see this man despite being seen as a peasant by any purple class citizens standards.

As you knock on the door of his house a neighbour yells at you to go back to your own district and quit begging for money and then the door is opened and the most beautiful looking man you've ever seen stands before you. Glaring down at you. 
""What do you want?""

""You're looking for Tallow?""

""Get inside before anyone sees you.""
You shuffle inside and the door is shut. The two of you make your way into the kitchen and he offers you tea, your preference is coffee though and so you decline.
You both sit on the couch and try to get to know each other.
There's not a single thing that you can agree on and almost every single word either of you says sparks a furious debate. The rights of the classes in each district being the worst argument amd frankly you're scared to mention that you're an orphan.
You're sure he's going to kick you out when he snaps. You feel sure your other half mustn't be your true love but you can't bring yourself to think the man your nemesis either. Each time he argues he gesticulates in a way that makes you admire his hands. Each harsh word sounds beautiful from his lips. His cold stare is something you can't look away from. He is everything you imagined your other half would be if that person was your true love and everything if they were your nemesis. 

""Is it possible..."" you begin slowly, mouthing the words in silence to test them before voicing them out loud, to make sure they come out the right way. ""That your true love is also your nemesis?""

I see nothing, I feel nothing. Hours pass or maybe minutes I'm not sure. One sense is still going strong: I taste metal. Whomever's blood I drowned in needs to scale back on the iron. Blood! Did I even have time to get out of the bathroom? It all happened so fast. But what happened so fast? I guess I'll never know. Death doesn't seem so bad. 

Pain! Suddenly my head hurt like I'd been smacked by the sharp side of a shovel. Did I even have a head anymore? This was so confusing. A ray of light! That's a good sign! I mean I think it's a good sign I guess I don't really know. I can see an image forming now, fuzzy though it may be. Ouch! I must still have a head because I definitely still have eyes.

"[WP] ""The worst part wasn't the screams, it was the silence.""",BellLabs,"Have you ever watched a horror movie? If not, get a life. If you have, then you know what I'm talking about when I say that terror is relative. Fear is something... Simple. We understand fear, we can fight fear. Fear is what you feel when the monster jumps out at you from behind the corner, screaming bloody murder.

No, the worst part is never the screaming. It's the silence. The quiet moments where the main character is creeping slowly down the hall, every footstep and muffled sob marked by another beat in the music, tense, their eyes darting in every direction as they and you await the monster you know is waiting for you in the darkness, behind you, above you, behind every corner and door.

You know that fear is coming, and there isn't a damn thing you can do to stop it. That... That is the silence. *That* is terror. If you're lucky, you're never cursed with it. If you're not, then it haunts you.

In every nightmare, you're walking that dark hall again. Every time your mind wanders too far, it finds itself holding its breath in silence to hide from an unseen monster in the dark. When you walk alone, it is with light and hurried steps, just in case it is back. Every time you blink, the world goes dark and you scream inside out of fear.

*Terror.* You can't run from it. You can't hide from it. You won't even be able to try. Everywhere you run, it is towards it. Everywhere you hide, it was always there, waiting for you.

And...

So am I.

So please, try to run. I might even let you get away. But when you do, you will know that one day, in the quiet of one tranquil midnight, you will awake in a cold sweat, and see two cold, empty eyes staring over you. You don't know when I will find you, and you can do nothing to stop me.

Run. Hide. Scream for me, and I will make a symphony of your agony. Muffle your cries, and I will smile from the shadows, and listen to the masterpiece I have crafted from your fear, and your terror.

After all... The best part is never your screams. It is your silence.",SilhouetteOfLight

He expresses his pain in loud screams, As he tries taking the knife away from me, one of my wild flaying hits cuts his throat, as I feel feel the blade sliting through his neck.

"[WP] ""The worst part wasn't the screams, it was the silence.""",BellLabs,"I never thought it would happen to me. No-one thinks so highly of themselves that tragedy would walk upon them. That they’d be forever memorialised as the youth with a bright future taken too soon. I screamed at first. Everyone in the library did. 

It was unexpected. A movie moment. The bullet leaving the barrel with a bang we all had heard before — on tv, on the news — but never expected to hear ourselves. It hit a shelf of books, ruffling the pages and making the metal shelf sing.

*Bang. Ruffle. Ting.*

Now, myself and a few others stopped screaming. Shock set in and I ducked behind a shelf. Hearing nothing but screams and my own erratic breathes. On the floor, back pushed into the shelf, the shooter was behind me and out of sight. If I couldn’t see them they couldn’t see me. Still, I could hear everything. The shooter’s slow walk. The heavy stomp of his steel capped boots.

Bullets fired out methodically. Sometimes I could just make out plaster breaking from the wall. Sometimes it was a softer, organic squish followed by a body hitting the ground like a rag doll. Almost everyone had stopped screaming by now. The foot steps close behind, sending that odd tingle through me. As though death had begun whispering in my ear.

Then, there was a girlish squeak. The sound of a sob racked ‘please’ as she knocked into furniture. It scraped against the tiles. A hand readjusted itself on the trigger. 

Bang. Shlick. Thud.

Silence.

The worst part wasn't the screams, it was the silence. The worst part was hearing death calmly walked towards me.",dreadful-mary
"[WP] ""Death walked in, put down his coat and set the kettle to boil. He was home.""",BellLabs,"Two black figures sat alone in a crumbling house somewhere in Limbo. The first figure looked vaguely like an aging man in his sixties. The second had yet to fully materialize. It was almost New Year's Day.

The first figure spoke.  

""Being Death was never my strong suit. Nothing really was.

""My first day on the job. Every year a new Reaper is chosen, a new Arbiter to decide who leaves and who stays. Of course, no one likes the job. Who else can you blame for your loss than Death himself? Who wants to stand around in Limbo waiting to register a client for eternities on end?""

The second figure nodded, the shadows of uncertainty swirling around it. It looked shaken, a thinner mass of black to its counterpart's deep dark grey. The first figure continued. 

""Anyway, my New Year Eve's party went great. I was sixty-five and partying like I was twenty. I might have drank the sea. Then *boom.* Heart attack. That's why I never drank at work.""

He stood up to get some brandy from the fridge. The figure opposite to him stared silently.

""I remember being rushed to the hospital, followed by the figure that would become my mentor. He just stared down at me, searching my face for the Mark. This one,"" he tapped his forehead. ""The one that sets us apart. The one we search for all year.""

He paused.

""My predecessor, 2015's Reaper, was direct, aggressive, and efficient. He sat me down in this very house, more like a shack at the time, and taught me how to be Death. Be polite. Be courteous. Never be late.""

He glanced at the living room. A line of photographs stretching out for infinite lined the walls. Nearest to him was the photograph of his mentor, still faded after he had gone. His own photograph was still clear, but, like all the other previous Deaths, it would fade as the year went on.

""I remember every one I have ever taken. My mentor, the actresses, the musicians, the actors, the cooks, the politicians, the criminals... Everyone. I never knew why, but I did. I put on my trenchcoat, set out into the light, and ferried people into the afterlife.""

The second figure started to open its mouth, but could not speak. The old man chuckled.

""Of course, I don't remember you. I don't remember New Year's Eve, and I don't remember bringing you here. But you'll remember. And in the afterlife, maybe I'll remember you.""

Suddenly the old man, now full corporeal, stood up. The figure, the new Death, followed suit. He opened the door of the almost nonexistent room.

""I'm ready now. C'mon, I'll show you how it goes. Your first Reaping's always the best.""

Somewhere, the sound of a clock rang out. One, two, three, four... twelve.

""Don't worry. You'll do great.""

The next day, a shadowed figure approached a familiar spot in Limbo. There was a new house where the old man's had been.

Death walked in, put down his coat, and set the kettle to boil. He was home.

"[WP] ""Death walked in, put down his coat and set the kettle to boil. He was home.""",BellLabs,"Home was an amorphous concept for Death. It was usually nestled somewhere between the twelfth and thirteen dimension of the cosmos, but it was known to wander, depending on its mood. In this case, it had curled up behind the twenty-sixth to nap in the drafts electromagnetic radiation.

Death sighed as he approached the door of home, which was raised sleepily upon recognizing its master. “Come on, open up,” Death requested tiredly, dusting the discarded entropy off of him in a few careful shrugs. 

Home opened wide. Death walked in, put down his coat and set the kettle to boil, letting home permeate into the fibers of his being. He was home.

“You’re early,” Life said, disentangling herself from infinity. Her eyes sparkled in time. 

“Just tidying the space,” Death explained, flopping down into a local energy minimum. “Doesn’t take so long to extract the entropy these days. It’s maximal in almost all dimensions.”

“Things are simpler now,” Life agreed, settling in beside him. 

“They’ll be simpler still, in not so long,” Death said. “Although, I think home won’t be happy when I sweep up them electromagnetic current outside our door, but home can find some empty corner of space to settle down in entropic bliss.”

 “How are you, my love?” Life asked.

“I feel better now that I am with you,” Death smiled. He grabbed her hand to place to his face, letting her infinitude shudder through him. “I love you.”

“And I you, for eternity and infinity,” Life smiled. Her smile faltered, refracting broken light from the current beyond and exciting loose photons into higher energy states. “There’s something I need to tell you.”

The kettle began to whistle, expanding and contracting in the vibrations of spacetime. 

“One moment, my dearest,” Death said, standing up to retrieve his infinity. The eternal vapors soothed his mind. 

Life followed him, knotting lower dimensions without thought through her twisting fingers. 

“Now, what is it?” he asked, stirring his infinity.

“It’s important. I think you may want to be sitting down,” Life said. The fabric of the cosmos caught between her fingers was wearing thin.

“My dear, what is ever the matter,” Death asked. He could not settle into a local minima, even with his infinity but found himself exciting to higher energy states.

“I’m pregnant,” Life said.

Death stuttered, and the cosmos warped. 

“How?” Death stammered.

“Well, it is what happens when two concepts intertwi—,” Life starts, blushing magnetic fields heavily.

“No, I mean, how will this work?” Death asked. “I am entropy. You are eternity. We are opposed.”

“I don’t know how it will work—,” Life said.

“Permanence and impermanence cannot coincide!” Death declared.

“We do,” Life whispered. Tears of gravity fell quietly. “Don’t we?”

“Yes,” Death said, matching her tone softly. “We do.” He hugged her; the convulsions of eternity weak against his chest.

“Perhaps, our child, it will begin through time,” Life said. “And it will end through entropy.”

“It will die,” Death said. 

“No.”

“Because of me.”

“No.”

“Like waves and particles. Nothing can escape my push toward maximal entropy,” Death said.

“But it will live, won’t it?” Life asked. “It will have a beginning and an end. It must. It will have both of us.”

Death held Life’s hand, intertwining their time and space. “Things won’t be simple,” he said.

“No,” Life said. 

“I suppose that’s okay. Simple is boring anyway,” Death said.

Life smiled through her tears, enfolding herself around Death.

He kissed her gently. “What will we name it?” Death asked.

"[WP] Why does the Grimm Reaper carry a scythe if he's only an escort? Well, you have died, and you are about to learn why.",Ford9863,"Dying wasn't how I thought it would feel. I had always assumed that the process leading up to it would be painful – and it hadn't been, I had died peacefully, in my sleep – but that the actual *dying* part would be easy.

Nope.

Dying was the most painful thing I have ever experienced. It was as though my consciousness, my soul, as though *I* had been ripped from my body; in that moment, I felt all the pain that I had ever felt in my life; every scraped knee, knocked head, kidney stone, a surgery, a few broken bones, everything. Even the times when the heat or the cold reached unpleasant temperatures.

Do you have any idea what it's like to experience all that pain, the stinging, searing, dull, sharp, aching, tender, hot, burning, intense, stabbing, tingling, throbbing, all at once?

That was a metaphorical question; of course you don't. There's no way you can until you've experienced it for yourself.

After, though, it was as you would have expected. I felt nothing, at least physically.

Emotionally, I felt all kinds of things. It was not as peaceful as people like to think.

I felt sadness, relief, desperation, empathy for my family, dissociation, in varying patterns or simultaneously.

There was no shining light or darkened stair to greet me; there was only the world, just as it had been, but without me.

And then, Death came.

His presence was not a one of disconcertion as I had expected it to be. Instead, it was one of comfort.

Despite his undeniably frightening appearance – the black hood, the skeletal features, the scythe – having another, one that knows what he is doing, one who has walked this road many times before, one who *understands,* is a very comforting thing when only moments before you had felt as though you were all alone in the world.

""Hello, Thomas,"" Death had said. ""You can come with me now.""

We walked out of my bedroom, through the front door, and into the street, and began walking on the sidewalk; it was dark out, and in my quite, suburban neighborhood, there was no traffic. We were alone.

""How far do we have to go?"" I had asked.

""Not much farther now,"" Death had replied. ""We're almost there.""

""Where is there? Am... did I get into Heaven? Is it even real?""

Death looked at me with a deep sadness that I firmly believe is unique to him; it is a type sadness that no one else ever has or ever will experience, the type of sadness that you can only experience after having watched all of humanity die and then go to Heaven or Hell.

""No, Thomas. You did not worship God, and as a result, your life was full of too much sin.""

I took a few moments to let it sink in, and we walked along, slowly, in silence. Death didn't seem to be in any particular hurry.

""What's it like?""

""Hell? Not at all what mortals believe it to be like. You will not feel the pain of torture in a realm of fire and brimstone; not in the way that you think. You will feel the weight of guilt that can only come from a lifetime of sin. Even if your sins were things that you do not feel to be wrong now, when you reach Hell, you will fully realize the wrongness of them all.""

""But, in the bible, it describes Hell as fire and brimstone and Heaven as pearly white gates and stuff like that.""

""Merely analogies; the horrors and the pain of Hell and the bliss of Heaven were related the best ways that our Creator knew how.""

""Oh.""

I thought it over a while. I could see what he meant, and though I didn't want to believe it, I knew it to be true. Death did not seem like the type of person to lie.

""How do you do it?"" I asked after a long silence. ""Is everyone treated this way? Is it only you?""

""It is only me and the countless souls that I have guided. Everyone gets the same treatment as you are. I do it without the constraints of time; the time I have to escort everyone is limitless and without direction.""

I looked around for a while longer. I wasn't ready yet, and I think Death knew it.

I was reminded, then, of one of my favorite poems:



*Because I could not stop for Death –*

*He kindly stopped for me –*

*The Carriage held but just Ourselves –*

*And Immortality.*



*We slowly drove – He knew no haste*

*And I had put away*

*My labor and my leisure too,*

*For His Civility –*



*We passed the School, where Children strove*

*At Recess – in the Ring –*

*We passed the Fields of Gazing Grain –*

*We passed the Setting Sun –*



*Or rather – He passed us –*

*The Dews drew quivering and chill –*

*For only Gossamer, my Gown –*

*My Tippet – only Tulle –*



*We paused before a House that seemed*

*A Swelling of the Ground –*

*The Roof was scarcely visible –*

*The Cornice – in the Ground –*



*Since then – ‘tis Centuries – and yet*

*Feels shorter than the Day*

*I first surmised the Horses’ Heads*

*Were toward Eternity –*

It seemed so appropriate, the perfect, succinct description.

""What's the scythe for?"" I asked, eventually.

Death looked at it for a time; he seemed to want to word his response perfectly.

""The afterlife does not consist of just angels, demons, those with eternal life, and those damned to Hell; there are also those who lurk on the edges, some simply waiting for nothing in particular, some preying on passersby.

""It is not for me to speculate, but I suspect that they are those who were damned to Hell, but, because they did not knowingly sin or did not sin as badly as others, were let go, were allowed to leave Hell after a time and be not in bliss nor in torture, but to merely be.

""The malicious ones are the ones who are not happy to just be; they are the ones who feel as though anything is better than nothing, or the ones who feel as though they deserve Heaven and can trick God into letting them enter with the soul of another.

""They do not realize that they cannot have any soul but their own, and that they cannot trick God, who is all powerful and all knowing; these ones are often damned back to Hell, having failed their one chance at any type of freedom, relief, or redemption.

""The scythe it for protection against them, for myself and for the ones I guide.""",keyboardtoscreen
"[WP] Why does the Grimm Reaper carry a scythe if he's only an escort? Well, you have died, and you are about to learn why.",Ford9863,"""You're dead, my boy. I know it's a shock, but-""

""No, no, I'm fully aware that I'm dead. Very few men win a headbutting competition with a train. That part isn't interesting anymore.""

""Then why is it you refuse to move beyond?""

I look at the figure in his black, billowing robes. His skeletal hand clenched around the haft of an ancient looking scythe. That damned scythe.

""It just makes no sense. You're a reaper of souls, not wheat. Scythes are terrible weapons against anything but a phalanx, and they're nowhere near as efficient as something modern; like a gun.""

""Guns lack subtlety.""

I laugh, I don't mean it to sound unkind, but even in death I'm apparently still a sarcastic prick.

""Yeah, nothing says subtle like a six foot stick with a three foot blade stuck on the end. You're the picture of quiet efficiency."" He, They, It, starts to speak, but I barrel through, ""All I'm trying to understand is why you went with a scythe.""

Now I'll tell you honestly, I'm no expert at judging the expressions of skeletons. That said, I had a sneaking suspicion that Death was exasperated.

""Are you truly postponing the afterlife solely to question my choice of implement?""

""Well, I've always been the inquisitive sort-""

""Obsessive, I'd say.""

I make a noise of irritation, ""If I bother you so much, just answer my hopefully-not-damned question so I can be on my way. Why the scythe?""

Death... Sighs? It's a sort of vague whistling sound. ""If you want to know the truth, I took the scythe from a book.""

""A book?""

""Yes. A book. Have a good laugh."" Death, apparently, can be a bit defensive.

""Well,"" I ponder, ""Was it a good book?""

He smiles, the rictus grin is as horrifying as you might imagine, though still somehow comforting. ""The best. You see, there was this author, a wonderful author. I got to meet him not so long ago. He always told such beautiful stories. In one of them, he talked about me. Not as villain, or monster, but as someone simply trying to do their job. He made me feel..."" Here, the ancient and unknowable being pauses a moment, considering his next words.

""Meaningful.""

""But that makes no sense at all,"" I interject, ""he wrote that book based on the popular image of you. He can't have influenced you to create the image he based you upon.""

""Whyever not?""

""Because it violates causality. It destroys the laws of physics and reason. It makes no fucking sense.""

""Young man,"" the being speaks slowly, as though to a particularly dim pupil, ""I am a talking, animate skeleton. Do you really think your rules apply to me? He wrote a story which I enjoyed, so I took steps in order to ensure that the story would happen. It's quite simple.""

""Now,"" he says, ""it really is time to be going.""

I blanch, sarcastic or not, cocky or not, it seems I still fear death.

""Can I... Can I have just a few moments?"" My voice shakes, betraying my terror, ""I'm not really ready to move on just yet.""

""No one ever is,"" Death's voice is soft, kind, ""neither is the wheat ready for harvest. At the end of all things, all either can hope for is...""

I grin despite myself, finishing his sentence as the scythe descends.

"[WP] Why does the Grimm Reaper carry a scythe if he's only an escort? Well, you have died, and you are about to learn why.",Ford9863,"“Do you have a face under all that?”

I've finally worked up the gall to ask him--is it a him?--after several minutes of silent plodding. Our pathway is gray and foggy, the landscape dotted by occasional trees that all look as though they've been struck by lightning. Repeatedly.

By way of answer, he turns his head completely round backwards without pausing or slowing his movement forward, and pulls back his midnight cowl.

If I was still alive, the sight and smell would completely turn my stomach. His head is sprinkled with a handful of long, greasy black hairs. His face still has skin, but it's stretched thin as paper, the bones of his skull visible beneath it. There is a festering hole where each of his ears should be, and the flesh of his neck is melted and gnarled. His lips are sunken and dry, pressed together firmly. Two withered eyebrows roost over the rotting remains of two eyes, something behind them gleaming an unsettling red.

He yanks the cowl down. It’s probably my imagination, but he seems to pull it more tightly about himself upon seeing my undisguised disgust. 

“Sorry,” I mumble. And I mean it. I don't want him to leave me alone in the mist.

I let a few minutes of quiet pass again, following him step for step. Eyeing the scythe he carries tightly in his right hand. This is admittedly beginning to make me nervous.

It's wickedly long, the blade curving the length of a man's body, and shines even in the dim light of--wherever the hell we are.

I jog a little to walk beside him, feeling slightly ridiculous in my bloodied yellow tracksuit--I was thrown fifty feet by a Prius while out on my morning run--“Why do you carry that?”

He glances at me--so far as I can tell with the cowl pulled low again--and I think I see the hint of a grin on those withered lips. 

I've upgraded from nervous to unsettled. I fall back again, letting him walk well ahead of me, just far enough that I don't lose sight of his pointed black figure. My hands are shaking.

The mist. His rotting face. The scythe. Should I even be following this person? In life, I'd heard of the Reaper, but everything from my time alive is fading at an alarming rate. I struggle to remember how folklore painted him, desperate to figure out whether he's trying to help me or if he means to slaughter me at the end of our little trip. (*Again?* I don't know how it works now. I've stumbled and stubbed my toe twice, though, so I know that I can still feel pain, in any case.)

He appeared by my side almost immediately after I felt myself separate from my broken body on 14th Street. The world around us began to fade to mist and cold, barren ground, with those strange, twisting trees. Back then, it seemed natural. Now, I have too many questions.

I slow my pace even more, weighing my options.

I can keep following him to whatever strange place he wants to take me--and maybe find out just what he carries that scythe for--or I can see if I can find my own way...though admittedly, to where, I don't know. 

I decide on a little of both--I keep him in my sights, but I start to wander away from the pathway, trying to find any sign of a landmark, anything I might be able to sneak away to and think. 

And right as I step off the path, I see it. A faint blue light, shimmering through the mist about a hundred feet away. 

I glance over my shoulder at the Reaper,who hasn't slowed down at all to accommodate the distance between us. His hood points ahead--there's no way he'll see me. Or so I hope. 

I start to make my way towards the light, anxiety and hope both building as I lose sight of the Reaper, who is still steadily trundling along. 

As it grows brighter and closer, hope starts to outpace anxiety. Whatever it is, it's emitting a soothing warmth. I'm almost there now. 

I barely catch the sound of the Reaper’s feet pausing on the trail. My heart starts to pound, and I pick up my pace, running quickly and silently as I can towards the blue light. 

And pull to a screeching halt as I see its source, choking down a scream. 

Several hundred human bodies of every age, race, weight, and height imaginable are joined together with what can only be called an enormous worm. Almost every one of their mouths is stretched into an identical long silent wail. At the head of the worm--its flesh deathly pale and damp and wrinkled and burnt in long swaths, I’m assuming from head to tail--but the end of it is swathed in mist.

From the end facing me dangles a long, fleshy cord, a dim blue light hanging from it like a bulb.
Completely silent, it advances towards me, blue light swinging.

Too terrified to scream properly, I hear horrible gasping and choking noises falling from my lips as I turn tail and sprint away as fast as my legs can carry me. A glance over my shoulder reveals that the worm is impossibly fast despite its size. The people hanging from its mass flail uselessly, their wordless shrieking more animated, jaws spreading wider. As the beast grows closer, my occasional backward look shows me that all of their throats are knotted with bulging veins. I realize to my panic that they are trying their hardest to make a sound, and nothing is coming.

This realization gives me the burst of speed I need. I see one of those blackened trees up ahead. If I can reach it, if I can climb it…

*Fuckfuckfuckfuckfuck*

I just barely stop myself from skidding into the tree as it comes more plainly into view. It’s made of something sticky like tar, something that oozes thickly as I approach. A thin new branch bursts from its trunk, reaching towards me rapidly. I barely manage to leap out of the way as it swipes for my ankles. It shivers and solidifies, then crumbles to dust.

Meanwhile, the worm has caught up to me. It slithers quickly towards me, its blue bulb curling upward into its head, leaving everything in the same dim, gray light that covers the rest of the landscape. 

Thinking quickly, I feint for the tree, running around it in a circle, suddenly intensely grateful for my religious schedule of morning runs. (Why did I stick to it so solidly? There’s a murmur of something, some sort of health thing, but it’s already lost along with the rest of my memories.) The worm follows my feint, racing towards the tree, heads and arms now focused intently on me. Eyes sweeping, hands grasping at the air in my direction.

I dance as close the tree as I dare, watching as a new branch forms from the trunk and begins to wind towards me. I jump out of the way again as it reaches for me, hoping that it will accept the substitute I’m leading into its path.

At the last moment, when it realizes I’m going to run out of reach too quickly for it to reach me, the branch changes direction, plunging itself into the worm.

Blood spouts from the worm as it writhed back and forth in pain. The branch swells and throbs, drinking deeply. The sight roots me to the spot--there's something primal, horrible, about it. The heads of the worm flail in panic, trying to escape their fleshy prison. Their frightened faces make my heart squeeze for a moment with doubt,  wondering if the fate I've just condemned them to is even worse than being joined together with the worm--

Until the flash of a long, curved blade cuts through the mist, and the heads of the worm begin to fall off, one by one. 

I step back, watching as the Reaper swiftly beheads dozens of the bodies, their heads rolling, sometimes even bouncing away several feet.

Then, a branch from the tree begins to form, searching for him, and he steps away, out of its reach. This one doesn't wither, instead straining against its limits, quivering with what seems to be agitation, wanting desperately to reach him. 

He stands aside as the tree continues to drain the blood from the deflating, flailing worm. The faces still left on it are contorted in terror and agony. The heads on the ground, I notice, are slack-jawed, but their empty expressions and staring eyes hold a kind of relief. 

After a few minutes of silent watching, during which the worm is drained to less than half its original size, the tree so gorged that it has turned a vague crimson color beneath the tarry surface, the Reaper turns to me. 

The red glimmer behind his sunken eyes twinkles ever so slightly. 

He turns to leave, to go back to the path. 

I follow close behind. ",letters_to_deaf_ears

I had been looking over my body, laying lifeless with the handle of the scissors sticking out of face. ""Dont run with sciccors"" said a calm, sarcastic, and raspy voice. ""I guess i shouldnt be one to judge. Im only here because im Gods cousin, i never even got to die. But, no end is a good i say. Come on now, ya ol' fat cattle, weve got an escalator to get to."" *Tink* *Tink* *Tink* He clicked his scythe three times onto the wood floors and turned walking. He had seen similar scenes before.

He wore a hooded black robe and i thought i had just thought the word reaper-, ""yes i am,"" but began to say it outloud. Could he read minds? Is he Spiderman? Where are we going? He remained silent to my thoughts, i can now gain dominance.

""Yo, whats it like up there?"" i asked. ""Dont worry about it,"" he replied. ""Whats Satan like? Is he cool or is it really just pain down there?"" he chuckled, ""Luci's a cutie. He couldnt handle splitting a 10 dollar Jameson bottle with me, youve got nothing to worry about. Ive read your file."" ""So yall get drunk out there? Is it like a staff only party or...?"" ""It is staff only, but ill get you in sometime. Jesus throws the best parties! Fucking fratboy, lol.""

The reaper looked down and reached for his phone in his pocket, fished it out, and began tapping its screen. I though as to what direction this escalator was going. ""So is it up or down? And how deep is this incline? Musnt be too deep if i cant tell which direction it goes. Trust me, my depth perception is crazy good. I could draw you the tip of any mountain, precision accuracy. Well, thats if i could draw that good. Is it good or well in that case? Oh well. Ha! Or oh good, am i right? By the way, ditch the stairs and get some sort of love seat or a futon. I once had a futon, then my dog puked on it while that threesome was happening. And then i puked on the stairs that night, because the fucking Sky vodka happened. Actually, these arent even stairs, its like a drawn on illusion. Fuckincg DEPTH perception! Where am I? What if i just run off since theyre even on a leveled surf-""

*TINK*

The scythe cracked the floor again. ""Listen, you gotta pay attention. Stay focused and we'll go somewhere, you know what i mean?"" I nodded, ""Good, now go ahead and ask me something since youre not getting the point to this on your own."" I asked what i had to, ""if you get drunk with god and them, do you just pee through your pelvic hole thing? And now, double question, a two-for i guess, how do you even digest liquor toxins to ge-""

*CLING*

He slammed the scythe on the ground and his voice grow impatient, ""This is your one time right-now, and it lasts about 15 minutes! Everybody else usually goes through their pasts and weigh out the bad from the good within 3 or 4 minutes, and poof! they fade into their decision! But you just had to be this person! Ive dealth with mental disabilities in my time, and ive read your file, i know you havent got any, so how?"" ""What?"" ""How are you this fucked?"" ""When i was less than 1 my mom went on a plane to Florida and the attendant dropped a whole cup of orange juice on my head."" ""That couldnt scratch the surface,"" he sighed. ""Also,"" i stated loudly, then so shyly it creaked, ""Im just- youre literally my biggest hero."" 

He looked at me, first time i saw his face, just a skeleton smilling as much as a skeleton could. ""A lot of your type dont like me, they always try to run,"" he turned to me and leaned against mid-air and continued, ""Its not stairs because one guy ran down them while we were going up, he just rolled down stairs constantly going up. It was so funny that God let me keep my job even though i laughed for a good 3 minutes."" I interrupted, ""Maybe he thought it was moving down and was excited to go to hell, i think? Or maybe he couldnt handle having died and stuff"" ""You humans are so sensitive with owning things! Its my land so lets fight about it! Its my chicken waffle sanwich sp lets fight about it! Its my body, so lets fight about it! Did you know crabs just ditch their shells? No, that could be lie. But we drew the stairs because it gives the same effect as either up or down. Also, try walking out of the stairs we drew."" I pushed my arm to where he leaned and felt a wall. ""Thank you Windex, that shits almost not even there.""

*Tink*

""Heavens awesome, Hells fucked but youd enjoy it. Ive read your file. And by the way, up, down, left, right, theyre all the same so dont sweat it, youre dead. Anything else you wanna know? Weve got like a minute before you just end up in Limbo."" ""Whats with the scythe since youre not the one putting scissors in my face?"" 


He laughed, something sweet and sincere like rain in mid-spring. ""The staff,"" he said removing his hood where light shown brighter than birth did, ""is to get attention back from scatterbrains like you.""",MooseWithARoom

"[WP] Two Twin Brothers were both born with the exact same superpower, but it makes one of them a superhero and one of them a supervillan due to their perspective on the power.",FoundTin,"I walked out of the burning house. A body wrapped in a blanket in my hand. I had rushed as fast as I could but I could not save the guy from burning. Thankfully, he was not dead. With his face burnt and his left side charcoal black, I wondered if he will get his life back. Will this fate break his spirit? 

The firefighters waited outside. They hurried to take the young, limp body from my hands. A couple of them thanked me. But for better or for worse, people kept some distance. 

I am a pyromancer. So is he, my twin brother. The one who started this fire.

We had lost our parents when we were very young. It was our uncle who raised us, helped us in getting us on our feet. I was always a god fearing decent kid. My brother wasn't so. He always was cunning. He always had a trick or two up his sleeve. Since, we looked exactly the same, most of the times he set me up to take the blame for his actions. 

My uncle was the only one who could see through his charade. He used to get him for all the wrongs he used to do. He began hating our uncle. He always wondered how could that old man get it right. Always. I guess raising two kids helps you understand the tiny nuances about them. Your instinct tells you who is the culprit. 

I still remember that day when all went wrong. It was a winter night. It was very chilly outside. It was just the three of us in the house. The mercury was dropping very fast as the night deepened. It was very normal for us to light a fire during winters in those days. My uncle got the fuel to light up the fireplace.

I still don't recall how it happened. Did my uncle fumble with the lightbox or was it a deliberate action on his part. I was sitting on the sofa watching my uncle set up the wood in the fireplace. I was tightly wrapped in a blanket. Slowly, my eyes were beginning to shut. I almost fell asleep when I heard a loud scream.

All I could see was a human figure. Ablaze. I cried in horror and jumped from my seat. I threw the blanket aside and rushed near the fireplace. The flames had completely engulfed my uncle and there was a callous smell of skin burning. The shrieks of my uncle were deeply unnerving. Without a thought, I scoured for the blanket I had frantically tossed away. I threw it on him in the hope to stop the fire killing him. All I wanted was to stop those orange flames to leave my uncle unharmed.

And then it struck me. It was like a lightening hit that buzzed my core. I could sense each and every flame as it danced on my uncle's body. I could sense each of the tiny sparks flourished on his limbs. I could feel the fire as if it was a raging, untamed beast. A part of me, an instinct told me that I could control those flames. Those burns and progressions felt very tangible. In an instant, I tried to stop the fire. To extinguish it, I put all the effort I could. But it was not easy. It was as if some other force was trying to control the flames too.

Then I saw him. The sight of my uncle burning was so panicking that I had forgotten about my twin. I looked around and I saw him on the other side of my uncle. Whatever had hit me, had hit him too. I could sense him trying hard to fuel the fire to rise it to consume my uncle. I could see the vicious rage in his eyes. I could see the firelight dancing on his face and his staring, wide eyes. It was as if he didn't even notice me. The same sight which made me distraught, somehow liberated him. I could see his eyes feasting over the horrible scene as if feeding on it. In the next instant, as I saw him, he saw me too. He felt the fire same way as I was feeling. He could sense what I was trying to do.

The next few seconds were agonizing for both of us. He was in a frenzy. He tried to stoke the fire as I tried to stop it. We both were equal. Our strengths equal. The only unfortunate thing, I was late. When uncle's scream waked me, he was already on fire. Within a minute, my uncle's screams stopped. He had won.

He came after me the next second, only to realize that he could not burn me. It was the same for me too, I couldn't hurt him with fire either.

Even today, I hold myself responsible in a strange way. I...I feel, I could have saved him, I could have stopped my brother. To this day he finds the fire liberating. He is the number one arsonist on the loose. I, his twin brother, always find fire nurturing and caring. I try to stop him as I can. 

In our battle, the world burns. The scales are somewhat tipped in his favor, for like the first time, I am always the second person to arrive at a scene and as the world would have it, starting a fire is far easier than completely extinguishing it.",vaikrunta

[WP] You head to work as a mortician and realize you've accidentally been dosed with LSD.,Psynomad,"'Ring ring' the alarm clock goes off. It's barely 6 in the morning and I'm still sleepy but I have to get up because I cannot be late from work, not again. 'I better make coffee' I think of myself while I'm putting on my black suit. Bedroom door creaks a little when I open it and head to the kitchen. Morning sun shines in from the windows and exposes all the dust floating in the air. I measure just right amount of coffee and water to the coffeemaker. Soon the smell of coffee fills the room. I pour my cup full of coffee and take short, savoring sips from it. 

It's 6.30 am and I have finally finished my coffee and done everything else necessary. Surprisingly I also found my car keys immediately, which never happens. The moment I open the door I hear birds singing and gentle warmth of summer. It makes me yawn. The moment I open my mouth I feel something going in, but nothing appears to be there. I go to my car and turn the engine on.

'6.45 am' says the clock of my car. I'm going to arrive in time, yet something feels off. I hope I'm not coming sick. In no time I arrive to the parking lot of my workplace. Today I'll be working in some kind of chapel in the middle of cemetery. 

I step off my car. Colors seem brighter and more intense than normal. The moment I open the gate to the cemetery I see someone staring at me further away. I move couple steps forward and look behind me. The gate is no more. When I look back in front of me there is no one anywhere to be seen. Only tombstones after tombstones. 

'I have to go to the chapel to get some help I think of myself. The chapel lies in the middle of the graveyard. I still can't see it which is weird because it should be visible all the way from the gates but I decide to follow the paved path that leads towards it. 

As I walk the path I see the ground move all around me. I'm starting to panic badly when suddenly apple trees begin to grow all around the graves. One in front of each tombstone. The trees appear to have lots of big red apples. The smell of cinnamon fills the air. I decide to pick one apple and taste it. The first bite tastes like an apple pie. The second bite tastes different, like cucumber. The last and third bite tastes like rotten eggs. 

Suddenly the season changes. The trees die and drop their leaves. The air feels cold and windy. It starts raining really heavy. The ground gets muddy and starts to move. I can suddenly smell death. The coffins are exposed and I can see skeletons in the ground, moved by the mud. I start hearing weird voices. The deceased are slowly rising from the mud and they start staring at me. I start running away. The dead don't seem to be too fast but they approach me slow and steady.

I run and run and run. The graveyard seems to never end. I'm getting more and more exhausted and slower. They start to catch me. Finally I collapse to the ground. They are getting closer and closer. What can I do, what are my options. They might just be imaginary but I don't want to face them. I see a rock nearby. I crawl to the rock and think for a moment. They are getting really close of me now. I start to bang my head to the rock. Once, twice then third time, always harder. I can feel something already touching my feet when I hit my head to the rock fourth time. Then it's just blank.

I wake up from the rock. It's summer again. I check my watch. It's 7 pm. Apparently no one noticed me lying there because I was out of sight. I'm relieved that it was all just hallucinations. I will probably be fired from my job because no one will believe my story, but at least I'm alive and life is not just a nightmare. That's all that matters now.",Writing-stuff

""That is my business,"" gruffed the fairy. ""You say you want love and luck. Well, anyone 'you' love, shall be bestowed with luck,"" promised the fairy, ""But, you can't have both for yourself.""

""I choose love,"" the girl quickly answered, but a sly grin grew across the fairy's face. It wasn't a happy grin.

""Whomever, 'you' hold in your heart, will benefit, indeed,"" she grinned, and then she was gone.

The years passed and the girl almost forgot about the fairy. She had some boyfriends along the way, but not much luck in love, until she met the man she would one day marry. 

From that day forward she realized what the fairy meant when she said her wish might come true in an unexpected way. And by her own choice, ""I choose love."" She would never benefit from having people love her, but rather the people she chose to love would benefit. 

...and they did...benefit.

So much so, that after many years, she began to choose poorly and men took advantage of this choice. Some men did not return her love, but rather wrapped her up in a non-gilded cage and presented her devotion to them ...to the world.  

She became lost...as lost as you can be without ever leaving where you are. She made some terrible choices in those years, but many people benefitted. 

She had gotten exactly what she asked for...luck and love. Only, she was not receiving either of the two, and something happens to a person after that long in a cage. 

When the caged bird no longer sings, because it has no more love in it's heart, and no chance of flying free...what happens to that bird?

As the girl was losing all hope, her mind contemplated her options. She had a choice. Who could she love, that would set her free?

The problem was that everyone seemed to benefit from her, so she trusted no one.

...and that was it. No one. No one else, but her.

She would love herself.

The girl began to love herself and choose to hold herself in her own heart.

As the days passed, a small gold key began to grow in size around her neck. ""A necklace,"" she wondered.

In time, it was large enough to open the cage and the girl was able to set herself free. 

The fairy, who was very old now, appeared again. ""I was wondering when you would figure that out,"" she complained.

The girl was very angry and hurt when she spoke to the fairy, ""That was a cruel joke you played on me all those years ago...very cruel. You knew I only wanted to be loved,"" she cried.

The old fairy smiled the warmest, most genuine smile she could muster and said, ""and now... you are.""

Why did she leave me?! We were meant to leave together...           
I was the one to make her ascend, to make her pure again.         
Never will I forget the yellow siluete with white dotted sprinkles she liked to wear.           
Never will I forget the magnificent musk of her body every time she was about to change her sheets or take ali shower.           
Never will Ili forget her pristine long legs, clasping together at the many noises I would be making, without her knowledge, understandably.           
What joy it was to take a peak at all the faces she would be making while walking alone in an abandoned alley at night, without surveillance or protection.              

She had a very emotional face and that's what I adored about MY women, they had to experience sadness so harsh it turned into depression, fear so big it turned into crippling anxiety and emotions so deep, she would ride the tides of feeling for the many days to come...         
It was so much fun to watch her turn animal as I would scare her or back to human when she was in the general vicinity of her home. She thought she was safe in there and indeed she was! After all, I was watching over her, exercising complete control over what and when and why she experienced.           
Tracking my progress down the few months I had been her secret husband, one could see the work of a true artisan unfold:      I knew that she ate breakfast at 7:58am every morning.           
I knew that her favorite cereal was always branded, never generic.  She liked to live the high life but thats fine; I was okay with that.   I could accept it, although it did piss me off at times. Why couldnt she eat generic Muesli like all the normalno folk, she just had to screw everything up for me by picking a brand... That wasnt part of the deal but I was fine with that, really, Hahahahahahah. I just didnt want her to get hurt. I had to kill her cat. It was for her own safety.       
The cat also savoured branded food. Disgusting.         
She had to learn, to understand that one has to adopt to the neverending flow of time- NO BRANDS NO MORE!             

She would also find it easier to accept ascension, she would be reunited with her sinner cat after all... She loved her cat, it was her only friend, besides her abandoned husband, me... Now, I'm her only friend and lover and she has abandoned me. Hahahahaahahah. For the first and last time!         
If sve doesn't join her cat soon I might join the cat instead. After all, if she has the audacity to abandon me, I can befriend her cat and play with her for an eternity!           
We'll see how she likes that. To be betrayed. To be so humiliated by someone you thought you loved...         
Who did she do this to me?! I'm so angry! I will find you and you WILL join me!

[WP]Serial killer has been monitoring his next victim's movements for months. She is a loner and the perfect target. One day she disappears and nobody notices but him.,Umerred1,"I took a deep breath and counted the seconds ticking by on my watch. Why was she late? I'd been watching her for weeks and she'd always gotten home around the same time. At least within a ballpark. She went the library, and then she ended up at her house within 10 minutes of 7:30. That was how she lived, it was how she breathed, it was how she did everything. 

I'd been here for 45 minutes already, pressing myself against the wall beside her front door, keeping my breaths shallow. I'd been early to make sure that she didn't hear me come in, but I knew her schedule and she was never late. What was going on?

Could she have made plans with someone? Maybe she just went off and decided that she deserved a nice dinner. Lord knows people needed a good last meal to make sure life was worth it. I pressed my finger lightly against the trigger of my gun and tapped my foot against her floorboards. What the hell was keeping her?

The clock turned over to 7:47 and I'd had it. Something was off today. I was going to lose my edge, it was time to come back tomorrow. I'd snapped the lock on her window this morning, it wasn't like I couldn't get back in. Home and Bed, tomorrow would be fine.

---

The morning came and I followed it to the bus stop outside her house. She needed it to get to the library. I usually kept out of sight, but I needed to make sure she was here this morning.  I almost wanted to ask her what was going on with last night but nobody could ask that.

The dull sky finally started raining and I pulled deeper into the shelter. She was going to miss the bus at this rate. She hadn't turned on her bedroom lights yet this morning. Had she stayed over with someone? Who could it have been? She didn't talk to anyone, she never talked to anyone unless they were being paid to take her coffee order. What'd-

""Miss?"" The bus driver asked through the open door as he idled the engine. I gave him the once over, he was the only bus that came to this stop so- When had he gotten here? Didn't matter. 

""Sorry, distracted,"" I said before swinging onto the bus and pulling into a seat around the middle. Where was she? It wasn't like her to be anything but on time.

---

She hadn't been to the library today. I'd spent all day reading idly, mostly watching the door to catch her coming up, but I hadn't caught anything but a cold. I pressed my gloved hands against the lock I'd broken last night. It came loose and I slowly started to push the window open. It squeaked and I kept going, amateur. 

Her room was dead quiet, nothing had been moved since the last time I'd come to see her. She hadn't been here. I checked my watch and counted the seconds again, it was just a little before seven, I could wait to see if she got home from whatever she was doing. 

I kept sniffing as I waited by the front door. All day I'd been sitting in the red chair at the front of the library that nobody used.  The storm kept blowing in at me but I'd been too stubborn to move, and now I was sick. I was pissed off, cold, and I had a cold. Everything'd been so easy up until this point and now she was no-showing me twice in a row. She didn't do things like that,  that's why I was killing her. Easy target my ass. 

I pulled my gun away from my chest and sighed. Was I really about to go looking around her house for a reason she might be missing? God, I wouldn't do that for Mom, I mean, I wouldn't kill my Mom either but that wasn't the point. I stepped away from the door and made sure it was locked. 

Her room was in the same shape I'd left it, except now it was wet. ""Aw fuck Cait,"" I said as I got over to her window and shut it. I'd left my way in open and let the storm inside. Now I was in for it, I couldn't just leave, she'd know the window'd been open and she'd suspect something.  I flicked on the lights.

In for a penny and all that.

Her shoes were tucked in the corner. Who kept their shoes in their room? Aside from that everything seemed pretty normal. The bed was a sloppy mess, her clothes were scattered in a false promise that she'd get them into a hamper. Her cellphone was charging on her desk and her laptop was seated beside-

Wait. People brought their cellphones everywhere. I skipped around the clothes on the floor and snatched the phone off the desk. No messages, of course there weren't. That being siad, there were no texts, no notifications, nothing bothering her. I tried to open the damn thing but it asked me for a password, and I'd never gotten that from her. I dropped her phone.

Her computer was just sitting there on the desk. She brought it to the library sometimes, looking at articles on it instead of reading books. I hovered my hand over the lid, was I really going to do all this in someone's house when I was trying to kill them. As soon as she knew who I was the game was up and I'd need a new target, three months would have been for nothing.

I opened the laptop and typed in her password. Hydro, her old cat. I'd picked that one up over her shoulder. There weren't any calendar notifications or anything on there, just a screen staring back at me with no clues.

Her email would show if she'd gotten anything about flights. Maybe she was just on a trip I hadn't heard about. I scrolled through the past weeks and there was nothing, just nothing sent to her in the last month. How was that possible? Someone must've sent her spam. I checked the deleted folder, it was just as empty.

Search history was next but she'd erased that and I didn't know how to recover it. How was I supposed to know anything about her if-

I reached down to the drawers of her desk. I'd watched her get ready twice, and I knew what I needed to look for. Her library card was sitting neatly on top of a pile of chargers. Maybe the stuff she'd been reading would help me figure out where she'd gone. That'd been tomorrow though.

[WP] ...but that was before the Variuowen.,Vercalos,"Once we were happy. Or, we could have been. *Should* have been. We see that now. Then, of course, we weren't. We wanted more, and we wanted it faster. It was barely any time between something new and being bored with it, from being wowed by some amazing advance and feeling as though the world owed us something better. Nothing satisfied us. You hit a point, I guess, when you spend so long fighting for so much - must have been about 25 years before the fighting finally ended, though the books put the Uprising at 18 years because I guess things *still* don't matter until they happen in the west - that you don't know anything else but fighting for more.

During the Uprising, those of us who were optimistic of a proletarian victory had bright visions of the future. A future where, with so many people displaced from jobs due to automation, control of the automation would be nationalized and profits used to subsidize those out of work. A world where robots could take over dangerous work, and people would be free to chase leisurely pursuits, to study art and philosophy. A New Renaissance. They envisioned, perhaps a little too optimistically, a utopia in which all people had the opportunity to craft any life they wanted. 

But, old habits die hard. Generations were raised in a very materialistic society, after all, and our identities were caught up in what we owned, how we appeared on social media. After the Uprising, people wanted nothing more than to get back to what they missed about the previous world. And with the unlimited time and freedom to do that, life became less a blossoming of artistic expression and more a violent whorl of consumption. The resources people had led them to simply acquire *more*. More gadgets, more trinkets, more things to show off on an ever-increasing and expanding social media sphere. Life was all about what other people saw and thought of you.

Life was wretched. We were absorbed in other people's lives, and we saw only what they wanted us to see. We would spend an entire day crafting a single image for others to see, miserable except for a single instant captured to make others think we were perfect. And in our misery we would see the perfect lives of others, obsess with what we thought they were, and chase it for ourselves. Their look, their possessions, everything. It was an endless cycle of acquiring and disposing. We had everything we could possibly need to be happy - food was plentiful, sustainable, and healthy; we were safe from dangerous labour and free to pursue our dreams; war and poverty were eradicated - and we had never been more miserable.

We had everything. But that was before the Variuowen. Now we have no choice but misery. ",somanybutts

Their hopes and their dreams, everything about their society.
Their philosophy and everything they knew about life.
It had their history. Their achievements.
It had the best of humanity's art.
It also had what made humans human.
Everything about humanity's legacy was written on this slate, carved out from the ground.

The slate was currently traveling at over 40,000 mph, headed out of the solar system.

It wasn't a plea for help.
It wasn't an invitation to earth.

It was a call for recognition. Acknowledgment.
It was humanity making their mark on the universe.
It was them saying ""We were here. Against all odds we formed in the universe and came to be.""

Space agencies and scientists around the world had teamed up to send this rocket out as a last attempt to leave their mark.

It would be the last launch they ever made.

And as humanity crumbled and the earth burned, they knew that one day millions of years in the future someone would find this and take the time to decipher it, and slowly find out about the humans.

Humanity would be long gone by the time that happened but it gave them something slightly reminiscent of hope.
At least they had made a change in the universe and wouldn't have lived for nothing.

The child looked up in awe at the great obelisk before them.  

""It's a monument. The elders say it was a tribute to some sort of old God worshipped by our ancestors in the Shining Age. Oaxhin-Tan, I believe, was the name of the God.""

The child pondered this revelation for a moment. ""When did they build it?""

His grandfather chuckled. ""Oh, they built it a long time ago. Back before the Shining Age, even. Back then, people lived a lot like we do now. At least, that's what the elders say.""

The child thought about this. People had lived like they did now? The thought had never occurred to him, but now that he thought about it, it made sense. ""Why did the worship Oaxhin-Tan? What did he do?""

His grandfather thought back to his days learning from the elders. ""Back when people first came to this land, they lived under the rule of the Red King Shorse. Oaxhin-Tan came from across the sea to drive the Red King's armies away. They came back a few times, but every time, the followers of Oaxhin-Tan made sure they never won.""

""What was he the God of?""

""Freedom, equality, justice, and unity. And this was meant to made sure the people of this land never forgot what their kingdom was built on; the blood of the brave men and women who died to defend it. Oaxhin-Tan gave the people these values, and this was their tribute to him. A great tower, five hundred feet tall, carved from solid stone. It represented all they stood for.""

""What who stood for?""

""Us, my son. That was what they called their kingdom. Because they had their differences, but no matter what, they stood together, because they were one of Us.""

""Will it ever be like that again, grandfather?""

Few could read it, and fewer knew what it meant, save for a few very, very old men, granted long life during the Shining Age.

[WP] It was a dangerous sort of smile that adorned the face.,Vercalos,"For days, I kept having nightmares about my brother's car crash the other month. I'm always this powerless spectator reliving the anxiety and terror of that day every night. I had already been seeing a therapist, and he said it's natural to have some unresolved stress or trauma about the recent incident. 

Thing is, I figured there wouldn't be much to begin with. Certainly not enough to cause me nightmares. But they stayed consistent, and they were becoming troublesome.

I was starting to even see myself in the more recent ones, where *I'm* the one in the car accident, and my brother is left standing there to watch. I had even gotten prescription drugs to help me cope, but to little avail. 

I didn't even go out anymore. Home. Work. Home. Work. It had gotten so tiresome, I didn't even bother driving. Too distracting, that I almost had a rear-end collision. I didn't mind the extra 10 minutes to walk. But that was three weeks ago, and no signs of deviating since. 

The therapist said maybe it's some underlying, misplaced guilt; that I feel responsible for it all, and that's why I can't let it go. I *wanted* to, but part of me just wouldn't. 

I suppose I could call it all unfinished business. If I didn't confront it all, if I didn't *end* it all, I probably would never know peace. So I decided it was time I get some well-needed rest, once and for all. 

I went to the hospital later that day, hoping I'd beat my mother before her routine visit. It had been so long, I had almost forgotten what room he was in.  

I quietly stepped inside my brother's hospital room, yet Mother had in fact already arrived. Her back to me and the door, her arms were wrapped around my brother, who apparently gained consciousness that day. 

Both of our faces were clearly full of shock the moment my brother and I saw each other. Yet, not two seconds later--and I was counting every breath--his face distorted into a twisted smile. I examined him carefully, and could easily make out the sole word he mouthed. ""Vengeance."" He then turned his attention back to Mother, as if his action just a moment ago was nonexistent.

[WP] It was a dangerous sort of smile that adorned the face.,Vercalos,"Thanks. I was trying to convey the overall message or twist without being explicit. The brother had just regained consciousness from the car accident. And remember the clues earlier about ""guilt"" and ""unfinished business,"" and trying to get there before his mother. 

When the brother mouthed ""vengeance"" it's implied the main character tried to kill his brother in the car accident, and now the brother wants payback. But in hindsight, if I had picked a different cause of injury like a shooting, it might have been easier to deduce the main character intentionally caused it. ",poster213

Below however, hits rang out into the empty sky. Spears hitting chestplates, swords hitting other swords, the last moans of horses dying in battle. It was a massacre of men. One man however changed the way war would be looked at forever.

John put down his sword in disgust, sick of all this petty fighting he decided to try and reverse  an ancient saying ""sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me"". 

He took out his smartphone and typed a mass text message to everyone on the opposing side, it read ""you're mother is a cow"".  The second he hit the send button a wave of vibrations rang out through the soldiers. All at once, as if planned they all took out their phones and read the message. 

""Who the hell is john""
""Who the fuck just called my mom a cow?""
""Well he's kinda right.""
""Hmm 867-5309, anyone know who's number this is, they just called my mom a cow.""
""Hey me too, who is this troll"" 

Sentances like these rang out endlessely in the battlefield. Soon enough, John received message after message of people roasting him because of his message. Soon enough everyone on Johns side caught one, and one by one began texting the other solders horrible things about them. This is how the ""war of words"" started in 2045. 

To this day a message lay engraved in stone on that very battlefield, it reads. ""Sticks and stone may break my bones but words will always hurt me.""",skaterfromtheville
[TT] Both sides tired of blades. It was time to fight with words.,Vercalos,"Then having realized the folly of the type of battle that trashed treasuries, wreaked widowhood on women, and halved and halved again the harvests - a dirge for the peasants that perished! - the two nations decided to settle their scores with words. 

And so they did send forth volley upon volley of sanguinary text, hailing pugnacious pamphlets upon one another by way of hot air balloons. Where previously blacksmiths had rejoiced at the profitable pursuit of forging weapons, and congratulated themselves for being of their particular profession, now printers and scribes saw fit to bless the conflict for its coin. 

Examining, now, an example, of the artillery employed, let us inspect the invective prose of one A.S. Bierson. 

“You damnable, dastardly bastards - for not one of you is of legitimate birth, being, every mongrel man and woman, sprung from the loins of unholy pretenders, who support an illegal claim to the throne; having no true papers, since your false government falsely forges falsehoods; having no true home, since your hovels are built on untitled land - let not your children bear the burden of your feckless fornications, and yea, do you submit, to the One True King.” 

The enemy recipient of this missive picked up its vehicle leaflet as he departed the scene of a spurning - woe to the man whose lady love is scathing. Thus, he fell into an apoplectic rage, and so ennobled, rose to the defense of his nation, such that his lancet letter was dropped, with others, into opposing territory the next day. Wrote J.Tomlin, to his aggressor: 

“Given the niggardly nature of your noggins, which, notwithstanding the fact that we are of the same species, somehow lag behind ours in all manner of intellect and insight - hark now to a simplified composition, made elementary and childlike, so as to urge upon your moron minds some understanding: S-U-R-R-E-N-D-E-R.” 

Who knows if peace will ever come to embrace these unruly tribes? Let us shake our heads at their foolishness, at their futile fighting fists, which knuckle and clench perennially, around their peevish pens. Let us endeavour, ourselves, to avoid such flaming wars.

""Tell me about it. Say, how about we settle it with words? As they always say: Wounds by the tongue are sharper than those given by the sword.""

&amp;nbsp;

""What?! I see you like being the pu**y you are eh?""

&amp;nbsp;

""Ah hah, subtly taking the front foot eh Dom?""

&amp;nbsp;

""Just pick up the damn sword and fight me, you wuss!""

&amp;nbsp;

""I already told you, both of us are too tired to carry on. We wouldn't have a winner. Look, you even dropped your sword just now.""

&amp;nbsp;

""I see that you are afraid of losing eh? I say you don't even deserve the 'best swordsman' title at all!""

&amp;nbsp;

Waiting. Patiently. MacArthur is a well-versed man, but he had to wait for the perfect opportunity to strike. 

&amp;nbsp;

""Hey! Talk back you mute! Else I would self-declare that I'm the winner of this fight, be it swords or words!""

&amp;nbsp;

Not now. A predator has to watch his prey before striking. Now is not the time still.

&amp;nbsp;

""And I'm gonna take your beloved sword, fabled to be the strongest sword forged with the rarest metals the earth has to offer. I must say, I'm amazed by it... I mean, how do you even wield it? It's... it's so huge and long...""

[TT] Both sides tired of blades. It was time to fight with words.,Vercalos,"""An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind."" A shame this idiom wouldn't be known for another thousand years.

For fifty years the animosity between the Kingdoms of Gaulanitis and Kalamar had them locked in a stalemate; hundreds of battles had been fought, thousands of lives lost for no longer a reason more than the spite of bitter Kings. Though fifty years had seen no wish to cede, its wear was visible, as these two Kings sat across the court.

""Peter, we've been here before. How many times has your army sat at my walls? And each time, they have been fatigued."" called the Kalamaran King.

""Aye, Abernathy. But this time is just a means. I come with an offer,"" was the reply.

""Of submission? Surely after all this time you know we'll find no truce.""

""I've grown old. I've grown tired of the sounds of mettle outside my doors, as I'm sure you have as well. I've lived 65 years now, and my physicians tells me I won't make the next. You look no better yourself.""

""Living by sheer stubbornness, my Loranna would have said.""

A moment passed in silent respect.

""My body has aged, but my mind is still sharp. What say we set aside the mages and the mettle, and have one last duel? One of wit. To the victor, the spoils?""

""I suppose I find your terms agreeable, but as always, your tact lacking,"" Abernathy chuckled. ""If you don't mind, I'll begin.""

&gt;*There are two sisters,*  
*Forever cursed.*  
*One gives birth to the other, un-nursed,*  
*And the other, in turn, gives birth to the first.*

Peter thought for a moment, before a grin came to his face. ""That would be the Night and the Day,"" he announced.

""Indeed, it would. Your turn.""

&gt;*What has roots as nobody sees,*  
*Is taller than trees,*  
*Up, up it goes,*  
*And yet never grows?*

""The mountain on which my castle stands!"" proclaimed the Kalamaran King.

""For now,"" Peter smiled, knowingly. Abernathy spoke:

&gt;*This thing all things devours;*  
*Birds, beasts, trees, flowers;*  
*Gnaws iron, bites steel;*  
*Grinds hard stones to meal;*  
*Slays Kings, ruins town,*  
*And beats mountain down.*

After a brief moment of though, Peter declared, ""it's time.""

With his opponent's confirmation, he reached up and patted his robe. ""What do I have in my pocket?""

""Excuse me?"" came the confused reply.

""What do I have in my pocket,"" Peter repeated.

&amp;nbsp;

""Well, that's simply not fair!"" Abernathy proclaimed. ""How of all the things in the world, should I know?""

""Think, Abernathy. Think! Were *you* a King, what might you have in a pocket?"" Peter asked, mockingly. ""I'll even give you three guesses. Remember, to the victor, the spoils.""

Abernathy closed his eyes and began to consider the things he might have carried.

""A purse?""

""No.""

Abernathy's mind raced.

""A signet?""

""Closer. One more guess.""

""... A letter?""

""Indeed, and for you,"" Peter said, passing the scroll to a servant. The servant took it, and briskly crossed the room. ""And with it, my apologies for your losing this game.""

""What do you mean, my loss?"" Abernathy said, gleefully taking the scroll from the servant and unrolling it. ""I've beaten your blatant cheat, so tell me: how have I lost?""

&amp;nbsp;

On the scroll read a few small words.

&amp;nbsp;

^^^""I ^^^prepared ^^^explosive ^^^runes ^^^this ^^^morning.""

[TT] Both sides tired of blades. It was time to fight with words.,Vercalos,"Alef's breath was getting shallower now, more ragged. The snow helped numb the pain, but he could still feel his life slipping away. Pooling around his body. It felt warm.

Lying down was no way to go. He propped himself up against a tree, wincing. His vision cleared slightly. Yes, he was still in the same clearing, surrounded by dead trees, branches, the occasional boulder. In front of him laid the body of the Louterrian soldier, curled up, still clutching his sword. That was the hardest fight of his military career. Yet he managed to come out on top. He coughed, spurting out blood. Somehow, victory didn't feel as sweet as it usually did.

""You look horrible.""

The voice came from the body. Alef chuckled wryly. ""I thought I killed you.""

""Please. You couldn't kill a rat with that sword. What is it, iron?""

Alef gripped his sword. ""It's a traditional Gimel scimitar. We use the best metal we have for these swords.""

""So, yes. Iron.""

Alef made a small smile. His face hurt. ""Is there a point to all this?""

""Well..."" The Louterrian pushed himself up to a seated position, leaning against a tree of his own. ""I would try to stab you, but I fear my body will collapse. My voice, on the other hand, remains unscathed, and as such, I will use it as my weapon."" He scoffed, then fell into a coughing fit. ""Seeing as I am likely more eloquent than the smartest of your kind, this seems an easy victory.""

This seemed... sad, more than anything. Alef's grip loosened. ""Right. What's your name?""

The question seemed to bring joy to the Louterrian's eyes. ""Sir Fernand Aldrick Moreau, member of the 74th Battalion of the Louterrian Army."" His eyes narrowed in suspicion. ""Why do you ask?""

""Alef. Nice to meet you."" Alef closed his eyes, leaning his head back against the rough bark. ""Do you have a family?""

Fernand hesitated. ""Why, yes. I have a wife, Adalyn. A woman who is infinitely more beautiful than whatever pig you managed to-""

""I do too."" Alef forced a smile, his eyes still closed. ""Her name's Rebecca. She was the only person I ever loved. I loved the way her eyes narrowed when you made fun of her, the way she fussed over me when I came home on leave, how when she laughed, her eyes would light up and suddenly the whole world felt a bit brighter."" He opened his eyes. He looked at Fernand, at the blood-red snow, at the blackening sky. ""It doesn't feel so bright anymore, Fernand.""

""... No, I suppose not.""

Everything started blurring together. 

The trees, into the snow, into the sky. 

He felt warm. 

Had it stopped snowing?

He sighed, and let it all fade away.

[WP] Fear. They were made of pure fear.,Vercalos,"Fear. They were made of pure fear. And I am the one who made them. 

I forged their bones out of nightmares of blood and fire. I layered their muscles with thoughts of loss, desertion, and pain. I armored them with the darkness that lurks in people's mind, the shadows that hide in the corner of their eyes, and the frigid cold that grip their hearts. 

These creatures were made by me, and me alone. But they lived and breathed because of the delusions that plagued mankind. And it would be these delusions that will bring them to their end. 

They look like golems to me, looming and hulking as they marched forward. Their black armor glistened in the rain and their blood-red eyes pierced through the mist for miles on end. But they would like a living nightmare to everyone else. Because that was their sole purpose. 

No soldier can gun down an army when that army is made of the rotting and deceased bodies of their children, their parents, their lovers. No soldier can think when ghouls are charging at them faster than their bullets. No soldier can fight when the world goes black and the weight of their failures anchors them to the ground. And what a beautiful site that would be for me. 

To watch them all cower before my genius, my invention. They turned me away because they were afraid of what I could do. And now I have turned that fear back on them a hundred-fold. They said I shouldn't dwell in dark magics. They said I shouldn't mess with forces I didn't understand. They said I was going too far. 

They were right. When they are shivering in the cold, and starving in the dark, with their hands over their eyes to blind them from the horrors that lurk around them, they will see that they were right to fear me. These creatures may be made out of their fears, but I am their master. ",JasonHolloway
[WP] Fear. They were made of pure fear.,Vercalos,"""You have to admire them in a foul, hated sort of way.""

Faith Alathir gave Flint a querying look. ""What do you mean?""

Hilary Flint gestured to the bloody remains before them, a mass of black fur and razor claws. A narrow mouth held dozens of yellowed fangs in gums corrupted with disease, bits of gore and dried flesh still clinging between them. It was vaguely lupine in shape, though on a scale which defied normal means. It was bipedal, its arms lanky and lean, its legs wrapped in layered muscles and built for bursts of speed. But it was its eyes that were the most disturbing, pale and human-like.

""It's a Loup-Garou,"" he explained. ""Werewolves can transform between monster and man, but Garous are trapped in one form, their *true* form. A werewolf might have a Man's intellect, but a Garou has a bestial cunning that no sentient being can compare to. More than a Dire Wolf and more than a Man, a Loup-Garou is something which is neither beast nor being. It exists on the border of what think we understand, and in doing so makes us question what we truly know. 

""We don't know where they come, if they even breed or reproduce at all. There's some who believe that Garous arise from corrupted beings, transforming and infecting them until they evolve into something *not* Human. Others dismiss this, calling it as nonsense and that we've merely haven't seen offspring or breeding. And then there's a scant few like myself who believe they come from another source altogether, a notion too dark and terrible for the masses to accept.""

""And what's that?"" Faith asked. Flint turned towards her, his eyes dull with jadedness. 

""That these... abominations are not biological at all, that they're the manifestation of death and fear, and every negative emotion which has filled this world since the Arrival. You Fae knew nothing about them before then, which suggests that they are a product of the borders between the physical and metaphysical being torn and sundered. And if that's the case, then there is very little either Man or Fae can do to stop them. For every act of anger or fear or sadness will breed more of these creatures, and in doing sow the seeds of our own destruction.""

"[WP] A Story that starts with ""The end"" and ends with ""Once upon a time""",Wolve909,"The end. I knew it was coming; after all I'm a lead investigative reporter for CNN, I know a lot before the rest of the nation. Our executives didn't know how to tell the world what we had discovered. The UN was meeting now and they would decide ultimately what we would do. Other news stations had let some information slip but because of their credentials and resources it was widely unaccepted as truth. I sat in my office as nausea rolled over me from the dread that filled my stomach. My anxiety ran rampant and I considered calling my family. Before I could finish thinking about that task there was a small knock on my office door. 
""Come in,"" I said weakly, holding back bile. 
My boss came in, tears rolling down her face. Gone was the makeup she had carefully applied this morning, replaced instead by streaks of running mascara and blotchy red cheeks. Her usual perfectly fixed blonde hair was tied back in a high bun. The fear in her eyes was evident and not a good sign.
She swallowed hard as if she too was feeling the overwhelming sickness at the back of her throat. 
""The UN has decided it would be best if we didn't say anything. They don't want to cause massive panic and hysteria. You're free to leave, please go home to your family.""
I drove home preparing myself to act as if everything was normal. My family shouldn't know what was about to happen and I decided to not put them through knowing the truth. My two beautiful children, twins, were outside playing in the summer sun as normal. My husband was sitting on the porch watching them with his paper in his hand, his soft brown hair blowing in the breeze. I got out of the car to excited squeals of ""Mom!"". My husband stood up and smiled at me before walking over to kiss my forehead and take my briefcase. They had no idea that this wasn't an ordinary day. 
The sun was setting by the time we finished dinner. I made sure to make their favorite meal as it would be the last one they ate. My husband sat on the couch watching television, gradually growing sleepy and my children began to rub their tired eyes. It would seem the sleeping medicine I added to their food was working well. I told the children to go get ready for bed and for the first time in their young lives they didn't argue. I heard my husbands soft snoring behind me and turned to look at his face. I committed every single bit of it to memory. The slight crookedness in his nose from a previous break, his long lashes lying against his cheeks, his lips thin, and his jaw square leading up to perfectly shaggy brown hair. I walked over quietly and kissed his forehead, hesitating to pull back, and whispered a quiet I love you. I walked up the stairs, feeling the soft carpet against my bare feet, and made my way to my children's room. Both girls were already in their respective beds. I went up to each of them, stroked their soft blonde curls, and kissed their foreheads. 
""How about a story?"" I asked weakly.
Both girls nodded sleepily as I chose a short book from the shelf about a magical princess. I sat in the chair between their beds, bright lights flashing from our impending doom outside. I knew it was only a few minutes before the meteor would hit, destroying our planet and all of its inhabitants. Tears welled up in my eyes as I looked at my little girls one last time. I smiled at them to hide my despair and began to read.

"[WP] A Story that starts with ""The end"" and ends with ""Once upon a time""",Wolve909,"The end its a very difficult concept for us human to grasp. I think we all did the thought experiment of trying to comprehend what would our view of the world be like after death, only to find ourselves shivering in that void of (generally black) emptiness. 

As i'm writing this, i ocassionally peek through the window, only to see a picture that no one else had ever saw: A world without men. Dont get me wong, there are still people down here, just not men. Only women.

As you can expect (if you ever payed attention to those biology classes, my non-existent friend), this is the end of humanity. They've tried everything in their reach to avoid this, and so far everything has failed. Maybe its for the best, to have a fresh start, and detox this already badly beaten earth from us.

I can't stop staring at the gun in my table. We (me and she) know why we are here. I'm here to demonstrate that there's always something that escapes our understanding, and she is here to end my existence. For there is no place for me in here. You know what, scratch that, what i meant to say is that this isn't my place anymore. There is no joy in being the salvation of mankind when it just would destroy you.

I really hope that this earth would hold life as interesting as was ours. I really hope that this would be an emotion filled world once again. I really hope that transgender people would, once again, rise from the evolutionary rollercoaster that is our existence. I really hope that this bullet will do its job, and kill the last biological man on earth, so that the planet would be filled with potential intelligent life, like it was, once upon a time.

"[WP] A Story that starts with ""The end"" and ends with ""Once upon a time""",Wolve909,"The end of the year was filled with shame and regret. It tasted like sweat and nerves, and smelled of execrable matter. This was what Joseph expected. It was tradition. It was mandated. It was the day that he and his crew gathered to review their various failures. The idea was to acknowledge them, and move on. Living on Gen-9 was a commitment - to the project, and to each other. The year-end tally was a necessary thing, to clear the air, to prevent suffocation. 

“Who’s next?” asked Joseph. For a moment, he had closed his eyes, and the pressure inside his head expanded into a lightness, turning him inside out, whack-a-mole thumping, unzipping him into space. He looked at his scorecard. Sixteen. That made sense. 

“Me,” said Astrid, “I’d like to apologize again to Terry for wrecking his photosynth batch. I should not have reset the vac-dome. I should have checked to see if it was in use, but I was tired, and the lab was empty. So, I hit reset, and went to sleep. I’m really sorry. I shouldn’t have gotten lazy.” 

“It only wrecked three months of prep,” said Terry, “So - let’s say three shots, and we’re even.” 

Astrid downed three shots of moonshine, and marked her sheet accordingly. Terry thought of the little monocellular creatures he grew, green and luminescent. How many thousands had he raised, in his quest for atmospheric adaptation? He thought of how that particular batch had made it further than the others, and how he had felt such fury, such murderous frustration, that he had not been able to summon the words to strike at Astrid when he found her. It was not that he had lost the mental facility for speech - it was that the invectives seared so fast up his throat that they had cauterized it completely, and sealed his tongue to his palate. So, instead of a righteous tirade, he had wheezed sharp breaths through a burning chest, and delivered wordless tears. Now, he looked at Astrid as her sinuses ran from the awful, potent liquor. She hacked out the aftertaste into the beaker that served as communal spitoon. He looked at his own scoresheet, which had him at twelve shots. He reflected. He forgave her. 

“My turn,” said Terry, “Chang, that thing with the siloric petri dishes was my fault. It was totally my fault. Won’t happen again, I swear.” 

“Is that you talking, or the moonshine?"" asked Chang. ""But then again - I guess your drunken promises are worth as much as your sober ones - by which I mean, they are worthless. Because, you know, you had *promised to check for siloric growth*, and you didn’t.” 

Terry looked at his shotglass. He wondered if he was a terrible person. He wondered if he was supposed to be on Gen-9, if they would ever get anywhere with anything, if there was any point trying at all. 

“I’m fucking with you,” said Chang, “Two shots and we’re good.” 

Terry tossed back the shots, and marked them down. It was good. They were good. They were blind and crawling, and slipping back and forth and beautiful, and it was the end of the year, and a new one would start tomorrow. 

Later, when the score cards had cumulatively averaged twenty seven - lower than last year, Joseph noted, with some satisfaction - they lay invertebrate in their chairs, and stared out the viewing panel. The galaxy hummed.

“Do you think they’ll know we did this, a thousand years from now?” Someone, somewhere, vague-voiced and sleepy. 

“A thousand years from now,” said Joseph, hearing himself from far away, “They’ll still be doing this, themselves. They'll be castigating themselves, and each other, for the fuck-ups of the year. And the fuck-ups will have been great, and the next year will be greater. This is the story of life. It’s called progressive failure. The thing about success is - you fail until you get there. And so they’ll throw back shots like we did, once upon a time.” ",taohacker
"[WP] A Story that starts with ""The end"" and ends with ""Once upon a time""",Wolve909,"""The end"" The announcers voice boomed.

All the actors on the stage flinched at the declaration. We held position as the velvet curtains dropped over us. The audience was creating a symphony of applause. They cheered and whooped. Yelled and demanded more. Finally the curtain hit the wooden stage. I dropped from my bow and hit the floor. I tried to regain my breath as the other actors and actresses dropped onto the stage, either from exhaustion or to avoid any unwanted attention. The people beyond the curtain eventually stopped their rhythmic beat and left. Whispering to each other in awe of the performances.

""They seemed so dedicated""
""Did you see that death scene! the way the head rolled gave me chills""
""That was wonderful, when is their next show?""

I shifted my head to view the other half of the stage. Tom's unblinking head was staring at me, gushing blood from the neck. Jerry was bawling, everyone hated the executioner role. As the theater patrons finally left we heard the sound of polished shoes hitting wooden floor. Everyone looked away from stage left. I kept my nose to the ground to try and catch a glance of the producers. Two of them stood over us all. Their perfectly pressed pin stripe suits shifted with each step. The one on the left wore the classical smiling theater mask. Its twisted grin pressing the eye holes upward. The one on the right with a hanging frown that sucked the joy out of all who glanced upon it. 

""Wonderful show"" The smile said with glee.

The frown simply dragged Toms head and corpse back to stage left. 

""Well I'm sure you all know the drill"" The smile continued clasping his hands together ""Get some good sleep, we have more shows tomorrow"" 

Some people began to weep. Other groaned. The veterans remained silent. I started to pull myself to my feet and walked towards stage right along with the rest of the actors. We all shuffled through the hall to the cement room. I paced into the corner, closest to the vent, and slumped down into it with the wall against my back. Jerry was the last one in, dropping his ""prop"" outside the room before he went in. Tears still streamed from his puffy eyes but he silenced his sobs. The light on the ceiling began to dim slowly. The veterans closed their eyes and acted as if they slept. Every now and then waking up to check on the dimly lit ""Roles"" board. I crawled over to Jerry, his breathing was short. 

""You ok"" I whispered trying not to wake the others from their slumbers.

""I'm getting out of here"" He said shakily.

A few people looked at him from the room. The veterans chuckled. I looked back at the steel door, locked in place until morning. 

""And you want to do this how?"" I asked.

""During the play"" He said looking up at me with red eyes ""I'll jump off the stage""

People started to sit up and look our direction. I grabbed his hand and looked him in the eye.

""Good luck"" I smiled.

A small beep rang through the room, role changes. The veterans shot up and scrambled to see. Pushing and shoving to see who was on what. They all let out sighs of relief and flopped back onto their spots. I only glanced at one spot, *The Prisoner*. Everyone in the room looked at Jerry with pity. He didn't even look at the board and shoved his head to the ground with hands on his head. I crawled back to my corner careful not to step on anyone. One of the veterans glanced at me and smiled. I took a peek over to the board.
*The Executioner- Thomas*
My stomach dropped. Guilt washed over me like waves crashing upon the shores of a lighthouse. The veteran was almost laughing at me. I turned away shutting my eyes tight. 

Morning came and the light slowly cranked back on. Everyone groaned as the steel door popped open. Jerry ignored the board not even caring who it was titled with the burden of his death. We where given new sets of our costumes along with minuscule daily rations. Jerry was silent all through our short eating break. His eyes stayed on the ground. The sound of people filling the stands just beyond the curtain fueled my own worries. I felt the black eyes of the frown gaze upon me from the shadows of stage left. Everyone slipped on their assigned costumes, I put on the black hood worn only yesterday by Jerry himself. The ax had been newly polished, sharpened. Jerry looked at me with confusion, anger, and then understanding. I attempted to mouth sorry but felt a sharp compelling feeling against it. They watched from across the stage. 
The announcers voice boomed above us.

Blurred images seeping into the back of my head. Cold, wet, immense pain and now worst of all.......fear. What's happening? What happened? Is this real?What is real? I don't understand.


Time swoopes past as I spectate in brief moments. Blackouts. Visions rush at me from a distance until they crash into and imprint themselves in my memory. Some pleasant, some, not so much. Again.......fear. Memory????


This silence is deafening. Or did I just imagine and fabricate sound to be real. Still cold, still wet and vision is still blurred. Immense pain and back to the darkness.


Blurry but something different. White light has replaced the blacks and greys. Movement, uncontrollably shaking from the cold? And again, that haunting question....what happened? Intense pain.


I try to focus in between blackouts and possibly during them. I'm not sure. And now, for once the wet seems warm. Vision turns blurry again. White to red to black. I try to move. My head rolls and I feel something warm leak across my face and then something I longed for........a sound. Drip drip drip drip drip.........fear. My instincts pull my head to the original position. Silence followed by darkness.


How can I tell the time I've spent subdued to this nightmare? If it is so, a mangled thought process of a dream, I hope to awake to the welcoming sound of my alarm. Instead I stay in this place drifting in and out of the unknown. 


Where am I? Not knowing the answere to the questions asked by the gremlin in my head is only a small distraction from the pain. Somehow I now welcome the pain because it's the closest thing to feeling alive. Alive? If I am thus, I should be able to control my body. Why can't I move? ..........why? why?
Darkness.


Life, Death, why can't I comprehend? A slight smile cracks open my dry lips. The warmth of the blood is strange in my mouth but even worse is the thought of quenching my thirst with my own blood. How much time has passed? I wonder if anyone else is left. A sad thought now, as the last person standing, ( bad analogy I know ) I'll be the only one without a burial. 


It's amazing how easy it is to focus on the negatives. Allowing the hurt and pain to create further mental hurdles. Deeper and deeper into this black hole. 


But I'm not dead yet!!!!!! Or am I? I don't care anymore. I've been stuck here too long. I need to know that there's more to this life? Or limbo or where ever I am.


Time for a change.


But how? I hope some day I can repeat this story with ""once upon a time""",jordpaian

This brought that quote to mind. It is a brilliant piece of writing if I could I would give you a third gold, but I cant so have a smiley instead. :)",nooneisherex10
"[WP] A Story that starts with ""The end"" and ends with ""Once upon a time""",Wolve909,"""The End."" That's usually how stories went. You say something about happily ever afters and put a nice little bow on it all and say ""The End."" Then you move on to the next story. 

That was certainly what I was doing; Moving on to the next story. But there wasn't any ""The End."" It was just this crazy constant loop, over and over and over. Not in a a nice growth kind of story arc where the protagonist learns the value of being a good person and comes to peace with himself. Instead what I got was the constant grind of a life and death. I got to see everything, trapped from birth till death in a body not my own, and with no ability to guide the outcomes I knew would happen. 

I had heard a kid's parents tell him about the butterfly effect, how some small action in one place could have a bigger effect somewhere else. Now I was witnessing that first hand. I watched as a waitress served the wrong food to a truck driver who got angry and later beat his wife. She had to go to the hospital and drove herself there only to get into a wreck that delayed a senator from a night with his mistress. The mistress got angry and called his wife and a media circus ensued causing the Senator to vacate his seat to save his marriage. This left it open to an opposing Senator to move in and become the deciding vote on healthcare legislation that would limit the type of funding available for medical research. Which in turn trickled all the way down to a little girl suffering from cancer, who now couldn't use her own umbilical cord blood to help re-seed her immune system. 

I'd been with all of them on that ride. I watched that waitress grow up in a good family only to have it stripped away by the death of her father. I sat in the head of that trucker and felt his fists as he pummeled his wife, time after time, and felt the anguish he felt at not being able to stop himself. I felt every blow, every broken bone, sobbed every tear, right along side his wife and right along with her felt the heartbreak of wanting to kill him or be killed by him just to stop the pain. I'd been with her when she went to his funeral years after their divorce and even still when she jumped into the river still thinking about him. I'd been the senator and his wife and the mistress and all the reporters reputable and not. I'd been other senators, other interns and pages and security guards and scientists and policy wonks and doctors and nurses and now this little dying girl.

And it all broke my heart and made me cry for the world. This was the world. The world was pain, dotted with just a few short heart beats of happiness. It was hard not to be smothered by it. It was madness. And every time the next person I rode with died I hoped that this would be the end of it. I hoped for that sweet silence. No more suffering. No more helplessness. 

At the same time I knew I'd miss some part of what it was to be human. I knew that now as the girl's mother held her. The woman's cool hand on her daughter's hot cheek. Singing sweetly through the tears as her daughter struggled out the last few breaths of her short life. 

I wondered as things grew dim, where would I go next. What lay beyond that curtain of the grave. Where was ""The End"" for me? Better still, where was my ""Once upon a time?""",nhavar
"[WP] A Story that starts with ""The end"" and ends with ""Once upon a time""",Wolve909,"The end comes just the way it always does, every time. At 11:57 and fourteen seconds, the heartbeat monitor spikes for a moment, the same three frantic beeps before the buzz of the flatline I've become so accustomed to. Your face looks no different in death; the end always comes in your sleep. For a long time -- two minutes and fourty six seconds, but it feels as long as all my lives -- I sit there, holding your hand as the clock ticks until the warmth begins to fade. 

""TEN!"" I don't look behind me as the crowd on TV begins the countdown. 

""NINE!"" Their voices are tinny, distant, as faint as the feeling of unease that's already begun to creep up on me. 

""EIGHT!"" All I want to do is lean down, kiss you awake like I did so many mornings last year. When I do it next time, I'll start to cry, I'm sure; I have every other time, after all. You'll ask me what's wrong, those big brown eyes so focused on me, and I'll deflect, make a dumb joke about 2016 being the worst, and the conversation will shift away like it always does. Like it always will.

""SEVEN!"" The first time I looped in time, I saw it as a second chance. A chance to persuade you to eat healthier foods, to guilt you into exercising more, to try to get the doctors to prescribe you cholesterol medicine and statins and every other heart medicine modern science had dreamed up. To convince you to take it easy the day of the stroke, physically bar you from going out to the gym or drive to your sister's or go for a walk to clear your head. And every time I tried, it ended the same way: with you in this bed, and me holding your cooling hand as the clock strikes midnight. 

""SIX!"" The unease has grown to dizziness, nausea. The wind has begun, slow for now, but already gaining in speed. Soon it will be a hurricane.

""FIVE!"" When I realized the stroke was inevitable (I think it was the 57th loop, though I had already begun losing track), I freely confess I went off the deep end. Talking about our future, spending time with you, even looking at you became painful. By Valentine's Day, I couldn't take it anymore. I packed my bags and drove until I hit the Pacific. But even spending New Year's Eve in a bar in San Francisco instead of the hospital room back in Philly, I still found myself waking up at home on January 1st, 2016. I stopped trying at work, got fired, stopped trying in our marriage, got divorced. I spent New Year's in a mental hospital. Still woke up in 2016. I tried to die. Woke right back up in 2016.

""FOUR!"" And every time I woke up, you were there, smiling as bright as ever, kissing me to welcome in the new year that was so very old to me. At first, it scared me, to see you so happy and to know it was all going to be torn away. Then, it infuriated me, for you to be so blithely cheerful in the face of what you were going to do to me. But after that worst loop, when I downed the pills and wanted nothing but the embrace of the black, there you were. Same kiss, same goofy smile, same words whispered in my ear that you whispered every time. 

""THREE!"" I sobbed into your arms that night. And you didn't ask why, you didn't push me; you just held me tight until my body stopped shaking. The next day, we went for a walk in the park by our apartment. The sun was just peaking through the clouds, and the sunlight turned every snow crystal to a dazzling prism. At 3:32, you suggested we make a snowman; at 3:58, I accidentally covered you in snow, which led to a vicious snowball fight. And just for a moment, it felt like everything was okay. It took me a few more loops to realize that's because everything was.

""TWO!"" I don't know how many loops ago that was. Ten? Fifty? A hundred? Honestly, it's a meaningless question. All that matters is that it will happen again tomorrow. And in two hundred ninety one days, the stroke will happen again, and 74 days after your mind leaves, I will lose the rest of you too. And a day after that, I will have you back.

""ONE!"" The wind is gale force now. I lean in, kiss your hand. ""See you soon,"" I whisper.

And with that, I'm thrown through a plate glass window, turned inside out, run through a wood chipper -- I've never quite come up with a satisfactory analogy for the weirdness of the sensation, even after all this time. And then I'm in our bedroom, and you're holding me, and kissing me, and it's all I'll ever have, but that's alright because it's all I ever want.

""Happy New Year,"" you whisper, just as you will whisper again and you whispered once upon a time.",Amy_Ponder
"[WP] A Story that starts with ""The end"" and ends with ""Once upon a time""",Wolve909,"The end must have not been so bad, the people said. Otherwise why would she have been smiling? It was the first day of the New Year, and people stood huddled out in the snow, stomping their feet and blowing on their fingers, gathered around the frozen corpse. She a little girl, just a child, and her feet were blue and bare and the blood had frozen in her cheeks, so that even in death, she was still rosy-faced and smiling. The poor girl, they said, and toed the burnt-out matches in the snow. Perhaps the cold addled her brains. Perhaps she died believing she was warm. 

A red-cheeked man sniffed and rubbed at his nose, and then tilted his head to the air. ""Does anyone smell that?"" he said. And indeed, there was the scent of something burning. They stepped, back, boots sloshing through icy water as the snow melted around them. The black burnt-out matches re-lit themselves, blazed red hot. There was something buried in the snow beneath the girl, gnarled hands emerging like roots. ""My God!"" a woman screamed. ""There was nothing there! There can't have been anything there!"" And yet bony arms clutched the frozen corpse, snow melted into a toothless grin. The crowd scattered backwards, leashed to the periphery of the horror. It was suddenly very hot, and very bright. The people looked up and saw the boughs of a great Christmas tree towering above them, its branches blazing with thousands and thousands of candles. The sky was black and stars fell from the sky, trailing lines of fire behind them. 

""Now someone is dying,"" the little corpse said, her cheeks very pink and her smile frozen on her. ""When a star falls, an angel tumbles down to Earth."" 

The light went out, momentarily, and the people were stumbling in the dark. Then there was a sound of a match being struck. 

There was fire, God! There was so much fire. The people threw off their scarves, tore open their coats, sweat pouring down their faces. There was the hiss of burning fat, and a roast goose with knife and fork still embedded in its body danced in front of them, its skin blistered and sweating. The little corpse bit into it, and it writhed in ecstasy as grease ran down her chin. People fell to their knees and begged. Some of them prayed. It did them no good. The little grinning corpse struck another match, r-r-ratch! 

They were in a great and polished stove, its brass sides sloping, so that there was no escape from the flames. The people screamed as they slid down into the pit of Hell, fingers clawing at the unforgiving metal. Their bodies sizzled, their bones cracked from the heat. The little corpse dangled her feet down and warmed them by the fire as the people were rendered into ash, their screams echoing across the curves of the stove. 

And then all the matches had been consumed, and there was just a little girl standing among the ashes, her yellow hair curled prettily around her neck. She carefully picked through the ashes and extracted two slippers, one after another, and slipped them on. They flopped oversized on her dainty feet, her soles now black with soot. The air had grown cold again, and the skies darkened, and it had begun to snow. She knelt, and began to gather the remains of the matches. 

""I would have gone gloriously,"" she said, and began to fill her apron. ""I would have gone with God, once upon a time."" ",sadoeuphemist

"[WP] A Story that starts with ""The end"" and ends with ""Once upon a time""",Wolve909,"“The End.”

That was always my least favourite part of the book. Every night, after getting ready for bed, my mom would read a story to me. It was always the best part of my night, because no matter what kind of day either one of us had, we could become anything for an hour. I remember her coming into my room with a model submarine one evening. That was when we started Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, my favourite story to this day. We stayed up an extra hour, just talking about it and describing the submarine, the Nautilus. I was in a whole new fantasy world, and I could live in it forever.

In my mind, I was riding in the Nautilus, finding adventure, fighting off giant squids, and my mom was right there by my side. She was always there by my side. No matter where the stories took me, she was my partner in crime. She would weave these worlds effortlessly for me while I lay in my blankets, dreaming up gigantic worlds full of fantasy and adventure. I never had to worry about anything because I knew my mom would protect me. Every time we finished a book, she would replace “The End” with “Once upon a time”, to teach me that no story is ever totally over.

Nowadays it seems to be the other way around. She hasn’t been too well, but that’s okay. Old age will do that to you. When I come into her room, I don’t know if she thinks I’m a nurse or a stranger or if she remembers her little boy. She doesn’t say much, but it doesn’t bother me. Mostly, I’ve accepted the position we’re in now. I go to the home every day to go see her.

Every night, after I’m done work, no matter what kind of day either one of us had, we become anything for an hour. I come into her room with a little model submarine, and I open up a book. And every single night, she smiles when I replace “The End” with “Once upon a time”.

"[WP] A Story that starts with ""The end"" and ends with ""Once upon a time""",Wolve909,"The end is near, the woman say, her eyes swollen with grief, and you try to swallow past the lump in your throat. You’re not very successful, though, as the next breath you take tastes like sickness. 

Sunny is holding the woman down, pinning her arms behind her back while she trashes with all of her remaining strength. His moles look like ashes on his nose, next to the feverish flush of his cheeks. For your part, you’re just sitting down on the ground, limp and motionless, staring at the scuffle without being able to muster up the energy to care. 

The building is dusty. It must have been a pretty cozy house before civilization fell, but in this day and age it’s nothing more than the barebones of a shelter. It doesn’t stink too much and the door is locked, though, so you consider yourself lucky. 

It’s pretty small. Somewhere not so far away, the woman’s kid is crying. He started bawling his eyes out when Maria took him out of the main room; you’d figure that even an eight years old knows what such a thing means in this world. You can’t find the energy to care. Brat was lucky enough to have his mother for all this time, that’s already a luxury. You feel very cold, and very disinterested. Sunny would probably want to keep him. You can foresee a lot of temper tantrums and diaper changes in the future, and you’re not happy about it. He always had a big heart, Sunny, and you’re a bit jealous of his tears. Yours dried out long ago. 

He’s tying her hands with ropes, now, mouth wobbling, and all of you know what comes next. The woman resumed to screaming incoherent strings of words into the carpet, intertwined with things that sounds suspiciously like sobs. You ignore it in favor of fixing your gaze on Sunny’s back as he gets up to fetch the knife – not the gun, you can’t afford to waste a bullet on an immobilized enemy. 
You know what comes next, and that’s why you get up, for once. You wobble for a second, because you sat there for so long, you can’t feel your legs anymore. Sunny is coming back, his face set into firm lines, and this, ladies and gentlemen, means that he’s ready to be the self-sacrificing idiot of the group by carrying this burden all by himself. 

You can’t have any of that. 

 He looks startled when he sees you up and walking, harsh features shattering in favor of the soft, soft man you’ve learned to know. He’s a good person, Sunny, good with children and somehow managing to be kind as the world collapses around him. Over anything, he’s precious, because people like him are rare and those are the ones humans need to go back on their feet. But hard times break those men, make them despair as strongly as they once hoped, and such a fate is unacceptable for Sunny. 

Oh so very carefully, you pluck Sunny’s fingers off of the knife, one by one, until he lets go of it. He looks heartbroken, there in the dim evening light. You know what he’s thinking – you know that man like the back of your hand, really. “I can’t make you do this”, he whispers, barely loud enough to be heard over the woman’s grunts. You laugh at that, cupping his face between your hands. He stills, looking entirely shocked. It’s understandable. It’s out of character for you. “Like you could make me do anything, kiddo”, you say with one last chuckle. “Now get lost. I have work to do.”

You divert your gaze when you spot the terrible relief that shines into his eyes. He’s a good person, Sunny, an honest and kind man. It doesn’t make him perfect, and certainly not any less of a coward than the rest of your kind. 
He leaves, and the soft click of the door behind him sounds deafening. You stay in place for a few seconds. The woman only lets out the occasional sob now. No doubt the sickness is creeping in. You have to do it now, you know it, but even you need time to pull yourself together before looking a woman in the eye and slashing her throat. 

When you turn around, she’s looking at you from behind stray strands of disheveled hair. She has green eyes, you note distractedly, like her son. Very pretty. They still look a bit crazed around the edges, but she seems to have calmed down a bit. It’s treacherous, and you know it. The calm before the storm. In a few hours at most, the sickness will hit with all its might, and there would be nothing human left behind those moss-green eyes. 

“Are you ready?” you ask, because you can at least be polite about the whole thing. For an instant, she seems like she might beg, but then she gets one good look at your face and stops dead in her tracks. You think she understands why you didn’t left it to Sunny to end her life. You’re too weary to yield before a human face, and, oh, isn’t that delightfully ironical? 

In the end, she nods slightly, and you sit down wearily, on the ground right next to her. She opens her mouth, toying with her thoughts for a moment. “Can you make it quick?” she murmurs in a soft, broken voice. You show her the desesperaty small knife in your hand, and shake your head. “You’ll have to bleed out”, you answer softly, “so that you won’t get back up.” A pause, and then you add: “You’ll stop feeling anything after a while.”

She exhales sharply, seemingly on the verge of tears for an instant. But it seems like there’s some steel in this woman in the end, because she swallows them down without breaking eye contact. “Will you stay with me?” You nod. “Could you… talk to me when I go? I don’t want to die listening to silence. Please.”
You smile a bit, and press your hand on her own, which is still awkwardly tied at her back. You don’t let her go though, because you’re not the kind of idiot who falls for pretty eyes. “Like a bedtime story?” you wonder a bit wryly, and she smiles back tightly. “Okay then.” You lay her down on her back so you have an easy access to the pale column of her neck, and pretend you don’t hear anything when she sniffles a bit. 

You shift your grip on the knife, and pause one last time, looking down in those fearful but steady eyes. They’re very green. Like still water. “When it comes, take it easy. You wouldn’t want to, but try.”

She breathes in, breathes out, and you slash her throat open. You hold the back of her head as she gags on her own blood, and try to think of something to say. 
“Once upon a time…”

"[WP] A Story that starts with ""The end"" and ends with ""Once upon a time""",Wolve909,"The End is a sore topic for me. My human subjects are so useful, and those who are faithful go to heaven, and hell is an average hotel with propaganda about how bad it is created by over-fearful believers. The humans are the most flexible, resilient and intelligent life forms I had ever created. So when the situation initiated, I had 10 billion souls, and 3 billion of them went to heaven. One person was a particular favourite though. John was extremely faithful and knew the bible was just a representation of my power. I never slaughtered with a wave. I just demonstrated my power. John was also a great writer.

I summoned him and told him of my plans to create new life forms, a new tree of power. Instead of intelligence, I wanted strength as a key element so when their world ran out of fuel I would reincarnate my subjects as the perfect life forms, strong and smart. Most of all, I wanted John to be my scribe, my faithful right hand man along with the spirit I created called Jesus by the men. With my power, after 3 hours of meditation, a new world came into existence. As the first tree grew, the tree of strength, John put his nib on the paper, and the first words were

Its day 6.",aPacPost,"Have you ever heard about how ancient civilizations use to believe that if you killed someone, you would absorb their ""power"" or their ""essence""? I thought it was silly at first too, but I've come to find some validity to their superstitions.

The last thing I remember from when I was alive was seeing my wife and newborn daughter in her arms flash before my eyes I felt splitting pain wracked across my body. It felt hot at first, like something with sharp nails raked themselves all over me and then all went cold until I stopped feeling all together. 

I don't remember much else before I died albeit after that happened though, remember the shock of how I got up from the floor to find my house now empty, with my family nowhere in sight. I don't even know how I had gotten there. The windows were boarded up, the locks were changed, and I found that every time I tried to touch anything, my hand or body went through it. It took time for me to come to terms with my new state of being, I even tried to leave the property that my house was on but I found I couldn't travel more than 20 feet from it and when I did, I moved my legs as if I was walking but instead of gaining traction with them, I floated! 

Time passed as I came to terms with my new self. I figured I woke up sometime in the year 1948 as that was the most recent newspaper year date on the newspapers that piled up at my doorstep. I used those over the years to count the time up until the year 2023 when the current president of the time set forth some sort of campaign to encourage the reduction of a majority of paper products or something. They stopped delivering papers after that. And by that time, everyone was using their portable telephones.

The house I lived in was renovated a few times by new owners. Apparently, the only way that I could communicate with them was by talking, to which they generally didn't seem interested in what I had to say. So I usually kept quiet, thinking of them as ""guests"" residing with me at the time. It was good to have company for a time and as time progressed, it was good to see new faces and marvel at how technology was changing since what they called ""The Great Depression"".

Around 2058, She came into my life. She was a young woman, probably no later than 24-25, definitely young when compared to me. When I saw her come through the door of my house, if I could faint, I'd be all over the floor like the time I died. Pardon me for a moment... I find it strange that I mention something like that.... I don't even remember how I died.....

She looked like the faint memories I had of my wife, very similar to her in fact, not the exact spitting image, but definitely she looked like her. I watched her for awhile, she didn't use her portable telephone like other guests did, hers had some feature which made little bumps on it instead of letters. I found that out when I tried to check the time on her telephone, I also found out whenever I got near her, I felt that pain all over me, and saw my hands, looking like cigarette smoke, floating towards her with some speed until it wrapped around her, seeming to I guess absorb me. I had also noticed the name on her lease. Susan Edgewood.... Edgewood... I felt like I knew that name from somewhere.... I spent the rest of that day trying to figure out what it all meant. I even tried speaking to her the next day. She seemed to ignore me.

The following month, her items were moved in. She had apparently came from a wealthy family. I tried talking to her every day when she was alone and every time she ignored me. Afterwards, with feelings of confusion of my lack of success, I'd float around the house, looking at her various possessions and by around her sixth day living in my house, it was by doing that, that I found her family photo scrap book from around the turn of the century. I had to ""slide"" my head through it to read it as I couldn't touch it. I saw people I didn't recognize from it, until I reached the last page. I saw Edgewood. My Former Boss: Cochran Edgewood. He was both involved in the mob and the occult, as a ""hobby"" he would say. As these memories and more of my life started flooding my semi translucent head, his last words to me silenced all other memories: ""Go back home, and wait. You soul belongs to my bloodline. Many moons to form, three moons to fill, my children will feed, their bellies you'll provide, now willing sacrifice die...."". The memory of him wearing some weird clothing pushing me from atop his building flashed through my mind, to be ended by the sound of air rushing past me and then a sicken wet harmony of a crunch and a smack broke my concentration. ""Three moons...."" I said to myself out loud, ""I need to get this woman out of my house.....""

This time he finally starts to open up.,bozzy253,"I’m the oldest angel and, I think, the only being God actually considers a friend. You think that might come with a bunch of perks – wrong. After I retired, my only duty is to keep the old man company while he drowns his divine sorrows in hard liquor. He never talks either, just sits there in his usual barstool, sighing to himself. 

This particular night we’re at an Irish pub near Belfast. Old whitey-white has already finished a row of shots and the barkeep is giving him a strange look.

“You’ve always been a good friend, Tron,” he says, lazily slurping on a cognac.

It’s been so long since I heard his voice. The memory is quite different from reality. It used to be thunderous and bombastic, now it’s quiet and shy.

“I’m here for you old buddy.” That is, after all, part of my retirement package.

“You know, it was easier before,” he mumbles. “Have I ever told you about the woman in Paris?”

This is new – almost two millennia without any insight into the big man’s mind. I shake my head vigorously, trying to encourage him to open up.

“There is a woman who lives near Notre Dame. Every day she walks into the church, kneels at the altar and prays for the same thing.”

“She doesn’t know you’ve stopped answering prayers.”

He laughs, but it’s a sad and tired one. He downs another shot in between his cognac sips.

“She is the reason I stopped.”

I wonder what this woman has done to cause such tremendous neglect from the creator. What horrendous act of heresy could possibly be the reason? Her prayers must be insincere to the point of satire – that’s the only explanation. 

“Her prayers are the most sincere ones on the planet, nobody can compete with her – not even the pope. And that’s the problem,” he continues.

I’m used to getting my mind read. Luckily I have nothing to hide, being this pure of heart and spirit. A lesser angel would perhaps not pass God’s immediate and intimate judgment.

“Did I ever tell you about Job?” he asks. “That little piece of shit?”

“Sure, everyone’s heard about Job.”

“Do you know why I screwed him over?”

“To prove to Mr. S that he was a devout follower even without your protection.”

Now he laughs again. I just don’t see the humor.

“Wrong,” he says. “You think I care what that horned little scumfuck thinks? I don’t need proof, I’m almighty!”

“Then why?”

“I ruined his life because I was bored. And they still wrote me off as the good guy in that scenario.”

“I see.”

“No, I don’t think you do, Tron. No offense.”

“None taken, Sir.”

He dabs his sweaty forehead with a handkerchief and orders a triple malt.

“Throughout the old days, I tried to teach these cretins a lesson. I showed them the difference between good and evil. The flood, Sodom &amp; Gomorrah, the seven plagues, the genocides of the tribes in Canaan, I even sacrificed my son (which really is just me on bad hair days) to myself  –  I wanted them to understand that claiming to be good and loving while doing evil does not make anyone good. I wanted my creations to learn morality and critical thinking for themselves.”

“Why not tweak them or give just them that from the start?”

“My dear, Tron. I guess you’ve never been into boat building?”

“I can’t say I have…”

“You build the boat, but once it’s in the water you want it to float by itself. Repairing and adjusting it on the fly will cause it to sink faster. It’s the same way with humans. I gave them free will because I wanted to see where the waters would take them.”

“I see. But since you’re almighty don’t you already know what will happen?”

“That’s the sweet thing about being omnipotent, nothing is beyond me. I can choose to not to know their future.”

“Ah! That certainly makes sense.”

“Anyway, Job and the entire Bible is a joke. Them writing all that stuff down was inevitable I guess – they were still in the development stage at that time. I was hoping they would’ve discarded that book by now. There are so many hidden secrets for them to discover if they could just stop worshipping and killing each other and get their asses off the planet.”

“Have you ever played an RPG?” he asks suddenly.

“I’ve dabbled in MUD and EverQuest a bit…”

“It’s like they’re stuck on level 1 and can’t get out of the newbie zone – and all because of that stupid book and their undying hope that I will boost them to epic level.”

“I get it.”

“That woman in Paris, she has the strongest faith I’ve seen, and all she wants is more followers on twitter. It’s really quite disturbing. If she would just try to be interesting instead of praying all day, it would already have happened. She has the potential to be the biggest name on social media but her unshakable faith is holding her back. Six thousand years and they still don’t get morality or have developed critical thinking. It’s like I shot myself in the foot and it’s really quite depressing to watch their struggle. ”

[WP] It turns out that God is actually real but he is extremely shy. You are a retired angel that gets a drink with God every week. This time he finally starts to open up.,bozzy253,"The rain splatters heavily against the pavement as people ran along the pavement, trying to avoid getting themselves wet. The sun that was setting in the horizon signaled yet another end of a week, in the infinite cycle of time. I smiled as I reached my destination, a small bar just right at the corner of the down. 

The doors gave an old creak as I pushed them opened, revealing a cozy interior inside, full of chatty patrons looking to celebrate the end of the week. And just like always, seated near the corner of the room was Him. Dressed in a white suit and pants.

""You know, you gotta change your colours, they're too eye catching,"" I said as I slid next to Him, a bottle of beer in my hand.

He looks at me, grinning. ""You always say that Michael, but you know I can't do that.""

""Yes, yes, all the too pure talk, I know."" I raised my beer to Him, and He raised His glass of water. My bottle met with a familiar clink to his glass, and His water turned instantly into wine. He never gets bored of the trick.

As the cold beer flow down my throat, I noticed that He was staring at a young man seated not far from us. I nudged His shoulders. ""So, what's his story?""

He played with the wine in His glass, His eyes never leaving the guy. ""Just married but just lost his job, wondering how to tell his pregnant wife, cursing me with every gulp of the beer. Hates life, hates everyone else, thinks that I am treating him badly.""

I laughed. ""So, why not talk to him and prove him wrong then?""

He turned to stare at me, His face serious. ""You know I can't, Michael. Just like the shirt. I can't.""

""Bullshit,"" I retorted. ""I was there when you first created everything, when you breathed life into this world, when you bravely tried to give these people direction, when you bravely died for them. You have done so much, and yet now you can't even talk to a guy on the verge of giving up?""

He could only shake His head, before returning His attention to the wine before Him. ""I can't bring myself to interfere anymore, Michael. The last time I tried, remember what happened? Hundreds and thousands got killed because of me. Just because they believed.""

He still blames Himself for what happened.

""And look what good did that do?"" He continued. ""Not only did the world NOT improve, there was the Crusades, the Inquisition and hell knows what remains of what I tried to start. I am not talking to humans again. It never ends well.""

I gave a long sigh, not knowing what to say. We have had this talk before, hundred of years ago, and it did not end well. I tried to convince Him that the future of humanity did not look good without Him, but He merely said that humans should be left to themselves to decide their own fate, free from His interference. 

I left the job that very same day, citing a need for retirement. 

""You now, Lucifer has been having a great time this year when you're still too afraid to talk to humans,"" I muttered under my breath. 

He glared at me. ""Don't use that name to provoke me. You know very well too that he has his limits too, and I will not allow any influence beyond what's given to him."" And then He emptied his entire glass of wine in one gulp. When He laid down the glass on the table again, the glass began to magically refill.

""You got to teach me that trick one day,"" I joked trying to change the subject.

He smiled at me, that reassuring smile that made you feel that He knew everything that you are thinking. And He probably did, anyway. ""I promise you, if anything happens that requires me stepping in, I will. I don't like interacting with humans, but that doesn't mean I won't.""

I returned His smile. They didn't call Him God for no reason. ""I know. And 2017 probably will most likely need you anyway.""

We both laughed as we raise our drinks. ""To yet another new year,"" He said.

""To another new year,"" I replied. ""And may you bless us all.""

⌲: Woah! What the f-- Who was that?

⌀: Oh, that's the guy assigned to their God. He went nuts about 1300 years back and decided to re-RE-RE do his plan for mass thought control to try to get them a religious organization that would push things forward and work against their inherent nature. Actually worked out for a while, they got around to naming most of the stars they could see instead of raping and burning each other for the most part.

⌲: For the most part?

⌀: Yeah. The first, or maybe the second I forget, got pissed off at the ""new"" religion and systematically attacked them until the entire area descended into war. They kept doing it, too. Was like four major assaults over a couple hundred years. Determined little fuckers when they think they're right.

⌲: That's gotta sting. Your old creation corrupts your new one?

⌀: Right? No wonder he's so pissy.

ܜ: Hey you two wanna shut the fuck up, please? He can hear you.

⌲/⌀: GAAAAH!

ܜ: What?

⌀: Who the fuck are you!?

ܜ: Uh, I've been living here since before YOU got here, shit eyes.

⌲: Oh wow, you're tiiiiiny!

ܜ: Yeah and I also have a direct line to your boss so knock it off with the racism, I don't appreciate that shit. 

⌀: Have you seriously just been living in the console this entire ti--

⌲: Wait, back up. You have a ""direct line"" to their God? The guy we heard earlier, right? Is he...Okay?

ܜ: Being a God is hard, especially for these tumor-heads. The big guy never particularly wanted that job but he's been doing his best for a few thousand years now. Doesn't help that all the other guys quit so now you've basically just got one God trying to run half a dozen different religions down there. 

א: THEY NEVER KNOW WHAT THE FUCK THEY WANT

ܜ: See?

⌲: ...Can he hear us the whole time?

ܜ: Omniscience, bitches. One of the better-sounding job perks until you realize you don't get to turn it off while you're on the clock. He can hear me, both of you, the other guys up here, and aaaaaaall of them down there.

⌀: That has to suck.

ܜ:  Prick! Uuuuughhh...I can't be mad. He's just depressed. He knows this whole project is doomed but he's really trying his best, you know? Like, can you imagine it? You're stuck caring for a whole sentient species that was an accident in the first place, has been confined to their home planet, nobody wants them, not even themselves, and YOU'RE in charge of making sure they get hospice care until we either get sick of keeping them around or they finally kill themselves. Anyway, that plane crash was near a pretty sweet bar, so I figured I'd introduce you two a neat earth delicacy they've concocted to help ease the pain of existence. Since, you know, SOMEONE isn't doing a very good job at it right now! It's called tequila, here, try some.

[WP] It turns out that God is actually real but he is extremely shy. You are a retired angel that gets a drink with God every week. This time he finally starts to open up.,bozzy253,"I’d been working for the Department of Living Relations for nearly 400 years before I bumped in to Him outside of the office. It was at this tiny dive bar pretty close to work that I frequent. Goallweh, as my co-workers and I have taken to calling Him, was already more than a few rounds in. 

“MIKE! Hey buddy! Come on over and I’ll buy you one!” Goallweh bellowed as He noticed me. 

I didn’t even think he knew my name. I sheepishly looked around, rather embarrassed to be called out by name. I slowly made my way over to the corner of the bar He is holding down and pulled up a stool. 

“Thank you, sir, for offering to buy me a drink.”

“Anytime Mike, but you can drop the formality.” He said while gesturing to the barkeep to pour a pint for me.

“Sure thing…” I trail off realizing that I have no idea what His name really is, the living call him so many different ones it’s hard to guess which one is correct. “This is going to sound bad, but what is your name?”

He laughed; a genuine, deep rooted, belly laugh.

“I’ve gone this long without correcting people, I’m not even sure what my name is. Just call me El. It’s the easiest one to remember, and the least pretensions sounding.” He said, smiling broadly.

“Sounds good, El; but what do you mean you have never corrected people before? If you don’t mind me asking.”

“Well, I think the first time it happened it was a typo, someone missed a semi-colon and accidentally started a message to the Shaddai people with: ‘I am El Shaddai, be fruitful and multiply…’ instead of ‘I am El; Shaddai, be fruitful and multiply…’”

I felt my stomach drop. I remember delivering that one, I just thought He was being pretentious and didn’t correct it.

“Just a stupid mistake.“ El continued as I tried to hide my embarrassment. ”With so many languages, dialects, slang, and need to be the sect that does it differently; before too long it was Yahweh, Allah, Adonai, Lord, God, Jehovah, , and others. I’m sure you’ve heard all of them.” 

I nodded. “So what happened? Did they just ignore you when you came back and said ‘Hey, listen, my name is El.’?”

“Ignore me? Probably not, but I just didn’t want to deal with it.”

“Didn’t you correct them?” I asked as my eyes went wide.

“No.” He replied quietly, looking down at the bar.

“Why not?”

“Well, dealing with people is just hard. I don’t really like confrontations. It was just easier to roll with it. Besides they might think less of me.”

“Think less of you? You are a god to them, if you pardon the expression.”

“Yeah, I mean… They might not like me if I tell them they are wrong.”

“But they **are** wrong, and they should call you by your actual name. Besides all that, it might reverse a lot of the confusion that has happened over the millennia.”

“I don’t know, maybe it is easier to just keep things the way they are. I mean, I’ve been doing it for so long and it’s not so bad.”

“Not so bad? You have like 50 different names, and 50 different groups of people that are always asking you for things, different things for every group. It has to be a lot of work to keep it all straight. What happens when you give the wrong answer to the wrong person?”

“I dunno... It’s been going on for so long I don’t think I should try and correct them now. Besides it seems to all be working.”

“I don’t know about all that. I think they will still respect you if you correct them.”

“But correcting people might make them feel bad. I mean they are just trying to do their best, who am I to tell them that they made a mistake with my name?”

“You are El, and that should be what they are calling you. It’s your name.”

“As long as they are following what I am saying I don’t see the difference.”

“You use the DoLR for all your communication with them though, and that was what started this whole name thing in the first place. I think if you did it in person it will work out just fine.”

“In person? I really don’t like doing that. The DoLR makes it easier, like the entire thing with Abraham and his goat. I didn't feel comfortable asking him for it myself so I sent someone.”

“Abraham and his goat?”

“Yeah, I sent a DoLR Agent to tell Abraham to go to Moriah and sacrifice a baby goat to me. I want to make a stew.”

My eyes went wide with terror. “Baby goat, a kid? Not, like, his kid?”

“Yes, why do you ask?”

“Well, I was talking to Gabe the other day and he mentioned that he delivered a message to ‘some sad sack named Abraham’ and that he felt the word ‘kid’ wasn’t professional sounding and he changed it to ‘son’.”

“Oh.”

“’Oh.’? Just ‘Oh.’? How is that an ‘Oh.’ Abraham is going to kill his **son** to prove he loves you. How does that register as an ‘Oh’?”

“Well, I mean, I guess stew is out of the question… I’m sure Abraham won’t do it, he’s pretty smart.”

“So you are not going to stop him?”

“I don’t want to seem wishy-washy. Besides Abraham likes me, I don’t want to upset him.”

“So you are going to risk the life of Isaac, his only son, because you are too damn shy to correct a mistake?”

“I’m not shy! I just don’t want to stir the pot.

“And you don’t like talking to people, and you don’t like correcting mistakes. You probably didn’t even follow up with the DoLR on that whole name thing.”

El sat stunned. “I don’t know about all that, besides I like I said, it was just a simple mistake.”

“It was, and it was my mistake; and I am sorry about it. I am sorry about this too. You need to get your shit together, be a little bit more careful, and sack up for these ‘simple mistakes’ before someone is hurt.”

“Maybe you are right… but I really don’t like people. They are needy, and touchy.”

“Then hire someone to do it for you, someone to proof read and hand deliver these messages. Or just stop sending messages.”

“Maybe stopping would be easier, at least until I find someone like you said. Could you do me a favor though?”

I grab my jacket since I know what he is about to ask. “Sure I will go stop him, thanks for the drinks.”

[WP] It turns out that God is actually real but he is extremely shy. You are a retired angel that gets a drink with God every week. This time he finally starts to open up.,bozzy253,"The bell above the door chimed as I entered. The whole place was very…mortal. As was the reason for the bell above the door. You see there is a saying among those upon the world of man, that every time a bell chimes an Angel gets its wings. Not only is this false, that the bell is above a door used almost exclusively by Angels to enter a pub called Wings, is considered, to the owner of the establishment, a good joke.

The owner of this kitsch, mortal-themed, house of revelries is an angel. Much like myself, he is retired; for an Angel this simply means a loss of capitalisation – no longer being Angels, but angels instead. We still have the wings and the love, though.

Wings, the pub, was not a favorite place of mine. Nor was the angel behind the bar a personality I sought out to spend time with; but, it is where, once a week, I find an old friend. 
God.

Yes, that one.

***
I sat next to Him at the bar (capitalisation - very important) and Azzendiel started to pour me a beer. The retired angel had a gruff look on his face and a jacket of leather that billowed at the back - on account of his wings. Firstly, angels cannot get drunk - nor can we truly be sullen. But, given the reach of eternity and the inevitable influence the humans have on us, some have come to enjoy a few moments of make believe.

I took the beer and did my traditional look around the establishment. He, the capitalised He, didn’t like it if I lead with a salutation. He had to be warmed up first. Wings, though styled after a dark and dingy hole in Chicago, was spotless and too bright. Dust was hard to come by on this plane of existence, let alone dirt, and the whole shady establishment vibe doesn’t work so well in a place where light seems to come from the air itself.
“Bit dead, I see.” I said, as I had, many times before.

“’s ‘ow I likes it, see.” Said Azzendiel. Angels, capitalised or otherwise, don’t often have accents. Nor usually do they run bars, wear leather jackets and adopt the name Dom - but Azzandiel was a special case.

A thump rung out as the empty pint glass was put down. We looked at Him. As He pushed the glass towards Dom with one hand, the other hand wiped the foam from His mustache. I knew then, that it was time for each of us to play our roles.

Azzandiel as Dom, the barmen.

I, an old angel, as the talkative friend.

And He, the strong and silent type.

***

A mortal sport was on the TV, and a few empty shot glasses sat, rims-down (‘s ‘ow ‘s done, Dom had said once, long ago, straining his accent), and I was holding half a beer and talking about a few of my old cases from my days as an Angel.

I should perhaps describe Him. But, I cannot. He looks like Him or Her or Whomever. A look of whatever fits. It is perhaps, more important that you know that Dom – the angel Azzendiel – and, in fact, any other entity that rings the bell above the door, will see not Him, but an ordinary angel. All of them that is except, myself. This is His choice. He, despite a penchant for creation and a list of trillions upon trillions that bare his touch, does not particularly enjoy company or conversation.

Do not think him curmudgeonly.

He is, in fact, shy. Imagine being a tad shy, and a trillion billion beings keep trying to talk to you. It’s a challenge.
“And that was the last time I helped an Italian on a Bicycle.” I said.

Dom chuckled and He smiled. The story was an old one, and I had told it before, but we were all playing our parts.
“Ohhh, good ‘it.” Dom said as one mortal on the screen did something with a ball. Then he returned to rubbing a clean rag on a clean glass.

Then it happened. God spoke. And he spoke.

It is said that the voice of God alone can create a world, and to have him speak to you would destroy your mind. This is not the case: his words *can* create worlds, but to hear them would do no harm to you. Unless of course, he wanted them to, I suppose.

His words, though, are not words in the sense that you and I may know them. They are the building blocks of the universe, and to translate them is difficult.

He spoke on and on.

I can tell you this. He was happy. Happy that it had all happened. But he was sad that the end had at last appeared upon the horizon.

As he finished speaking, our worlds, that of Dom and You and I, had changed.

He wanted us all to have some time. And wanted us to forgive him.

The bar was dark. There was not total darkness, but compared to the sourceless light with which it had once been lit, it may have well has been. I could feel grit upon the bar surface, and tears upon my cheeks. The glass Dom dropped, shattered on the floor.

I turned and saw him – horror on his face, a well fitted jacket on his back.

We could feel it.

The mortality.

The end is nigh, friends. But I shall endeavor to stop it. God just needs to sit and talk with an old friend. That’s all. Surely.

"[WP] ""The contents of his nightmares"" they said, ""are classified.""",carrja99,"My Dad is a scientific equipment salesman. At least, that is what he tells us. His job requires that he travels a lot. He has sent postcards from virtually every continent. When he comes home from a business trip, he is often full of exciting stories and he brings gifts for me, my mum and siblings. Something went wrong the last time.

The trip was longer, he stayed for over a year - normally travels from between two weeks to a month. Throughout his absence , his employer could not tell us where he was or what was up although they kept paying his salary to my mother's account after the second month. Mother told me that was her first surprise, she didn't know Dad earned so much.  

When eventually he returned last moth, we didn't get to know for a couple of weeks. One day his boss showed up and said Dad was back, he had had a nervous breakdown . We all went to go and see him then but he looked at us like we were strangers, he couldn't recognize us. See, he also suffered an almost total memory loss. The doctor said he rarely sleeps but has frequent nightmares.

Apart from these issues, he appeared to be healthy. Mum wanted to bring him and help him get better but they wouldn't let us. So Mum got her lawyer involved but not before Dad was transferred from the hospital to what appeared to be a classified government facility.

Our first day in court, the D.A requested a meeting in the Judge's chamber  to share some information. ''Mrs. Smith"", he said to mum. "" Your husband has been part of a classified government department. His loss of memory is a security issue. ''

But Mum insisted she just wanted him to come home, he could always go back when he regains his memory.

But the patronizing DA insisted, "" We are not bothered about what he forgets, the trouble is that he remembers stuff when he is asleep. ""

The judge made it obvious he was on their side. He would not be allowed to come home. And we had only two options; to sign a non disclosure agreement or be served with a court gag order, there and then.

The crow's nest was filled with monitors, designed to provide full view of the area without being hampered by the biting cold and windstorms.

Robin was hooked up to the nest more closely, a headset placing everything directly in front of her eyes. Radar, radio, infrared, and a variety of other sensors were kept under her constant watch. It was impressive, her ability to juggle so many things at once. The rock music blaring in the chamber, she liked less.

""Robin?"" she poked the girl in her back. Robin jerked upwards, pulling the headset of her head swiftly.

""Eleanor, what's up?"" she said quickly. Robin always spoke quickly. She looked up at her, placing the device down on the desk. She was barely fifteen, having entered the ship's crew by betraying the merchant vessel her parents were on. She was... nice enough, if somewhat maniacal.

""Briefing for the warehouse mission,"" Eleanor explained simply.

""Oh, this is going to be great,"" Robin pulled open a small cupboard. The girl lived in the tiny room, only coming down for meals,showers and meetings. She survived, somehow, with just a small cot and a tiny desk for furniture.

Robin spread her tools out over the bed. As with everyone else, she served two roles in the team. On the ship, she kept an eye out for security and police ships. While boarding, she cracked safes, picked locks and used explosives.

Her argument was that the explosives acted as breaching charges, and thus were absolutely essential mission equipment. Robin was busy shoving a single set of lockpicks into her satchel, accompanied by three blocks of C4, two grenades, three flashbangs, and a number of mysterious vials.

""Right, well, see you downstairs, yes?"" Eleanor patted Robin on the shoulder and turned to head down the ladder.

""I've got a faster way down!"" Robin offered.

""Really?"" Eleanor asked, intrigued. Her muscles were starting to ache from the climb up, and heading back down would no doubt be worse.

""Hold this, I'll rig it for you,"" Robin handed her what looked like the end of a hose. ""Tightly, you hear?""

""Yeah, come on, show me the thing,"" Eleanor gripped the rope tightly.

""Basically it's just..."" Robin fiddled with a plate on the side of the chamber, then turned around quickly and shoved her out of the chamber.",poiyurt

2018
San Bernardino Job Fair 

The kid has a license, why am I dealing with parents.

""Well you have to understand Best Buy spent years encouraging us to be the James Bonds and Kim Possibles of our profession. Why should we give up the fun, prestige, and yes, the job titles because some manager gave us the slip?”

Deputy Field Marshal. That's my title. I got the slip and walked away with that and a slightly battered 2011 Volkswagen Beetle. I found my new career shortly after listing the car in Craigslist. It was one of 1,800 hundred that would go up for sale that week.


The kid, Michael, is set. Dad won't be hard to win. But the mother is gonna be tough. She's fidgeting and taking an unhealthy amount of interest in the Parks Department internship brochure that had been tucked in her bag.

""And how safe are these delivery jobs? I've seen your trucks, they’re kind of beat up."" Pipes the unenthused father. ""Well all of our vehicles get regular maintenance, and everything is fully insured. Investing in the Geek Squad fleet was crucial to our start up.” Like I said Craigslist was lousy with the white and black vehicles. I heard there was a demolition derby in San Jose. 

“And, as a new Agent Michael will start off with a senior agent. He’ll run routine local deliveries up until his 18th."". Michael looks up from his phone briefly to ask me about pay. He's ""heard"" we pay a bit above the local average. It's true, and well documented in our reviews as employers which I’m sure he’s browsing through on his phone. I anticipate he'll ask about employee breaks after glancing through another two reviews. He's a good kid and will probably do well with us for the few years before he lands in a school. That's if we can get him out of Mom's downwash. 

""Why are we even discussing this? They're all just a gang of thieves. Susan's blog dedicated this last week to articles about the pirates, and the Geeks are the worst. Last month they stole more than a hundred drones! Not just the deliveries but whole drones. Mike Blancherd was saying they’re going to move the warehouse to Irvine just to avoid the thieves. His family just moved in two years ago for the job. Is it crazy to want your kids to grow up in one neighborhood? And two weeks ago they arrested some pirates with 900 pounds of cocaine. Soon the cartels will be arming the drones and turning LA into a bloodbath!"" Her tirade let me catch up on some e-mails. Her rant means I’m going to spend five minutes convincing them the pirates have no connections to our budget delivery service and that Michael will only find safe, career building opportunities with us. I don't want to lie to the parents. It's gonna get me a black eye or a trashed car one of these days. But these kids born in the last two decades were making adult decisions by the time they were twelve. The parents need to back off a little, The kids can handle real life experience. And it's only one lie. If Michael wants he can drive deliveries, get a small investment and then after a couple years of school blow that investment on some world travel. Or he can sail the seas as one of the Geek Squad Corsairs.

Delivery piracy really didn't take off until 2017. Amazon's first deliveries were New Year's Day 2015. By Q3 of that year there were an estimated 3,100 drone deliveries in Los Angeles a day. The independent sector was gobbling up the business that the Post Office and big box 
stores had starved on. A delivery truck could be sold and turned into 4 drones and pollution credits would pay to retrain your drivers to drone support jobs. The low hanging fruit went first, drones grabbed from front yards or shot out of the air. The drone operators responded with higher altitudes, random courses, and tiny delivery windows. Pirates got organized and made investments. GPS spoofing was expensive and you never knew what you would plunder. An inside man meant you knew what you were stealing but the risks of getting caught were high. Hunter Killers were worth their weight in gold, but cost quite a bit more. With brilliant magnet interdiction or a vibration engine on an independent arm you could hit 18 or more deliveries in an hour. In July of 2017 Walgreens lost 600 drones when their holiday lighting upgrades opened a backdoor in the programing. Not only was it a major loss for Walgreens but piracy rates saw rapid growth over the next couple months as drones were converted to cheap Hunter Killers. Drone operators funneled a lot of money and staff into program security. But whaling, the practice of capturing drones for illicit use ensured there were plenty of new drones for the pirates.

Small Drones are easy and can handle recon and security easily. But for cargo theft or dronenapping you would need big drones. Powerful drones. Drones with energy to spare. Drone defenses were good and getting better. Losing a heavyweight whaler to blade crippling chaff or unbalancing foam spray would put most outfits out of business. If you did get away with your treasure then you had to watch out for tracking drones and ONstar. You might get caught and not know it for months as they built a case on you. Plenty of guys would retire early just to get 
nabbed a few months into their new routine. But if you didn't get caught, or fly your drone into something hard, you could retire from crime well.  ",ianingf

"[WP] Amazon's flying warehouse delivery system is in full effect all over the world. You are a sky pirate, about to strike the biggest goldmine in your life.",ekazu129,"The world in 2139 is....well different. Especially here in the UK. London is now a semi-aquatic city, beautifully recrafted to be the Venice of the North. In truth, its returned to its roots as a waterside settlement, with canals and waterways reaching deep into the southbank and City of London. Roads are long gone, submerged under several metres of murky water. The new youth live in high rises, converted office blocks that have been re-engineered to withstand the tides and pressure of the water on their foundations.

With no roads, no pavements and no railways, travelling by air is the norm. Airships have become popular again as they don't need a runway, and can land on top of buildings to drop residents off to their watery dwellings. Drones are now everywhere - they are the backbone of our new civilisation. They deliver daily items to the millions of citizens living in the lagoon, but they are dwarfed by the Autocarriers.

Autocarriers are massive, aircraft carrier sizes floating behemoths, not airships but full on gravity defying cargo vessels shipping priceless goods around the world, to docks high up or low down near the waterline in most cities. They are incredible machines, almost completely unmanned save for Sentinels (elite private security teams paid by the AmazonCorp), and a team of combat drones that operate on deck and in the air around the Carrier, protecting it at all times. 

Air piracy has become more and more rampant. Failed states like Somalia, North Korea and countries that are friendlier to independent merchantmen are rife with pirate crews, looking to take down an Autocarrier and sell the cargo for billions on the black market. Only a few have succeeded, the world famous crew of the Vanquish, a retrofitted Antonov 225 cargo plane - they boarded an Autocarrier over Moscow, took over and ziplined most of the precious cargo into the Vanquish' cargo bay, then simply unhooked and flew away. This was in the age before private security and combat drones though...

Anyway, enough about the past. This is our turn, our time to be famous, our time to rich beyond stupid. My name is Cleod (pronounced Cloud) and I am a Air Pirate. My crew is Jimmy, Frank, Butters and Fidget. Jimmy is weapons, hes ex Royal Marines (back when we had a Monarchy). Frank is demolitions and engineering - hes the best at coming up with creative ways to get us out of a jam. Butters....hes not very pretty to look at, but hes very, very good at sneaking up on unsuspecting henchmen. Fidget, hes non stop. Hes also very small, so hes good at getting in and out of very tight spaces, useful for when your hijacking a trillion dollar aircraft.

Anyway, back to point. In our secret hangar, we have recently stashed and started to work on our secret weapon. It cost me more than I am willing to admit to you, but she is a beauty. A true workhorse, powerful, versatile and can take an absolute pounding before shell go down. She is called Matilda, and she is a Chinook helicopter. 

Yes, I know. Shes nearly 200 years old. But we have the parts and the fuel, weapons and a pilot (me). Our target? The Bezos. The biggest Autocarrier in the AmazonCorp fleet. Its also the most well armed, the fastest, most well protected piece of paramilitary hardware in the world, period. Its estimated worth, when empty, is about $400 billion. When full, transporting anything from Gold bullion, to military equipment, to sports cars, to entire armies, its worth is nearly incalculable. 

We have an inside man at AmazonCorp, one of the chief combat drone designers, who has agreed to help us for a cut of the profits. He designed in a unique acoustic recognition software that actively listens for a specific ""disarm"" signal. His name is Vikram. Our fathers knew each other when they were in the Royal Marines together, and I managed to ...persuade him that his loyalties lay with the common, good people of the world, rather than a faceless mega corporation. 

So, once Vikram gave us the code, we would fly into intercept, taking off vertically underneath The Bezos and then circle around, from under to over and land on the roof. Now, this thing is huge, I mean, vast. It shouldn't fly, but it does. Its around the size of 3 Nimitz class aircraft carriers. It is just unimaginably large. You could land 5 jumbo jets on its roof and it wouldnt notice. Once we are on board, we will make a beeline for the cockpit. Its on the underside of the aircraft, so we will have to get Fidget to find a sneaky way in. Once we are inside, the plan is to get the Chinook to the rear while the crew are distracted with us. This is the elaborate part. The Chinook will fly ...backwards...with its tailgate open, so we can do exactly what the crew of the Vulcan did. Zipline the cargo back to the Matilda....",airwalkerdnbmusic

You are a sky pirate, about to strike the biggest goldmine in your life.",ekazu129,"The faint glimmer of blue light flickered off the surface of his glasses as he went to adjust them. He was still wearing the same pair he'd always had.  He remembered getting the things  -delivered right to his door - couldn't help but admire the two-day shipping at the time. Although, nowadays Gavin got his packages with a certain selfish acquisition. 

Gavin grew up on books and the soft orange light of day peering through the curtains to light his pages. He always loved the one's about pirates. The swashbuckling sea dogs with nothing but a ship beneath their boots and a crew to man it. 

But he soon traded in the seven seas, to the sea of information found behind his monitors - he had stumbled upon a few extra in one of his 'scavengings.' It wasn't all so different though. His keys thrummed away like the sound of crashing waves undertow and every breath Gavin took felt like it gave wind to his sails. He even had a crew.

One doesn't just take on the largest Internet retailer alone. Amazon was a freaking fortress; that was, until they began that new drone project - anything to be one step ahead. But that step was the last one on the plank and now Amazon would fall, right in to his trap. The system that ran flights was rock solid, Gavin couldn't break in even if he was given time and the key to the front door. But individually, the drone software left something to be desired. 

Today one of Gavin's deckhands, as he called them, caught wind of an anomaly. A big ticket item had been scheduled for purchase and set off one of his red flags meaning the customer selected ""drone shipping."" But it wasnt just one, for whatever bloody reason, there was 20 drones that came online glowing red on Gavin's display.

Shit! Had they finally caught wind of all the waves he'd been making in thier precious delivery service. He only had 45 minutes between the time the drones left the facility and the time they reached the house. Could he break through that many in that short of time? It had always just been one. An offline drone once a month and a missing package never raised enough alarms to get the full attention of Amazon's internet security. Shit! They were totally mocking him. If they thought this lousy trick was enough to stop him. But he was stumped. Maybe he'd get lucky and guess right. There's no way to be sure. But... If he didn't do this now, all he'd ever be is a petty thief stealing pennies out of wishing wells. He muttered something under his breath that seemed to shatter the silence of his dark room, ""I'm a pirate.""

Whatever courage he seemed to be lacking returned to him. There was a comfort of knowing his place, on the deck of his own ship, and at the desk of his own operation. He always ran the mission himself. Gavin would stand for no mutiny, not for a project that was so many years in the making. One misstep would be the end of it all. Knowing fully that it was him at the lead, he was willing to go down with his ship. 

He cracked his knuckles, took one last sip of coffee, and began his work...",ProfessorQThresh

"[WP] Amazon's flying warehouse delivery system is in full effect all over the world. You are a sky pirate, about to strike the biggest goldmine in your life.",ekazu129,"""Sir! The ship is getting closer!"" A crew mate announced. Soon after, the captain bellowed, ""Fire the forward guns! Aim for the outer engines!""

Shots rang out from the forward of the ship. Of the four engines aboard the Amazon warehouse, or an Amazon Wareship, two were taken out. The ship of the pirates was then made able to speed up and catch the ship with a broadside.

""Prepare to fire broadsides!"" Demanded the captain.

""Broadsides ready, sir!"" announced his Chief Gunman.

""Fire!"" Shouted the captain.

3 sets of 20 shots rang out from the ship. Not a one among them missed their target. Though an effective boarding hole had not yet been made in the Wareship, the captain still announced that they would begin boarding. The boarding party prepared themselves - putting on Oxygen masks and preparing their boarding rifles. One man among them had a bomb, effective for blowing open a human-sized hole in the ship. 

The hole was blown into the Drone Deck - one floor below where they needed to be. On a normal sized Wareship, the security would have been too tight for them to have effectively managed. However, this one was small, and this security was overpowered. They made it to the Control Bridge, and was able to stop any distress calls and everything. 

After that was handled, they made their way to the Storage section. This is when they moved all of the cargo to their ship; after this, it could all be sold at some town. Actually, it had to - if they were caught with all this by the Amazon Navy, they would be near instantly shot down.

It didn't matter, however, as an Amazon Naval vessel spotted them still connected to the Wareship. 

The battle lasted a mere 15 minutes. Shots rang out from both sides. But, in the end, no pirated goods would be sold to anyone.",Joshsed11
"[WP] Amazon's flying warehouse delivery system is in full effect all over the world. You are a sky pirate, about to strike the biggest goldmine in your life.",ekazu129,"""How far is it?"" the Captain asked suddenly, breaking the silence like a bullet through glass. The eight men around him looked up and shifted from where they stood, leaning restlessly against the dusty walls of the old farmhouse.

I looked down at the GPS in my hand, screen centered around a pulsating red dot. ""About 20 miles away. But on course, like you said.""

""Alright,"" the Captain nodded, and walked over to peer out of the windowpane, ""check your packs. It's almost time.""

I ran my hands over the cold steel clamps which secured the the jetpack to my body. I could hear the others doing the same, pulling taut the straps around their chests, checking the clips in their rifles, tightening boots and headbands. Dust billowed up from the floorboards in the commotion, casting a stale haze throughout the room. After the checks were done, the Captain walked outside, and we followed suit, one by one.

As we exited the broken down farmhouse to stare across the dry Texas plain, I felt a nudge and a gruff voice from the side.

""You ready?""

I didn't have to look over to know that Solomon was smiling through his painted face and wild hair, eyes wide with anticipation. Crazy fuck. I glanced at the Captain, and the others coming around to stand in a semicircle on the cracked ground. Less than half the men we had last time. Solomon was the only one smiling. I shook my head.

""Remember last time we tried to hit a guarded shipment?"" I said.

Solomon laughed. ""Most of those guys were recruits, not even true Screamers. Dead weight. 'Member how that one sandy-haired bastard tried to desert on us?"" Solomon spit. ""Shot that one myself. Watched him fall.""

Just then, one of the other men raised his arm and pointed at a speck across the gray sky. Everyone looked. Within a few moments, the men began to rise off the ground, as the shrieking sound of their jetpacks filled the air. I turned on my own, and felt the machine reverberate throughout my entire body.

""Besides,"" Solomon shouted over the din, as we lifted into the sky, ""We steal this machine, we will never run out of water again. Think about that! We steal this machine, your son will never go thirsty again!""

Below me, the farmhouse became smaller and smaller in the distance, blending in with the dying land. As the Amazon shipment and several figures began to take shape in the sky ahead of us, I ran a dry tongue over my cracked and bloody lips. I tightened my grip on my rifle. ",westcoastpheromones

That ain't one of them shake weights, that's for sure."" Dante, the captain's right-hand collapsed his telescope (19.95 with Prime membership) and headed to the drone ships lower deck to tell his superior of his findings.

""Sir. There's a hefty package 3 nautical miles North, headed towards Green Bay.""

Captain Flute was a man that did not take kindly to being bothered. Especially when he was reading e-books on his Kindle Fire (89.99 with Prime membership). 

""This best be a worthy treasure Dante. I'm 5 chapters into Amy Schumer's memoir (14.99 with Prime membership), and I'm eager to hear more of her smelly pubes. That wretched whore. But you know, she's aware of it and that makes her kind of likable.""

""Yes captain. I have heard the tales. But there is not much time to retrieve this bountiful shipment.""

The Captain stepped up to the bow of the great drone ship, reached into his deep pocket, and retrieved his remote control. 

""All hands on deck. We should be there in like five, maybe seven if there's traffic. Adam Levine's in town, so you know how it is.""

The Captain's assessment proved most accurate. Adam Levine was in town, and the trip took 7 minutes. They arrived next to the package. Dante, who was a Princeton educated physicist, obviously, calculated the velocity of the package and programmed the ship to match it. The package now appeared still as a photo beside the ship. A still photo I mean, not one of those moving ones on the new iPhones. What's the point of those anyway? Isn't that what videos are for?

""Okay Dante. Now use the giant claw to retrieve our prize.""

""The Giant Claw"" was an apt name for the device Dante had built to retrieve packages because not only was it a claw, it was also giant. The package was also giant, but not quite as giant as the Giant Claw so the package was retrieved with ease.

As the captain stared at another day's bounty, he wondered if one day he might try his hand at a more noble profession, like an office manager. Then, he can order supplies from Amazon Prime, with an office credit card. He'd be able to open boxes aplenty everyday, and break no laws. The captain closed his eyes and for a moment this became his truth. He felt fine with himself for the first time since he was a boy. In a moment, this fantasy disappeared as Dante ripped open the box that encased his stolen fortune.

It was a dinette set (234.99 with Prime Membership).

"[WP] Amazon's flying warehouse delivery system is in full effect all over the world. You are a sky pirate, about to strike the biggest goldmine in your life.",ekazu129,"""Mark?"" Eleanor made her way down the deck. The british navigator stumbled and staggered, the ship shuddering and shaking on its journey through the sky. It was a rougher flight than usual, the vessel running at top speed to intercept the Warehouse. The Skipper was designed for speed and agility, but even it was struggling to match the required velocity.

The view was fantastic, so long as you were looking away from the sun. Depending on where they were, it swapped from mountain ranges to sprawling deserts. She often spent hours staring at the twinkling lights of a metropolis or the stars in the night sky. But she didn't have the time to look now. Pity, today they were hovering over a splendid lake.

She continued along the deck. There was a wood finish to both the furniture and much of the structure, a callback to the pirates of yore. It was all for show. Underneath the wood was actual aluminium, and the outer hull of the skipper was metal armour. There was some glamour to the pirate life.

""Mark?"" she pulled the door to the captain's quarters. The Bridge didn't make any pretense, decked out in LCD screens and holographic displays.

""That's *Captain* Mark to you, Eleanor,"" he glanced up from the display, but didn't stop typing.

""Right, sure,"" she walked around the room and placed a hand on his shoulder, leaning over him to look at the plans. ""You ready for this?""

""Bit late to back down now, hm?"" he flicked up his 'eyepatch'. A glass lens connected to the ship's systems or the team's, as needed. More often, he was watching illegally downloaded episodes of The Walking Dead.

""Yeah, yeah, I know. Your dream score... we'll be set for life, etcetera.""

""What, you don't believe me?"" Mark pretending to be offended.

""Sure I believe you. It's a grand adventure, and we'll be so rich we can do anything we want. I just don't think you'll be able to give up this life,"" Eleanor rubbed his shoulder gently.

""Adventure, adrenaline, and action. Mark Roberts is going to give all of that up?""  she chuckled. ""Not happening.""

""Oh, we'll see,"" Mark shrugged noncommittally. ""For now, how about you round up the rest of the crew? ETA is an hour, we'd better do the briefing soon.""

""Aye aye, captain,"" she pecked Mark on the cheek.

There were two other members of the crew. Mark preferred a smaller crew, to divide the take more profitably, and retain more control over the group. Mark was the commander of both the ship, and the boarding party. Eleanor navigated the Skipper, and maintained communications in the boarding team. The other two were... less organised.

""You going to make me go up there, Robin?"" she called up towards the crow's nest. Her voice struggled upwards, torn and shredded by the screaming gale. No response returned.

She pulled the coat a little tighter around her body, flipped her goggles down, and grasped for the first rung on the ladder.

  The clock began sounding, and puzzled she looked across the room before realizing, “Daylight Savings time. Of course.” She had been out later than intended today. Frowning, she pulled a large hairy spider from out of her hair and slowly crushed it between her fingers. Very lifelike. It was rather good at the details. Or perhaps it pulled this from her memories like it did some of the other visions it presented. Either way, “Carry on then.”

  An impossibly large hand was placed on her shoulder, and she sighed. Biting down on the hand hard, she could feel the flesh part in her mouth as blood poured out of the wound and she opened her jaw as the hand was pulled quickly back and turning found that the house had apparently abandoned the rest of this little scene.

“I will say however,” she said, closing the closet that was now empty of all creepy crawly things, “that I was considering dessert tonight. And the longer you spend playing around. The longer you must wait to eat.”

  All signs of blood were gone, and the lights came back up as a small child toddled into the room from the kitchen. Predictable. Like any child, always impatient for sweets. She wondered not for the first time if the thing within the house had once actually been a child. But that was not a line of thinking that interested her for long.

  Heading up the staircase, she went to the locked door at the end of the hallway. It hadn’t taken her long to determine what spaces in the house were left unaffected by its games. For reasons beyond her, there were two rooms on the second floor, and one in the basement, that the house never changed. The visions it conjured would enter them, but that was the extent of its influence in those spaces. Puzzling as it was, it served her just fine.

  As she unlocked and opened the door, she could hear a shuffling from within, and small voice began to whimper. Set in the center of the room was a locked chest. And from within it, a small voice began to wail, “Please… please help me….”

  She pulled a key from her blouse and unlocked the chest to find a child huddled inside, hugging itself in fear.

“Shhhh….” she said pressing her finger to her lips, “It’s okay, you’re going to be okay now.”

  The child looked beyond her and began screaming at the top of its lungs. Holding her finger up, she waggled it side to side, “Uh, uh, ahhh… Mommy gets to play first,” but the screaming did not cease. So she pulled a crucifix from within the chest and turned to see that the house child’s mouth had grown almost large enough to swallow her whole, and its eyes were hollow and empty sockets atop it warped and misshapen head. Touching the cross to its lips, the child squealed in agony and skittered back across the floor towards the door, changing back as it did to the small child it had started out as.

  She could not begin to understand its fear of religious artifacts any more than she understood anything else about it. But that too served her well enough. 

“You may have your dessert when I am done,” and as she said that, the child frowned, and turned away from her, as it always did before *she* played, “You should watch me some time,” she replied, turning back to the chest, “You might learn something,” she finished with a smile at the contents.

[WP]A sadistic serial killer who has seen and done it all has moved into a haunted house that changes its insides to terrify its occupants to drive them insane. The killer is not amused by this and quickly grows bored.,gathling,"Greg sat in the living room and waited. He moved in almost a month ago and this so called ""insanity house"" was becoming rather predictable. He looked over towards the door that led into the hallway and checked his watch.

""At 9 pm lights flicker..."" he whispered to himself. Right at 9 the lights flickered.

""9:01 Uncle Henry walks in..."" 

The lights cut off but soon the outline of an older man walked into the room. He was breathing hard.

""Mommy's left us all alone... time to play our little game..."" the man moaned. The lights kicked on, showing Greg his Uncle Henry. The older man was naked, stroking his hard penis as he had a crazed smile on his face. Greg rolled his eyes.

""Yes house... I was molested and raped by my uncle! Old fucking news! I am a serial killer its like origin story 101 with my type! You must look in my mind and that means you do know he was my first kill? Chopped him up during a camping trip with a hatchet!"" Greg said to the house. 

Uncle Henry stood there for a moment before his body fell apart and landed on the floor before fading away. Greg looked at his watch, it was 9:08.

""Now the group..."" he said. 

Suddenly the room was full of people. All of them in various states of undress as they all cried and begged to be spared. Greg looked at all the men and women he killed though out the years. He walked over to a pretty young college girl. She looked up at him with her pretty brown eyes.

""Please don't hurt me..."" she whimpered. He smiled.

""Raped you... tortured you... set you on fire."" he said to the ghost with no hint of remorse as he walked over towards an older looking black man.

""Look man... I... I won't tell anyone about this! Just... let me go!"" the black man said, his voice full of fear. 

""Beat you with a tire iron... castrated you... used a cork remover to pluck out your eyes and fucked the socket till you died."" Greg said to this ghost as if he was just going though his boring day at the office. 

Greg looked around the room till he laid his eyes on an older fat woman who was fully nude. Her crying smeared up the cheap make up on her face.

""Please... I have grand babies..."" the fat woman whaled. Greg chuckled as he walked towards her.

""Old truck stop whore! Raped her used up holes with what ever i had in the basement... cut new fuck holes in her fat and used them well till her heart gave out!""

The screaming victims stopped their screams and cries and faded away. Greg looked around a bit upset.

""Aww giving up already? I was hoping to find that couple I met from the personals ad or maybe that hitchhiker I tied to the back of my truck and dragged down that dirt road!"" he said sounding like a disappointed child.  

The living room went dark again. He cocked his eyebrow as he seemed excited by what could be coming. 

""Oh changing it up some? Lets see..."" Greg said as he rubbed his hands together.

One light came on. Standing in the middle of it was a sad little boy. He was crying as he rubbed his eyes. His clothes looked a bit old and disheveled. Greg stood there for a moment before he realized who the boy was...

It was him!

Young Greg looked up at his older self.

""Why? Why do you hurt people?"" the boy whimpered.

Greg got on one knees and rubbed the boy's shoulder.

""You want to know something? I dreamed of going back in time, meeting you... raping the fuck out of you before skinning you alive and using you one final time!"" the older man said to his younger self with the most evil smile a human being could give.

His younger self backed away in horror.

""But... But I'm you!"" the boy said in sick disbelief.

""What a way to go though! Raping and murdering my past self! Fucking myself out of existence!"" Older Greg said with a laugh.

The ghost boy vanished, leaving the killer alone in the house. Greg huffed.

""Is that really all you fucking got?!"" he yelled before sitting back on the couch. 

He grew board with murder some time ago. He had hoped that maybe this whole ""being driven insane by ghost"" would lead to something.

But all this house was doing to him was boring him to tears!

[WP]A sadistic serial killer who has seen and done it all has moved into a haunted house that changes its insides to terrify its occupants to drive them insane. The killer is not amused by this and quickly grows bored.,gathling,"George took his final, triumphant steps into this new murder house, a huge grin spreading over his face as he stepped over the decaying, splintered threshold into 453 Green street. He had a theory about this place. All the previous occupants were driven mad within a week of taking possession, all claiming to see horrors that somehow recalled past trauma and personal deep-seated fears. It had only been days since his last kill, but that didn't stop George's adrenaline from pumping as he imagined the gore and mutilations that might be specifically tailored to his jaded sensibilities by this evil house.

The house was vacated in a hurry by the previous occupant. Broken bits of furniture were strewn around the living room, mixed in with various bits of trash and clothing. Closing the door, he could see fresh scratches in the paint. His heart leapt yet again, imagining the abject terror of the last victim trying desperately to - 

George doubled over, a pain radiating from his abdomen. He felt was swimming in the air with nothing but white in his vision. Then there was a voice:

""Too easy,"" it said. 

The house was transformed. George sat at a dining room table, smooth speckled formica and padded vinyl chairs. He saw a full place setting in front of each chair. Across from him was a blonde woman with hoop earrings and a perfect glittering smile. He couldn't believe it, but he recognized her instantly. 

*""Mom?""*
he thought. Oh this was going to be great! He was going to see the bitch torn limb from limb again! He felt his lips curl into a smile. What he wanted to say was, *Hello again, mother.* But what came out of his mouth was,

""Pass the potatoes, dear?"" She obliged, grasping the shiny pewter serving dish.

""Of course, sweetheart!"" she said with a friendly lilt in her voice.

Oh. So George wasn't in command, this was a performance just for him. He glanced to his right and saw a small boy, also with golden locks cropped in a neat bowl cut. *That's me!* he thought. Little seven year old George was playfully pushing his potatoes around on his plate, making *vroom vroom* sound effects. George felt himself say,

""Now son, you have to give those peas a chance."" Little George gazed lovingly at Big George, and said with a smile,

""Ok daddy!""

*What the hell is this happy family shit?* thought George. *This never happened, my father never asked a question without his belt. And where's my bitch mother's cigarette and glass of sherry?*

George glanced to his left. His older sister sat quietly eating her dinner, fifteen and pretty as she ever was. George could remember how much prettier she'd been when he had sliced her throat the following year. He grasped his steak knife in his right hand, silently willing himself to lunge at her smug, pretty face. Instead he heard himself asking about her day. Sylvia smiled sweetly and gave her father all the pretty details. 

*So this is your big plan, house?* thought George, *Bore me to death with this happy family that never was? Give me a break.* Silence, save for the contented clicking of silverware on china plates. 

Dinner ended and George felt himself walking upstairs. He donned a pair of silk pyjamas and went to the ensuite bathroom. Staring back at him as he dutifully brushed his teeth was the monster that had shaped his youth. But George wasn't resentful - life would have turned out far more boring any other way. 

His mother, Julia, joined him after her nightly routine in the bathroom. But instead of taking her usual mother's little helper and passing out for the night, she accompanied George to the children's rooms. *Is this it? Will she be forced to watch the veneer crumble? I mean, as long as I get to do the deeds, this may not be boring after all.* George smiled inwardly, but the children remained in their beds as each parent gave them a peck on the forehead and sang them a goodnight song. There was no twenty minute beating for little George, and no whatever he did to Sylvia as George remembered listening through the walls growing up. 

Older George and Julia returned to the master bedroom. *Is this it then?* he wondered, *Will I have to make slow, passionate love to my -*

Just then, he was back at the dinner table. Everyone in the family perfectly dressed, having a perfect little evening. *Shit. The house IS trying to bore me to death.* George played along, wondering when the ""murder"" house would give up.

Perhaps around cycle 5,342 George started getting more upset, more than he had been the last round with this oh-so-perfect lie. He passed the time thinking of ways to dismember each and every one of them, images of flayed skin and rubbery intestines dancing through his head. *It's not fair!* He tried taking the knife with his from the table, but it would not budge. Over and over he tried. And over and over, his father's smug grin shot back at him from the bathroom mirror. He longed to kill that man again, to once again feel his warm blood on the cool bathroom tiles.

By cycle 12,987 George started seeing the cracks in the veneer of the house's little show. There were milliseconds where he could pull the knife a little closer at the end of the meal. Times when he could get a syllable out of his own volition. He wouldn't give up, soon there had to be a bigger crack. He could wait.

Cycle 30, 413. *The children were angry now. Not at the table just George's head children. Yes they wailed. Where was the spot? Ah, just so. Finally. The knife! It dances from the pantomime and into the real time, skittering in my hands, so joyful and fresh, full of life soon. Hopping up the stairs by two, two of us. Little big George kills the man! The man in the mirror, bathroom. Stab him! Stab! Oooh no, wrong way! Wrong way! Into me he hides!! Get out of there!!!!! I will extract you with beautiful red colors, finally, finally.* 

George struggled, stabbing himself close to the jugular with his practiced hand. His blood spilled, warm onto the cold linoleum. Just then, he was sitting again at the dinner table, blood pouring on to his warm steak. He managed a thin smile, and found himself say haltingly to his wife,

Carrie Fisher wakes up from a dream in which a starman came down and told her she is needed in a new world. She grabs her phone and calls her mom and says, ""David wants me next! I'm so excited!"". ""Well I want to go with you!"" replied Debbie. ""I'll talk to him when I get there. You know I can convince him...if not, i'll make him."" laughed Carrie.

It was well known in the secret society of celebrity greats that David has been working on a way to gather the souls of the greats lost in the past and bring them to a different universe. Ever since Lou Reed passed away, David got bored of New York City and the planet earth. He wanted to see his friend Reed and maybe get Lennon back as well. However, before he left, David casted a spell on everyone who listened the Blackstar. The story goes that, if a starman visits you in a dream then you can access the his universe by reciting the chants from Blackstar. Once you do, your soul leaves your body and the secret society reports a basic headline of your death. 

Carrie got out of bed, picked up her dog that was lying at the base of the bed, and went to where she kept all of her records. ""Now where did we put that thing."" she asked. She saw the black record, as she went for it she got distracted by the framed picture sitting on her night stand, her dog jumped out of her hands, and she started to cry. Carrie didn't know if she wanted to leave everyone behind. However, she knew Bowie wouldn't have called upon her unless he knew her time on earth was coming to an end anyways. Even though there was a rumor that Bowie only called on Anton Yelchin....just so he could have a young American boy around, Carrie agreed with this sentiment. ""I would have done the same thing"" she said while thinking about all the people she was going to see again. 

Carrie grabbed the record, held it to her chest, and whistled to her dog. ""Now you be a good. Don't let Mark overfeed you. Mommy needs to go have a drink with an old friend."" Carrie walked over to the record player, put the record on, hit play, and slowly walked back to her bed. As the eerie instruments played, she picked up her phone, googled the lyrics, and started singing along. About 4 minutes into the song, the lights started to flicker, and a beam of light busted through her bedroom doors. ""Thank you Carrie"" said a mysterious voice. ""Is that you Bowie? Do you mind turning off those damn lights"" said Carrie ""And can I shut off this creepy song already."" she complained. ""Listen hear Princess."" Said the mysterious voice. The lights shut off and there he was, standing with his head up high, in high thin white duke cloth. ""The gate is only open for a few more hours. You were finished with the movie right?"" said Bowie. He walked up to her, held out his hand, and she grabbed it. ""I'm ready."" She said. Bowie pulled, lifting her soul out of her physical body, and Carrie stood in form she wanted, feeling stronger, and more confident than she ever has. ""Take me to your silly universe.""

"David Bowie has created his own alternate universe, and is selectively populating it one person at a time. [WP]",marimbee,"""Hey, Starman?"" Carrie asked, nudging Bowie's arm to get his attention as they walked down the soft grey hall to her new room (the hall was usually iridescent, but whenever he was moving anyone in, David always changed the color to something softer, to ease the transition).

David let out a little hum of curiosity, peering down at her from the corner of his eye, his pale white suit a stark contrast to the graceful black-and-blue of her clothes.

""You know everything, right? Everything that's happening back home?"" she inquired.

""I suppose so, but only in the short-term."" he answered, shrugging. ""Why do you ask?""

""...what's gonna happen to Gary? I mean, I know Mom, and Todd, and Billie are gonna be fine without me, but what about him?"" she finally asked. She tried to seem calm, but under it all, Bowie could see how worried she was for him.

David understood her fear, and smiled gently, comfortingly, as he did with all those who he brought into his new world. ""Billie will care for him, and Todd will help.""

""But what about mom?"" she pressed, eyes wide with wonder behind her glasses.

David knew the truth, what was going to happen was in a close enough time span for him to see. He knew that soon, there'd be another addition to his universe. But there was no need to tell Carrie that. As much as she refused to show it, Carrie was in awe and afraid of this strange new land she'd been brought into. There was no need to shake her further.

So, instead, he brought her to the door of her room, changing the subject. ""Inside's everything you could want. Feel free to wander around once you've settled, get used to your surroundings. Prince, Gene, and I were planning on playing cards later, if you'd like to join us.""

Carrie chuckled. ""No thanks. I might just go visit Patty Duke, see how she is. But thanks for helping me find my way, David. You're a star.""

David chuckled too, slightly saddened. ""And you, my dear, are a princess.""

""General."" she corrected, but smiled before slipping into her room to rest and get acquainted with this new life.

As the door shut, David felt his heart lurch in his chest. He swallowed down the awful feeling in his chest, and adjusted his tie before walking away from the door. There was much to do, after all, so very much to do and all the time to do it in. He could hear the sounds of rabbit's paws, a great black rabbit guiding someone else to this Valhalla of art. So, taking a deep breath, David made the hallway shimmer and gleam with iridescence before descending the grand staircase to greet the newest denizen of his own private Black Star.",SapphicSleepyhead

My mother would scold me and chase them away with a broom or whip her apron at them.  But regardless of her efforts the cats would park their furry tails outside our home and meow endlessly into the night.  

The meowing drove our neighbors to near insanity.  Jacob the neighbor boy played any instrument beautifully, he would become one of the most incredible musicians the world had ever heard.  But the infernal meowing made practice almost impossible, so his parents put their home up for sale and moved away from the ""cat house"".

One by one each neighbor put their houses up for sale and moved away.  Unfortunately those houses never actually sold because no buyer was foolish enough to live near the cat house.  Soon I was all alone, every kid my age had moved away and I was avoided like the plague.  But, I had my cats.  All three hundred and sixty two of them.  I used to give them names, but even that became impossible.  So now I just numbered them. Dr. Meowsauce the second, third, and so on.  

Days passed and I grew older.  My mother passed away days before my thirtieth birthday.  It nearly broke my heart.  She was my rock, my beacon in the storm, my only true human friend.  The only attendees at her funeral were myself, the priest, and six hundred and seventy seven cats.  

The morning of my birthday I woke up to begin my regular routine.  Find and dispose of the hundreds of mice the cats had killed and left for me the night before.  Eat breakfast, clean the house a bit and spend time with the cats.  

""Daniel.  It's time we talked,"" a small voice said. 

I spun around in search for the origin of the voice.  Sitting on the kitchen table was Dr. Meowsauce the First.  He was old, his fur ratty and matted but he held his head up with pride. 

""It's time that you know the truth Daniel,"" Dr. Meowsauce spoke without moving his thin black lips, he spoke directly into my mind.

""We have been waiting for this day for a long time.  Cats have been wandering the Earth for eons waiting for our savior.  For you Daniel.""

""What are you talking about?"" 

""The prophecy! One day a human would be born that will lead the felines in battle.  To finish our eternal struggle once and for all.""

""Battle? Against what?""

A sharp howl interrupted my next question.  Then another howl echoed the first.  Soon barking and howling came from every direction.

""Prepare yourself Daniel.  They've come,"" Dr. Meowsauce said bitterly and extended his claws.

She had an amazing talent: jumping. When I first heard about it, I thought she was lame just like me but then I found out that she worked with NASA. She could jump to moon very easily. Even though she had the ability to jump to Saturn, NASA didn't want to risk losing her. She was really important. 
The day I told her about my ability she laughed, not in a bully way but in a that's-really-cute-i-love-cats way. I really thought she could love me, but of course I was wrong. She left me for a guy who could talk with cats. 
OH

He had a lame ability too but he was an upgrade version of me. 
I felt like the only person who could love me was a cat. 
I was right. The guy she left me for, said that all 10 cats of mine were in love with me. It didn't feel good to be told that the only sex life you could have would be beastiality. ",asya_su

Another who like tinkering will revolutionize civil action. You? Well, cats just seem to like you...",meringun,"They called me ""Pussy Pleaser""... which wouldn't have been so bad, if I wasn't a straight girl. In fourth grade. Whose last name was ""Dyke"".

It was Billy Greene that came up with the name. My mom always said he had a crush on me, and that's why he treated me like crap. 

Of course Billy had the talent that I wish I was born with. He had a near-photographic memory. Studying became nothing to him. Meanwhile, I was stuck being a friendless dope on the playground, talking to the growing number of stray cats that seemed to follow me around. It was so unimpressive, I questioned if this was even an ability, or if I'd actually been born without one and the cats were just attracted to my scent. Did I smell like a lonely cat lady?

I was seething with rage when I saw him out walking his dog the day after his 30th birthday... his powers indeed exploded overnight, just like everyone else's. He generously reminded me of all the embarrassing things that happened to me in grade six that I was FINALLY just starting to forget.

When I was 29, it became clear that my cat powers were unfortunately my only talent in life. My lawn was regularly dotted with various neighborhood felines. Even Billy's housecat, who lived three blocks over, was at my house near-daily. Begging for scratches, meowing. But the funny thing was, when I would tell her to go home, she would. Sometimes I'd let her hang around for hours, just to annoy Billy.

Finally, my 30th birthday arrived. The day I dreaded so much, I was almost glad to get it overwith. What new mockery did my life have in store on this day?

My family was visiting. They were all downstairs preparing for my birthday supper. It was already 4PM and I was still in bed, trying to sleep the day away. My mom popped her head in my room and reminded me that I was born at 5:32PM and I had to be downstairs before then so they can all sing happy birthday to me. She was kind enough to not mention anything about the cats, but it didn't matter. I could hear them.

I finally crawled out of bed and looked out my window... yup. There they were. My lawn was almost entirely covered with meowing cats. I saw a girl out for a jog stop and take a picture. Ugh. I knew if I told them to scram, more would replace them just as fast. But it was too much, I couldn't bear to look at them any longer. I opened the window.

""Get outta here!""

...nothing. Not one cat moved. That was strange.

My mom called me down for supper. My brother Mark was there and gave me a hug, being careful not to crush my bones like he knew he easily could. My cousin Sarah was already sitting at the table with her boyfriend Pete, whose ability my cousin never shut up about - endurance. Great, Sarah.

Mom served up everything as my brother turned off the TV just as a news story flashed across the screen.

""Wait, what was that?"" I asked.

""Oh just something about the Stratten Zoo. Some animal escaped or something.""

""But don't worry about that, Honey."" my mom cooed, still treating me like the family baby. ""Stratten is miles from here. Let's eat!""

The food was amazing, which was no surprise. Mom's ability was taste. I was only mildly distracted by the growing number of cats that were pressing their paws up against our sliding glass doors.

""Why don't you just tell them to leave?"" Sarah asked, clearly annoyed.

""I tried... they're not listening today."" I shrugged.

My mom and brother exchanged a worried look that I pretended not to notice by checking my phone. I had a Facebook message from Billy. My heart skipped a beat. Was he actually going to wish me a happy birthday? Wait, why did I care?

I opened the message: 

[Hey P.P., we have to take the cat to a vet appointment today but she's not around. I'm assuming she's at your place. Can you just tell her to come back already?]

I angrily closed out the message. He has a photographic memory, and still acts like he doesn't know it's my birthday. I wasn't about to return his cat to him. Besides, she wouldn't listen to me anyway.

Finally, dinner was over and I was almost free to retreat to my room to sleep the rest of the day away. But of course, the happy birthday song had to come first. It was almost 5:30.

Mom hurried off to the kitchen to light the candles on my cake. It was then that my cousin's boyfriend Pete spoke his first words of the evening.
""Danielle... is that a Lynx?""

We all peered out the patio doors into the dying evening light and sure enough, one of the cats sitting there looked to be a wild Lynx.

""Whoa!"" my brother exclaimed, ""That's actually kindof awesome!""

""Yeah"" I agreed. ""I guess we do live pretty close to the woods. It's almost amazing that this is the first time i've seen one. Strange how it's not bothering the other cats...""

My mom came back into the room with a bright cake, and the singing began.

*Happy Birthday to you...*

I wish this day would end.

*Happy Birthday to you...*

We just have to eat the cake, and then it will all be over.

*Happy Birthday dear Danielle...*

I glanced at the clock, 5:31.

*Happy Birthday to yooooooou...*

As they were finishing off the last note, I felt the ground begin to rumble slightly. Was this another earthquake? My family was now oblivious, applauding themselves for the song as I swiveled around in my chair and squinted out into the now blackness. The cats were meowing... a lot.

A horrible feeling overtook me as the cat wailing grew. The room fell silent and the pictures on the walls shook. I looked down at my watch... 5:32.

The glass patio doors shattered and everybody screamed. Among the chaos of flying glass and housecats spilling into the house, a great beast was now standing in our livingroom. It took my brain a moment to compute what my eyes were seeing, but sure enough, there it was.

A white tiger.

My family and I scrambled to leave the room, but a piercing scream stopped us. The tiger was on top of Pete - sharp teeth clamped into his side, dragging it's claws down his legs and tearing them to shreds. Blood spilled everywhere and Sarah screamed. The tiger dragged Pete across the floor, directly blocking the path we needed to escape.

""STOP!"" I shouted automatically. The tiger's eyes flicked upwards to meet mine and it reluctantly released Pete, who was now passed out. My brother slung Pete over his shoulder and stood back from the tiger.

Just then another large mass appeared behind us in the patio doorway. A mountain lion. It lunged towards my mom, but was stopped when the tiger leaped between the two of them and roared, seeming to tell the lion to stop.

With all of this chaos happening, I barely noticed the room filling up with housecats, completely covering the floor. I hadn't been stepping on them because they seemed to part for me to get through. The walls were still shaking. Cats were flying over our back fence and sprinting into our house. There were now three Lynx cats on the table, eating the leftover dinner. Another mountain lion came snarling into the house, this time halted by both the tiger and the first mountain lion. They seemed to all be communicating...

""Get out of here!"" I yelled at them. The three large cats stood and stared at me, unmoving.

I had to get my family and I out of here. We raced past the cats and locked ourselves in the upstairs bathroom. Sarah was sobbing and Pete was bleeding out fast. I looked out the window and saw 8 or so mountain lions pacing back and forth just outside of our back fence, waiting for a particularly large swarm of housecats to be finished spilling over into our yard.

In our mad rush, no one remembered to grab their phone off the table. We were stuck, unable to call for help. All we could do was sit tight and wait, feeling the unsettling rumbling of the house and listening to the occasional roar or growl of large cats communicating with one another.

Three hours had passed, and the rumbling stopped. My brother and cousin seemed to stabilize Pete. I dared to look out the window once more. 

There were cats as far as the eye could see. All staring up at me.

""Hey, look."" My mom whispered. ""You have a shower radio. Let's turn it on and see if we can hear anything about the city sending help to our house!""

We turned the dials and waited for the words to become clear.

""-state of emergency. We just received news of thirty-two more zoos worldwide that have had their large felines escape. Wait, I'm getting an update... make that thirty-seven more zoos.""

I took a deep breath and let the information sink in. Then I walked to the bathroom door and opened it. 

In front of me stood a wall of massive cats. Tigers, Lions, Panthers, Cheetahs, Leopards... all sitting obediently, awaiting my command. I locked eyes with the white tiger, front center.

""Get me my phone.""

The tiger roared, and moments later I could see a small black object being passed mouth-to-mouth along the sea of cats, heading straight to the white tiger at the front.

The beautiful cat, phone in mouth, approached me slowly and gingerly released the slobbery phone into my hand.

My family stood back in shocked silence as I turned to face them. 

I opened my phone and dialed 911. I told the bewildered operator that I needed a medic to my address, and that I should be able to clear a path through the cats for them. The moment I hung up, I saw that I had an unopened Facebook message from Billy, sent two minutes after his first one:

[I'd wish you Happy Birthday, except we both know today is going to be depressing for you. Don't worry though, i'll send my cat back to visit you after her vet appointment. Wouldn't want you to be *completely* alone on your birthday.]

I closed the message and looked up at my new army of cats. 

""I'll be right back."" I said to my family.

""What? Where are you going?!"" asked my mom, alarmed.

I just smiled.

""I'm going to bring Billy his cat back.""

I blew out the candles on my birthday cake and wished for my talent to shine through this year. All of my friends were blessed with special talents-superhuman strength, blazing speed, inconceivable intelligence- but I seemed average in all aspects. 

Now on my 30th birthday, I was reaching the maturation of my talent, and the only thing that seemed interesting about me was the fact that every time I went to the animal shelter, cats sat down and peered at me from their crates. When I left the animal shelter, they all went berserk, hissing and scratching at volunteers and patrons following my departure. I had actually been banned from two animal shelters for this strange and unexplained behavior. 

Ever since people had started being born with weak talents that grew stronger until their 30th birthday, the human population saw an all-time high growth rate. We were fascinated by the variety of talents and thought these talents would save the human race. While many pressing issues such as climate change and national debt were seeing improvement, poverty was high and those with less special talents (like myself) struggled to find reasonable employment. 

Because I was not a competitive prospective employee, I could hardly afford a place to live and enough food to eat. I was allowed to stay in a bedroom at a friend's place and mostly ate leftovers that were about to be thrown out. I saw less and less handouts these days though, as more special talents arose and more ""average"" citizens lost their jobs. 

One morning, I was scrounging some dumpsters for breakfast, but they were all empty. The homeless and ""average"" citizens littered the sidewalks while the ""specials"" walked past to begin their days at work. I was cold, had one week to move out of my friend's house (because he was recently let go from his job and was losing his home), and I had half a can of mandarin oranges in his fridge that I had been trying to make last. Unable to find any food to eat, I ambled back home to eat the last of my mandarin oranges, but still found my stomach growling after the oranges were gone.

I turned my head to the right to look out of the window and try to come up with a plan to survive. Suddenly, a cat I had never seen before leaped onto the windowsill with a hot dog in its mouth. I opened the window, and the cat dropped the hot dog at my feet and climbed back out of the window into the frosty grass. Hungry and unwilling to waste the food, I grilled the hot dog and ate it, finally calming my rumbling belly.

Twice a day, the same cat appeared in the windowsill, dropping food at my feet and leaving immediately after. That last week I had at my friend's house, I was able to eat what the cat brought me and collect other food items out of dumpsters to take with me when I lost my home. 

When I finally had to leave home, I knew I would never see the cat again. Much to my surprise, a few days later the cat found me curled up on the sidewalk with my back to an old brick building. I was cold and nearly out of supplies, but the cat rubbed up against me and gave me a knowing look before leaving me. 

For the next several months, this cat (along with many others) began bringing me food, socks, blankets, medication, and many other supplies that allowed for my survival. They were bringing me so many things that I was able to help other ""averages"" out when they were suffering. I still had no place to live but my cats and my newfound friends stayed near and kept me warm at night. Even though sickness and poverty were killing off a growing portion of the human population, I was hopeful that the cats would keep me alive. They made me optimistic for the future and grateful for the present. 

Soon enough, the government recognized the harm done by the separation of the ""averages"" and the ""specials"". They banned use of our special talents unless an emergency demanded our talents be used. Life began to look more normal, and more of the ""averages"" were able to find jobs. As for me? I opened my own animal shelter, determined to find homes for all the cats that had kept me alive in my times of hardship. They seemed to trust me to find them the perfect fit, and to this day I continue rehoming abandoned and stray cats.",justhisfriend

Bobby always laughed at me after his karate lessons. It hurt a lot then, but it's okay. He's too busy to laugh now, what with him revolutionizing modern warfare. No time for Bobby to laugh anymore.

Lucy always laughed at me as she and her gaggle of friends went to the scrapyard for parts. It stung a lot then, but it's okay. She's too busy to laugh now, what with her being in the process of solving the energy crisis. No time for Lucy to laugh anymore.

Jane always laughed at me between mouthfuls of her favorite snack. Jane was my first love, so her laughs always used to hurt the most, but it's okay now. She's too busy to laugh now, what with her six star restaurant constantly cooking up a storm for celebrities and world leaders.

Yeah, that's how it went. Everyone always laughed at me, just sitting by my lonesome, filming my cats.

Sitting here at my trusty computer, I can't help but smile as I click on a link with my mouse.

I didn't see anything unusual. But then, I didn't have my sister's gift. Since she'd come of age a couple of years ago, she could see things few others could. Heightened senses weren't an unusual power, but her microscopic vision was still pretty rare. And she knew it. 

""What is it this time? Is there something under my nails again?""

""No. You mean you can't see it?""

She knew perfectly well that I couldn't.

""Just tell me, Sara."" I was sick of playing her guessing game. 

""It's hair. Red hair. It's like it's growing from your skin."" She pulled back my sleeve. ""On your arms, too. And your face."" She reached for the hem of my sweatshirt. 

""Stop!"" I said, pushing her hands away. ""This isn't funny."" I looked closely at the skin on the back of my hands. There was nothing there. 

""Your eyes,"" she said. 

""What about my eyes?""

""Were they always so yellow?""

""It's just the light,"" I said, a little uneasy. I didn't know what game she was playing, but I didn't like it. 

""I know what it is,"" she said. Her face was deadly serious. ""You're changing...into an old man."" She laughed hysterically and grabbed another piece of my birthday cake. 

""You're such a dick,"" I said. 

--

Standing an inch from my bathroom mirror, I had to admit my eyes were a little yellow. ""It's just the light,"" I told myself. Stupid Sara. I was being paranoid. It was like feeling spiders on your skin after seeing one. The power of suggestion. 

A lone cat yowled outside my bedroom window. It was Mittens, I was sure. My neighbor's cat always seemed to prefer my company. 

She sounded sad tonight. No, I thought. Cats don't have feelings. I was just projecting mine onto her. 

--

When I woke, I smelled trash. Did I leave something in my room? I looked around, but the smell seemed to be coming from the kitchen. 

It was the garbage disposal. How did I smell that from my bedroom? Wait, this must be it! My power was enhanced smell. Well, it could be worse. 

""Holy shit,"" said Sara. 

""Oh come on,"" I said, sick of her shit. 

""No, I'm serious. You're covered in fur.""

""Jesus, Sara. Grow up.""

""I'm fucking serious. Look at your hands!""

The red hair Sara had claimed to see yesterday wasn't there at all. Instead, grey fur was growing from my skin in a pattern that was unmistakably tabby.

""Holy shit. What's happening to me?"" was what I said, but all I heard was, ""Meow meow mew mew mew.""

""Jimmy!"" Sara cried, but she was getting farther away from me. No, she was growing. No, I was shrinking. 

""Meow meow!"" I implored Sara's legs to no avail. The colors of the room were fading. 

""Oh, Jimmy. I'm so sorry."" She was leaning now to reach me on the floor.

They laughed, they played, they knew I was their only hope of getting to the cats was me.  As I aged and more rare and exotic cats showed up they more they collectively wanted the cats around. The people were only looking for the cats they ignored and hindered my other hobbies for cat time. After a time I got a cat sickness and was no longer useful so I was thrown away. The natural thought was to take their appraisal of me and lay in the mud. Little did they know my cat abilities were the superficial shell of my talents. Where they lived and associated their own being to the ""talents"" they thought defined them , I used mine as a shell  to allow me to learn from many different groups of people. As long as I showed up , and brought the cats i was free to steal all the perceived ""talents"" of one dimensional people. Some I don't use because they poison you, some give people away immediately.

Is that rude?

I can't exactly be at fault for not listening too well. I wasn't exactly expecting... well... words...

""Did you get all that Steven?""

Oh wow, ok yeah he definitely spoke and I completely missed it. 

""Will you do it?""

I stared blankly at Jasper who was sitting over a coffee table in my living room surrounded by every single cat in the neighborhood. I scanned the cats from left to right. 

Snowball belonged to Ms. Cassandra from across the street, I gave him left overs from my sandwich on my way back from school whenever I could. 

Smudge was a stray cat who followed me home often and, despite the warnings from my mother, would always be friendly with me.

Tiger was Randy's cat. He would always got jealous cause the cat would only be at ease around me. I'd hear stories of clawed out curtains, and scratched fingers, but he would always comfortably purr on my lap when I came over. 

This was only to name a few. 

I never thought much of it. I like cats, and cats like me back. But on this day the words coming out of that furry, toothy mouth revealed to me that this was indeed my special talent. 

Well not the words themselves, more like the action of the words coming out. And subsequently my understanding of those words...

More than the sheer surprise of hearing my pet talk, I was shaken to my core in pure disappointment. Others usually got super strength... or flight... or mind reading... I guess I got... cat likeness? Wait until the others hear about this?

But oh well, gotta make the most of it.

I looked at Jasper who I could tell was beginning to get worried. 

(Wait can cats look visibly worried? Must've been the talent.)

""Actually... umm... if you don't mind... could you just repeat that last part one more time?"" I said to Jasper, hoping to not be offensive in anyway. 

""Of course Steven!""

""We're all here because we all feel a sort of connection with you. We understand you as much as you understand us. And to any feline with half a brain it'd be plain to see that you should be the one to lead us!""

A resounding 'meow' reverberated across my room, like an adorable war cry that struggled to be taken seriously.

But the 'meow' kept going, bouncing onto my ears over and over, and suddenly the cry took the shape of words. 

""Praise the Great one Steven! Praise the Great one Steven!""

Just then my front door slid open. I braced myself for the stellar and totally reasonable conversation I was about to have with whoever opened it. 

That's when I saw a massive paw slam into the room, followed by another, then another until the figure entering the room was entirely revealed. 

""Praise the Great one Steven!"" bellowed the great lion with a mighty roar, both completely shattering my reputation with my neighbors, and my center of balance and mind. 

I fell onto the floor with eyes open so wide, you'd think I was a cat hunting at night. 

I looked up at the ceiling with a complete utter lack of words. Not only did the cats have my tongue, they had torn it to shreds. 

Eventually I gathered enough strength to lay out a single word. 

""Huh...""

I believe it was profound.

Now it was all about what a person was good at. Extraordinary strength, intelligence, speed, and other things. Earth itself had been reverted into a genetic caste system. Not everyone was happy with the hand they were dealt but they tended to be good at the jobs they were assigned.

But what do you do when you have no hand to play? At 13 years old, I had no discernible abilities. I wasn't a very physical kid. History was an interesting subject for me but I could never be a teacher. Not when there were other people that were clearly more intelligent than I was. There was no place for me with the other children. People tried to reassure my parents. Little Billy from down the street hadn't developed his muscles until he was 15 after all.

The teenage years came and went. People felt sorry for me but never tried to help. I was an unfortunate relic of society's past, an insignificant little human. By the time I was in my early twenties, I was living in the streets. Not one living thing to keep me company until a tiny black cat befriended me. The next day another one appeared.

Within a week, I was being fed food by a group of cats. They would scavenge and steal from others and return with meals for me. A few weeks after that I managed to teach them how to steal cell phones, wallets, and jewelry. I had become the head of a criminal organization composed of cats. A small part of me began to understand why Egyptians worshiped these little fuckers. 

On my 25th birthday, I had managed to build a comfortable life. One that I had been denied for a long time. My talent was not an augmented skill, it was a completely new ability. I had been given command over an entire species, a king in a world that had told me I was worthless. It was time to begin building my Kingdom.

At 27, I learned that I had command over every feline. A trip to the zoo showed me that no amount of human talent could react faster than a wild animal. They weren’t just animals, these cats understood my every thought and motivation. Bared claws and bloodied corpses became the norm. The feline kingdom had reestablished itself as a dominant force in the world and all it took was a leader.

At 30, I wept for there were no more lands to conquer.

Yarn wasn't the best material for throne making but I had to do something with all the yarn I was getting as peace offerings and I didn't get much else since I banned the gift of dead mice.

I idly glanced at the my calendar, and turned the page to a new month and a new cute cat picture. I recalled half-mindedly the thrill I used to get when I saw a cute cat. I guess you get a bit numb to that sort of thing when you've seen first hand how deadly they can be. My 29th birthday is coming up, I should probably plan something exciting... Birthdays are such a hassle.

A tabby cat approached my throne, almost comically small compared to the lions on either side of him. The dim light didn't give justice to the many badges that adorned the sash that laid across the tabby's 
body. I would have preferred a better lit room but the my subjects didn't seem to mind.

""General"", I purred.

General Tobias looked at me, not even the lack of lighting could hide the bright pink scar running across his eye.

""We have another attempted escapee""

I sighed. Why can't the world just stay conquered.

""Take me to him."" I meowed. Clearly disgusted.

I stepped down off of my throne, several yarn balls were unsettled and rolled away from the surrounding mass of yarn. I followed Tobias down the corridor past rows of barred cells. I could feel my mind being read as I walked by the prisoners and conquered up some memories of past torture. I smirked as I heard a few of my prisoners gag. 

We arrived at the last cell where a scrawny stick of a man was beating at the walls of his cell, and had actually managed to create a few cracks. I shouldn't be surprised, this was once the strongest man in the world.
He stopped when he saw me and put on a brave face but couldn't quite manage to stop his lower lip to tremble in fright.

""Jacob,"" I said. My voice hoarse. It's been awhile since I spoke in human tongue.
""You were one of my best workers in the mines, what is this I hear about you trying to escape?""

He tried to spit at me but in his dehydrated state he had nothing to spit. I didn't flinch.

""You can't just keep us here like animals!"" He yelled, his voice breaking halfway through.

""Do you remember what you used to call me in high school, Jacob? Crazy Cat Cunt. I used to bleed from the amount of wedgies you would all give me.""

""Please! I'm sorry! You could talk to cats! There's no way I could know h--""

""Jacob, you tried to escape and that is against the rules.""

""Please!"" He broke down. Several other prisoners who were watching the scene averted their eyes in anticipation as to what was to come.

""No Jacob,"" I said as I nodded to the lions and opened the cage door.

I didn't look back as he was eaten alive. His screams would serve to set an example for the others.

And if he did come back, they would be ready for him.

After all, they had their talents: many were stronger than oxen, others could shoot a target from three miles, and some could sweet-talk the robe off of a supreme court justice. They were a city of mammoths and monsters and miracle-workers.

But there were mutterings, nonetheless.

""Marcus?""

""Yeah?""

""It's time, isn't it?""

""No, Lisa, no, he's not coming back.""

""He could, though.""

""He won't? What's left to claim?""

Lisa shook her head. ""I don't know. I don't want to know.""

Marcus put his hands on her shoulders. ""Lisa.""

""I'm leaving.""

""Why? You can't go.""

""I'm taking Spot with me.""

Marcus sighed heavily but said nothing. She was probably right. But admitting that meant he'd have to leave everything he knew, too. He watched her leave.

She was almost right. It took a month before Sha-Ka-Katta showed his face. But there were more of them this time, thousands upon thousands of them, four-legged demons, and the man himself rode in on a litter of them, carried by cats on two legs, cats on one leg, cats on robot legs. All with glittering eyes preparing to fire.

""What do you want with us?"" Marcus called out from the tavern roof. ""You've taken everything.""

The man dressed in cat furs, with a crown of woven whiskers, made no noise. He sat, frozen, for a minute, then raised one hand--was it a paw?--just perceptibly. The cats shrieked and clawed and tore each other to pieces to get at Marcus. They swarmed the tavern walls and climbed and dug and flung themselves from window sills to balcony to gutters.

""Why?"" screamed Marcus.

Sha-Ka-Katta raised his other arm toward the sky and a thousand more cats flung themselves headlong at the barn. ""This place smells like tuna.""

I love them. 

Ever since young, my grandmother had a lot of cats in her house. I could remember every single one of their names. 

I've seen cats get abused by naughty children and I've done everything that I could do to prevent them from happening. But I especially loved it when I held cats in my hands. I loved it a lot.

As time passed by, I started being involved in politics and business. I don't know why. I've gotten bankrupt four times. 

Recently, I've decided to run for president. I've said loads of bullshit like building a wall, and mentioning China loads of times. My campaign had loads of controversy floating around. 

I just wanted to tell the world one sentence.

Köttur, age 9
---

Anne stood and watched the children play. Her favorite part of the day was observing children create their own worlds. A group of boys and girls were fighting a monster only they could see, on a ship only they could control. Others were jumping rope, and still others were drawing with chalk. Every child in her 4th grade class was engaged. Except Köttur. 

The boy sat at a distance, against a tree, four cats curled up around him. He, too, watched the children play. It wasn't with interest, Anne noticed. Köttur seemed... suspicious.

He made Anne uneasy.

---
köttur, age 16
---
Köttur had been to Botswana many times before. His adoptive parents were missionaries. He loved it here. The raw wild called to him, even after he had arrived.

The buggy he was driving jostled him as it took each bump and dip in the gravely dirt road. He was speeding, but there were no limits. He had quickly learned that the general rule was to go as fast as you could without hurting yourself or others. And that seemed to be more a suggestion, and less a rule.

He was fast approaching the small village he had known as a boy, traveling with his parents. It was here he had met Mabadiliko, a mystic and village seer who had resisted his parents' message. Ultimately, the village had adopted Christianity, but throughout the years it blended with their local traditions into something unrecognizable. It was Mabadiliko that helped Köttur recognize the Gift.

The dirt road protested his speed with a gentle haze of dust. Through it, Köttur could see farmers rise from their fields, one hand over their eyes to shield the sun, staring in his direction. The villagers hated him, and he could feel their disdain as he raced toward the town center. Their hatred fueled him; his anger bringing a sickening joy. Köttur grinned.

The haze of dust behind him was moving, convulsing. Shadows danced among the fog, causing the villagers to turn and run toward their homes, grabbing children and calling to one another.

A watchman on a tower yelled as Köttur approached. Through the smoky dust, the glowing eyes of leopards could be seen as they sprinted alongside.

---
köttur, age 29
---
Köttur stood on a hill, overlooking the Gauteng capital city of Johannesburg. The last decade had seen him chased across the globe. He had briefly made Interpol's top 5 list. The people of the world grew wary of his Gift. He no longer had a home. 

Until today. 

Köttur raised his powerful arm, his blonde hair shining in the sunlight. He waited a moment, watching the serenity below him. He closed his eyes, fist still high in the air, a soft breeze enveloping him. It was time.

His piercing blue eyes snapped open. In one motion, he lowered his arm and knelt on one knee. He closed his eyes again.

The soft breeze built to a rushing gust of wind as thousands of jungle cats swarmed on the unsuspecting city below.",ariseatif

Paul was always envious of the other kids. Of the cool kids. Being a teenager was hard enough, and it didn't help that filthy stray cats followed him on every step. He loved them as much as he hated them. 
He always felt a special bond to cat and figured out early that this was his ""special talent"". 
The cool kids were incredible dancers, strong football players or beautiful girls. 
And he was just the cat guy. The weird cat guy.

Age : 19

Yesterday Holly visited him. She loved cats almost as much as Paul and their relationship just happend at the local animal shelter. That was 2 years ago, now Paul was the local animal shelter. 

Holly wasn't quite sure what her power was. Some people figured out their talents later, some sooner. The sooner you found out, the more powerful you got. 
But Holly didn't really care. She had Paul and the cats, she didn't need a talent. Most people didn't care. If your talent is being extremely good at cleaning wine stains in curtains or being able to grow your nails fast you don't really care. 
And although Holly was a big part of Pauls life, today he didn't waste a single thought on her. He would finally be able to leave the US to a Safari trip to Africa ! 

Age : 23

The Safari trip didn't turn out as planned.
The first week was great. The lions and leopards loved him just as much as the cats and while they were a bit more stubborn, they followed his commands just as the cats.
It was almost like Paul and the cats had a telepathic bond. Everything his cats, small or big alike, noticed, Paul noticed. It wasn't overwhelming, as it happend naturally. When Paul was out in the jungle, he felt like a god. Sensing every bit of the deep forrest like a part of his own body, through the senses of the cats was just special. And he was only 23 !
So that was really fucking cool. But in the second week, it began. Some guy with insane charisma started a worldwide revolution through YouTube. 
Everybody knew of this guy, nobody really thought he was a problem as he mostly teached nice ethics on his YouTube channel. He made the world a better place ! And then he took LSD and had a horrible trip... 
The video he uploaded while having panic attacks and paranoia couldn't be censored soon enough and pretty soon most of the world thought that all the powerful people were lizards. 
Anyways, Paul now was stuck in an extremely underdeveloped part of africa where the people didn't had any access to YouTube. 
He informed about the craziness by Holly. It turned out her talent was handling dangerous situation well, so she somehow got out of the mess North America was.

Age : 30

Today was Paul's birthday ! 
Every year his talent got more crazy. He now was the shared consciousness of all cats in a radius of 50 miles. Which was a lot, since he attracted cats like a super magnet.
The revolution had cooled down 6 years ago. The guy who caused everything managed to calm his fanatic followers down by telling an even more extraordinary claim : Cats were god's.
Most humans who were regular users of the internet already knew that and with a army of Reddit users missionaring the world to the one true faith, events turned quickly.
And with the help of Holly, Paul had no problem claiming himself as the god-emperor, bringing peace, cuteness and occasionally broken lamps and cups to the world. 
Because that's what cats do !

""Not specifically""
""They seem to like me"" fired my mouth in three bursts

""Could you explain more clearly?"" A voice so bold but revealing femininity

""Yes, you see. Animals called cats seem to like me""
I replied with amazing speed

""Well, that was a nice joke. Now. Please describe. I need an accurate description for your powers"" that bold women

""I'm sorry. I wasn't making a joke"" I cried trying to hide that I was indeed making a joke

""Very well, it seems you have difficulty in describing your powers. Shall I call for a telepathist?""She enquired

""No mam. I wasn't having any difficulty in describing my powers. Those are just the end of it. You see,  whenever I go near cats, they come closer to me and rub their bodies on me. At first,  I thought they were just scratching their backs with my cotton pants. But it didn't turn out like that. They had these happy faces that only an angel or somebody from it's family would have""
I paused

""Go on Mr.Tony""

""Can I get a glass of water please""? I asked her.

She pressed one of those buttons that looked like they belonged to a Russian bomb shelter. Another person showed up. To my surprise,  that person was already holding a glass of water. To be more clear, a glass 3/4 full of water with a disposable lid made of aluminum foil.

She whispered something to the other person in the left ear. That person handed me the water glass-bottle-coolthingy hybrid.
I peeled of the lid and sank my throat.
Now that I notice, that person was only wearing earing on his right ear.

I continued
""These cats;  they had a hard time leaving me, whenever I had to part away with them, they wouldn't jump amd hold me,  but they always hugged me by the chest and wept""

""And were they sapient?"" She interrupted

""No mam."" I replied.
""They were just as ordinary as any cat.""
""I suppose that's enough for the description?"" I asked. Pretending to be an asian sheriff. 

""More than enough for your age"" replied she.

She didn't seem that much interested. Just the look on her face would reflect the words ""I have the most boring job""
She filed my report. She thanked me. Then she pressed another one of those fancy buttons.

I left before I could see what that one was supposed to do.
As a highschool student on a vacation. I was extremely tired. I admit I'm lazy. Just like anybody who's born on 1996.the last thing I remember is the softness of my baseball printed blanket rubbed directly to my mamallian F-A-C-E.

""BEEP!"" went the clock. I couldn't get up. I thought, what if
""BEEEP!"" She went again, this time. Only to more annoying. ""BEEEEP!"" Came the final but the loudest nonsensical sound.
By this time, I had already undressed and went on to have my morning shower. Not that I like water. But my dad highly recommends it 'to be famous among the ladies'. Whatever he ment with that. I spent half of my shower time watching the curtain and the other half talking to Bomper, a sapient cow who lives in my bathroom. He's also blind so i allowed him to stay there. He eats my soap everyday.""

""Tony!!"" Cried out mommy. ""Breakfast is ready""
Anf that was my cue out.
I rubbed myself carefully with the fur-of-fury.
Then got dressed, jumped through the stairs just like Peter Parker Sr. From the old movie.
I thought this part was boring so I'm gonna skip it.
After finishing my breakfast and hurried to the attic cum library where my dad keeps his books.
And for you hygieniacs out there, I did wash my hands before and after eating. Just a point worth noting of.

I grabbed the last book that I was supposed to read.
The book that I was supposed to get on my 14th birthday.
Before my dad passed away.
I spent the first 20 minutes crying and the next 3 minutes trying to stop my generous eyeballs.

I read through the cover that say ""R-E-P-O-R-T Report!""
Oops!. I've missed a word ""B-I-R-T-H Birth! Birth-Report!""

Something tells me that I shouldn't open it. But my body was not ready for that I suppose. It moved on my own and opened the first page.
""October 17. 1996."" The first line ended.
Now a strange smell of seafood entered my mind. It seems it was the eight-tentacled barney-colored Octopus.
And No I'm not gonna associate Doc Oc to a cute Octopus. I always thought it was a mistake they had. A marvelous mistake. I giggled like a goose thanksgiving Santa Claus for his Gifs to Me Me. I laughed again. ""Man I'm the funniest guy."" I said to myself. Or maybe should I say ""Man I'm the punniest guy?!"" I laughed again. But this time; like a nerdy goose who's inhaled nitrogen gas.

""Look at me. How pathetic am I? I thought to myself. I cried first. Now I am laughin my ass off. Not realy. But it did hurt though. Its noon already. And I hadn't finished the first page of the boom yet.
I haven't even read the second line."" I said to myself with low volume so that nobody would hear it.

Now I remember a dream that I had for quite a few nights.
It wasn't always the same but it'd end up like this.
A cat poster with the word ""S-C-H-I-Z-O-R-P-H-R-E-N-I-A Schizophrenia!"" I recall doing a project on that one.
If I remember correctly that's the disorder where the doctors are supposed to say your brain is ****ed up.
I asked my mom.
She stabbed me with her pointy words
""No Tony! , you're not psychotic. Its just your age""
I thought that I really had that disorder after reading cats cause it.

""Maybe not. I said to myself.""
It was a long day to spend crying.

_=_=_=_=_=_=_=_=_=_=_=_=_=_=_=_=_=_=_

From the writer. 

Sorry for finishing the second half so quickly.  I had something totally different on my mind. It seems as though I overestimated my ability to type on morning. Sorry. And Tony didn't have schizophrenia. It was just one of the confusions caused when you're going through puberty. He thought he had schizophrenia for about a month after which he jumped on to another disease. He's 21 Now and if famous on instagram for his cat pics. He evolved his ability enough  talk to cats now.
That cow in his shower was just the imaginary frienf everyone has when they're lonely. Ask me anything if you didn't understand here and I'll try to respond. Pardon me for any grammer/spelling mistakes.FYI the story is set in an alternate universe at 2012.

""Look at me. How pathetic am I? I thought to myself. I cried first. Now I am laughin my ass off. Not realy. But it did hurt though. Its noon already. And I hadn't finished the first page of the boom yet.
I haven't even read the second line."" I said to myself with low volume so that nobody would hear it.

Now I remember a dream that I had for quite a few nights.
It wasn't always the same but it'd end up like this.
A cat poster with the word ""S-C-H-I-Z-O-R-P-H-R-E-N-I-A Schizophrenia!"" I recall doing a project on that one.
If I remember correctly that's the disorder where the doctors are supposed to say your brain is ****ed up.
I asked my mom.
She stabbed me with her pointy words
""No Tony! , you're not psychotic. Its just your age""
I thought that I really had that disorder after reading cats cause it.

""Maybe not. I said to myself.""
It was a long day to spend crying.

From the writer. 

Sorry for finishing the second half so quickly.  I had something totally different on my mind. It seems as though I overestimated my ability to type on morning. Sorry. And Tony didn't have schizophrenia. It was just one of the confusions caused when you're going through puberty. He thought he had schizophrenia for about a month after which he jumped on to another disease. He's 21 Now and if famous on instagram for his cat pics. He evolved his ability enough  talk to cats now.
That cow in his shower was just the imaginary frienf everyone has when they're lonely. Ask me anything if you didn't understand here and I'll try to respond. Pardon me for any grammer/spelling mistakes.FYI the story is set in an alternate universe at 2012.
Thanks for reading

She could run at full speed. By the time she was 4, she could keep up with me, our parents, and even our cat... You know... Supposing the cat would ever leave ME alone. By 12, she was a competitive track star. There were some others with similar abilities, but she was exceptional. Have you ever seen a girl barely 5 feet tall running a 4 minute mile? She impressed her coach, other schools, our parents, but me? No... I resented her.

By that point, the best thing I could do was teach cats to perform tricks with a snap of my fingers and even though they all loved me, I resented them as much as my sister. I mean, come on... She gets a power that will give her an athlete's life with little to no work and I can play with cats? Sure, she DID work hard, but it's not like she would've been much slower if she didn't. That all changed on my 20th birthday though.

I always wanted to be as fast her. It killed me that I wasn't special. She was nearly 18 when it happened... She fell. Badly. They say she was as fast as a cheetah before the accident and she could keep that speed for up to an hour, but that dream was gone. She wouldn't run again. She tried even though the doctors all said she couldn't and shouldn't. It got worse and eventually she had trouble even walking down the block. 

Ironically, this did wonders for our relationship. We started hanging out constantly. I'd make her laugh with choreographed cat dances and meowing symphonies. We'd talk and go to parks and I'd carry her when she got tired, but it only made her feel worse... She was grateful, but she wanted that rush again. Although fun and *ahem* financially lucrative, all she wanted was to feel the wind on her face as she soared past. The sound and the taste of cooling air. The blur of colors and the smell... That was something she couldn't even describe to me. I realized something... She lost her power. Maybe mine was stupid, but I had one. 

And I got an idea. I wasn't sure if this would work... In fact, I feared ever going back to the zoo after a lion tried to jump at us when I was 8. But I had to try... For her. I owed her after years of brushing her thoughts and feeling aside for my own jealousy. 

I walked in and I could hear the meows... Purrs... And roars. Hell, I could feel them at this point. I could tell what any cat wanted and right now, they wanted me... To what end, I'm not sure, but I walked towards one... The most beautiful and majestic creature I had ever seen. We locked eyes and just as I had done a million times, I snapped my fingers... And he lay on his tummy awaiting my love. I smiled knowing I'd finally be able to give my sister what she wanted. 

... 

Maybe after a test drive. ",jmd10of14

Me? Cats only seem to like me. They all laughed at me. Ridiculed me. What can a person who only cats like do at the age of 30? Meow everyone to death?

They laughed. They mocked. But little do they know the extent of my powers. They underestimated me.

Unlike them who constantly flaunt their power, I have secretly honed mine in the past few decades. Slowly putting my plans in motion. Eliminating dogs from society. Making cats the pets of choice. Secretly I have been planting my agents across the globe, ensuring that they have access to all the most secure places in the world.

They may have forgotten me, but come tomorrow, I will show them the true extent of my power. They will come to fear me, no matter what their powers. Because come tomorrow, they will finally learn the hard way what a real Crazy Cat Lady can do.

Another who like tinkering will revolutionize civil action. You? Well, cats just seem to like you...",meringun,"New York City was never pristine, but these days it was a hellhole.  Crumbled buildings pierce the skyline and the streets are coated with concrete rubble.  Chaos feeds on these new powers.  Of course, those with the knack for building and planning were ""building  a better city from the ashes,"" but like all things in bureaucracy, it took time.  

New Yorkers preserved for the most part.  Where would they go? Nowhere is really safe as it was in the old days, and those without the right powers had very few means to defend themselves.  

I remember the early days.  My aunt took me to the Bronx Zoo for my 15th birthday.  Growing up in the south Bronx meant we could never afford to go when I was younger.  I know I wanted to see the lions; years of taking care of the stray cats on my block gave me a deep appreciation for everything feline.  

When we finally got to the lion enclosure there were dozens of children pressed against the glass, eyes wide and mouths running.  The pride was resting on the warm stones towards the back.  I was reminded of my cat Raisin when she lays on a sunny windowsill.  The plaque by the glass said the big cat was named Rafiq.  When I approached, the lions stirred.  Rafiq walked right up to the glass where I was and stood silently.  His broad front shoulders were firmly locked like a soldier at attention.  I looked into the lions eyes and I felt.  .  . Respect? Admiration?  My mind reached out in futility for the word.  The children giggled wildly at the rather odd display.  One boy of maybe ten years joked I must be part lion.  He wasn't entirely wrong.

I'll never forget the kind smile on my aunt's face as we left the zoo.  She saved up for months to take me.  It was the best gift I'd ever gotten.  I wanted to thank her so much, but I never got the chance.  Screams rose from the entrance as a young woman in a red bandanna hurled the whole entrance gate across the park.  Days later the reporters found her manifesto; it was some sort of twisted animal rights protest.  I froze in terror as the flying iron bars threw my aunt into a concrete barrier.  The impact broke her skull.

Enraged, I charged at the woman, my voice cracking as I screamed with all my might.  I felt a red-hot fury burn from the pit of my stomach; a feral wave of anger blurred my mind. 

 ""*Kill*"" I thought.  ""*Rend her.  .  . Go for the jugular.*"" 

As I ran forward she lifted the entire entrance booth over her head, her eyes stared directly into mine.  I knew I was her target but I was too furious to stop; I ran forward at her with everything I had.   As she wound up to heave the massive booth at me a golden blur tore past my right side.  Rafiq's mane blew wildly behind him.  The broken glass from his enclosure clanked off his fur to the cobblestones behind him.  A single pounce and the entire entrance booth slammed to the ground; the woman's throat was a mangled mess of blood and Rafiq's teeth gleamed red.  

These powers hurt people.  These powers killed the only person who ever cared for me.  The bureaucracy tries to fix it with order, but they are blind.  These powers run wild, and no one understands *wild* better than I.  I will hunt them down.  I could not save my aunt but I will save the others.  New York City is my kingdom, and every cat, big and small, a member of my pride.  

Cats are solitary creatures by nature.  Even the lions tell me they only form prides out of necessity.  I have changed them and they have changed me.  I have shown them the ways unity, and the power of their combined efforts.  They have shown me the thrill of the hunt.  I wield them in the hundreds just as I move my own arm.  I feel them each at the corners of my mind.  I see their world and I hear their thoughts.  

Those with powers of prediction may anticipate the move of a lion, but not a pride of hundreds.  Those with speed cannot catch us all.  Our numbers give us strength, and our strength can outmatch even those who raise mountains.  

A scream pierces the silence of the night.  I look down from my post at the top of a crumbling tower to witness the gruesome scene: a Strongman and a Stretcher holding a woman by the neck as they rummage through her purse. I already feel the local strays encircling the block. 

""Fifty should be enough,"" I muse.

Rafiq lets me onto his back as I lick my lips hungrily.  

It is time to hunt.

The both of them were getting on in years. Still smirking at the beast, he drew his cape on, fastening it a moment before 30lbs of serval seemingly gravitated to his shoulders, draping herself across the back of his neck. ""It's time.""

The Beast Master smiled at the liquid femininity of the serval's voice. He had understood them since he'd been in his teens, but hadn't heard them speak until his early twenties. It didn't surprise him when basically every female feline he came across sounded like seductress. ""Since when are cats ever on time?""

""You're no cat.""

He chuckled as he stepped out onto the balcony, overlooking the grounds of his estate. Below him, hundreds, thousands even of cats of all shapes and sizes were gathered, the majority feigning feline indifference, as if they just happened to be here at this time and place entirely on accident. Some watched curiously. Far more than he was used to watched him with steady, unblinking gazes, their full attention on the human standing above them.

""Our final victory is at hand!"" He shouted above them, meeting the gaze of many. ""The world, always yours to a degree, is now FULLY yours, once we've taken the final stronghold from the foolish Dogman and the last of his allies! Many of his followers have defected. They know where the food is now.""

Tails swished below, but the cats remained quiet. More were openly paying him attention.

He nodded, feeling his muscled neckwarmer shift slightly with the movement.

It wasn't a correction, rather, just as I said, something I pondered while I read. This line:

Sorry, let me explain from the beginning. Ahem...

When I was young a cat showed up at my door. Later on in elementary I found everyone else could use things like telekinesis or levitation. I could summon cats to aid in my conquest to the cookie jar.

By high school I was able to cheat on my tests by sending cats in to steal the answers, study them and put them back by the next day.

College got a little bit dicey though. They waited for me to command them. I told them I couldn't since I was caught up with everything. They told me that it was a matter of time before you decide the date of the world. I told them to wait. I commanded them to take the side of a human and wait for my orders.

Months and years flew by and now I'm thirty. I haven't really seen heads or tails or ear fluff of them since. Thank God. I came home from work one day to find Lucy sitting on the couch watching the news.

""Leon, when will you do it?""

""Do what, Lucy? Feed you?""

""No, you know what I mean,"" he sounded very serious.

""I'm afraid I have no idea what you are talking about."" 

""You realize we've been waiting ever since college for you to make the final decision.""

""Well, right now it's a bit difficult.""

""Well, right now you should check on that. Come, watch TV with me.""

I went and sat down beside Lucyfur and watched the News. I noticed ever so slightly an orange tabby perched behind the news anchor.

""Is that-""

""An orange Tabby? Why, yes it is. And you know what it wants?""

""What?""

""You to command him. Here,"" he changed the channel to the new episode of the Magicians on Syfy.

There it one was, a white Persian right in the background in the brush of fillery.

""What the...""

""Leon, it's time.""

""Time for what?"" I felt an eerie darkness fall over me.

""Command them.""

""Of course.""

""Not specifically""
""They seem to like me"" fired my mouth in three bursts

""Could you explain more clearly?"" A voice so bold but revealing femininity

""Yes, you see. Animals called cats seem to like me""
I replied with amazing speed

""Well, that was a nice joke. Now. Please describe. I need an accurate description for your powers"" that bold women

""I'm sorry. I wasn't making a joke"" I cried trying to hide that I was indeed making a joke

""Very well, it seems you have difficulty in describing your powers. Shall I call for a telepathist?""She enquired

""No mam. I wasn't having any difficulty in describing my powers. Those are just the end of it. You see,  whenever I go near cats, they come closer to me and rub their bodies on me. At first,  I thought they were just scratching their backs with my cotton pants. But it didn't turn out like that. They had these happy faces that only an angel or somebody from it's family would have""
I paused

""Go on Mr.Tony""

""Can I get a glass of water please""? I asked her.

She pressed one of those buttons that looked like they belonged to a Russian bomb shelter. Another person showed up. To my surprise,  that person was already holding a glass of water. To be more clear, a glass 3/4 full of water with a disposable lid made of aluminum foil.

She whispered something to the other person in the left ear. That person handed me the water glass-bottle-coolthingy hybrid.
I peeled of the lid and sank my throat.
Now that I notice, that person was only wearing earing on his right ear.

I continued
""These cats;  they had a hard time leaving me, whenever I had to part away with them, they wouldn't jump amd hold me,  but they always hugged me by the chest and wept""

""And were they sapient?"" She interrupted

""No mam."" I replied.
""They were just as ordinary as any cat.""
""I suppose that's enough for the description?"" I asked. Pretending to be an asian sheriff. 

""More than enough for your age"" replied she.

She didn't seem that much interested. Just the look on her face would reflect the words ""I have the most boring job""
She filed my report. She thanked me. Then she pressed another one of those fancy buttons.

I left before I could see what that one was supposed to do.
As a highschool student on a vacation. I was extremely tired. I admit I'm lazy. Just like anybody who's born on 1996.the last thing I remember is the softness of my baseball printed blanket rubbed directly to my mamallian F-A-C-E.

""BEEP!"" went the clock. I couldn't get up. I thought, what if
""BEEEP!"" She went again, this time. Only to more annoying. ""BEEEEP!"" Came the final but the loudest nonsensical sound.
By this time, I had already undressed and went on to have my morning shower. Not that I like water. But my dad highly recommends it 'to be famous among the ladies'. Whatever he ment with that. I spent half of my shower time watching the curtain and the other half talking to Bomper, a sapient cow who lives in my bathroom. He's also blind so i allowed him to stay there. He eats my soap everyday.""

""Tony!!"" Cried out mommy. ""Breakfast is ready""
Anf that was my cue out.
I rubbed myself carefully with the fur-of-fury.
Then got dressed, jumped through the stairs just like Peter Parker Sr. From the old movie.
I thought this part was boring so I'm gonna skip it.
After finishing my breakfast and hurried to the attic cum library where my dad keeps his books.
And for you hygieniacs out there, I did wash my hands before and after eating. Just a point worth noting of.

I grabbed the last book that I was supposed to read.
The book that I was supposed to get on my 14th birthday.
Before my dad passed away.
I spent the first 20 minutes crying and the next 3 minutes trying to stop my generous eyeballs.

I read through the cover that say ""R-E-P-O-R-T Report!""
Oops!. I've missed a word ""B-I-R-T-H Birth! Birth-Report!""

Something tells me that I shouldn't open it. But my body was not ready for that I suppose. It moved on my own and opened the first page.
""October 17. 1996."" The first line ended.
Now a strange smell of seafood entered my mind. It seems it was the eight-tentacled barney-colored Octopus.
And No I'm not gonna associate Doc Oc to a cute Octopus. I always thought it was a mistake they had. A marvelous mistake. I giggled like a goose thanksgiving Santa Claus for his Gifs to Me Me. I laughed again. ""Man I'm the funniest guy."" I said to myself. Or maybe should I say ""Man I'm the punniest guy?!"" I laughed again. But this time; like a nerdy goose who's inhaled nitrogen gas.

""Look at me. How pathetic am I? I thought to myself. I cried first. Now I am laughin my ass off. Not realy. But it did hurt though. Its noon already. And I hadn't finished the first page of the boom yet.
I haven't even read the second line."" I said to myself with low volume so that nobody would hear it.

Now I remember a dream that I had for quite a few nights.
It wasn't always the same but it'd end up like this.
A cat poster with the word ""S-C-H-I-Z-O-R-P-H-R-E-N-I-A Schizophrenia!"" I recall doing a project on that one.
If I remember correctly that's the disorder where the doctors are supposed to say your brain is ****ed up.
I asked my mom.
She stabbed me with her pointy words
""No Tony! , you're not psychotic. Its just your age""
I thought that I really had that disorder after reading cats cause it.

""Maybe not. I said to myself.""
It was a long day to spend crying.

From the writer. 

Sorry for finishing the second half so quickly.  I had something totally different on my mind. It seems as though I overestimated my ability to type on morning. Sorry. And Tony didn't have schizophrenia. It was just one of the confusions caused when you're going through puberty. He thought he had schizophrenia for about a month after which he jumped on to another disease. He's 21 Now and if famous on instagram for his cat pics. He evolved his ability enough  talk to cats now.
That cow in his shower was just the imaginary frienf everyone has when they're lonely. Ask me anything if you didn't understand here and I'll try to respond. Pardon me for any grammer/spelling mistakes.FYI the story is set in an alternate universe at 2012.

Their kind reciprocated with the same strange attraction, their piercing eyes immediately bubbling into an adorable black ball, the pupil expanding to occupy the whole of the eye, just as I passed by them. I was to cats what probably is a ball to a dog! 

But that was then, this is now… That strange connection I had when I was young? Turns out I have the ability to mentally communicate, and to a certain extent, control cats. As the sheets of the calendar turned, my ‘feline abilities’ grew stronger, uncovering an astounding range of things I could do with and to my furry friends. From the humble little kitten next door to the ferocious wild leopard, I could tame them all, without any physical strain, thanks to my superhuman mental abilities. This may seem like a really trivial talent to have when others are lifting mountains and revolutionizing civilizations, but disparage my talents at your own peril!

My abilities make me almost the cat equivalent of the Queen bee, with the whole world my hive and all feline creatures my humble workers. I have a whole cat army at my disposal, spearheaded by the fastest land animal and commanded by the king of the jungle. Needless to say, I was directly responsible for the safety and well-being of my kitties. It was not before long that I realized what the direct existential threat to them was. Humans. 

The collective harm of humans was killing the ‘roar’ of the jungle and replacing it with the far more modest ‘meow’ in cities. This, to me, as a sincere sympathizer of cats, was simply intolerable. The balance amongst the cat hierarchy had to be maintained after all, and could not, at any cost, be tilted in the favor of any other species. So I decided to take action. 

Through my evolved consciousness, I could see through the eyes of my fellow pussy cats as though it was I experiencing the world around instead of them. I then strategically placed the adorable fluffy ones in the decision making chambers of human society like the Forest Department and the Urban Development Authority to name a few. This provided me with the vital Intel about upcoming human advances into the areas wildcats call their home or human intruders call the jungle. This Intel enabled me to take suitable action to weed out any attempt by the greedy 2 legged creatures of grabbing more territory for their own selfish purposes. How do I do that? I have an army remember! I just order one of my generals to “take out” the next lot of bulldozers who intend to pluck a few trees. 

We all can now ‘purr’ in peace, thanks to this ongoing mechanism. But I fear those restless humans won’t stop and would eventually hatch a dubious plan to thwart our resistive movement to save our kind. Until then, MEOW!",samarth1901

My head shot up off my desk. My eyes struggled to adjust to the light. My right arm was asleep where I had been laying on it.

""Huh, what's up?"" I mumbled.

My classmates laughed as I wiped the drool residue off the corners of my mouth. I smiled along with them to appear less embarrassed.

""If you're finished with your nap, we would love to hear your opinion on the subject at hand."" Mrs. O'brian said, clearly frustrated.

I looked to my friend Evan for some sort of clue as to the context of what Mrs. O'brian meant. He just laughed at me. What a pal...

""Sorry Mrs. O, can you remind me?"" I asked.

Mrs. O'brian was a no-nonsense kind of teacher. She would normally make her students leave the classroom for something like this, but she was aware of what I was dealing with at home.

""We're discussing the ethical decision making behind George's shooting of Lenny in *Of Mice and Men*."" She answered.

I looked to Evan again, out of habit. He lifted his notebook to reveal an incredibly detailed sketch of me drooling on my desk, while a cat sat on my head.

""Douche."" I whispered under my breath as I stood up and made my way to the front of the class.

Mrs. O'brian took a seat at her desk and stared at me, waiting for my illuminating insight.

""Ahem."" I began. ""Well, the only person who would know the answer to that question would be the author.""

A few kids snickered. Mrs. O'brian replied, ""And who would that be?""

I could feel my face turning red. ""Um, George...Orwell?""

The class erupted in laughter.

Mrs. O'brian looked furious. Thankfully the bell rang and everyone started to gather their things and leave the classroom. I made my way back to my desk when she stopped me.

""I'm going to need to see you after class, Thomas."" She said without a hint of amusement in her voice.

Evan walked past us on his way out and whispered to me, ""I'll see you outside, assuming she doesn't kill you.""

The classroom was now empty besides the two of us.

""This has to stop, Thomas."" She said. ""I can't let you pass my class if you're always asleep or not paying attention.""

""I'm really sorry Mrs. O"" I replied. ""It's just so hard to get any sleep at home, with all the strays screaming at me from outside my bedroom window every night.""

She walked over to her desk and removed something from her top drawer. It was a brand new pair of ear plugs. She handed them to me.

""Try these this weekend, and let me know if you need more on Monday. You're a smart kid Thomas, but I can't let you move on to the 10th grade if you don't start applying yourself.""

I put them in my pocket and smiled at her. ""Thanks Mrs. O. I'll do that.""

She returned the smile and put her hand on my shoulder. Her mouth opened to respond but what I heard was not her voice. Instead it was an awful sound.

**EHH EHH EHH EHH EHH**



I woke up again. This time for real. I reached across my cot and slammed my hand down on that horrible alarm clock to silence it's assault.

I groaned and stretched, before swinging my legs over the side to get the day started.

""Another day in paradise."" I mumbled to myself, sarcastically.

Everything had changed quite a bit since the time of that dream. Far too many people had let their abilities go to their heads, and the world had fallen into a global state of civil war. It was like the wild west, but with magical abilities thrown into the mix. If you didn't have any way to protect yourself from bandits, then you were likely going to be canon fodder for the bloodthirsty and bored. Most people aligned themselves with a gang, or crew, or agency that provided some amount of security. I was no different.

I looked out of my bedroom window and saw my boys wrestling in the grass. Tiny roared as Liam chomped down on the scruff of his neck. Nearby, Paula was laying in the shadow of my shed, watching the two boys fight. I knocked on the glass.

All three of them looked up at me through the glass and smiled. Well, as much of a smile as one would expect from a lion, tiger, and panther.

I walked into the kitchen and poured myself a cup of coffee, before logging onto BILLNET to see what was going on with the crew.

*BING*

A message from Evan appeared.

**Hey T. We're meeting up today at noon, to caravan into town to get supplies. I'll pick you and the kids up around 11:30.**

I closed out my inbox, and looked at the news feed. Bill had shared an update. I clicked on it.

**PRESIDENT BRADLY ASSASSINATED IN THE NIGHT**

""Jesus Christ."" I muttered. ""Just keeps getting worse.""

Liam, Tiny, and Paula barged in the house through the back entrance and began aggressively nuzzling me and growling at each-other, competing for me attention.

""Alright, alright guys. Easy.""

I pushed my way past them, and went into the backyard before shutting the heavy door I installed to keep them inside. I walked over to my storage shed and opened the door.

*Baaaaa*

I unhooked the chain on the lamb I had purchased the previous week, and led it outside. I shut the door behind me, and walked back towards the house. I didn't enjoy this part, but it was necessary these days. Hunting was extremely competitive, and I didn't want anything to happen to the kids so I provide what I can for them.

I opened the gate and the kids came shooting out, filled with blood-lust and excitement for their meal. I quickly entered the house and shut the heavy door as the lamb's screams began.

I walked back over to my computer and sat down. I had missed another message from Evan, so I opened it.

**Change of plans. Bill intercepted a message from the Python Crew. They're going to raid town today around the same time that we were going to be there gathering supplies. We need to get there ASAP to avoid any bloodshed. I'm outside.**

I downed the rest of my coffee, and opened the closest window to whistle at the kids. They looked up at me in response, their faces all covered in blood.

*HONK HONK*

Evan was already here.

""Let's go kids!"" I shouted.

I shut the window, and went to my armory cabinet. I pulled out two pistols, and my trusty sniper rifle.

""Not specifically""
""They seem to like me"" fired my mouth in three bursts

""Could you explain more clearly?"" A voice so bold but revealing femininity

""Yes, you see. Animals called cats seem to like me""
I replied with amazing speed

""Well, that was a nice joke. Now. Please describe. I need an accurate description for your powers"" that bold women

""I'm sorry. I wasn't making a joke"" I cried trying to hide that I was indeed making a joke

""Very well, it seems you have difficulty in describing your powers. Shall I call for a telepathist?""She enquired

""No mam. I wasn't having any difficulty in describing my powers. Those are just the end of it. You see,  whenever I go near cats, they come closer to me and rub their bodies on me. At first,  I thought they were just scratching their backs with my cotton pants. But it didn't turn out like that. They had these happy faces that only an angel or somebody from it's family would have""
I paused

""Go on Mr.Tony""

""Can I get a glass of water please""? I asked her.

She pressed one of those buttons that looked like they belonged to a Russian bomb shelter. Another person showed up. To my surprise,  that person was already holding a glass of water. To be more clear, a glass 3/4 full of water with a disposable lid made of aluminum foil.

She whispered something to the other person in the left ear. That person handed me the water glass-bottle-coolthingy hybrid.
I peeled of the lid and sank my throat.
Now that I notice, that person was only wearing earing on his right ear.

I continued
""These cats;  they had a hard time leaving me, whenever I had to part away with them, they wouldn't jump amd hold me,  but they always hugged me by the chest and wept""

""And were they sapient?"" She interrupted

""No mam."" I replied.
""They were just as ordinary as any cat.""
""I suppose that's enough for the description?"" I asked. Pretending to be an asian sheriff. 

""More than enough for your age"" replied she.

She didn't seem that much interested. Just the look on her face would reflect the words ""I have the most boring job""
She filed my report. She thanked me. Then she pressed another one of those fancy buttons.

I left before I could see what that one was supposed to do.
As a highschool student on a vacation. I was extremely tired. I admit I'm lazy. Just like anybody who's born on 1996.the last thing I remember is the softness of my baseball printed blanket rubbed directly to my mamallian F-A-C-E.

""BEEP!"" went the clock. I couldn't get up. I thought, what if
""BEEEP!"" She went again, this time. Only to more annoying. ""BEEEEP!"" Came the final but the loudest nonsensical sound.
By this time, I had already undressed and went on to have my morning shower. Not that I like water. But my dad highly recommends it 'to be famous among the ladies'. Whatever he ment with that. I spent half of my shower time watching the curtain and the other half talking to Bomper, a sapient cow who lives in my bathroom. He's also blind so i allowed him to stay there. He eats my soap everyday.""

""Tony!!"" Cried out mommy. ""Breakfast is ready""
Anf that was my cue out.
I rubbed myself carefully with the fur-of-fury.
Then got dressed, jumped through the stairs just like Peter Parker Sr. From the old movie.
I thought this part was boring so I'm gonna skip it.
After finishing my breakfast and hurried to the attic cum library where my dad keeps his books.
And for you hygieniacs out there, I did wash my hands before and after eating. Just a point worth noting of.

I grabbed the last book that I was supposed to read.
The book that I was supposed to get on my 14th birthday.
Before my dad passed away.
I spent the first 20 minutes crying and the next 3 minutes trying to stop my generous eyeballs.

I read through the cover that say ""R-E-P-O-R-T Report!""
Oops!. I've missed a word ""B-I-R-T-H Birth! Birth-Report!""

Something tells me that I shouldn't open it. But my body was not ready for that I suppose. It moved on my own and opened the first page.
""October 17. 1996."" The first line ended.
Now a strange smell of seafood entered my mind. It seems it was the eight-tentacled barney-colored Octopus.
And No I'm not gonna associate Doc Oc to a cute Octopus. I always thought it was a mistake they had. A marvelous mistake. I giggled like a goose thanksgiving Santa Claus for his Gifs to Me Me. I laughed again. ""Man I'm the funniest guy."" I said to myself. Or maybe should I say ""Man I'm the punniest guy?!"" I laughed again. But this time; like a nerdy goose who's inhaled nitrogen gas.

""Look at me. How pathetic am I? I thought to myself. I cried first. Now I am laughin my ass off. Not realy. But it did hurt though. Its noon already. And I hadn't finished the first page of the boom yet.
I haven't even read the second line."" I said to myself with low volume so that nobody would hear it.

Now I remember a dream that I had for quite a few nights.
It wasn't always the same but it'd end up like this.
A cat poster with the word ""S-C-H-I-Z-O-R-P-H-R-E-N-I-A Schizophrenia!"" I recall doing a project on that one.
If I remember correctly that's the disorder where the doctors are supposed to say your brain is ****ed up.
I asked my mom.
She stabbed me with her pointy words
""No Tony! , you're not psychotic. Its just your age""
I thought that I really had that disorder after reading cats cause it.

""Maybe not. I said to myself.""
It was a long day to spend crying.

_=_=_=_=_=_=_=_=_=_=_=_=_=_=_=_=_=_=_

From the writer. 

Sorry for finishing the second half so quickly.  I had something totally different on my mind. It seems as though I overestimated my ability to type on morning. Sorry. And Tony didn't have schizophrenia. It was just one of the confusions caused when you're going through puberty. He thought he had schizophrenia for about a month after which he jumped on to another disease. He's 21 Now and if famous on instagram for his cat pics. He evolved his ability enough  talk to cats now.
That cow in his shower was just the imaginary frienf everyone has when they're lonely. Ask me anything if you didn't understand here and I'll try to respond. Pardon me for any grammer/spelling mistakes.FYI the story is set in an alternate universe at 2012.
Thanks for reading

My friends all had their own little quirks and skills, my friend Daniel had begun working for NASA in his spare time in our sophomore year of high school.

One of my other friends had gone off to the Middle East with a volunteer group that had begun making progress, calming everything down and decreasing attacks. Now, almost nine months after he left, you could barely tell there had been a war there at all, and you want to know how they did it?

Yoga.

Freaking yoga.

Who even does yoga?!

Another of my friends, well you get the idea.

Me, well, like I said, I was a nobody. The problem facing me was that everyone was born with a skill, something unique to them that no one else could do. But more and more it seemed like my talent was just being normal.

My parents were always telling me how it isn't our talents that define us, but who we are as people.

Yeah right.

It's easy for them to say when they're geniuses.

My Dad invented some alternative power source thingy I didn't even understand. Apparently he was able to create energy from people just walking around. Crazy, I know.

And then there's my Mom.

Sigh. Oh Mom.

For those of you who don't know who she is, where have you been, say, the last 20 years? She basically got rid of illnesses and disease. You remember cancer? Yeah, that's gone. Swine flu? Aids? You guessed it. And if anyone knows how she managed to accomplish THAT, it's certainly not me, so don't even bother asking.

But I digress. What I'm trying to say is that I have a lot to live up to, and I have absolutely no clue how I'm going to do it.

Above all, I just want to find my gift--the thing that makes me special.

A quiet purring filled the air, and my hand was headbutted by a large ball of fuzz.

""Not now Jonjon,"" I said, trying to push the beast out of the way. But Jonjon would not be denied, and I gave in to his demands with a small smile.

I looked down at him fondly, scratching behind his ears just the way he liked it. His purring increased in volume. I gave his head a quick rub and abruptly stood up.

Jonjon jumped down from where we had been sitting together on my bed, and with a twitch of his tail trotted out of the room without a second glance back at me.

I stared at where he had disappeared around the corner for several seconds before snorting in amusement. Cats always found a way to make me laugh, especially Jonjon.

Shaking my head I grabbed my backpack and headed out of the house. I didn't bother to let my parents know where I was going, for they would both be at work until past midnight. My lack of restrictions was the one saving grace of having famous parents, because they were at the top of the chain of command they were hardly ever home. It had been this way for as long as I could remember, and while at first it had been uncomfortable to always be by myself, now I couldn't imagine it any other way.

The door banged shut behind me as I walked across the street. I knocked, and then let myself in. Daniel and I were almost like family, and had given up letting the other into our homes long ago.

Before I could close the door, the orange and white tabby coat of Jonjon tore through the opening. I rolled my eyes and shut the door. I must have left the garage open when I got home from school. We had a doggy door that Jonjon used to go into the garage whenever we had company, or, when he could use it to escape the confines of the house.

I jogged up the stairs and pushed open the door to Daniel's room. I shut the door behind me and waited to let my eyes adjust to the sudden darkness. When I could see once more I took in the sight in front of me. There were two computer monitors on screensaver mode on top of his desk, alongside a third that appeared to have the plans to the new space ship model.

Did I mention Daniel works for NASA?

In the middle of the room was a couch, where Daniel was sitting, his headset on. Across the room from the computers was the TV, where Halo. . . .2? was currently being played.

If you haven't noticed Daniel's kind of a nerd.

""Did you bring the catnip like I asked?"" he said, his voice, louder due to the headphones, echoed around the room.

I nodded, then realized he wasn't looking, ""Yep.""

""What?"" he yelled over the sound of the game.

Instead of answering I dropped my backpack and dug around until my hand closed around a ziplock baggy, bulging from what was inside. I tossed it into his lap and zipped up my backpack, before tossing it into the corner. He only spared the baggy half a glance before he was back to the TV screen.

It was like this most times I came over, but by now I knew that I just had to wait it out. I sat down at his desk and admired the spaceship model. I must have been sitting for several minutes because I jumped when he said something from just behind me.

""Beautiful isn't she.""

I gave the smallest of nods, my eyes never moving from the image.

I opened my mouth to say something when a loud meow came from outside the door. A second one followed it at a higher pitch.

""Looks like the cats have found us,"" my friend said, already moving to let them in the room.

As three cats bounded through the door he flipped the light switch, momentarily blinding the two of us and leaving us blinking at the sudden change.

When I could see once more I noticed the three cats were milling around at my feet. Jonjon was one of them, and he was joined by the two cats that lived here.

""What did you need the catnip for?"" I asked suddenly.

I couldn't see Daniel's expression as his back was turned, but I could imagine him smirking as he said, ""Julie loves it. Plus, it'll help me with a little test.""

I cocked my head to the side, my curiosity piqued. But Daniel just gave me a knowing smile. I watched as he pulled apart the lips of the baggy, letting the smell waft out.

Three cat heads turned as one, but none of them moved.

""Here,"" Daniel said, handing me the baggy. ""Walk over to the far wall and hold it out for them.""

I did what he said and was surprised when the cats all followed me. One of them sniffed at my shoes and I nudged it back a step. I looked back at Daniel and he was grinning from ear to ear.

""Give it back.""

I did as he said but the cats stayed right where they were instead of following the bag as they had done before.

Daniel took a deep breath before giving me his signature quirky grin. He took a deep breath, and then said, ""Congratulations-""

His next word flipped my world upside down.

The stupid things breed so fast that even game shows tell you to neuter them. Calicos and ragdolls, Siamese and otherwise can be found all over the world. It's ridiculous that such a common creature be intertwined with my one true purpose in life. Do you know what it's like to be a ""crazy cat lady"" at seven?? You don't get a lot of dates that way, not when Sharon's talent is probably dick sucking. Sorry, just venting. Anyway, the silly little felines have always loved me. When I was wearing scrunchies in my crimped hair and later on when I finally graduated from university. Since I've always felt a sense of injustice when it came to talents, I decided to seek my own sense of justice I suppose. Not many women I knew pursued the police force like I did. I ran until I threw up as feral tabbies effortlessly jogged beside me. They kept me up with their purrs and head butts as I studied for exams. The stupid and adorable things were by my side no matter what, and damn did they grow on me. I was thirty when a huge Maine Coon hopped into my squad car. My partner, Marco, was annoyed but he'd learned to deal with it by now. All the kid heard was a bunch of hissing, but fuck me if I didn't hear all about Mrs. Fluffyboots being pissed at a drug dealer kicking her kitten. My coffee dropped from my hand and only the lukewarm liquid dripping on my thigh snapped me out of it. Needless to say, cats are everywhere. They breed so often and are on every damn continent. And now? I'm the best intelligence gatherer the U.S. Government has ever seen. ",Psyche_Siren

Another who like tinkering will revolutionize civil action. You? Well, cats just seem to like you...",meringun,"I was walking home from work in the cold sleet, wishing I had a car. No one did, not anymore. All the vehicles not used by the military were scrapped for the war. I lived in The Sanctuary, one of the few human cities independent of the Animal Kingdoms. We had to fight every day to maintain it, and military service was mandatory. I had worked at an ammunition factory for 3 years, ever since I was 14. After 4 years of civil service I'd only have to serve one year instead of two. I took this program because the pay's decent, and the average soldier lives for a few months. 

Pets are nonexsitant here, but there are ""stray"" cats and dogs all over the place. On civil service program involves rounding all these up, but many evade them. These ""strays"", as all school children know, are very aggressive and hostile to humans, often growling and barking before scampering off; however, cats have never been like that to me. My friends would be hissed at and scratched, but I could pick them up and they'd purr with delight. This was noticed by many people, including the Ministry of Defence who feared that I, like the ""stray"" animals, was a spy.

Walking down the deserted alleyway, I heard a low rumble from behind. I turned, only to be confronted with two leopards. I tried to run, but a third leopard blocked my escape. They lunged, and slashed me across the chest. One tackled me, but was pulled away by a massive german shepherd. A pack of the biggest dogs I've ever seen flooded the alleyway, and parlayed with the big cats. I ran, and was stopped by a pitbull. It wanted me to follow it, and I did. It lead me out of the city. Along the way, I'd see small flocks of birds badger random areas on rooftops, only for a tomcat or two to spill out and get chased off. A few were scooped up by hawks.

Crawling through a small tunnel that smelled awful, I emerged in a forest, and collapsed from the shock and massive lesions across my chest. I awoke in a room. I could see the walls of Sanctuary out my window. I heard a knock at my door and two middle aged men came in. They introduced themselves as the King of Dogs and the Lord of Birds. I was in a fortress and main base of operations for the two men's war against the Queen of Cats. They told me I shared here affinity with cats, and that she wanted to kill me and take out a possible rival. My powers are weak now and I can barely control cats, but eventually they'll develop enough to rival her's. I was rescued so that they may use me as a weapon, I could undermine her powers and give them the edge they need to win. 

I've been kept here for 40 days now. While I'm free to walk around the castle I'm escorted by sheep dogs and birds watch my every move. Lately I've been confined to my room. I have a marvelous view of the dogs and birds heading to the front. Everyday a column of dogs marches off in eager spirits. Every night, an equally large column of wounded dogs limps back. My room is right above the infirmary, the howls of anguish and the yelps of the doomed keep me awake for hours. The columns marching off have been getting smaller, and the ones marching back are getting larger. I see fewer and fewer birds flitting about. The war goes poorly. The dogs and birds have been fighting amongst eachother. The amiable sheep dog was replaced by a pack of mean wolves and a cassowary.

Tonight, I was awoken by a soft voice repeating ""Wake up, wake up."" I opened my eyes to see a cat standing on my chest. I jumped up but was hushed. ""Silence in golden right now."" the cat began ""The Queen apologizes for the excessive forced used earlier, it really was over the top but you were incapable of understanding us at the time. The Queen wishes to have you in her palace. She is an old woman, and here years are numbered. While twice as powerful as her adversaries, thanks to her age, she is almost 80, and needs an heir. Come with me, we can smuggle you out and take you to the palace.""

""I'm not sure I trust you."" I proclaimed. 

""That's understandible, but we're your best bet for survival. The dogs and birds have lost, their line has collapsed, the cheetahs have the area surrounded. There is a rift in the alliance. The Lord of Birds is retreating, and wishes to take you away with him. He's really bad at keeping a secret, since everyone knows and the King of Dogs wants to kill you. You can't return to Sanctuary either, as you were declared an enemy of the species and had your humanity formally revoked. If you could make it to their trenches alive you'll be shot on sight. Hurry now, with me. If you run away with the birds and are inevitably captured when the birds get intercepted no mercy shall be shown to you.""

So now here I am. The cassowary was killed outside by the sound of it. I can see the King of Dogs marching through the courtyard with a group of wolves. I can here dogs and birds fighting out in the hallway. My only choice appears to be with the Queen of Cats, and I don't by that ""excessive force"" story. I fear this may be the end for me.",Raptor_in_a_suit

Another who like tinkering will revolutionize civil action. You? Well, cats just seem to like you...",meringun,"""I like cats""
""Not specifically""
""They seem to like me"" fired my mouth in three bursts

""Could you explain more clearly?"" A voice so bold but revealing femininity

""Yes, you see. Animals called cats seem to like me""
I replied with amazing speed

""Well, that was a nice joke. Now. Please describe. I need an accurate description for your powers"" that bold women

""I'm sorry. I wasn't making a joke"" I cried trying to hide that I was indeed making a joke

""Very well, it seems you have difficulty in describing your powers. Shall I call for a telepathist?""She enquired

""No mam. I wasn't having any difficulty in describing my powers. Those are just the end of it. You see,  whenever I go near cats, they come closer to me and rub their bodies on me. At first,  I thought they were just scratching their backs with my cotton pants. But it didn't turn out like that. They had these happy faces that only an angel or somebody from it's family would have""
I paused

""Go on Mr.Tony""

""Can I get a glass of water please""? I asked her.

She pressed one of those buttons that looked like they belonged to a Russian bomb shelter. Another person showed up. To my surprise,  that person was already holding a glass of water. To be more clear, a glass 3/4 full of water with a disposable lid made of aluminum foil.

She whispered something to the other person in the left ear. That person handed me the water glass-bottle-coolthingy hybrid.
I peeled of the lid and sank my throat.
Now that I notice, that person was only wearing earing on his right ear.

I continued
""These cats;  they had a hard time leaving me, whenever I had to part away with them, they wouldn't jump amd hold me,  but they always hugged me by the chest and wept""

""And were they sapient?"" She interrupted

""No mam."" I replied.
""They were just as ordinary as any cat.""
""I suppose that's enough for the description?"" I asked. Pretending to be an asian sheriff. 

""More than enough for your age"" replied she.

She didn't seem that much interested. Just the look on her face would reflect the words ""I have the most boring job""
She filed my report. She thanked me. Then she pressed another one of those fancy buttons.

I left before I could see what that one was supposed to do.
As a highschool student on a vacation. I was extremely tired. I admit I'm lazy. Just like anybody who's born on 1996.the last thing I remember is the softness of my baseball printed blanket rubbed directly to my mamallian F-A-C-E.

""BEEP!"" went the clock. I couldn't get up. I thought, what if
""BEEEP!"" She went again, this time. Only to more annoying. ""BEEEEP!"" Came the final but the loudest nonsensical sound.
By this time, I had already undressed and went on to have my morning shower. Not that I like water. But my dad highly recommends it 'to be famous among the ladies'. Whatever he ment with that. I spent half of my shower time watching the curtain and the other half talking to Bomper, a sapient cow who lives in my bathroom. He's also blind so i allowed him to stay there. He eats my soap everyday.""

""Tony!!"" Cried out mommy. ""Breakfast is ready""
Anf that was my cue out.
I rubbed myself carefully with the fur-of-fury.
Then got dressed, jumped through the stairs just like Peter Parker Sr. From the old movie.
I thought this part was boring so I'm gonna skip it.
After finishing my breakfast and hurried to the attic cum library where my dad keeps his books.
And for you hygieniacs out there, I did wash my hands before and after eating. Just a point worth noting of.

I grabbed the last book that I was supposed to read.
The book that I was supposed to get on my 14th birthday.
Before my dad passed away.
I spent the first 20 minutes crying and the next 3 minutes trying to stop my generous eyeballs.

I read through the cover that say ""R-E-P-O-R-T Report!""
Oops!. I've missed a word ""B-I-R-T-H Birth! Birth-Report!""

Something tells me that I shouldn't open it. But my body was not ready for that I suppose. It moved on my own and opened the first page.
""October 17. 1996."" The first line ended.
Now a strange smell of seafood entered my mind. It seems it was the eight-tentacled barney-colored Octopus.
And No I'm not gonna associate Doc Oc to a cute Octopus. I always thought it was a mistake they had. A marvelous mistake. I giggled like a goose thanksgiving Santa Claus for his Gifs to Me Me. I laughed again. ""Man I'm the funniest guy."" I said to myself. Or maybe should I say ""Man I'm the punniest guy?!"" I laughed again. But this time; like a nerdy goose who's inhaled nitrogen gas.

""Look at me. How pathetic am I? I thought to myself. I cried first. Now I am laughin my ass off. Not realy. But it did hurt though. Its noon already. And I hadn't finished the first page of the boom yet.
I haven't even read the second line."" I said to myself with low volume so that nobody would hear it.

Now I remember a dream that I had for quite a few nights.
It wasn't always the same but it'd end up like this.
A cat poster with the word ""S-C-H-I-Z-O-R-P-H-R-E-N-I-A Schizophrenia!"" I recall doing a project on that one.
If I remember correctly that's the disorder where the doctors are supposed to say your brain is ****ed up.
I asked my mom.
She stabbed me with her pointy words
""No Tony! , you're not psychotic. Its just your age""
I thought that I really had that disorder after reading cats cause it.

""Maybe not. I said to myself.""
It was a long day to spend crying.

_=_=_=_=_=_=_=_=_=_=_=_=_=_=_=_=_=_=_

From the writer. 

Sorry for finishing the second half so quickly.  I had something totally different on my mind. It seems as though I overestimated my ability to type on morning. Sorry. And Tony didn't have schizophrenia. It was just one of the confusions caused when you're going through puberty. He thought he had schizophrenia for about a month after which he jumped on to another disease. He's 21 Now and if famous on instagram for his cat pics. He evolved his ability enough  talk to cats now.
That cow in his shower was just the imaginary frienf everyone has when they're lonely. Ask me anything if you didn't understand here and I'll try to respond. Pardon me for any grammer/spelling mistakes.FYI the story is set in an alternate universe at 2012.
Thanks for reading

Perhaps most people would find this to be cause to celebrate, but not me. What do I have to celebrate about anyway? Proving my mother right? She aways told me I'd never find a man, then she'd look off into the distance wistfully. She was probably imagining all the grandchildren I'd never give her, or maybe she was just thinking about tacos. Who the fuck knows what goes on in that crazy old git's head.

Maybe I should celebrate the fact I work a mediocre job and live in a tiny one bedroom apartment all alone. Well alone unless of course you count all of my cats, and I do.  Ok time for roll call! There's Ginger the orange tabby, Midnight whom is solid black, Sunny the Sphinx, Snowy the Persian, Waddles the munchkin cat, Fidget the blue Russian, and Bob, the idiot. 

I started out with just Ginger, but kept acquiring more and more cats over time. I never went out looking to adopt more cats, they seemed to find me. I've always loved cats so I don't really mind, the more the merrier right? I'm really starting to get into the idea of becoming a crazy cat lady anyway.

Sorry, I got off track, that tends to happen when I start taking about cats. Another reason I'm bummed today is I still haven't found my special talent. Yeah, I know most people don't find out what theirs is until their 30th birthday, but most people have some inkling of what theirs will be. I have no fuckin clue, just another disappointment in a long line of disappointments. I bet I don't have a special talent at all.

I'm just glad this day is almost over. Just a few more steps and I'll be inside my front door. First thing I'm going to do is take off my bra, second is lose the pants and then I'm going to eat freezer pizza while playing video games. Ah yes they perfect end to an imperfect day. 

Huh... That's weird. All the cats are at the front door, like they've been waiting for me to get home. Haha, Ginger is meowing and it almost sounds like words... Wait... It IS words. I leaned in closer and then the words become clear. ""Welcome home Eve, we have much to discuss. We've been waiting for you for a long time. You took longer for some of us to find than others, but now that we're all here it's time for you to take your rightful place as our leader."" My jaw dropped, I AM special after all... I fucking knew it.

Köttur, age 9
---

Anne stood and watched the children play. Her favorite part of the day was observing children create their own worlds. A group of boys and girls were fighting a monster only they could see, on a ship only they could control. Others were jumping rope, and still others were drawing with chalk. Every child in her 4th grade class was engaged. Except Köttur. 

The boy sat at a distance, against a tree, four cats curled up around him. He, too, watched the children play. It wasn't with interest, Anne noticed. Köttur seemed... suspicious.

He made Anne uneasy.

---
köttur, age 16
---
Köttur had been to Botswana many times before. His adoptive parents were missionaries. He loved it here. The raw wild called to him, even after he had arrived.

The buggy he was driving jostled him as it took each bump and dip in the gravely dirt road. He was speeding, but there were no limits. He had quickly learned that the general rule was to go as fast as you could without hurting yourself or others. And that seemed to be more a suggestion, and less a rule.

He was fast approaching the small village he had known as a boy, traveling with his parents. It was here he had met Mabadiliko, a mystic and village seer who had resisted his parents' message. Ultimately, the village had adopted Christianity, but throughout the years it blended with their local traditions into something unrecognizable. It was Mabadiliko that helped Köttur recognize the Gift.

The dirt road protested his speed with a gentle haze of dust. Through it, Köttur could see farmers rise from their fields, one hand over their eyes to shield the sun, staring in his direction. The villagers hated him, and he could feel their disdain as he raced toward the town center. Their hatred fueled him; his anger bringing a sickening joy. Köttur grinned.

The haze of dust behind him was moving, convulsing. Shadows danced among the fog, causing the villagers to turn and run toward their homes, grabbing children and calling to one another.

A watchman on a tower yelled as Köttur approached. Through the smoky dust, the glowing eyes of leopards could be seen as they sprinted alongside.

---
köttur, age 29
---
Köttur stood on a hill, overlooking the Gauteng capital city of Johannesburg. The last decade had seen him chased across the globe. He had briefly made Interpol's top 5 list. The people of the world grew wary of his Gift. He no longer had a home. 

Until today. 

Köttur raised his powerful arm, his blonde hair shining in the sunlight. He waited a moment, watching the serenity below him. He closed his eyes, fist still high in the air, a soft breeze enveloping him. It was time.

His piercing blue eyes snapped open. In one motion, he lowered his arm and knelt on one knee. He closed his eyes again.

The soft breeze built to a rushing gust of wind as thousands of jungle cats swarmed on the unsuspecting city below.",Meh_McSadsterson

Well, cats just seem to like you...",meringun,"Wailing sirens echoed through the city streets. the glow of flames tinged the walls of surrounding buildings. As Owen walked in the direction of the noise, a stray cat leapt from the shadows and followed directly behind him.   
   
  
  He had always been a recluse, unpopular and awkward. Girls didn't like him, his peers didn't like him, even dogs growled as he passed. so the day a vagabond cat appeared on his front porch, Owen expected to get scratched to ribbons.  
  
  
  Sergeant Pulaski was growing hoarse from screaming. It seemed the waves of people fleeing the gargantuan anthropomorphic pug would never end, and someone needed to bark orders. otherwise, he'd be happy letting the giant dog stomp empty buildings flat. He was running on fumes, and didn't have the patience for some teenager walking purposefully in the wrong direction. ""hey, idiot!"" He shouted. ""That thing'll crush you!"" But the kid kept walking, and then Pulaski saw it. A herd of cats, jogging along after the boy's heels.  
  
  
  Clad in a mustard-colored cape, The Amazing Hot Dog was at his wit's end. none of his sausage-related powers seemed to have any affect on the Space Pug, so he turned to his compatriots, the Fast Food Five. ""My Cola Blasts have no affect."" said a dour Soda Fontaine. ""My Szechwuan Fire Fists are equally useless."" concurred a dejected General Tso. The looks of despair on the faces of Diablo Taco and Whamburger told Hot Dog all he needed to know. What were they to do? He scanned the horizon, casting about in desperation for an answer. Who could defeat such a monstrosity? Then he saw it, creeping from every alley. From every trashcan, every dumpster, every windowsill, every cardboard box. A massive horde of cats.  
...
  
  ""I don't know what to do with myself,"" Owen had said to the homeless man who was his only two-legged friend. ""my job stinks, I have no girlfriend, and all my money goes towards feeding all these cats anyway."" He gestured around the front stoop of the apartment building. Dozens of tabbies, calicos, tortiseshells, tuxedoes and more lazed about, most gazing at Owen as if he were made of catnip. ""I can't get rid of them, and I cant let them starve in any case. I never asked for this. what should I do?"" He turned to the hobo. 
  ""your life is just beginning, young man. you'll find your purpose. look at me, I don't have nothin', and I have yet to fulfill my grand purpose myself.""
  Owen flashed him an incredulous eyebrow. ""Yeah, sure."" He mumbled out sarcastically, chin on his palm. ""that makes me feel so much better.""  
  
...
  
  Flames from the destruction licked high, and spread throughout the widening path of rubble as cars got caught in the blaze. the roar of the monstrous Space Pug echoed between the shattered hulks of the skyscrapers. Owen strode forward, now surrounded by a feline sea. Thousands of cats had made their war to him, so many that one could not see the pavement. they circled around him, and climbed atop one another to get closer to him. Owen took another step forward, and stood atop the backs of three cats standing close to each other. another step landed on the backs of cats, who were building a sort of cheerleader's pyramid to give him support. every subsequent step brought him higher and higher up a swiftly building staircase of cats. Soon, he was engulfed in a swarming hive of putty tats, and it lifted him up into the sky.  
  
  Pulaski recieved the call to evacuate, and did a final 360' visual sweep to confirm that no more civilians remained. Down the street, in the direction of the chaos, lumbered a sight he had never seen before. a towering colossus of fur and whiskers, lumbering it's way toward ground zero. What on earth was that?  
  
  From his vantage point on the rooftop, the embattled Amazing Hot Dog spied a massive..... ..*thing* making its way toward the battle. Was it there to help the  giant pug? Or defeat it? As it came more into view, the Fast Food Five and the Space Pug together whirled to face the newcomer. what they saw, by the firelight of towering skyscraper infernos, was a towering conglomerate of fur and claws. thousands upon thousands of cats, all clinging to each other, all acting as one. and at its head, if you squinted really hard, could be seen a teenage boy.  
  
  An appendage grew fom the mass, a colossal fist made of cats! it swung mightily in the direction of the Space Pug, and connected with the force of a million mouse-slaying pounces. The Space Pug flew backward into the wreckage of the financial district, sending chunks of concrete and marble into the air. The cat-mass wasted no time, following up its first strike with a ferocity born of countless catnip frenzies. The fight to save the city was on.  
  
  Far below, at a safe distance (thanks to the efforts of an underappreciated Sergeant Pulaski), a crowd cheered. a young woman stepped forward, squinting at the teenage figure she could just barely make out. ""Who is that?"" She wondered. Behind her, a homeless drifter stepped from the shadows. ""He's the hero this city has been waiting for, ma'am."" Tears of pride brimmed in the vagabond's eyes.  
  
   ""They call him... Pussy Magnet.""",PharoahSlapahotep

Better than the lottery honestly and judging by the payout tables in New Appalachia a better payout even if all you got was bowel control.

""The 15"" they are called. It took them a full five years to figure out that it was about one in 31911 people that would get a amplified natural skill. Everyone of course was born with something but a lot of the time it manifested in something mundane. One guy would be able to surf so well it looked like he was walking the water another might be able to be the only one who could hit a fastball thrown over 140 mph. It has turned into a world of exceptional people but nothing was ever monumental. Like bowel control, who cares if you can fart the star spangled banner or whistle Coldplay with your pie hole?

Then the ultras started to pop up about three years ago. Devlin, their leader had been using his ability in mathematics to track them down. He had the singular luck to be the first of his kind and have a gift that would service his ego. I had heard him give a speech on the differences in Triangulation and Trilateration about two months before he found the second 15er. Lina Rae had not even realized she was a 15er when Devlin found her much like I did not know I was either until she found me. Lina Rae was sensitive to vibrations so much so that she could understand them. Channel them and track them. She was like a living walking computer hooked up to the earth. She could tell where someone was anywhere within five miles by how they walked. It was all very over whelming for her and at first it was only tolerable for about 10 seconds and up to 30 feet. So much input. George fixed that for her with some custom hearing aids that filtered the vibrations based on some kind of mathematical algorithm Devlin had cooked up. George was a engineer but not just mechanical, or civil, or electrical, he was all of them. Anything and everything was his in his power band. You need something he can build it. Seriously the gy was a one man fabrication shop. Lina Rae was only one of thousands of people that he helped. All she had to do was focus and she could find anyone almost anywhere thanks to George's and Devlin's help. She could read a computer screen at 40 miles if she wanted. She found new tricks everyday. It was amazing honestly. She once announced that I was ovulating. That was a bit weird.

The day she found me I was at my parents business doing my weekly rounds. Cleaning the cages and scooping shit. This would all be mine one day. I was in a mood to say the least just thinking about that. Their sudden and unannounced intrusion to my normal day startling at first turned to pure panic as I felt the water at my feet bind me in place like superglue. The four of them looking at me I heard Devlin say ""That is her! 31911 it has to be my models are never wrong!"". Lina Rae eyed me up and down with a finger to her ear trying to get a read on me with some kind of vibration. The next to last visitor a teenage boy still looking at his phone sighed and I found my legs unbind. Looking down the water it did not move or seem to change. I still am not sure what that was about.

I smoothed my dress and requested to know what was going on. Devlin was curt in his response. ""What is your skill, we know you are a 15er. Lina can feel you from twenty miles and Kurt says you taste funny like we do"". 

Taste?! I did not like Kurt real quick.

Not having a skill I was sent into a panic. My blood pressure rose, my skin flushed, my hair seemed to stand on end. Lina Rae noticed instantly and started to say something before the cage beside her flung open and a small white kitten struck her dead in the face with a well placed open paw haymaker. Falling to the ground without doing any damage what so ever it meowed and ran for cover. Stunned by a full frontal attack of cuteness Lina Rae laughed out loud as more kittens stormed the room from every direction. One after another they flooded over the four 15ers like a tsunami of Awwwww. It was to be later named The tribble attack of 2016. My power it seems was Kitten control and I had no idea how truly powerful it would become. Lina Rae kept that white one.

They were always hanging around me, though their numbers had grown over the years. It had started with a single tabby kitten I had met while walking along a riverbank when I was six. It followed me the whole day, and the next, and the next. On the fourth day he brought a friend, an orange striped cat with one eye. Ever since then, my herd of cat followers had grown larger by the year. 

I looked at their hungry faces, turned up at me in expectation. Amused by their antics, I waded through the sea of meowing fur balls to the end of the pier and crouched down. I closed my eyes and began to sing. It wasn't long before I felt an answer to my siren song. With a flash of silver and a great spray of salt, a giant tuna surged up from the depths and stranded itself on the shore. I gaped at the marvelous fish in surprise. I had long ago mastered minnows, sardines, herring, and mackerel - even the occasional lobster or two on special occasion - but an entire tuna? That was a new one even for me. 

The beautiful fish breathed its last and the cats began to swarm around it, all hoping to get a tasty morsel of this truly magnificent feast. In their rush to fill their little bellies with as much tuna as possible, none of the cats noticed me slip under the waves.

The warm fire crackled in the fireplace as I sat contentedly in my arm chair stair at the slowly twirly hands of my time piece.    Maybe I'd finally figure out the point of my damn talent.  
Everyone else I had ever known was so amazing.  Elizabeth, my ex from highschool, was building starships now.  Alex my best friend from college was now flying them between planets at the far end of the galaxy. My brother was spreading peace across the warring states of mars, bloodlessly - bringing freedom wherever he went.  But I.... I just sat here with my cats.  

I watched the clock tick closer to the time I had been born 30 years ago.

I didn't have an unhappy life - I was just tired of my mother bugging me, asking me when I would grow up.  When would I make something of my talent like she had of hers, and with her talent - a knack of convincing anyone of anything - she could really, really go on.  Unfortunately, she had convinced herself that my feline attraction would mature into an amazing talent.  

Ember purred as I petted her soft, black fur.  Whatever.
 
The clock hit 8:34.  30 years before I had been born.
The clock continued to tick.
Nothing changed.  
I stood up and stretched and looked around at my several cats all laying contently around the room. 
Hmmm... I think I'm okay.
Maybe in a world of dreamers, of inventors, of the perpetually unsatisfied, I, alone, was okay.  I was fine with who I was, who I had been, and who I was going to be.  I didn't need anyone else to have my happily ever after.  I just needed me.  And if a friend or two wanted to hang, that'd be cool too... but totally unnecessary.  ",Inlacrimabilis

A single tabby, following me to school. I was only 5 and delighted to meet the new friend I had seen watching me from afar for the past few months. Proudly sitting myself down to first class I presented my new friend to the teacher, who quickly sat him outside the door and proceeded with the lesson. When the scratching intensified and she finally relented to see what was working the poor creature up, four cats entered the room and sat themselves around me. ""How peculiar..."" was all I remember her saying, staring intensely at the gaggle of felines now surrounding my desk. Phone-calls must have been made. Concerns were raised. How would we manage four cats following him everywhere, how are other students meant to focus? It was merely the beginning of many uncomfortable questions.


That was 11 years ago. I slide from my bed, carefully setting my foot between a nest of clawed limbs and lazily flicking tails. I trudge to the window, ignoring the chorus of irritated chirping, cutting through the apparent sound of 100 tiny engines gently idling. Outside was as it always was: A complete wreck. The lawn, where visible, was minced, scattered with feathers and tufts of errant fur. What remained of the tiny birch tree my father proudly planted 13 years hence sat forlornly amidst the ocean of lounging bodies, forming a muted rainbow stretching into the street and far beyond.


Raised voices carry up from the hallway downstairs, juxtaposed to the combined sound of hundreds of resting cats. The specifics are muffled, but I catch the words ""institution""... ""properly manage""... and ""Gift"", the latter-most dripping with sarcasm as always and marking the voice as mothers. Some people get strength, others get insight, one guy even had a formidable understanding of marine life. Somehow I got cats. They loved me, in the way that cats do obviously; no force could compel cats to stop being cats. They just felt the need to be cats around me, magnetically attracted in the aloof way cats are. I was pretty sick of it quite a while ago. At least they made an effort to listen.


The argument downstairs is getting more heated, I shush the surrounding cats in an attempt to better hear what's being said. The purring moves from a soft roar to a quiet hum both outside and inside; the discussion becomes clearer.


""I'm not sure you're grasping what I'm telling you here, how serious this is."" my Mother explains, keeping her voice level this time.

""Alright, what's changed in your mind?"" My father replies, obviously tired of rehashing the discussion

""I've been talking to, well, experts on these things, people who study these sorts of people.""

""And?""

""Well, we all know the ""Gift"" peaks at 30, and starts showing around 5 or so"".

""Obviously, we've all seen this ourselves on TV.""

""Well, Jacks gift is what we call a ""Quantifiable"" gift, you can measure it, and compare it to other gifts people had.""

""Yeah, so?""

""Well, gifts like these, the way they grow... it's exponential Charles...""

""What are you saying?""

""If we compare him to that Alex kid, remember him, had that reality show? The one that could lift buildings? Well when his gift started, he could lift 100 pounds or so pretty easy, when he was Jacks age, he could lift a Jeep, and when he hit 30 he was lifting entire buildings. And when you plot his strength over time, you can see how fast it grows...""

""And if Jack's gift does the same thing...""

""There's, what 1000 cats out there? At this rate, if he follows the same pattern as all the other quantifiable gifts... we're talking 100 million cats, that's basically every single cat in the country... and that's not even... there's a bobcat out there Charles...""

There's an uncomfortable silence as I feel my father process this information.

""Maybe be then he could control it better then, tell them to just go home... maybe he can...""

""I don't think you appreciate how important this is, the expert I was speaking to had to make reports to his superiors... there's a representative from Washington coming down later today to discuss how we... how anyone is going to handle this.""

""I... Just... Shit..."" My father struggles to find the words.

I step back from the window and consider everything I just heard. I feel oddly calm. Like this is what I knew would happen all along. I contemplate the prospect of commanding 100 million animals. It feels oddly right. The cats can feel the wheels turning in my mind, hundreds of yellow eyes turn to meet mine as I inspect the... my... horde. The window opens effortlessly; I move with complete confidence of purpose. I lean forward and tumble out of the open portal, landing immediately on a pile of cats stacked 10 high. They bear me gently to the ground, supporting my weight without hesitation. A trophy? A place on prime-time? A crappy reality show? There's a lot more that can be done with this. The cats look to me, awaiting a new command. Images of mountain lions flash before my eyes, of a horde that stretches a hundred miles. 

We can make a start I conclude, as the cats surge me forward with surprising speed away from my home, toward greatness.",cherubeal

[WP] All universities test and assign a major that directly relates to the student's life. You are assigned Schizophrenia. You have no idea why.,ndemasie,"   It was a foggy and mild morning on new student day at Delaware State Institute, a day I anxiously awaited since receiving notice of acception. We freshies gathered in the commons rotunda at 9:00am sharp for the continental breakfast. Although a small public institution, DSI had the top ranked dining facilities in the tri-state region. After filling our bellies to their brims with the ever so airy, fruit-ladden belgian waffles, maple soaked chorizo, and eggs benedict, a volunteer showed us to our respective dorms. 
   Following the hour or so we had to drop off our belongings and briefly get to know our new roomies, we were divided into groups, given our student id numbers, and sent to separate computer labs based on last name. I copy my id onto my hand after being instructed not to misplace our numbers ""p1490187,"" it reads.
 
  This was it, the most important and stressful hour of our young lives, the state-wide Institute Placement Exam. I suppose I never really put much thought into what I wanted to do, but I particularly enjoyed the psychotherapy unit in high school psychology. I was excited to see what the IPE had in store, yet an unsettling nervousness was sublty creeping in. I had heard countless stories of the exam and how it's 99.9% sensitivity almost always yielded a correct match, but I was skeptical. I wondered how in just a measly twenty-one questions they would perfectly match a major to the sum of my life experiences.

   Upon entry of the lab I look around for a familiar face, I quickly realize I know noone. Cool, no problem, this was the anonymity on which I would construct the new me, the fresh start I yearned for. It was the chance I awaited to put my old isolated memories of high school behind. I sit down in the back row on the far right. I set up my new student email, then sign in. The link in my inbox takes me to the exam homescreen. The butterflies kick in when the proctor informs us we will begin when the clock strikes noon. I have always prided myself on my test taking so I don't know why I  felt such unease.
    As soon as the second hand points skyward I begin. I enter my name, birth date, and id. The first twenty merge into a blurry, prying questionnaire now, but I could never forget the last question. I instantly recognized it as one of the original Rorschach inkblot tiles that we discussed in psych. Simple, it's a butterfly. I mean, nobody in their right mind would argue otherwise. It was as clear as day. 
    I submit my answers, the completion screen informs me to report to the protcotor for further instruction. I look up and realize everyone is gone except for me, my immediate neighbor, and the proctor whose nose is burried in a book. My neighbor finishes as I grab my bag and throw my jacket on. He seems like a cool guy so I introduce myself. ""Kyle,"" he confidently remarks while shaking my now clamy hand. With a dumbfounded look he asks, ""so what was up with that last question?"" While I bend down to tie my shoe, I reply, ""oh yeah, the butterfly inkblot?"" He looks perplexed when he questions my facetiousness as we walk towards the front of the classroom. I, ahead of him, ask the proctor for my next move. She requests my name and id, does a search and copies ""A280"" onto a blank index card. I wait in the hall as Kyle receives his assignment. Five minutes go by before I duck into the bathroom. I walk back out and see no one in the classroom except the proctor who is now packing up. I ask if she saw the direction Kyle went. She coldly says nothing and swiftly walks out as if she didn't hear a thing.  

   Roaming the halls in route to A280, I turn the corner and instantly bump into Kyle. He asks what room number I got. After showing him my index card, he tells me he can show me there. After anxiously pacing through a few corridors we get to the room and I peep my head in. Their are a handful of cold metal chairs setup, one rear facing, with a man in his mid-forties seated with one leg over the other. His blandly colored clothes strangely seemed so vivid in comparison to the dull greyness filling the room. I turn back around and involuntarily recoil when I see Kyle is absent from sight. The seated man grabs a dixie cup from a tray on the table behind him, and while glancing down at his clipboard he posits, ""You must be patient 1490187."" ",bkrahl

""Now, Daniel."" I finally interject. He stops, almost flabbergasted that I would so rudely interrupt. ""You wrote in your application that you have no employment currently.""

""That's correct, yes."" Daniel nods and cracks a wide, friendly grin. It seems he thinks he nailed that one. 

""Well then I'm just going to have to be direct with you. Are you a pen salesman?""

""What? No!""

""See, it's just that you just spent a lot of time trying to sell me pens.""

""You asked me to!""

""I asked you to sell me one pen. A normal pen. What is this?"" I pick up a pen with a nib on one end and a small hole on the other. I press a small switch on its side and a thin sausage of purple play-doh oozes out onto my desk. 

""What are you talking about?"" Daniel replies, seemingly astonished that I would accuse him of lying. ""That is the number one fun-doh excreting pen on the market. My nieces and nephews loved them, so I always keep one on me.""

""And this?"" I pick up a sleek, white pen with two nibs.

""A fantastic pen. Double the writing, half the work. You're a fishing man, right? Well just imagine getting your work done in half the time and getting out on the boat-""

""Enough! Enough selling! The exercise is over. Put your pens away.""

Daniel scoops up his fabulous array of novelty pens and stuffs them into his jacket. 

""I think that draws this interview to a close."" I say, discreetly filing Daniel's application in the trash can. ""I'm going to be honest. You probably won't hear from us.""

""Oh."" For the first time, Daniel's smile drops. ""Would you mind telling me why? So I know what to improve?"" 

""Well Daniel, first of all I'm fairly sure you're a pen salesman. In fact, it's now becoming clear to me that you probably take interviews for sales positions at various companies all over town, trying to flog your terrible pens.""

""That's... fair."" 

""And secondly, even if I admired your salesmanship and thought you'd be a perfect fit on our sales team, I couldn't allow anyone so stupid to work here at the pencil factory.""

"[WP] You just asked the interview candidate to sell you a pen. Unbeknownst to you, he/she is a professional pen salesperson, and they're using this interview as an excuse to sell you their unique line of novelty pens.",quailtop,"""Now Mister Kern,"" Barlow says, running his fat fingertip down the list. ""I don't mean to be insulting, but your résumé seems, um, slightly improbable, don't you think?"" 

Eddie Kern sits across from him, fresh-faced and attentive, clad in what looks to be his father's suit. It shows slight signs of wear and is overlarge at the shoulders, and with Kern's skinny neck and freckled face, it brings to mind a babe swaddled in tweed. He twists his neck as if to read the upside-down papers and pipes up cheerfully, ""Is there a problem, sir?"" 

""Not a problem, necessarily,"" Barlow says. Kern's like a puppy, eager to please. Barlow likes the enthusiasm, but he wants to make sure Kern's not the type to piddle all over the floor. ""It's just you've got quite an impressive list of previous jobs here, and -"" He flips through the papers and squints, and then squints up at Kern. ""How old did you say you were again?"" 

""Oh!"" Kern says, and laughs lightly. ""Older than I look, I assure you, Mister Barlow. You can go down the list, call them all up. I've been working for a long time, started door to door selling pens when I was nine."" Kern squares his shoulders and does a very passable impersonation of a professional. ""I've had a lot of experience since then."" 

""Mm,"" Barlow mutters. He figures Kern's padding his résumé, but for a sales clerk he doesn't much care. He'll do due diligence, though, make a few calls. ""Selling pens, was it?"" he says, looking up, and picks up a black ballpoint from his desk. ""Well, let's see what your sales pitch was, Mister Kern. Go on, sell me this pen."" 

Kern's face lights up, so abruptly that Barlow thinks of a jack-o'-lantern. A single strike of a match, and a twisted leering grin come alive. ""That pen?"" Kern says, and snatches it out of his hands. ""Hmm, I don't think so, Mister Barlow,"" and the pen is casually flicked aside, skittering across the office floor. ""A man like you, no, he deserves a better class of writing implement."" 

Barlow barely swallows a chuckle. There's actually a few droplets of spit that escape. ""Well, uh, go on,"" he says in wonder. ""What, uh, what does a man like me deserve?"" 

There is the glint of metal and suddenly there is a new pen in Kern's hand, as if he's pulled it out of his sleeve. Kern is standing, leaning over with a practiced spiel. ""A man like you,"" he says, ""is a man of experience and understanding, who smiles at the whimsical notions of fate."" The pen is comically thick and black, dotted with open white circles and swooping infinity swooshes - like a wizard's robe, Barlow thinks. ""The push button features a working Magic 8-Ball, so that with a single signature -"" Kern waves it like a magic wand and tips the pen to him, and sure enough, Barlow can see the fluorescent blue triangle bobbing up through the darkness ""- your fate will be revealed."" 

Barlow pushes his chair back, and the sticky wheel squeaks. ""Wait, wait,"" he mutters, blinking. ""I don't - How did you get that to work in such a small space?"" He shakes his head, clearing away the cobwebs. ""No, no, never mind. I don't think, Mister Kern, that this is exactly the sort of thing we're looking for -"" 

""No matter,"" Kern says easily, and like a magic trick he fans out an entire deck of pens, all four suits - no, at least a dozen suits, all of different colors. ""I'm sure I have exactly what you need.

""The syringe pen,"" Kern says, before Barlow can stop him, and there is a thing of transparent plastic and blood red ink and a glinting steel point. ""Your wife worries, doesn't she, Barlow? What with your desk job, your eating habits, your failure to work out on the weekends - your father died of a heart attack, didn't he Barlow? You can still see him, can't you, red-faced at your dinner table -"" 

""No!"" Barlow says, and even as he says it he can feel the blood rushing to his face, his tie constricting. It's true, it's all true. He should have seen this coming. ""How dare you! You - you get out of my office right now, Kern! You - you -"" He is spluttering. Chest pain. Lightheadedness. Nausea. Sweating. 

""But a man like you!"" Kern trills, and clicks his abominable tool repeatedly, the needle sawing in and out like a sewing machine, or some unimaginable medical appliance. ""It's all a joke to you, isn't it, Barlow? You're not scared of hospitals! You're not scared of getting your shots! Of course not! Of course not!"" Kern lays the syringe out on the table, daring Barlow to take it. ""It's just a lot of red ink to you!"" 

Barlow sucks in breath again, sinking back down into his chair. Red ink, yes, that's all it is. A little stress. Nothing to kill yourself over. He mops his sweaty brow with his tie. ""Please,"" he begs. ""My god, Eddie, please. Whatever you're doing - please, please -"" 

""Ohhh,"" says Kern, in a false, drawn-out sympathy, and there are so many pens, there are just so many pens. They are multiplying. They are trickling out of his sleeves. Flower-tipped pens blooming in bunches. Racecar pens screeching up on their nubby rubber wheels. Pens with goofy-haired trolls and grinning demented faces popping up and shrieking at him. Bendy rubber gel pens writhing like worms, burrowing out from the ground. Bone pens, molded plastic and knobbly joints, and Barlow realizes with horror that he is looking down at his own fingers. There are so many novelty pens, and they are all so terribly tacky. ""Oh, I've got a pen for you,"" Kern shrieks. ""I've got a pen for you!

""You want to believe you're a fun guy, don't you?"" Kern says, striding over him as Barlow has collapsed to the floor, crouching in a fetal position. ""You're fun! You're whimsical! You sure know how to have a good time!"" The racecar wheels in high-pitched circles around him, imitating a deep, throbbing horsepower. ""You're not washed-up yet, oh no, Barlow! You haven't become just like your old man! You're not a humorless piece of shit like he was! There's more to your life than money!"" The flower pens are making funeral wreaths, bristling thorns of plastic and metal. The trolls and smiley faces are grinning like there's no tomorrow. ""You're not going to die miserable and unfulfilled! No! You're the fun sort of boss!"" And Kern's baby face is leaning in, red-tinted and horrible and with the mocking grin of eternal youth. ""You're the sort of guy who owns a novelty pen!"" 

""What do you want!"" gasps Barlow. He is clawing at his own face with his own bony pen fingers, drawing ink lines down his cheeks. ""My god! What do you want from me!"" 

And Kern is calm again, handing down the 8-Ball pen like a god from on high. ""Barlow,"" he says. ""I just want to sell you a pen. Go ahead. Have a test run."" 

Barlow reaches out with trembling fingers and takes it. It is too thick, a cartoon plaything, and fits uneasily in his hand. He crawls to a sitting position, feels around on his desk. There's usually no dearth of loose paper, a bunch of old receipts and invoices and memos, but now there's nothing but the nibs of his fingers scratching out lines against the wood. 

""Here you go,"" Kern says sweetly, and from his pocket unfolds a sheet of parchment like a handkerchief. ""Go ahead, boss. Give 'er a try."" 

Barlow gets to his knees and flattens out the paper on his desk, and closes his eyes and through muscle memory signs his name. 

""There you go,"" Kern says, and Barlow opens his eyes and looks down at a glass display case, all the novelty pens aligned in some arcane order. Barlow's holding the 8-Ball pen in his hand. ""That'll be a dollar fifty nine, sir."" 

Kern's humorless behind the counter, all the hysteria drained of him, grown to fit his suit. There are lines at the corners of his eyes, lines at his mouth when he remembers to smile. ""Sir?"" 

""Oh,"" Barlow says, and feels for his pocket and extracts his billfold and lays two dollars out on the counter. ""Yeah. Here you go."" 

Kern taps the cash register and makes change, and Barlow turns to see the doors behind him. He leaves without looking backward and steps into the noonday sun. 

Barlow blinks, uneasily, a donkey that has lost its burden. He no longer knows where to go. He looks down at the thing in his hand, clicks it, and watches the fluorescent blue triangle float to the surface. 

*Better not tell you now,* it says. 

Barlow slips the pen in his pocket, and wanders down the sidewalk, off into an uncertain future. ",sadoeuphemist

"[WP] You just asked the interview candidate to sell you a pen. Unbeknownst to you, he/she is a professional pen salesperson, and they're using this interview as an excuse to sell you their unique line of novelty pens.",quailtop,"As he ushered his secretary to let in the last interview of the day, Robert mused about which was more unsatisfying, the last 15 candidates he had interviewed or the lunch he had eaten this afternoon. Judging by the clock the time was nearing 6pm but his stomach estimated it closer to 2 hours past meal time. If he could keep this interview short there was a delicious roast beef sandwich he could steal from the company fridge. It was supposed to be Joe's lunch but he'd left in the afternoon claiming a headache.

Dreamy thoughts of rich juicy roast beef were cut short by half a handshake. More specifically, the half that didn't involve Robert. Standing with his arm outstretched in a suit and tie, the sudden intruder cut an imposing figure. With an awkward throat clear, Robert completed the handshake and motioned for the man to take a seat on the opposite side of his fantastically unornate desk.

""Good to meet you uh...."" He trailed off, refreshing on resumes was for men who did not have their minds preoccupied with salivatory delights and he did not know this man's name.

To his credit, the man did not bat a single eyelash. ""Very pleasant to meet you too.""

""Thank you for taking the time to interview with us. I have, uh, heard extensively about your sales experience."" He lied out of instinct. This conversation needed to be shifted away from introductions before his lack of knowledge came back to bite him.

Robert sat down and leaned onto the desk, looking the other man straight in the eye. ""I have heard about your extensive experience however here at SALES SALES SALES Inc we don't simply take honeyed words. We demand RESULTS.""

The other man did not move other than to calmly nod.

""Sell me this pen."" Robert demanded confidently, tossing a generic ballpoint pen across the table. He leaned back and calmed down. He was back in his element now.

The man picked up the pen and examined it quickly. Then a miraculous thing occurred. For the first time in this strange encounter, the man's eyebrows moved. ""That is a curious question. Why would anyone ever want this pen?""

Robert's jaw dropped.

""What I mean is"" The man continued ""why would anyone want THIS pen."" He gently tossed it in the trash and reached into his bag.

One thing you have to understand about this sales office is that every item was priced, recorded and tracked. Robert watched the pen sail into the trash bin the same way a person might watch 31.67 cents be tossed into a trash bin after being stolen from your wallet. Eventually, his astonished gaze returned back up to the other man, who was holding a new pen in his hand.

""I want you to have this, as a present from me. It's a much better pen for a man of your sales stature. When a client sees you signing the document that seals away their savings for the next 20 years, do you want them looking at a cheap piece of plastic, or this?""

This was the moment where Robert was supposed to interject, or at least refuse to take a gift during an interview but much to the dismay of his professionalism, he dumbfoundedly accepted the pen. Lunch was way more important to him than professionalism anyway and he'd already forgotten about that.

""This pen is made from unibody anodized aluminium. The same material they use to build airplanes. It's super thin, strong and light all at the same time. It makes pen strokes light and effortless. No signature of yours should ever be written with a cheap plastic toy ever again.""

""Th- thank you."" His brain was still processing the whole situation approximately a sentence too slowly.

""This pen under good use should last you about 180 days of normal use. But maybe more like 130 for a sales shark like you."" 

Robert nervously cleared his throat, carefully examining the pen. It was quite beautiful, with a mellow silver and gray brushed finish. ""Yes, of course"" 

""After the lifetime of this pen, you will need more pens. Thankfully, I can sell that to you here and now.""

Even though he was still lost in this conversation, a little part in the back of Robert's brain suddenly lit up and recovered from the deep thaw. It realized the danger that he might be suddenly be subjected to parting with any amount of money. This was completely unacceptable and Robert jolted back to awareness. 

""That, uh, will not be necessary. You can have this pen back. That was an excellent demonstration.""

Robert suddenly became sullen. This man had clearly passed, which meant more paperwork for him. With a sigh, he looked at the clock. Which was a redundant action, his stomach had already told him the time.

""You don't like it? That's okay. I have many others. How about a pen that can measure the temperature? I have one that can take your pulse and one that can call you wife when you are working late. For a man of your sales experience and wealth i have one that shows stock tickers and can initiate trades with the click of the cap. Surely one of these will be one you desire.""

The man caught him by complete surprise. ""You have me convinced, you can sell a pen. No need to patronize me.""

""You don't understand, I have them all right here."" The man emptied his bag on to the desk, along with his business cards. Mr. Henry Wright, Pen salesman. Robert read the card over 3 times in disbelief. Next time he should really read the resumes.

Robert was astounded as he studied the myriad of pens. Each one sated a different desire. However as he finished studying the pile in front of him, he found it lacking in exactly one way.

"[WP] You just asked the interview candidate to sell you a pen.

But I will not sell you just _any_ pen. I will sell you _this_ pen.""

The person I'm interviewing reaches for his pocket. Pulls out this, beautiful, silver-looking pen. He seems prepared - someone probably asked him this before. But it's just a pretty pen, I'm not impressed yet.

He says ""Depending on the type of paper, whether it's hard tough paper that ink doesn't want to get in, illustrated paper, or normal paper... we always get problems with other pens. The ink slips through the other side, see this?""

He grabs another pen from his pocket, writes on his resume with it. Flips the page around... and yeah, we can see the ink on the other side. Does it again with his ""high-quality pen"", shows me the other side, you don't see the ink. Still not impressed. How often would I actually need that? At least he's confident. He's already better than 99% of the people I asked this question to.

""See, the clip on the pen, to put it on your shirt - it's a solid one. Usually they fall but this one is solid. If you put it on your shirt it will _not_ fall. All this is great, and personally that would be enough for me to buy the pen. Now look at the pen - this is _prestige._ This is _prestige in a pen._ You can see from the looks of it, how shiny and beautiful it is. It looks pricey.

That's not everything. Hold it in your hands""

He lands me the pen, I grab it... it is heavy. It does feel prestigious. I still wouldn't buy it, I don't really need the pen.

""Now try writing with it""

I listen to him and start writing with it.... this is actually quite smooth. The ink doesn't slip, so easily readable. Writing with it _just feels good._ I'm not gonna let him know that. Let's see what else he comes up with. Or maybe I would buy it. He didn't ask me if I would buy it yet.

""If I told you it cost $15 would you buy it right now?"" He said

""No, but it is an interesting pen. Tell me more about it"" I'm curious what else he will come up with.

""Do you explain to a group of people during meetings, sir?""

Only sometimes, I told him

""Do you have a cat, sir?""

I told him that yes, I do have a cat.

""Cats love chasing things like lights, correct?""

I said yes... but aren't you supposed to sell me this pen?

""Sir, this pen is so amazing. Not only do _you_ love the pen, your _cat will love it too.""

He flips the pen around, presses something on the side and a red dot of light shows up right where he's pointing at. That pen got a laser in it.

""Imagine playing with your cat with this. The pen is at $15 like I said, but it's actually worth $30. It's the prestigious pen that even cats will fall in love with. Sir, I'm not here to sell you one pen. I'd like to sell you 5000. $2 per pen, you can resell them for $15 to $30 dollars each. I have the statistics that prove people buy this pen and the profits you can make from it. I love this pen. Everybody loves this pen, you love this pen and even your cat would love this pen.""

He showed me the statistics, people do buy this pen. Other re-sellers made a lot of profits from it. I did it, I bought 5000 pens... and I also got one for me.",TheProgrammer163

Talk not that lingo to me. Dost see that leg? - I'll take that leg away from thy stern, if ever thou talkest of the merchant service to me again. Merchant service indeed! What good thine merchant service to me - what wouldst thou do with it, sell me a pen?”

I saw that Peleg had certain prejudicial presumptions, to pooh-pooh the merchant service so. Whenever I meet a man so piously predisposed, whose personal assumptions thunder forth with the force of an angry Jehovah; who, in the course of an interview, implies iniquitous insults, so do I adopt a similar amount of piety, and, as Yeshua, turn the other cheek. For, what of it - if an uneducated position does serve to preposit a man against me; does it render me a pauper for him to think me so? - nay, rather, the parsimony is his, for in judging me impoverished, in whatsoever manner, he has guttered and deprived himself of my delightful person, and shunted and shunned and shuttered me, and so will never know me as a treasure. 

Which is not to say that I am more desirable a friend than any other fellow, but neither am I less distinguished; therefore, friendship being a rare commodity, that must be wandering fished from a wide and wondrous sea - of equal men - it is always better to have a larger catch to sort; it follows that one should adopt a welcoming net that holds multitudes, rather than one that can but handle meager schools. How much happier is the debutante who can choose from a wealth of suitors, than her poor, less desirable cousin, who must accept her sole proposer?

Now, considering the appropriate way in which to prostrate myself before him - I saw that the correct course would be, indeed, to sell him a pen. I produced one from my pocket, for I never go anywhere without a couple or a dozen. 

“Yes, thou needst a pen.” How mighty, this Peleg Quaker, who had quaked thees and thous into my speech! It is a terrible thing to be in debt - previously, I mentioned my aversion to payments, and my corresponding rag of a purse. More compounded terror, still, to accrue interest on your owings. I swore to make a reciprocal impression, and so clear the ledger. 

“What!” 

“Dost thou seest this pen? Think you it but a simple pen? Look you here. Perceive it. I say, how joyful was the man who slipped the chains of Plato’s cave?

"[WP]. You die on the most peaceful day you've ever experienced. You discover the gates of heaven are real. Suddenly when checking in, 3 billion people show up behind you.",sir_lerm,"I left quietly, once I learned not to struggle.

The day was clear and warm, straight out of an ad for the retirement home. Sunlight streamed in through the windows, warming the beds of my ward with golden fire. It was a good enough day as any to die, I thought to myself, and not a moment too soon. The children had stopped visiting last year, but it didn't bother me like it had a week ago. I understood now. Since I had started to forget things, the man they once knew had eroded into a single windswept crag, holding on against the storm.

But I realized that there was no point anymore, and quickly the storm became a calm, warm pool that my mind slowly sank into. As I lay there on that warm spring day, May 26th 2017, the last of me leisurely drifted beneath the surface. I sighed, laid back and fell into the deepest sleep of all...

When I awoke, I was blind.

No, not blind, though I may as well have been. It was pitch black, save for a pair of twinkling green lights far in the distance. I tried reaching for them, but my hands bumped against something. Strange. Something felt *changed* in my body - I was full of energy, powerful and young... Trying to sit up, my head thunked against a hidden roof. It was then I realized that I was submerged in some kind of strange liquid - however, I was still able to breathe.

How long I waited in that darkness, I do not know. In all reality, it may have been anything between a few seconds to more than a month, but in the end something hissed and a circle of light appeared at my feet. The circle expanded, blooming into a world of light that my eyes strained and watered at. My small prison extended out as the top whirred open on hidden hinges. It suddenly hit me that this was it - I had passed through death and emerged out the other side with everything intact. 

Hungrily, I sat up, eager to see what awaited me in the afterlife. The sight that greeted me as my head left some kind of viscous gloop was not one I was expecting. Instead of heavenly choirs and clouds, banks of pods embedded in a great wall stretched above, below, and to my sides seemingly to infinity. Each pod was separated by a latticework of deep grooves in the metal wall, and mine was the only one extended that I could see in all directions. This was like in *The Matrix*, and with that recollection I realized that I remembered everything. My whole life was laid out before me, pristine and patiently awaiting my perusal. 

Any reminiscing was rudely interrupted by the arrival of a platform which glided between pods, doubtless using those grooves in the wall. On it stood a young man, clothed in a strange mechanical exoskeleton and no older than I was - with that came the realization that I had my 25-year-old body back - and a rack of equipment. He swung open a section of the railing that surrounded his platform, more with the air of a parking attendant than a reverential angel, and climbed down onto the side of my pod.

Offering me a hand, he intoned ""Congratulations. You have completed your Citizen Assessment, and are cleared for citizenship in the city of Heaven.""

""What are you talking about?"" I responded, bewildered. Taking his hand, I found that despite seeming young again, I was so weak that I could barely stand. This was a different kind of weakness, though; not the deep tiredness I had so recently left behind.

""This may all seem very confusing, sir,"" he sighed, ""but allow me to restore your memory...""

With this, he unhooked a strange, sleek syringe from his belt. I offered a pale forearm, but he laughed and pushed it away.

""No, this one goes in your spinal cord. Turn around, please.""

Warily, I shuffled about and offered him my neck. There was no pain, only a hiss, and a tingling right down my back and up into my head. Then everything came rushing back.

Of course. The year was not 2017, it was 2130. I had been a resident of the mega-city Heaven until I turned 21 and entered the simulation to prove my worth as an ethical, hardworking member of society. What had felt like 80 years in the sim was only four years in the real world. I was 25. Of course. Gripping the rail, I hauled myself up onto the service platform. The tech grinned and slapped me on the shoulder. 

""Well done. And thank Earth the serum took, I've had two failures this week already.""

I happily chatted with him, asking about developments in the settlement of Pluto, what celebrities had died, everything that I had missed in those four years of maturing. It felt an age since I had been here, and I knew what it meant to undergo an Assessment now. I was truly an adult, wise beyond my years. I let out a sigh of satisfaction as I unplugged the interface cord from my head and slotted in my familiar implant, and settled down for the long ride up past seven billion souls to the Moon's surface. I was lucky that Heaven was only a few minutes by maglev from the Assessment Centre - Neptunians faced a month-long spaceflight before they could return home. Racing up through the rows of neatly stacked capsules my implant fed me information on what I had missed, news, family developments, statistics from my simulated life to laugh at later, and updates from my own home. My wife! She had been out for a month already - no doubt waiting for me every one of those 30 days. I flicked her a joyous PM, we'd have so much to talk about, so many stories to share. 

I was still reeling in my euphoric reverie when the service platform juddered to a halt, and warning lights blinked on all around me on the capsules we were passing through. The onboard comms of our platform exploded with chatter. The tech set it to speaker and tried to make sense of the chaos.

""They're in the network!... Firewall down, must be an inside... Damn terroris-Wait, I want quiet!"" The other voices fell silent. ""They're accessing the pods in section C!""

""What part?"" A voice queried in the background.

""All of them! Holy Terra, they're opening them... That's 3 billion premature ejections! Do we have anyone in the area? Any personnel at all?""

My tech keyed the mic hesitantly. ""Yes sir, level 3 tech George Michaels reporting. I've got a service cart and someone who's just finished his term.""

""Alright Michaels, do what you can, we'll have as many personnel as we can down there in a few minutes. Just hold the fort!"" As the director signed out, I heard the control room descend into chaos once again behind him.

All around me, there was a hissing louder than anything I'd ever heard, a sound that transcended mere volume and battered at my ears from all around us. Three billion pods slowly emerged from their stations, making the wall seem like it was moving up to swallow our tiny platform. My implant exploded with notifications from various newsfeeds, ironically informing me of the disaster that I was right in the middle of. The low-level tech, no doubt fairly new at his job and expecting nothing more than a few failed extractions to trouble him, was clearly kilometers out of his depth. Wide-eyed, he turned to me, desperately searching for any reassurance.

""What the fuck are we going to do?"" he screamed out at three billion souls emerging from their world into the polished metal of the real one.",ecoltheelf

Suddenly when checking in, 3 billion people show up behind you.",sir_lerm,"It'd been 6 long days since they made the announcement. 6 dark, crime-riddled, terrifying days, culminating tonight.

The people that could afford it naturally fled the city first, taking only what they could carry. I guess the logic is get on the other side and hope for the best? As for the rest of us, we did what we could to ease our transition. At first there wasn't many looters. Now it seems constant.

I decided that before midnight, I should try and do one last nice thing, maybe try and get in good with the upstairs. After this week, tonight I'll definitely need it. 

Where can you find flowers during the end of the world? I drove my city for hours looking, and finally happened to find a nice island covered in flowers. ""Wait in the car, and don't peek out, keep your head down!"" I ducked and ran across the abandoned road, dodging the cars strewn about. I wasn't worried about hiding, the cars provided plenty of cover. The sign stuck in the dirt of the island said ""maintained by Lahey Landscaping"". ""Sorry guys, but you can fix it tomorrow"" I chuckled, as I started grabbing flowers and ripping them up. 

Then I heard her scream, and looked over my shoulder and saw him. Did he follow us again? 50 feet away, stomping towards her, with that same awful grin as before. Something was different about his eyes this time though. Finally I noticed the gun in his hands.

I turned in place and started sprinting. 40 feet out. He hasn't noticed me yet. 20 feet now, almost there. He turns and looks at me. I take two more strides then dive, he raises the gun and shoots twice. I land on top of him and we start to wrestle for the gun. My sense of sound, and touch, seem to have gone numb from adrenaline. I'm grabbing at the gun, and I can see that I'm touching it, but I can't hear or feel it. The scuffling stops, I blink, and suddenly all my senses come crashing back. Why am I so warm? It feels as if all the blood is rushing back into my body. 

I look down and notice the 3 holes in my shirt. ""This was her favorite shirt, she's going to kill me"" I thought. Everything's starting to go gray now, as my body slumps to the floor. As I lay there, one eye open, i see him across from me, body white as paper, still smiling. He's finally gone. She will have some peace before tonight. I hear her yell my name. ""Alb- !""

Now I'm standing in a white hallway that seems to go on for miles behind me. I look down, my shirt is fixed. ""Thank God"" I mutter. A man sitting behind the desk, in front of me, peeks up from over his news paper. ""You're early."" He barks. I blink, confused. Then it hit me. The meteor. I must have taken forever to find flowers. ""How lon-"" I start to ask. I'm interrupted by a loud fluttering followed a lot of screaming. I look behind me, suddenly, the hallway is full. 

""-bert!!"" I would recognize that voice anywhere. I turned around and started looking. When you've seen eyes like hers, you know how easy it is to pick them from a crowd, within seconds we've locked eyes. 

I smile. She raises an eyebrow, as if to say ""I hope you're ready"" I nodded, half to her, half to myself, turned around and took a number for paradise.",25BicsOnMyBureau

"[WP]. You die on the most peaceful day you've ever experienced. You discover the gates of heaven are real. Suddenly when checking in, 3 billion people show up behind you.",sir_lerm,"You had lived to see the end of siege, the ceasefires, the civilians being evacuated hollow-eyed from the rubble. You had lived to see the politicians congratulating  themselves, pens working busily at treaties and accords as they shook hands and clapped each other on the back and beamed at the cameras. You had lived to see the promised fruition of the War to End All Wars, the wish of every beauty pageant winner fulfilled, the end goal of modernity's ceaseless crawl. You had lived to see the parades and the protests, the doves being released in white flurries into the sky. You had lived, hollowed out, the shrapnel in your spine inuring you to all further pain, drifting on the hallowed currents of morphine. They had been beautiful, the countless inhabitants of the globe, even the politicians, every last rat-bastard one of them. You had lived to see World Peace. 

And then you had died. 

The dying was the painless part. You laid back and floated up the stream. Your body, heavy and thick with sludge, was filtered away gradually and only your spirit remained. You flowed through the roots of the world, and were drank in and purified. And then your head hit the bank and you floundered and your feet found purchase, and you waded up the shore towards Heaven. The gates were gold and open for you, and you were taking your first steps towards them, when some traitorous thought in your head told you to look backwards. And you looked, and behind you you saw the deluge. 

They came in billions, emerging baptized and still dripping, the river overflowing its banks. They came from every country, every continent, every walk and way of life. You had floated here on a river and now you were staring at an ocean, at a vast and endless sea, and it was drowning in human beings. The oceans receded before them and their heads emerged like an endless field of stones, their arms reaching out like a continent of grass. You stumbled backwards, not yet abandoned by the baser instincts of fear, and you walked into Heaven ass-first. 

The grass was green and the air was sweet and the clouds were crystal-white and you looked around desperately for anyone to explain to you what the hell was going on. An angel smiled down upon you, a thing of shining light. ""But how?"" you gasped, and pointed out the gates to the ceaseless flood of people. ""They were at peace when I died! It cannot have ended so quickly!"" 

""There is nothing to fear,"" the angel said, and lifted you lightly to your feet. Heaven's gates were open wide, and there were more and more and more. ""Are you not happy to see them? Will you not welcome them to their reward?"" 

And in your head the unworthy thought was running: *Don't let them in. They'll ruin it. Just like they ruined everything else.*

""Ah,"" said the angel, and you were swept away in the tide. There were strangers. There were family. There were people you had loathed while still alive. There were people who had died and who had yet to die. ""You are still acclimated to the parameters of the world below,"" the angel said, it's voice singing effortlessly above the crowd. Your feet were moving in a stampede. You were holding someone's hand. ""All divisions are illusory. All borders and nationalities and sects are illusory. Even your life on Earth, the years and millennia of suffering and war - a hundred years are as an eyeblink in Heaven. The impassable barriers of borders and oceans and eras fall aside in the face of eternity.""

It laughed gently. There was nothing but human flesh around you, pink and umber and deeper brown and pale with the veins showing through and all the various shades of skin. You could hear voices in a hundred different languages and dialects, rushing together into song. There were hands on you, freckled, gnarled, nails tinted pink. You were looking into a dozen sets of eyes. You tried, briefly, to hold on to yourself, to elbow out a small portion of room. And then the dam broke, and it was as if you were dying again, floating gently upstream.

""You have seen the end of war,"" said the angel. ""You have seen the end of conflict."" You looked up at your hands, and were no longer sure that they were yours. ""Welcome to the Kingdom of Heaven."" ",sadoeuphemist

""I get asked that question many times, young one. No, these devils are the spirits in charge of sorting souls to the appropriate afterlife, those who have not dedicated their soul to a god in their waking life. It's a big bureaucracy, you see.""

Now, you best get moving before I have the devils send you to Ogheamna's land of knowledge rather than the beloved fluffy-cloud heaven of your faith."" *He spoke with an irritated but still kindly look, clearly shooing me through the gates. As I stepped through, there was nothing. Not emptiness, just a formless void. I sat down on the formless void with certainly infinite new arrivals, including a horrendous creature similar to a mushroom, an Elf of the Linerim race, and, of course, a catgirl. I was about to strike up a conversation with one of them, before suddenly I vanished....*

*.... and was met with a hall of metaphysical knowledge, the Library of Askelior and palace of Ogheamna, the god of wisdom, knowledge, and magic. It seems that unconscious wish of mine came true.*

[WP] An old group of superheroes struggling with dementia,stereo16,"The old man pulls out the orange plastic chair and sits in front of me. He gives the nurse who escorted him here a suspicious frown. 

She smiles back at him. It's a patient, patronizing smile. ""Here's your visitor, Allen. Just like I promised he'd be. Didn't you believe me?""

""Not really,"" the old man mutters. I stare at him. Allen Scriff. Otherwise known as the Scrivener. Once, everybody knew that name. Now nobody does. 

His face is the same, but different, too. There are wrinkles folding the corners of his pale blue eyes, which stare at me without recognition. He looks so small. His shoulders hunch, and there's a bulge on his stomach--a beer belly that would have strained the gold spandex he used to wear so proudly. 

He doesn't look at me. Instead, he glances at the nurse, then bolts for the door. 

It's a perfunctory attempt. There must be a part of even his fractured mind that can understand he's never getting out of here. The nurse catches him instantly, gently pushing him back into the chair. 

He's surprised at her strength, which is so much greater than his. You need a special kind of medical personnel to look after a man like the Scrivener after he's lost his mind, but the Sunnyskies facilities have a very broad hiring pool. The nearly unlimited government budget helps, of course. The Department of Unusuals takes care of its heroes, even if the heroes themselves can't remember that they're heroes anymore. At least, the Department used to.

The nurse handcuffs Allen to the backbar of cheap, orange plastic chair. The handcuffs are made of duralamin, the alien metal which is the only thing that can dent the Scrivener's strength. He winces at the touch of the metal around his wrist, but says nothing. 

The nurse gives him a cheery wave. ""Enjoy your visit, Allen,"" she says. Then she walks out. Leaving us alone. 

At last he says, ""They told me you're Angie's son. My nephew.""

""You don't remember?"" I ask.

He squints at me. I see the temptation to lie skittering over his face. But at last he admits, ""I don't know. Maybe. They give me pills. Sometimes, I feel like I'm reaching for something and I almost have it and--"" He shakes his head.

""Are they treating you well?"" I ask.

""Yes,"" he says. Then he frowns. ""I mean, no. I don't--""

""You don't know?""

I can see the fumbling in his face. ""They give me pills,"" he repeats. His pale eyes flicker away from mine, but not before I see he tears he's trying to hold back. ""They...the nurses. They hurt me sometimes. I know it's for my own good, but...the one who brought me here. She's the worst. She smiles at me, but there's a look in her eyes."" He shivers. ""She hoisted me up into my bath one day, and left me there for hours. The water was so cold. She's the one with the pills. They taste bad. Make my throat hurt.""

I nod sympathetically. He meets my eyes and says. ""It's so good to see you. So good to see a friendly face. I've been so lonely.""

I fold my hands on the table between us. ""They haven't given you the pills for a few days, have they?""
 
""I don't--"" He closes his eyes. ""Nobody comes to visit me. I wasn't...I'm not supposed to be so alone. I remember, there was this kid. An orphan. Like me. Reminded me of myself. I took him in. My sister Angie said I was crazy, taking a young kid like that for a sidekick, but--""

I didn't come here to listen to the old man's rambling. ""Yes, I know,"" I say. ""His name was Brendan. Brendan Bluebird.""

Allen starts. ""You're supposed to know that. It's top secret.""

I shrug. ""The government declassified those files long ago. Besides, I knew him personally.""

""You did?"" he asks.

I smile. ""Yes. I was the one who killed him.""

Allen's body jerks. He looks at me. Fear tightens the wrinkled ballsack of his face. ""You're not my nephew.""

""No,"" I say. I lean forward. ""I used to have a name. People used to be afraid of me. But you changed all that. You put me in prison.""

""The Eliminator,"" he whispers.

I nod. Back in the old days, the Scrivener had been a hero, and I...I had been his villain. So many plans, foiled by this doddering piss stain of a man. He'd wrecked my life almost affectionately, treating me like some kind of pet. His villain. His rival. His toy.

He wasn't smiling now. And he didn't frighten me anymore, either. He was nothing. A shrunken husk wrapped in a cheap bathrobe that smells like urine.

""You should have killed me,"" I tell him. ""But you had to do your goody-goody posturing. While you were accepting accolades, I was growing my empire behind bars. I knew I'd get my revenge on you someday. And now here we are.""

""I don't understand,"" he says.

""You will,"" I say. I push my chair back as I stand up. ""For now, all you need to know is that when the government contract for running this facility came up, me and the group of other backers--more of your old acquaintances--had some real motivation to be lowest bidder. We took a bit of a loss, but it was worth it.""

He wants to hit me, I can tell. But he can't because of his cuffs. 

I lean forward. It means smelling the stench of his old person breath, but I want to be close for this. ""I win, Allen,"" I say. ""Even if it took me half a century. I win.""

Allen gapes at me as I leave the room. 

Outside, the nurse smiles at me, leaning one round hip against her desk. ""Anything else, boss?"" she asks. 

I shake my head. Even though all the doors to the patients' rooms are closed, I can occasionally hear a scream. Like pleasant background noise. Definitely better than the soothing elevator music that used to fill this place before.

""No,"" I say. ""Keep up the good work."" My fingers brush her cheek. I'm not as young as I used to be, but I still have a way with a certain type of woman. She shivers at my touch.

""Yes, sir,"" she says.

I grab my coat. ""One more thing: I want you to lower the dosage a little. Let him remember more of what he was. That way, he can appreciate exactly what he's lost.""

She gives me a mocking salute as I walk out into the sunlight that the Scrivener will never see again.",unrepentantescapist

Coupled with the fact that this guy has a 97% chance of catching his mark may make you think that I'm a lunatic. Well, I'm not, and all I wish is to be able to live through this. I'm running from the attic of my house down to the first floor. From there, I'll grab the handgun I have there and shoot this guy down. It's a shame that I leave my one self-defense weapon three floors below me. I'm there sprinting down the stairs in a zig-zag motion so that he won't be able to shoot me easily. I see he's resorted to throwing knives once a knife grazes the side of my neck. I wince, slow down and get a knife thrown in my shoulder blade. Before I could react, there's one more lodged in my butt. Last one finds a new home in the back of my right thigh. I now know that there's no way I could successfully run from this guy with the knives in me. So, I crawl to the railing and throw my body over the railing... two floors down on the hard, cold wooden floor. Saying the drop was painful is an understatement. I landed on my side, my left arm is in unbearable pain... probably broke it. The handgun is just in that drawer... a few feet away... The cocking of a gun makes me freeze. The hitman mumbles that I'm an idiot before he pulls the trigger. Two shots in my chest, one in my head, and he slits my throat with a knife for good measure.

"[TT]In order to get people to actually do something, God decides to make everyone's New Year's Resolutions appear over their heads.",Crosshack,"""D--don't look at it,"" I said to her, shivering on her doorstep - either from the cold or the nerves. It was our first night out, and really, I was just surprised she didn't turn around and walk away like all the others have this year. Hell, I probably wouldn't have even gotten this far if it weren't for online dating.

""Uh... I..."" she stuttered, trying to find the words, her eyes fixed on the big red letters hovering over my head. ""How am I supposed to take that?""

""Just focus on me, please,"" I begged, struggling to hold on to my last shred of dignity. ""That's what I'm doing for you, so please do that for me."" Her eyes lowered to mine, and she gave me a look of skepticism and a slight nod. ""Real funny, big guy,"" I thought to myself.

So everyone's theory is that eleven months ago, the man upstairs thought maybe we'd get more done if our New Years' resolutions were on-display above our heads, for the whole damn world to see. And to add insult to injury, they came with colour-coded progress, from red to green, so everyone can know how much of a failure you are. I refused to glance at my date's words, or anyone's for that matter. To me, it was a matter of personal privacy - privacy which had been violated. And while I avoided reading her resolution, I could still see that it was a rich green. Mine, however, was still red as a street light, visible in every reflection I saw of myself. The unfortunate truth of me, a problem that plagued me my whole life, and the year I decide to confront it, this shit happens. Just super.

""Look, I'm a nice guy, really!"" I began to ramble, ""work's been tough this year, but I haven't let people's jokes affect the quality of what I do. I'm trying to change; I just need someone to give me a chance. Hell, my friends won't even hang out with me anymore."" Begging for respect is what it had come to. I would say this was my lowest, but in reality, it was probably the best the year had gotten.

""Did you... ask me out because..."" I already knew where she was going with this, as I had been struggling to maintain eye contact for the past minute or so.

""No, no!"" I responded. ""No, I read through your interests, thought we'd be a good match.""

""I'm really sorry, this is too weird for me. Just give me a few days, maybe I'll send you another e-mail."" This was it, it was over. She stepped back into her home and shut the door. The click of the lock told me I'd probably never see her again. Oh well.

I hung my head low and returned to my car. As I put the keys in the door, I froze at the sight of a green reflection and smile crept its way across my face. There, in my car window, in *glorious, green letters* was, ""ʜɔum oƨ ƨdood ƚɒ ǫniɿɒƚƨ qoƚƨ"".

[IP] Changing of Seasons,JJSigmund,"Spring. Spring was idyllic, flowers blooming everywhere, the flora and fauna filled with an infectious energy. People couldn't help but be dragged along in nature's excitement. It was chasing each other around a meadow because there was little else to do. Watching the grass sway in the wind, a hand around your shoulder. Satoma proposed to her, and they moved into their own house. A sanctuary, just for them, cloistered away from the rest of the world.

Summer, then, was about contrast. Heat and rain in equal measure. A haze of days that went by too quickly to grasp. Events that melded together and passed through your fingers. Swimming in a lake and coming away with mosquito bites over your entire body. There was a leak in the house, but nothing they couldn't fix. Satoma spent a couple of days with a ladder and a hammer.

Fall. The leaves fell from the trees, the world withdrew into itself. Everything went into hiding, but not the good kind. As if preparing for something, some catastrophe to happen, nature forwent its grandeur for hardiness. Satoma went off to the war.

Winter. Harsh. Bitterly cold. Everything caked in a layer of snow. If the chill didn't keep you indoors, the drift would. It arrested everything. All movement, all emotion. Satoma had promised he would return. Sakura had to worry, ponder, think. Not much else to do. Nature always went through its cycles, didn't it? Spring would come again.

[IP] Last Resort,JJSigmund,"I think it's important to understand that I didn't really have a plan.  I think it makes things better, somehow.  To be fair, I rarely have a plan when Morson comes calling about a new job.  Indeed planning is precisely Morson's purpose in the organization.  Mine is far simpler, and involves guns, loud voices, and lots of running.

I always read them over of course, a bit of professional courtesy. I clearly remember reading step 32, in which I shoot out the window of the skyscraper and jump through. Morson was quite pleased with himself on that one, very pleased. He told me it would be an excellent way to throw off pursuers, as none of them would be crazy enough to jump out after me.  This sounded better in my apartment, before I was carrying a data stick loaded with TriTech's greatest secrets and running low on spare clips.  Something about the quiet tinkle of glass and the wind whipping against a person can really bring out a certain retrospective view of events.

The plan, careful and meticulous as it was, knew that I would be facing police interceptors during my descent.  It called for me to use my handguns, specially built miniature rail guns designed to punch through the vehicle's armor, to take my pursuers out of the sky.  Morson's plan did not factor in how the wind might affect my aim, or how the building's security would begin taking potshots from the shattered window.  It also failed to mention how the recoil from my own guns would send me spinning through the air.

The plan did, however, mention that my getaway vehicle would pick me up once I fell thirty stories.  As I slammed into the seat beside Caleb, carefully descending in the Mark 2 to match my speed, one of my shots finally caught the police interceptor.  One of its stabilizers blew off, and the pilot pulled away rapidly to attempt an emergency landing.  Caleb grinned in his customary manner, rocketing away as the Mark 2's hatch began to close above us.

""So you got the data then?"" He said, idly guiding the vehicle through twists and turns meant to confuse surveillance drones.  ""I've heard it's worth a fortune this time.""

I patted my pocket, shut my eyes and leaned back into the seat.  ""The data stick, two near-empty guns and a couple years off my life.  No more skydiving Caleb, make sure to tell Morson that.""",Goshinoh

That'll teach me to hit Shuffle again. I struggle to remember why I even have it on here as my bullets bounce and ricochet off of the police cruiser, which dives to meet me. The fantastically cold air races past me before I hit my momentum arrestor, and not a moment too soon. There's barely enough time to register that I'm inches away from the asphalt as I hit my circular, very illegal device again, drop to the ground and scramble for the nearest building as crackling stun darts whiz past my ears. Barely audible past the sirens that pursue me and Papa Roach are yet more sirens further ahead. This won't be the closest getaway ever, but it sure as hell isn't going to be easy. My legs and lungs are burning, the small of my back stings like hell from where a stun dart hit my kevlar, and sweat has nearly frozen on me as I burst into the foyer of some lawyer. 

The clerk's face is goddamn priceless. Gotta keep moving, gotta keep going. It takes me a hot second to find the back door. I hit it with my favorite lockpick, my Glock, kick the door into an alleyway, and sprint off again. Snow drifts contrast the random litter, garbage bags, cigarette butts, and the poor shmucks in cardboard boxes who created the majority of the mess. Said snow also makes finding a manhole cover a royal pain in the ass. Where is it, where is it? I know I have at least a couple minutes before they figure out which way I went through the hotel, but then it's just a matter of following my tracks. I tell myself that I can't afford to slow down, but my legs disagree. This looks like one...and it's a trash can lid. Ahhhh...shit. Come on. Is this...no it's not. I'm starting to get nervous now, and the sirens in the distance aren't helping. Left, straight, right, straight, right... oh shit. I hear dogs. All I wanted for christmas was to get to the sewers, cover myself in piss water to short any trackers I may have on me, and be on my merry way. That's all I fuckin' wanted, and- FINALLY! A ladder at the end of the alley! My legs take serious issue with being told to move so fast again without their union-mandated 10 minute break, but I'm working overtime here, so they damn well can too. Both of my baby lead spitters find their holsters, I grab the icy sides of the ladder and slide down...and down...and down...

This is further than I was expecting...

Uh...

This may have been a bad idea. 

Any day now...

My legs decide to call it quits early and collapse as I hit the bottom some 200 feet down. Now my ass is filing complaints too. And as much as I would just love to stay down here in this frozen over hell listening to some Japanese crap Martha put on my vintage iPod to fuck with me, I can't rest easy just yet. I still have work to do, even though my job was done the second the cruiser and the majority of the city's police force started after me instead of the ""heavily damaged"" corvette I jumped from. I gotta long way to go still if I want to see that badass jump replayed on the news.",zipzip_the_penguin

"[WP] ""So, if you are too tired to speak, sit next to me because I, too, am fluent in silence.""",KCcracker,"Aldwin let out a sigh. His leg hurt, and there was a pounding in his head. Up above his head, the darkened sky filled with clouds and despair. Bright flashes of light, explosions and tracer rounds, filled the air. Aldwin, adorned in his worn and torn military fatigues, laid down on the dirt; his back leaning against the wall of the trench which encased him.

Around Aldwin, chaos raged. Men, young boys, lost sons, roared with anger. They fired over the trenches with their carbines, they charged the enemy lines with patriotic fervor; urged on by the feral rage of the amphetamines fed to them by their commanding officers. Aldwin let out a shudder.

A sharp pain caught Aldwin’s attention. He was so tired, his hands shook painfully. The lonely soldier looked down. A red stain covered his stomach. Something felt missing, a basic portion of of his being felt missing. It didn’t even hurt, but rather he felt hollow, empty. Aldwin’s hands shook as he searched his pockets.

Cigarettes, his hands searched softly for his last cigarette. A hand appeared in front of Aldwin’s vision. A cigarette was held delicately in the bone white hand. Aldwin looked over. A grim man sat next to Aldwin, his face covered by a black hood. Aldwin gave a small nod of thanks, and grabbed the cigarette. The hooded man lit the cigarette for Aldwin.

Aldwin took a deep drag from the cigarette, and let the smoke fill his lungs. He gave another appreciative nod to the hooded man; he was too weary to talk. The chaos around the two slowly subsided to a slow, soft background noise; a simple afterthought. Time slowed for Aldwin, and colors became oddly abstract to him.

The young soldier glanced over at this hooded companion again. The cigarette hung limp in his mouth; hanging off of the corner of his lips. The hooded figure gave the young soldier a soft smile as Aldwin’s eyes went pale. The two sat there for a merely a second, merely an eternity, before the hooded figure disappeared, leaving Aldwin’s body lying there in the trenches, another forgotten statistic ground up by the machinations of humanity.

"[WP] ""So, if you are too tired to speak, sit next to me because I, too, am fluent in silence.""",KCcracker,"You don't need dialogue to communicate emotions and motives between characters. The prompt seems to be hinting at a more serious, drab interaction between two people who are weary from life, and a story can definitely come out of that.

It could also turn comedic, as the two warm up to each other or as they watch something goofy around them and interact silently.

I think OP wanted to create a unique situation for a writer to make a creative story that didn't rely on the futility of dialogue. It's fine to think that it won't make a good story (I disagree with that sentiment, but life is all about conflict so that's a good thing), but I think it's a good writing prompt in the sense that it encourages a creative story.

"[WP] In a world where zombies are normal people, the ""Human"" virus is spreading...",KillerAc1,Bravo! Some human did read this:),KillerAc1
"[WP] In a world where zombies are normal people, the ""Human"" virus is spreading...",KillerAc1,"    I'm Zach, a human living in a world of zombies. When I was young, my parents told me of a ""virus"" turning people crazy. I never really listened until one day when I saw people in my small suburban town start becoming zombies. My parents and I escaped to the woods to hide in isolation from the virus.
    One day while gathering wood to cook our food, I heard a scream. My mom had tripped and fallen in the woods. I turned around and saw a zombie grab her foot and yank her into the forest. These were her last words:

    ""Zach! Go back and tell your dad to run! GET AWAY FROM THE FOREST!""

    I ran back to our camp and noticed my dad wasn't there. Having seen my mom get dragged off by a zombie, I was in panic when I saw that he was gone. I looked around and noticed a trail of blood. My stomach dropped. I ran.

5 YEARS LATER

    I'm living in a cave now. I'm 16 years old, so I can take care of myself. I expect that the zombies have taken over the world, but I think that I have discovered a way to save the world. I have created a cure for the virus. I tested it on a zombie out in the forest, and they became human. I invited the human to come back to the cave but they declined the offer and left. Weird. If only I could find a way to deliver the cure to everyone easily...
    
    I've solved the problem! I have created a nano virus with the cure inside! I will release the specimen in a few days and hope that the world becomes human again.

    I have discovered a small city nearby where I will release the sample. It took me years to collect enough materials to create this virus, so I hope it works.

    This is Zach reporting back. The virus was released, but I have some worries. I found the human I first tested the virus on in the forest, but the human was dead, without any evidence of a zombie attack. Another weird detail is that their eyes turned a bright red. I have a suspicion that the virus may turn zombies into humans, but also kill them afterwards. I hope I'm incorrect.

    My suspicions were true. The zombies in the city have transformed into humans, but their eyes are red. I have talked to some of them and they have given me some blankets to stay warm in my small cave. I hope they don't die.

    I hand barely hold back tears as I'm writing this. The people in the town are all dead. Even worse, some of them traveled to nearby towns. Hopefully not too many people became infected, but so far nothing has gone right for me.

   1 YEAR LATER
    
    This may be my last entry. I have removed the zombies from Earth, but I also nearly eradicated humanity. I have noticed my eyes have turned red. I think I have caught the nano virus too. When I die, hopefully some human is here to read this. Please, do not forget my story. I am debating I'm my mind if I should have killed everyone like I did or let everyone live as zombies. I have justified myself knowing that if I did not release the virus, other pure humans may have died. I am hoping that there are at least a few pure humans left over to resume where humanity left off. Goodbye.

"[WP] You have a godly parent, though you don't know it. You also happen to be an atheist. Your divine parent tries many things to get you to believe.",Laytheron,"I'm starting to think the word 'function' can fuck itself, but I'll try explain: 

&amp;nbsp;

In this context, a normal cell's function isn't ""form part of a human"". It's simply ""be a cell"". Its function has nothing to do with the human it inhabits - it has no loyalties to it - its loyalties lie with the physical laws that govern everything. This means that if a bit 'o cancer comes along, it's that cells job/function to become cancerous. Who makes the laws? Why does it have to do this? The universe makes the law. Not the human. So to say 'a cancer cell does it's job better' is to assign the cell's allegiance to the human, not to the universal laws that govern it. Therefore, within the context of these laws, both the cancerous cell and normal cell are perfectly obedient.

Both the cell and molecule change according to their environment - the reason being they're following the rules that keep the universe ticking. They can't break away from this. Looked at it that way - a cell is fulfilling its function by becoming cancerous.

[WP] You just finished your spacewalk and you're about to return back inside the space station. You ask your long time friend and colleague on board to open the hatch but instead he stares and you with an evil grin and releases the tether holding you onto the ship.,Melonazzz,"Endless black void, studded with infinitely compressed white dots of distant light. The shadow of a nebula shrouding part of the viewscape, any stars too far away or too dim to illuminate it. Against the dark, a small beacon, artificial edges startlingly out of place in this field. A smaller object trailed from it, an invisible fibre binding them together, a liferaft in amongst the turmoil.

""Phoenix, this is Adams,"" the suit declared, a brief flash of noise in the quiet, ""Operation complete, preparing to RTB.""

""Roger that,"" came the reply, ""Lights on, door unlocked. Make yourself at home.""

""Haven't brought a housewarming gift I'm afraid,"" Adams joked, smirking to himself.

""How rude of you. I'll see that you get no dessert tonight.""

""I shall miss my powdered sludge dearly,"" he answered, ""Adams out.""

The transmission shut out with a click, the faint hum of background static and interference being replaced with a muffled silence, wrapped around his head and pressing inwards. To some it was an unconformable sensation: an absence of familiarity. To Adams it was was somehow warming to him, alone in the universe, he could almost pretend that it was his creation and he was watching over it. 

Bringing his hand across his chest, he triggered the tether retraction which sent a vibration along the entire length of the cable and rattled through the outer casing of the suit. He could feel the tugging sensation around his waist as the space station drew closer, his home widening in his field of vision. As he drew close, he reached out to the handholds scattered around the station's frame and began to crawl towards the airlock.

The airlock remained sealed closed.

""Phoenix, this is Adams,"" he transmitted, ""Is this because of the whole gift thing?""

The radio hissed silently at him in reply. Irritably, sensing a joke, he resent his message.

""I can't let you in, mate,"" Ramirez tapped back.

""What? Why not?""

""I'm not sure I feel like it.""

""Come on man, let me in. It's cold out,"" he joked again, knowing full well his suit could last for another eight hours before the thermal systems began to shut down.

""You're unauthorised,"" Ramirez replied, no hint of joking in his voice anymore.

""Unauth- cut it out man,"" Adams demanded, no longer seeing the funny side, ""It's Adams. Let me in.""

""I don't know an Adams.""

""Yes you fucking do! Flight engineer Rufus Adams, Ident seven-four-zero. Open the airlock.""

A pregnant pause, the seconds drawing out into eons as the radio continued to snarl at him.

""No.""

A click, and Adam's tether released. The burst of pressurised air pushed him away, casting his body aside to dance in isolation in the void, spiralling head over heels unable to maintain control with nothing to push against. The darkness called to him as the station fell from his vision.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

""Adams!? Jesus christ! Adams?!"" the receiver screamed at him. It was only the movement of his organs inside him that told him he was still spinning. Apparently somebody else had come onto the line and was trying to speak to him.

""Ramirez?"" he groaned, beginning to feel nauseous.

""Adams, it's Holden!"" they shouted back. The medical officer. ""Hold on, we're coming for you! We only just caught Ramirez, I'm sorry.""

""What the fuck just happened?!""

""He vented you.""

""He didn't know who I was!""

""We've uh...found something. I knew he was ill. This is my fault.""

""Ill? What's wrong with him?""

""Just hold on tight, we're coming.""

""What's wrong with him?""

""Don't think about it, Adams.""

""What. Is. Wrong?"" Adams enunciated.

""For fuck's sake, he has a brain tumour.""

Adams stared into the endless void.

When you use their services, you realize something is wrong.",Mikerzoid,"They advertise it as a humbling experience. Look back on everything you’ve done in your life, determine if you may have any regrets or last wishes. Jesse said that it was life-changing. Abigail said that she improved her relationships with her husband, kids, and parents because afterwards. It’s become something of a status symbol to fork over nearly a year’s wages to almost die. In order to be anyone of importance you must have the enlightenment only gained by coming close to death. Everyone can tell you what they learned and how it has affected them since.

I arrived at the compound at eight this morning. After handing over thousands of dollars, signing a stack of waivers waiving my or my family’s right to sue should I be injured or die and sitting through a physical and medical history questionnaire the group of us with appointments for today are led into the briefing room.

There’s about fifteen of us. I think this is a larger than average group, considering the price I’m amazed at how many people have participated.

“Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. My name is Doris Williams. Thank you for arriving here so early this morning and for participating in our medical screening. Underneath your seats, you will find a copy of the papers you signed earlier.” I grabbed the packet from under my seat. It looked about the same as the one I had signed. Nearly as thick as a textbook. The redhead at the front of the room smiled as everyone grabbed their packets and continued on.

“Now, on page 58, you will find our social media clause. All of you are required to post favorably about your experience here. And you must post. Additionally, you are not allowed to actually repeat what exactly the process that you undergo here is.”

She smiled. Why did that smile worry me? “Thank you for visiting and we know that you will share your wonderful and enlightening experience.”

The man in front of me shot up, “wait, we paid money for a near death experience. A chance to see our lives flash before our eyes.”

“Well, sir. We advertise a humbling experience. Every one of you has paid good money to sit through a physical and sign some papers. If that is not humbling, I don’t know what is. And, unless you want to admit that you spent thousands on nothing, we trust that you will post some inspiring story about what you learned from this experience.”",AleksSawyer

""That wasn't too bad."" 

""I'll be right outside. Push the button on the left if you need to stop for any reason. Ready?""

""Ready."" The chamber door lowers over my head. I'm already feeling sick, but not from the injection. I rolled out of bed for my appointment this morning looking unrested and strung out from a killer hangover. I've been meaning to quit all year, but when I saw the commercial I knew it was time. People who have turned their lives around, regained their families. They told stories of seeing the tunnel of white light and a spirit guiding them through the universe. I've heard of similar effects from Ayahuasca to experience a mock death, spiritual awakening and treat addiction. But this, this is better. It's legal, easier to obtain, and stronger. Plus they guarantee you will see your life play out in front of you.

After what feels like ten minutes, I feel a little foggy but am not seeing any hallucinations or visions. My legs feel like they're falling asleep from the lack of movement. I feel uncomfortable until a wave of calm floods over me. My chest and face feel like they're being washed in a glowing warmth.

I'm startled awake. I must've nodded off, but it doesn't seem like much time has passed. I'm starting to think that I just got a good opiate drip and not much more is going to happen. I start grasping in the dark for the button, feeling along the edges when I start seeing a dim light flickering above me. It starts to grow. Gradually, the little fleck grows more until it's a white tunnel. It keeps growing until it's terrifyingly immense, like it will swallow me whole.

I found the button. My fingers are stroking it, telling myself that at any moment I can escape.

I see my 5th birthday party, the year my dad gave me a bike. I'm overwhelmed with joy, a simple excitement I haven't felt so purely since I was a child. I see myself in 7th grade, the first time I got drunk with my friends. I feel nostalgic but mournful for my loss of innocence. I see my husband and I's first date. I see my first arrest. Then cheating on my husband. My son being born.

My face is swollen and soaking with tears. I've never seen it from this perspective. We didn't decide to film it. Seeing Logan as a crying baby, so vulnerable and small reminds me I have to do everything I can to protect him. I hate myself for not being there for him lately. I'm trying to soak up this moment of everything it's got, to store in my memory and heart forever before it fades away. So that I never forget again. I'm scanning my husband and I's faces, the way Logan's little cries echo and sing. 

I'm distracted by something poking out of the corner. A red light in the hospital window. There's a figure holding a black box. 

Button. Button. Button Button Button.

The chamber door ascends. My legs still feel numb until Terry unhooks my IV. Once I can stand, I turn and tell him, ""I know you've been filming me. All of us. I'm not going to let you get away with it anymore"".

Terry smirks, ""But you wouldn't want everyone to know what we know, would you?""

Write from pet perspective.",Nazamroth,"It had returned. For the second time since the sun had set, Morty had laid his eyes upon the creature in the yard. When the shadows had started to cover the pool, and the mild summer breeze caused the leaves on the trees to dance, it was born into existence. At first, Morty thought there was something shiny in the water of the pool, but closer inspection revealed the gleaming red shards to be eyes. Eyes that peered around, as they drew in the shadows around them to take the shape of a six-legged monstrosity. It had not even noticed him that first time, but now it had set its gaze upon Morty.

Sitting in front of the sliding door, a large pane of glass between Morty and the...thing, he could not take his eyes off of it. Its long, dark appendages melted into the shadows, and where they fused with them, more red eyes appeared, shining with the same crimson light of their creator. Morty started to wag his tail, rising to all four paws from his seated position. It was no joyful wag, as he witnessed the creature and its minions move closer towards the door. One arm reached for the sliding door, and Morty did the only thing he was still able to do: bark. Bark as loud and fast as he could. 

“What is it, Mort?” A voice came from behind Morty. He turned around, still barking and wagging his stumpy tail. Morty’s master approached, as tall and great as ever. He looked down at his pet, stretching out his hand to scratch the faithful servant behind his ear. Morty loved to be scratched there. He stopped barking, and closed his eyes. Bliss filled his tiny body, as his master moved in his second hand to caress his belly. 
“Ah, you good boy” he heard the master say. Such bliss, such joy. 

Suddenly, Morty returned to his senses. The creature! He opened his eyes and looked through the glass sliding door again. In the darkness of the yard, no more crimson eyes could be seen, and no tendrils moved closer, threatening Morty and his master. Satisfied, the pet sighed, and darted off to his favorite place in the house: his pillow right next to the master’s seat. His master laughed, and Morty was happy he did his duty.

As he closed his eyes, enjoying the softness of his pillow, he knew it would not be the last time he would have to. The darkness was still out there, and it would try again. However, as long as Morty was there, his master would not need to know anything, nor fear anything. Morty was, after all, the one thing the darkness always feared: a truly good boy. ",TheChindividual

"[WP] When pets stare into an empty corner, or a shadowed nook for hours, they are terrified, and wonder why you do not see the monsters lurking. Write from pet perspective.",Nazamroth,"I felt it in my whiskers first, long after moonrise. A subtle tingle, a sort of fizzing against my fur. Like static from the bedroom floor against the owner's socks—well, she thinks she owns me. The tingle is stronger, and now my whiskers can feel the air moving aside as something *else* tries to break through. In the past I would wail for her to wake, but she cannot see them. Her eyes cannot acknowledge that which is unreal but exists all the same.

An oily slick, a thin film that separates me from the unreal passes across the room. I sit here, waiting, silent sentinel of Bastet. Since the time before stones were scratched, we have been secret protectors, hunters of things that would plague the humans and other creatures of this world. But unreality played a cruel joke upon us, and we can now never communicate with other species as we once did.

So we sit, waiting, for these terrors. The young may still wail and cry to alert their charges, but the veterans do not waste their energy. A tentacle pushes through the walls of reality, and from I scent the odour of chaos. Tonight the mountains have broken through. I lick my lips and slink along the floor, the tiles cold against the fur of my stomach. With my whiskers I can sense every twitch and turn that tentacle is about to make. Mere inches separate me from this thing, and still it is unaware of my presence.

That is the gift of Bastet, and why they cursed us. We are the *perfect* hunters. Humans know this much at least, but they cannot know what our prey truly is. My teeth sink into rich, dark flesh, the taste putrid, but the feeling so very satisfying. Oh yes, definitely one of *his* minions tonight. My claws dig in as the tentacle thrashes about, and I rip a great chunk of meat from that unreal thing.

Injuring it still is not my true goal tonight. Through that oily skein of unreality in the corner I can see eyes, and shifting shapes that no human could ever hope to comprehend. Kicking off from my claws, I race along the tentacle, screaming my battlecry, forcing the very fabric of reality apart as I leap through the rift.

An unreal world of shadows and monsters, where cause follows effect, and sometimes the two are completely unrelated. Here, in this place, my form is no longer merely felidae. Here, I am an avatar of Bastet herself. Here, my claws are sharp enough to tear the fabric of reality. Here, my warcry sends monsters running. Here, my life will end. But still, the battle must be fought.

I wake slowly, curled in the corner. I stretch, and lick invisible wounds. No human could die and return as I do most nights. No human could even see the unreal. I yawn, and let my charge rub behind my ears. She will find the vase later, and scold me. She will never know the untold horrors I have faced for her.

But at least I get a free meal every morning.",Ravager_Zero

Write from pet perspective.",Nazamroth,"Five clawed fingers protruded from the darkness, followed by a black face. Tendrils of smoke tugged at the corners of the face like strings of black venom as the figure tried to break away from the clump of darkness. I'd watched it do this for the last two hours and every time it surrendered to the light and recoiled into its empty corner. 

""Your dog has a thing for walls,"" John said. 

Marvin shrugged and went back to watching the movie. ""He's probably just bored.""

No, there's a black thing in the corner of your room that's trying to escape, I wanted to say. 

John glanced at the empty corner, but if he saw what I was looking at, he didn't show it. ""Dumb dog . . .""

""Can you put the light off?"" Marvin asked. 

I barked a strong 'No!'. But they didn't listen. John complied like an empty drone, shrouding the lounge in black. 

The shadow gave a loud cackle and spread its presence to the walls around us, across the floor, and in every corner of the room. It materialized human like but its features were dark sludge and pupils empty sockets. It crossed the breath of the room and stopped in front of John, watching his every move with an evil smirk. 

""I'm feeling tired . . ."" John said. 

I hopped up on the couch, lapping at his face, trying to keep him awake. That's what they want you to feel --drowsy. John patted me. ""Good boy, but back in your bed now."" He curled into a ball. 

I met the shadow stare for stare, it reached out a claw and placed it on John's head as he slept. Scratching John with my paws did nothing, neither did nudging him with a wet nose.  I'd tried to fight shadow's before, but they were impenetrable. And so I slumped down and watched. 

John's temple shifted like there was something moving under the skin. He shot awake, a line of sweat on his brow. ""Nightmare,"" he said, chest pulsing up and down, eyes darting around the room. The way he paused on the shadow for half a heartbeat made me think he saw it. Instead of reacting, he crumpled back into a ball and closed his eyes. 

The shadow licked whatever silver substance was on its claw and held a hand out, ready for more. John, none the wiser, started snoring. Unaware that there was an entity over him and something crawling under his skin.

Several times I attempted to get my family's attention to let them know of the danger. As always, they remain oblivious. I've seen the looks my family gives me as I watch these leaks. They think I'm mad. Perhaps it is better that they do not know.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;So I continue to watch. I can feel it in the leak, THEY know I'm watching. For some reason THEY fear me. THEY refuse to cross though while I am here. So I continue to watch. I am getting old now, these vigils take more of a toll on me than ever before. And I think THEY  know that. The time will come when I can no longer safeguard my family. I worry what might happen if no one can take my place.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;But I cannot change that right now. For the time being, I must protect. Whatever is beyond the leak grows restless. THEY always do that when my family approaches, so it came as no surprise when I heard the footsteps.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“There you are, kitty.” It was Annabeth. I twitched my tail to let her know I heard, but am busy. She did not take the hint.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I do, but now is not the time. I had to break free. All the while my eyes never left the leak. Then I saw it.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“Let's go watch something.” She said as she took me away. I had failed. Something had slipped through.

And he’ll sit and pet me for hours, scratch my head. Oh! And he smells so great, like steak and sausage. Lucy tells me he’s a “butcher” but I don’t know what that means. I don’t care though, he smells so great… 


&amp;nbsp;


Oh. The man is moving towards me now. Except, I don’t think he’s a man. He’s dark, and has a weird face. He’s smiling like Lucy does when I do a trick or when Ben comes over, but its’ all wrong. It’s stretched and thin. And he doesn’t have any eyes.   


I don’t like this man. I wish Lucy would make him go away.  


He’s coming towards me again. I can feel my tail unconsciously tucking between my legs and I’m shaking. Lucy, oh Lucy why won’t you look at him!


&amp;nbsp;

He’s only inches away from me now. His face looks so wrong and he smells stronger now, but now he smells like the bird and like our old house that night Lucy forgot to blow out the candle. That smell made me hurt and made it hard to breathe, but we were both OK.   


He’s just looking at me now. Or, I think he is. He still doesn’t have eyes. Just a blackish man-shaped thing with that same thin, stretched smile. Like the way Lucy’s socks look when I play tug of war with them. She gets so mad when I do that, but it’s fun! Besides, I hate when she puts on socks; that means she’s going to leave me. But she always comes back before…


&amp;nbsp;


**AHHCK!** He touched my head. He reached out his weird dark arm and patted my head and I couldn’t help myself… I peed all over Lucy’s nice bedspread and she heard it. She’s yelling and scolding now, and I can’t see where the weird man went.  


&amp;nbsp;


“Fargo, what the hell?! I just washed this and you *know better!* Ugh, you stupid dog! I have a paper I need to…” I saw the man appear behind Lucy so I started barking. She just swore at me. *But Lucy he’s right behind you! He’s reaching for you!* “I swear, you are the most obnoxious dog. BAD DO… AHHHKKK!!”

*The body of Lucy Green was found at her home on [redacted] street. A small terrier was found in the corner of the room, staring at an unlit corner of the bedroom. The first officer on the scene was a rookie, called in to do a wellness check. He apparently suffered the same fate as Lucy. Both were found with no apparent trauma and no clear cause of death. However, both had abnormally long, thin smiles that stretched from ear to ear. It was determined that these were not cut in or caused by any force or trauma. As of now it is unknown who the suspect is or how he killed these. The police force of [redacted] County advises all residents to be alert and aware, and call them with any information.

"[WP] When pets stare into an empty corner, or a shadowed nook for hours, they are terrified, and wonder why you do not see the monsters lurking. Write from pet perspective.",Nazamroth,"I sit on the floor, wag my tail, and try to pretend I’m not staring into the corner.

The boy has friends over. They’re crowded around table, playing game, eating food that smells oh so good and makes me hungry. But I can’t eat. I must stay focused and protect the boy and his friends.

The shadow sitting in the corner is new, second one this week. It’s smirking at me because it thinks I won’t move. But I’m big, and strong. Will protect boy and friends and parents. Will protect house because my house too.

I bare my teeth and try not to growl as it moves forward. But I do, and the boy pats my head and smiles at me. Him smiling makes me happy. I won’t let the shadow take that happiness.

He tosses me a chip. I catch it in midair and his friends clap. It’s good and salty and I want more *food food food* but I can’t I must stay focused.

Standing up, I inch toward it, leaving group behind. 

The shadow reeks of fear. It knows I can hurt it. Knows I *will* hurt it.

I puff my chest out to show strength, and it backs up further, swinging head side to side, looking for escape. It eyes the stairs first. Then door, staring at the hole where the paper man invades our home. He’s problem for another day.

It knows it can’t escape up the stairs. It dashes toward door because I can’t get out without boy. I’m too late and I scratch at the door and bark and bark for the boy but he’s so engrossed in his game that all he does is toss me another chip and tell me to sit down.

I place my butt on the ground and stare at the door. I wait for it to come back because it *will* come back.

They always do. ",LonghandWriter

You have no special powers... Just, you know... Common sense to conquer with...",Nazamroth,"Normally, I wouldn't ever have the courage to approach him, much less to speak with him.  He was an A-lister, after all, and I barely managed to hold onto my own meager C-list position.  I was a rookie, dwarfed by his all-star shadow.

Still, it was a Friday night, and I already had a couple beers pooling in my stomach and lightening my thoughts.  What was the worst that could happen?  And he always seemed friendly enough, if a bit distant.  I gathered my half-finished beer, summoned up my courage, and approached him.

""Er... Impulse?""

He turned at his name, looking over at me.  His frown smoothed out, replaced after a second by a smile.  ""Firebolt, right?"" he replied, pointing a finger at me.

I nodded, perhaps a little more enthusiastically than was necessary - but I hadn't expected him to recognize me!  ""Yeah, that's me!  Firebolt, a young man gifted in a laboratory explosion with the ability to manipulate and control all forms of heat, although I can't create a flame on my own-""

He held up a hand, his smile fading slightly as his face twisted into a wince.  ""Yeah, got it.  No need to do the monologue bit.""

""I'm sorry,"" I said, suddenly concerned that I'd managed to offend him.

""Nah, it's fine.  Everyone does it; they can't help it here.""  He gestured to a stool beside him.  ""Here, pull up a seat.  Next beer's on me.""

Still slightly dazzled by sitting this close to an A-lister, having an actual conversation with him, I obediently did as commanded.  The bartender came by, and I ordered my favorite beer - it reminded me of my father, although he vanished from my life almost a decade earlier, and my mother refused to ever tell me what had happened.

As I explained this, I saw Impulse wincing again.  ""Is there something wrong?"" I asked.

He sighed.  ""Nothing you'd understand, kid.""

""Go on, try me.""  That was the beer talking, grabbing ahold of my tongue before I could regain control.  Still, it was just saying what I'd been thinking, although I normally wouldn't have dared to speak so blatantly to such a great superhero.

Impulse looked over at me for a minute, frowning.  He seemed to reach a decision after a minute, shrugging and lifting his own beer to his lips.  ""Why not.  Answer me this, kid - what are my powers?""

I frowned.  Why would he ask me?  ""Well, you're able to think incredibly fast, make tactical decisions that blindside your enemies and bring them down before they can react,"" I recited, remembering the hero's profile page in the Super Manual.

""Wrong,"" he said, and finished off his beer.  He gave a little wave to the bartender, as I blinked.

""What?  But that's what's listed in the Super Manual-""

""But it's wrong,"" he interjected.  ""See, my reflexes aren't any faster than anybody else's.  I'm not a tactical genius.  It's not a gift that I have.  Instead, it's something I'm lacking.""

""Lacking?"" I repeated, totally confused.  ""What are you lacking?""

Impulse's new beer arrived in front of him.  ""And as always, it's on the house,"" the bartender said, grinning at the A-lister.  ""After you came in here the other month and stopped those punks from trying to burn down my bar, the bar that I've inherited since my great-grandfather ran a Prohibition backroom club here, I owe you a hell of a debt.""

I listened, raptly, to the story.  Impulse, however, seemed to be gritting his teeth, just waiting for it to end.  

""That,"" he snapped, once the bartender finished and turned away.  ""That's what I'm missing.""

I still didn't understand.  ""A bar?""

""Monologuing!""  He grabbed his beer off the counter with enough force to spill a few drops on the stained wood.  ""Everyone in this universe monologues!""

""Monologue?"" I echoed.  ""What do you mean?""

""I mean, whenever anyone tries to do anything in here, they need to give ten minutes of backstory!  Some murderer pulls out a gun, but he doesn't shoot the victim.  He stands there for ten minutes, blabbering on about how he's lost his morals and he needs to man up and do it!""

""So?""  I still didn't understand what was so strange about this.

""So it's bloody stupid, that's what it is!"" Impulse shouted, slamming his fist down on the bar.  ""Someone's blathering about how he's gonna kill someone, I just walk up and smack him!""

""After announcing your attack name, of course,"" I added.

""No!""  He spun on his stool to glare at me, eyes a little too wide for my liking.  ""No announcing!  No shouting!  No 'powering up', whatever the hell that is.  And no... damn... monologues!""

I just looked back at him.  He breathed heavily for another second, but then, with an effort, calmed himself.

""Don't worry about it, Firebolt,"" he said, sighing.  ""You wouldn't understand.  Think of it more as..."" He grappled for some words.  ""Think of it as I'm not from around here, and I can act outside your physical limitations.""

""Right.""  Hesitantly, I recalled the words from the Super Manual.  ""You can make tactical decisions that bring down your enemies before they can react.""

""Eh, why not.""  Impulse nodded towards my own drink.  ""Enjoy that, kid.  And you know why I bought it for you, why I decided to invite you over, share my secret?""

I shrugged, leaning forward and waiting for the deep, involved, wonderfully complex explanation.

""Because I felt like it,"" he said, grinning at my confused expression.  He slid off the stool and strode out of the bar, not pausing or looking back.

Wow.  A real A-list superhero.  I sat there, on the stool at the bar, for a good ten minutes before I realized that I forgot to ask for his autograph.

Too bad, really.  It really would have meant the world to Henry, the young man I visited in the hospital every weekend.  Henry had been one of the first bystanders I tried to save - but although I stopped the villain rampaging through the city, I wasn't able to save Henry from breaking both his legs.  I felt like I owed it to the kid to visit him in the hospital, encourage his recovery.  He helped make me a better person, because he acted as my morality, grounding me.  He would have loved Impulse's autograph.

Next time, I promised myself.  I couldn't let myself forget Henry again.  He needed to always come first.",Romanticon

I roll my eyes as the dude slumps backwards on his throne, most of the right half of his head missing, right around the ole eyeball area. As the guards gaped in disbelief at this I holster my revolver and shrug. 

""Anyone wanna tell me where the missile controls are?"" 

A guard kind of fumbles and then points at the side door out of the throne room. I walk into what frankly looks like a 1980's sci-fi set, draw and cock my single action, and shoot the first technician to turn his spinny chair towards me in the chest.

""Alright, let's make this quick, disarm the missiles and I won't fuck up your faces.""

One of the technicians starts to monologue about honor and loyalty to the boss. I Point out the door to the remains of what was their bosses face and he doesn't shut up. I give him some free and extremely permanent dental work for the low price of around $0.30 and a lifetime of haunting flashbacks on my part.

The other technicians freeze and then quickly spin around and shut everything off before standing up and filing out, some carrying lunchboxes and other stuff. 

And that was that, job was done. Saved the next kingdom over (who were completely peaceful, ironically) from getting nuked because no one in this place knows when to shut the fuck up. It's goddamn frustrating, makes being the fastest gun in the west totally fucking meaningless, considering the next fastest gun takes 15 minutes just to stop trying to measure dicks with you.

"[WP] You enter one of those universes where attacks are extremely telegraphed, preparations take minutes, and everyone gives lengthy arrogant monolouges detailing their plans... You have no special powers... Just, you know... Common sense to conquer with...",Nazamroth,"Captain Hughes, the Combat Captain of Voyager-Athena 23 jolts from his seat to inspect the assembly of regiment heads. He marches down and gazes at them, inspecting each officer's posture and position. 

Officer Lane rolled his eyes at this practice. What exactly was the point? It was more important to let the soldiers know of the possible circumstances of entering an unknown territory, and strategies to minimise loss and build friendly relations with other civilisations of the universe. If he were to narrate the most important principle of exploration, he would tell you that most civilisations prefer not to fight but to build relations that are mutually beneficial. Diplomacy is an important balancing act of life in the Universe.

Captain Hughes was fidgety, the ship was entering into unknown territory, with no particular strategy in sight. The ship could be blown into pieces by gamma ray guns from civilisations yet unknown, they could be captured if perceived as enemies, they could be forced into an unfamiliar wormhole. He was a worst-case-scenario man who couldn't afford failures.

""Officers!""

""Here we go again"" Officer Lane whispered to himself. Netra, the young Navigation Assistant couldn't control her giggle.

Hughes continued ""Do you know who the biggest enemy is?""

He pretends to wait for a response. However, the cautious and disciplined group of officers do not utter a single word, out of the fear of being perceived as disrespectful.

""The question should not be WHO the biggest enemy is""

He turns his back to the officers and raises a finger. ""It should be WHAT the biggest enemy is""

""The biggest enemy is a lack of strategy. It is our civilisation's well-weighed strategies that have made us the conquerors of this universe. An abundance of contingencies, awareness of threats..""

""Maximising strengths, minimising weaknesses.."" Lane and Netra murmured in unison.

""Maximising strengths and minimising weaknesses!"" Hughes roared. He improvises well but fails to exclude platitudes in his speech after all.

Netra observes something on the navigation panel and points it out to Lane.

""Our civilisation has always stood up for the truth, for welfare, for benefits for all. In our years of voyaging, we have never surrendered to the enemies, we have always fought through. Sometimes we were defeated, many times we emerged as victorious. It is important to know that a single defeat leads to a thousand victories. While we-""

""Uh, Captain Hughes"" Lane interrupted the well-decorated monologue of Captain Hughes that he had practised for the past few weeks in front of a mirror.

""Interrupting your speech wasn't my intention, but we might have located an unidentified ship""

Both hurried to the navigation panel, Captain Hughes studied the movement of the ship intently. He rubbed his chin and roamed around in a circle thinking of his next move.

""Take the laser guns out and fire a warning shot""

Officer Lane is startled. A combat already? Captain Hughes surely behaves like a child playing a video game.

""I don't mean to critique your strategy, Captain. But this could lead to harmful consequences, we don't even know what kind of a vehicle we are looking at-""

With the show of a hand, Captain Hughes orders Officer Lane to stop talking.

""Officer Lane, with due respect to your designation and experience, I must remind you that I am the Combat Captain""

He turns, straightening his back and heaving his chest.

""I have fought many combats and the harshest of wars in the Universe. You don't know when, or how, or where the enemy attacks. The most lethal of the attacks happen when the enemy has the upper hand""

Officer Lane and Netra, giving little importance to the speech, closely examine the unidentified ship. Hughes is now talking to the assembly of officers.

""Who even is the enemy, you have to question yourself. Friends turn into foes in no time, my dear officers, this Universe is harsh. No matter how much we progress, the primitive need of victory surpasses everything.""

""Captain I hate to interrupt once again, but we have identified the vehicle, it is an Intergalactic Ambulance carrying some of our own people""

Captain Hughes looks at Officer Lane and falls short of things to say for the first time. Silence in the hall is met with audible giggles from the officers.

As soon as I amass the life energies of this world into a single attack, I will decimate you to oblivion!” Super Villain Myoga Ultra yelled out, his muscles bulging beneath his black armor in concentration. His hands were held out in front of him, and a deadly ball of blue energy began to form between his outstretched hands.

Bobbeh Shill stood several feet away from Myoga; a slack look on his face. Bobbeh didn’t say a word, but rather walked up to Myoga, his grey shorts swishing as he walked. The young man, a distinct contrast to the over the top villains and heroes that filled this desolate wasteland of battle that was Earth, kept his hands at his side as he walked. Myoga’s energy ball didn’t scare Bobbeh, he’d seen this move all too often.

Myoga Ultra strained in concentration as he charged his attack. Sweat pooled at his brow. He only needed a few more minutes, and his devastating attack would finally be ready. He saw Bobbeh Shill approach him; Myoga couldn’t help but laugh at the fool.

“What, are you just going to walk towards me?!” Myoga yelled. “In just a matter of minutes, my attack will be ready, and I will eradicate you from the face of existence!”

Bobbeh let out a shrug, and continued walking towards Myoga Ultra. Soon, the two men were standing merely a few feet apart. Bobbeh spread his feet wide, and readied himself. He whispered under his breath.

“That’s my purse.”

Bobbeh’s leg moved in a swift motion. Myoga’s eyes widened in sudden fear as Bobbeh let out a guttural cry.

“I DON’T KNOW YOU!” He yelled, brining his foot up in a swift kick to Myoga Ultra’s groin.

Myoga Ultra let out a groan of surprise. His arms dropped, and the ball of blue energy dissipated. The Super Villain dropped to his knees, clutching his groin. He looked up at Bobbeh Shill.

“But how? How can this be?!” Myoga cried out in despair before he fell to the dry soil, unconscious.

Bobbeh gave Myoga a small grin, before turning to go. He pulled out a crumpled piece of paper from his back pocket. On the paper, was a list of names. The henchmen of the grand overlord of the world, Count Zion. Bobbeh crossed Myoga Ultra’s name off of the list. One more down.

Bobbeh Shill was only walking for several minutes before a war hardened voice called out to him.

“Bobbeh Shill, How dare you strike down my brethren and sistren!” The voice called out.

Bobbeh turned to face his next opponent. It was Atomic Adam, the legendary samurai who’s giga slash was said to decimate cities.

“I will end your reign of terror right here, right now Bobbeh Shill!” Atomic Adam called out, readying himself. “Our master was gracious to you. After your capture, he naturally told you about his master plans, but you were rude enough to escape after hearing our master’s benevolence. Now, you must die!”

Bobbeh Shill smiled, and spread his feet apart. He remembered his training; his inner mantra echoed through his mind.

**That’s my purse, I don’t know you!**

Bobbeh Shill smiled as Atomic Adam continued to prattle on about honor and dignity. His speech would last approximately twenty five minutes, plenty of time for Bobbeh Shill to enact his finishing move.

In a matter of moments, Bobbeh Shill was walking off again, another name crossed off of his list. Such was the life of a warrior destined to travel the road of constant battle. He did it all for survival, and for the honor of his father. Surely Bobbeh’s countless victories against the tyrannical Count Zion would make his father proud.

""Uh huh,"" I mumbled. Absentmindedly, I pawed at the cord running up the back of my neck, which connected a transmitter in my jacket's inside pocket with a lavalier microphone concealed in my bandana. It was picking up his every word. ""Right, fusion reactor, president, control. Anything else?"" I took a step forward. ""Like what's to stop me from just walking over there?""

""You'll never make it! I rigged this catwalk with explosives, the moment you set foot on it, I'll blow you to kingdom come!""

I took another step forward. ""And how exactly do you survive this?""

""Simple! I have a grappling hook! As the structure is collapsing, I fire it up to the observation deck and make my escape, while you will likely be dead before you're dissolved in the coolant below!""

While he was talking, I took a couple more steps forward. If I could just keep him talking...

""I don't see where you'd fit a rope in that suit of yours,"" I said. A few more words and he'd be in reach.

""Do you think the money that went into building my legacy was simply thrown away? We developed a highly futuristic prototype rope with four times the tensile strength per fiber than standard rope! It's barely—HURGH!""

I had reached him, stepped around him and performed a hip-throw to hurl him over the railing. So that was the first time taking martial arts as a kid actually came in handy, and statistically speaking, it was probably the last.

""You talk too much,"" I said aloud. I turned to the control panel: he'd stopped whatever he was doing when I showed up, but I hadn't arrived fast enough to save myself the trouble of reverting it. Now I was looking at an overheat and meltdown if I didn't do something soon. If only my sound engineering degree had prepared me for this.

My earpiece crackled, and a familiar voice spoke. ""Agent Teuast! We heard that on this end. A scheme of that magnitude requires the machinations of a truly evil mind, and by silencing him, you've done our entire world a major—""

""Dammit mate, shut up and just tell me how to disarm this thing!"" I barked. ""I've heard enough bloody monologuing tonight to last me a lifetime. Save it for the afterparty!""

Agent Calamis had been raised by former supervillains, of the same sort I'd just murdered except not evil anymore. He was a good kid, but he'd definitely picked up their habit of getting sidetracked at every opportunity.

""Sorry, Agent,"" said Calamis. ""What I mean to say is, that control panel is the central point of contact to the entire facility! One wrong move, and you could be facing results equally catastrophic to what your friend was hoping to achieve! So act carefully, and make sure...""

This was getting us nowhere. I pressed my mute button and got to work.

""...mess of wires down there, so take utmost care which ones you swap! If you get the clock pulse timings out of sync, you could fry the internal PCB and cause the whole facility to go into emergency lockdown, and then you won't—""

""It's done,"" I announced. ""I'm gettin' out of here.""

""But... what?!"" said Calamis, half alarmed and half insulted. ""But I wasn't done explaining how to do it yet! You asked me to tell you how to prevent overload!""

""I wasn't listening,"" I said, already on my way out the door, the reactor humming along quite happily behind me. It had been a simple matter of setting coolant flow back to high and reducing power input to standard. Anyone who could read an error message could have figured it out.

Behind Calamis, my supervisor shook his head. ""It's a good thing he's half as good as he thinks he is, Cal,"" he said, solemnly. ""One of these days, somebody's monologue is actually going to have important information in it.""",teuast

I stood there with my hands bound and mouth gagged along with about 10 other dudes.  A large vat of dramatically green acid boiled in front of us.  We were a good five feet away from the ledge.  Our legs weren't bound, but the room was locked down.  There was nowhere to go.  I figured disintegrating might be faster than bleeding out from Dr. McDongle shooting me in the back, so I resigned to my fate.

McDongle had conveniently placed a camera connected to the ceiling on the other side of the vat as to capture every moment, televising it to the residents of MetroGotholis.  It was on every big screen in the streets, and every television in every home.  I guess this shit was considered PG.  Honestly I was a bit disappointed that I was going out like this.    

After a few years living in M-G I came to the realization that nobody seemed to die of natural causes, like being hit by a taxi delivering pizza.  I do consider that a natural cause.  If you went, you went big.  While that could be considered a good thing, it almost became a cliche.  

I used to shake my head at the people who got into these situations.  I didn't go wandering around abandoned buildings or skipping through back alleys.  I was street smart, and sometimes I felt like I was the only one who could sense a ""Don't go in there"" moment in the entire city.  Yet here I was.

To be fair, I had been to that Taiwanese restaurant like thirty times and they seemed super straight up.  How was I supposed to know the real chef was tied up to the radiator in the back, and that the waiter was being held hostage?  And to McDongle's credit he actually made a pretty good Pad Thai. 

 I knew something was up when I found fish in it, because I didn't order fish.  Also the owner had a bizarre fear of anything with gills after he was apparently mauled post falling into a koi pond as a child.  That was the story the waiter told me anyway and he seemed pretty serious.  

My face must have been pretty transparent as I came to some sort of realization.  Then McDongle sat down at my table.  ""What's the matter, you don't like the fish?""

""Fuck..."" I dropped my spoon, and I began to feel light headed.

""It's a caribbean death-cuttle reaper fish. One of the rarest in the world.  Delicious, but poison to  a man such as yourself.""  

I looked McDongle.  That damn grin on his face.  The terrible comb over of gray hair and his stupid lab coat.  God dammit...,""Why?""  I asked him.  He started on some sort of rant about watching me and how I am a fascinating specimen in a petri-dish of a city or some shit.  I wasn't paying attention because I felt so out of it, and really only made it a few seconds in before my face slammed into my soup.

So fast forward to the acid chamber again.  McDongle opens one of the doors and walks in.  He has a hunched back and hes cackling and shit.  The camera turns on, and he walks in front of it.  In front of US.  ""Metrogotholis, I return...""  So he starts again right?  Talking about vengeance and egging everyone on, ""All of these years, I have waited.  This is only the beginning.  A taste, if you will, of what is to come.""  

I kind of looked around the room at this point, to make sure I wasn't missing anything obvious.  The rest of the hostages were crying.  I was literally the ONLY guy who realized that this douche was standing on the fuckin' ledge.  The ledge we were supposed to be pushed off of.

So he keeps going, ""I am a revenant, a spectre of an age of justice, and righteousness.""  He gets half way through his next sentence.  Something about retribution or some shit.  But before he could finish i lifted up my leg and just pushed him with one foot, and not even that hard really.  

Being an old ass man McDongle wasn't going to regain his balance.  He fell forward with a wilhelm scream and just kind of belly flopped into the acid.  Just like that it was over.  No dramatic melting screams, no half skeletal man crawling out of the vat.  He just died.  Honestly, even I was expecting a little more.

I noticed the other hostages staring at me.  They looked bewildered, like they couldn't believe what they had seen.  They just kept staring.  Then one of them spit out his gag, which he could have done ages ago and probably untied us all.  It was really the next thing he said that made me decide I needed to move out.  He just looked at me, disappointed, and said it, ""What the fuck dude?""

Let me set the scene for you. I was shopping, minding my own god damn business, when this spandex wearing prick walks in. He starts yelling, something about this being the first step to world domination yadda yadda yadda, anyway no one pays him much attention.

This makes the guy pissed. So he pulls out a lightning bolt. No joke, lightning came through the fuckin' window, hit him, and now he's holding it like its a javelin or something. Anyway, now I'm done shopping, and I go to pay but everyone's too busy cowering in fear, so I have to deal with this prick before I can go home. This looks like a job for Understate. Whoopdee freaking doo.

So now the guy (I think he called himself Hellbolt? Corny motherfucker) he recognizes me. ""Oh Understate, I'm going to kill you, lightning bolts, thunder, rah"" or something like that.

Now, the funny thing about these super-freaks is, good or bad, they are easily distracted. So while he was ranting about killing me and taking over the world, I walked up and asked him to hold my groceries. And he did. With that, faster than he could say ""Oh sure"" I kicked him to the floor and beat the crap out of him. Today I learned, despite how difficult it is to maintain a lightning bolt with a bloody nose, all that electricity has to go somewhere. Note to self, bring rubber gloves when fighting Electrics.

So yeah, he went to the hospital for scrapes, bruises, and the aforementioned bloody nose, I got groceries, and no one got hurt. Well, except for that window.",Wumer

I raise an eyebrow, I've never heard of a company called Earth. I decide to make an appointment for the interview. 

I get dressed and ready for my interview. I show up and walk up to the reception desk. A beautiful young woman smiles as I approach, her long blond hair bouncy and curly. 
""I'm Angela, how can I help you today?"" She asks with a lovely voice, like a well-tuned harp, soft and beautiful. 
""Hello, I'm Zaria Hall, I made an appointment for the head programmer position."" I say, feeling a little dumpy compared to this blonde beauty. 
""Oh yes, Mr. Christ will be right with you, he's just in the middle of a conference call."" 
I nod and go sit down on the bench seat while I wait. 
A few moments later I'm lead down the hall by Angela to the office of a J. Christ. 
A man with long brown hair, a beard and wearing a loose white shirt smiles as I walk in. 
""Please, sit down Zaria. I've been expecting you."" He says, offering a hand. 
I shake his hand and sit down. Odd, this office seems pretty casual with the dress code, and it's no even Friday. 
""I don't know much about computers, but my dad seems to like your skills. I was a carpenter before this, so I'll take His word on it."" Mr. Christ adds. 
""Oh, well I can show you some programs I designed, the whole program might be more interesting than the source code to a non-programmer."" I suggest. 
""Oh, sure. I'd like that."" 
I pull out my laptop and show off some of the programs I made over the years, mostly games; simple flash games, platform games and a few more complex, plot driven games.

Ok, seems I'm in a pickle here. That's not a phrase I say. Glad I just thought it. But, I digress. I don't say that either. I need to stop delaying. 

This is getting awkward. Mary Beth and I are just staring at each other, which is normally a romantic thing we do, except right now I'm naked, and she isn't, and a woman that wasn't quite her has left the bed we share. I'm in a pickle. Fuck!

Still staring. Now she's doing that evil eye twitch thing. That's not really fair to say. She isn't evil. Just a pain. I mean, why would I cheat on her if she wasn't a pain. What kind of asshole would that make me? But, I digress. Fuck!

Okay, gotta think fast. I'm gonna have to go Johnny Cochran on this bitch. I'm not calling my wife a bitch, but rather the situation. As I said, she's just a pain. Now what would Cochran do? I need to make this about something bigger than what it is.

[WP] Everyone in the world develops an incurable case of the hiccups.,ShadyNite,"*""The Hiccup-ocolypse""*

All around the world, people were shot as others accidentally pulled triggers. People bled out as surgeons messed up precise incisions. Cars crashed as the steering wheels were suddenly turned, or the drivers momentarily stopped watching the roads. Buildings fell and people were crushed when crane operators jerked the controls the wrong way. 

No, it wasn't just crying children or religious hysterics. Lots of people died, and that was just in the first few hours of it hitting their homes. It wasn't an earthquake, or aliens. It was hiccups.

All over the world, within one or two days, everyone alive had hiccups. Old grannies and newborn babies alike. Coma patients, even. I won't go into too much detail on what happened to the hospitals, but several of them quickly shut down.

At first, people thought it was ""vocal tics caused by mass hysteria"". It explained why only humans were affected by this, but not how everyone got them without even hearing of others. There were conspiracy theorists convinced it was biological warfare, and apparently even a few leaders that agreed, but scientific testing showed no sign of this being the case. It didn't help that most of the trusted news reporters refused to go on air to talk about it. Personally, I thought it was some disease that had hiccups as a symptom. It could have damaged our diaphragms, or our hiccup reflex, or something. I don't know. I've sort of stopped wondering by now. I just want a cure. 

You must think society would find a way to deal with it after the first few days, right? That's what we all thought too. There were minor adjustments that helped at first. More people walked places. Building operations were postponed. The epidemic was announced as non-fatal, and likely not dangerous, and we were informed that top scientists were trying to figure out what this was and how to fix it. 

Most of the panic that had originally stricken began to settle, but that didn't stop the effects of the hiccups. Society couldn't pause forever. Within a week, people were driving again. This time it wasn't just cars crashing. It was buses, and planes. Drivers and pilots fell asleep at the wheel, exhausted by the lack of sleep. I think there were a few accidents with power plants and the like, as well. 

Do you have any idea how uncomfortable it is to sleep with hiccups? To eat and drink properly? It's hard to breathe sometimes, and I can't imagine what it must have been like for people with medical conditions. I don't expect a lot of people were having fun at night, either, although I'm not one to think about those sort of things. Everyone was exhausted and irritable, and a lot of public services shut down. Police tried to keep going, but their hands were full. They didn't have time to sort out accidents from attacks.

Some less righteous people took this unstable period as an opportunity, from local criminals to terrorist organizations. Some more righteous took it as a warning from God. Either way, it started wars that we couldn't stop. Some things were still accidental, some weren't. It didn't really matter by that point.

 I like to think that this would all end if we found a cure, but I have a sinking feeling that I know the world better than that by now. They'd try to give it to everyone they cared about first. Others would find out and try to steal it. If they finally got it, they'd probably charge a fortune for people to have it.

If I'm wrong and this reaches someone in a safe and happy future, I hope it will serve as a good historical record. If not, I hope it reminds someone that the world wasn't always this way.",ImgurianOnReddit

If I was still hungry after I finished my bowl of food, she would give me her food. When I got neutered, she licked me and told me everything will be alright. She was always jumpy and happy. So much energy. I didn't even know dogs could be so energetic. She always needed to go outside in the yard and play. Now that I think about it, she is an angel. 
I snap out of my dreaming. I realize I am staring at her. I don't know how she does it, jumping and running around like she did 100 dog-years ago. I close my eyes, and think about the treats and presents I will get tomorrow. Most importantly, I think about her. I love her with all my heart. 
She is 122 dog-years young.

"[WP] In the Dog World, Humans are seen as akin to High-Fantasy Elves",TheGeorge,"It was a great day, as always. It's always a great day when Master is around. Unfortunately, when the all-powerful Master is around, there are bound to be others trying to steal his glory. A small human tottered by the front gate, pausing to look at me. 

No, Fluffy, you bad boy, how could you think so highly of yourself? Surely the small human had more important, humanly things to look at, like other humans. 

Master.

My fur bristled in fury. I lunged towards the small human, warning it of the consequences if it dared harm Master. That look in the small human's eyes...surely this was one of the bad ones Rex warned me about.

""No, small human, you shall not get any closer! I, Fluffy, shall protect Master! I will lay down my life for Master! Though you may be of the same kind as Master, Master is clearly superior! Yo shall not trick me into believing you are Master! I will never take orders from anyone but my Master! Leave!""

The small human started leaking water from its eyes. It ran away howling. Serves it right for wishing harm upon Master. I just hope it does not condemn me. 

Bad boy, Fluffy! Have more faith in Master! Surely he will protect you from condemnation.

There was a thud behind me. I turned around. Master was standing at the door.

""Master!"" I shouted, running towards Master excitedly. Surely he was proud of me for driving off the imposter.

Master grabbed a broom leaning against the wall. I've seen Master use it to collect the squirrel I once presented him with. It must be a broom of great importance. Maybe it was magic, and Master used it to send the squirrel to the dimension where bad boys go. Master would never send me there. I have been a good boy. Maybe Master was going to use the magic broom to give me blessings. I wagged my tail.

Master shouted some incantations, and caressed my fur with the broom. I was right! Unfortunately, the broom must have been too heavy, because Master must have dropped it. It hit me with a thwack. It hurt. I accidentally let out a whimper.

You're a bad boy, you're going to make Master sad that he hurt you!

Master caressed my fur again, but the broom was still too heavy. This time, it hit me even harder. I tired not to whimper, but I couldn't stop myself. No, Master is a good boy. Master is not one of the bad ones like the small humans. He gives me lots of blessings every day, but his magic tools he uses to bless me are always too heavy. 

I whimpered again. Master must have heard me, because amidst the incantations, I heard Master shout two very familiar words.

Bad boy. 

I'm sorry, Master...I failed you...You care so much about me, and yet I made you sad...I'm not a good boy anymore...",ellipsed_

[WP] Write a horror story with no villain.,Trialdude,"Early in the morning, I lay in bed, with my wife at my side, wrapping her arms around me. I looked over, and stared at her face, still asleep. I eased my way out of bed, trying not to wake her. I crept into the closet, slipped on a pair of pants ironed the previous night, and a white button up shirt, also ironed the previous night. I then slowly walked through the room, towards the stairs. Holding the handrail, I moved down the stairs, and into the kitchen. Upon opening the fridge, I couldn't help but notice a sour smell coming from the cheese drawer. The cheese I was planning on using to make breakfast was expired. Fuck. I took it out of the fridge and dropped it into the garbage can. *I should really go to the supermarket to pick up some more cheese* I thought to myself as I closed the fridge door.

I walked into the mudroom, grabbed the shoehorn, and slipped my foot into my dress shoes, as later, I had a job interview. I opened the front door, feeling the crisp November air brush past my face. My car was waiting in my driveway. Luckily, my car has a remote start feature, so I pushed that to let the car warm up as I approached. The windshield was covered in a thin layer of frost. I sighed, and turned back towards the house. I walked back up the stairs and back into the mudroom. I looked around, and found the window scraper.

I approached the car again and began to scrape. As I scraped away, I couldn't help but notice a small fracture in the windshield. Strange. I ran my finger across the fracture, and felt that it was more than superficial. I could feel the ridge created. *I'll take care of that later*. I entered my car, and closed the door. I backed out of the driveway, as to not slide on the ice. My car didn't have any snow tires yet. I drove fairly slowly to the supermarket. I had to be able to react quickly to braking cars.

I arrived at the supermarket with little trouble, save some traffic at the bridge. I walked towards the back of the store, where they kept cheese, and grabbed a bag of already grated cheese. I figured that because I was already at the store, I might as well pick up the groceries for the week. I spent a while gathering many things, such as milk, orange juice, carrots, bread, and eggs. I also picked up a small hammer, as the hammer in my workshop in the garage disappeared. Probably borrowed by my wife, who forgot to return it. Oh well. I needed a new hammer anyway.

I carried my bags back to the car and set them in the back seat. My trunk already had a chair in it that my wife wanted me to drop off at the Goodwill. I began to drive back at home, slightly faster than on the way to the market. Suddenly, I started to skid out. I turned back into the skid, but it was no use. I had no control. My car slammed into the bridge, and went flying off of the bridge, into the icy water below. My car sank deeper and deeper. one meter. five meters. 10 meters. The bottom didn't seem to exist. I was panicking. At points, I found it hard to breathe. *Alright. Calm down. You will kill yourself by panicking when you could be finding a way out*. My breathing began to slow, as I took deeper and deeper breaths.

I looked around. So far, no water got into the cabin. The groceries were all over the place in the back, but other than that, everything seemed fine. I looked outside to be greeted by darkness. Not much light was getting through the water. I then opened the cover to the skylight. I could still see the surface. I could make out the individual waves on top. I fell forward as the car slammed nose first into the ground, and didn't move. I began to think about how I would get out of this predicament. I would try the door. I grabbed the handle to the door, took a deep breath, and pushed. The door didn't budge. I tried again, pushing harder than I thought I could. Still, the door didn't budge. I leaned back into my seat and started to cry. I thought about my wife's face, and the high possibility that I'd never see it again.

I thought about the kids that we had always wanted. I imagined them running around a field, throwing a football back and forth. My wife was probably just getting up, wondering where I was. How would anyone have the courage to tell her that she will never see her husband again? I imagined my funeral. The hearse rolling up with an empty coffin, or one with a waterlogged body sitting inside. My crying stopped, and I took a deep breath. *I'm not dead yet*. I looked around, trying to see if there was another way out, when I heard a loud crack. Looking around the cabin, I didn't see anything, until I looked forward. The crack now extended across the entire length of the windshield. Another loud crack pierced my ears. The crack began to grow vertically. My heart began to race. I was thinking that this would be the end. Another crack developed, this time down the edge of the windshield. I began to kick frantically at it, trying to break the glass so that I could escape. Nothing. Another crack chipped off a small chunk of windshield, and water began to pour in.

It was freezing. I had no doubt in my mind that even if I escaped the car, the icy water would for sure take me. Suddenly, more of the windshield fell off,  and more water poured in. Eventually, all the glass caved in, leaving nothing to stop the flow of water. I took a deep breath and dove for the hole. I tried unsuccessfully to squeeze out. The nose was buried in sand and rubble, and it did nothing but make the opening smaller. I was about halfway through when I started to suffocate. I was in pain. My lungs burned as I held my breath for longer than I had ever. I quickly struggled to get back into the car, hoping that there was an air pocket somewhere.

My vision darkened. It became harder and harder to get myself out of the windshield. Eventually, my vision went black, and along with that, my head passed under the support bar on top of the windshield. I penetrated the surface, and gasped for air. I spent a minute breathing heavily. Luckily, I hadn't swallowed any water. My eyes were watery from tears. After a while, I got my bearings and worked on a backup. If I couldn't get out of the front, what about the back? I looked at the glass in the back, and saw that it was holding quite well. I had no idea how I could break it to get out. I tried kicking the front windshield out, which was cracked, and had no luck. There was no way that I'd be able to break the back. I looked around the cabin, and noticed that the grocery bags spilled and everything was floating around. The bags of cheese were open, and the juice had spilled. I looked around frantically for anything useful, when something shiny caught my eye under the water.

The hammer rested on the back of the back of the driver's seat. I reached down for it, and grabbed it. I then lifted it to the back window, and hit it as hard as I possibly could. A small crack formed around where I had struck. I hit again in a different spot, as I wanted a large hole, not just some small area where water would flow in effortlessly. I repeated the process for around five minutes, until eventually, the glass shattered. Now was my chance. The car was fully underwater. I kicked for the surface, trying to keep from locking up my muscles from the cold. The surface got closer and closer, and the water brightened. My lungs couldn't take anymore. I opened my mouth out of instinct to breathe, and water filled my lungs. I was choking on water. More and more water flowed into my lungs, and I felt them burning.

My vision started to blur and darken. I was so close. My fingers and toes went numb, and suddenly I felt warm. I felt nothing at all. I started to close my eyes, and sunk back to the bottom feeling nothing but peace.

I woke up to see only a bright light. *Am I dead?* I tried to stand up, but I couldn't. I couldn't move anything. I couldn't even look around. My eyes slowly adjusted to the light, and I saw that the light above me wasn't from a star or something more powerful, but from a lamp. I was still unsure if I was dead, but then I felt something grab my icy hand. My wife leaned over my body, tears in her eyes, and opened her mouth to speak. A look of sadness filled her eyes, and she suddenly closed her mouth. She lowered her head onto my chest and cried. She cried. In all of our years together, not once had I seen her cry this much. I tried to move my hands to hold her, but I couldn't.

The nurse entered the room. She saw my wife crying, grabbed her shoulder, and apologized to her. Why was she apologizing? I just woke up. What was wrong? My hearing started to fade in. All that I heard was a loud, long beep. It never stopped. The nurse picked up the clipboard and wrote something down. The doctor then entered and took the clipboard from the nurse.

""Jared Harriott, age 34, pronounced brain dead on the 23rd of November, 2017 at 5:22 AM. I'm sorry."" I was dead. I wanted to cry, but I couldn't. I couldn't do anything. Not a single thing. Is this all? Is there no real afterlife? You just die and see from your corpse? My body was lowered into a bag, and the bag was zipped shut.

""Thanks Jon. Well boy are we ever in for a scorcher this weekend folks...."", the weatherman prattled on.  Fuck you Steve. I always hated watching this guy. His Lego hair part, his used car salesman smile. Hardly old enough to be out of high school, let alone what ever the hell school you have to go to in order to point at a jet-stream and make cheesy weather puns.  Or at least he looked like a kid to me. Hell they all look like kids to me these days I guess.  Tends to happen when you're sitting in a chair you bought when they were in diapers, and wearing boxers that you bought about two years after that.



It's kind of funny though. I never noticed that he had a couple of grey hairs before though. Damn, Now I KNOW I'm old.  Well actually, hold on, He has a LOT of grey hair....no that doesn't make sense, he didn't have that at the beginning of the....HOLY SHIT! Look at those wrinkles! Is somebody playing  with the camera?



""In fact we have sun right up unt...."" 


""Um hold on steve, are you uhhhh are you okay?""



""Of course Jon. what uh what are you.."" he said in a noticeably raspier voice.  "" Now that you mention it, I think I might be losing my voice Jon. Back to you"" his voice now withered and weak.  The 30 year old weather man was no longer there. standing in his place was a 50 year old...no make that 60....64...



Steve now hunched over, legs wobbling, seemingly unable to support his own weight reaches out to grab the desk beside him but misses and stumbles to the ground.  Clutching at his chest, he gasps for air, and then...well and then he stops gasping for air. In fact he stops doing anything.  Where there stood a 30 year old weatherman 5 minutes ago, there laid 90 year old corpse.



""Ok, we're going to take a quick..."" Jon started, but the station had already cut to the technical 'difficulties please stand by' screen.



What the hell did I just watch, I thought to my self.   Well it turns out, what I had just watched was the beginning.   The beginning of the end.  And It was just broadcast live on the 5 o'clock news.  For a minute, there was nothing.  Yes for 72 seconds,an absolute eternity on the Internet,  No one in the entire world commented on the inconceivable event that they just witnessed.  Then it started.



""Holy shit did aybody just watch..."" ,       ""Breaking news out of Arizona tonight"",         ""U GUYS NEED 2 WATCH THIS VIDEO RIGHT NOW!!!!"",        ""Som nigga jus olded to death ON fukin TV yo!""





They called it 'The Time Virus'   It attacked DNA directly, causing exponential DNA oxidation, as well as ceaseing all cell division in the host body. It turned out to be highly contagious.  It had a long incubation period and worse, it was contagious long before any major symptoms appeared.  Turned out that some people could have it for 20 years, some people could have it for 6 months, but in every case, the end result was the same.




Simply put, people started dropping.  A few a day, then a few hundred, a few thousand and then a few hundred thousand. After 2 years passed with not even a glimmer of hope from medical science, people started to see it more as a when than an if scenario.  Some people rioted.  Some people started cramming every bit of living they could into each day, not knowing when their day would come. Me? I just kept doing what I do. I mean after the initial shock wore off, how much had really changed.  The way I see it we're all just sitting around waiting for our day anyway right?  Yeah, I think I'll crack a brew and see what's on the tube.

No fire frozen halfway up my staircase.

No psychopathic-ex standing over my bed with an ax.

""What the hell could it be this time?"" I sighed out loud while looking around me. This wasn't the first time I had awoken to a frozen world, yet it was the first time I was having so much difficulty finding out just what exactly was going to kill me. My body tended to use my ability subconsciously when in danger, but the danger was usually very apparent. 

A quick walk down the steps and to the kitchen revealed that I hadn't left the oven on. My house wasn't a gas-fueled bomb, waiting for a spark to set it alight. A glance out the front window showed clear signs and no sight of a plane barreling towards my front door. The streets were clear, more than they had ever been. The sun was still burning bright and hadn't shriveled up into some lackluster, dormant state ... yet.

""What could it be?"" The mumbling was the only sound in the still world as I ascended the stairs. A turn down the hallway and a quick twist to the right led me to my roommate's room. I didn't even bother knocking, not exactly rude considering the circumstances, before entering the room.

""What a mess."" My eyes swept over the mass of clothes and trash that littered the floor. If he had been more aware of just what exact danger he was in, he would've stopped to clean up the mess. 

""I know Carl won't."" I turned to face the man's mess of a bed and was surprised to see that he actually looked awake. He was frozen in place, but his body sat upright on his bed while his eyes remained focused on something in front of him.

""Look who actually woke up before noon."" I didn't expect a reply, but it was still nice to say out loud. Carl's laziness was legendary amongst our group of friends.

""Now, what's got you up so ear-"" The words died within my throat before they could make their way out of my mouth. My breathing seemed to freeze along with the rest of my body as I read through the image displayed on Carl's TV.

NUKE LAUNCHED BY RUSSIAN ANARCHISTS. EVACUATION IN PROGRESS. ARRIVAL TIME: 10:19

A hesitant glance over at Carl's clock confirmed the time. 10:18. And just as I turned to look back at the TV, I felt it. The world began to move again. The air around me became abuzz with motion and noises. The soft tick of the clock rang through the room, announcing time's return to the natural world. 

""-my god."" Carl's finished sentence was drowned out as a high-pitched whistle filled the air. I ran from out the room, not even bothering to dodge the mass of crap on his floor as I ran to my room. I burst through my door in a hurried frenzy, all while the whistling grew louder and louder. I dove across my bed and flung my head against the window. As my hands reached down to tear the obstruction, a tremor ran through the ground. An instant later, a bright light blinded me. I tried to pause. I screamed the word over and over in my head. It did nothing to stop the crumbling of the walls around me. It did nothing to stop the shattering of the windows. It did nothing to protect me from the heat of the nuclear warhead as it ate into my skin.

I guess that I had always had the ability to pause time whenever I was about to be harmed somehow. I woke up at this morning to see that everything has been paused.

I would be coming of age today and I am set to become a new champion for my Goddess. I look around my family's house; the buildings and windows outside each touching my attention. I tilt my head sideways in imagining the entire ecumenopolis; the planet-wide city. It's always seemed beautiful from the angle of a tower or a photograph from orbit. I particularly like the areas that have white marbelescent domed and pillared buildings around a harbour or bay. I don't really travel much around the globe, but I like occasionally looking at pictures. I know that the oceans are covered in boats and floating platforms which try to let as much light past them into the aquatic ecosystem as is tenable. 

My Goddess, the One of Alacrity, speaks to me about my new life as an adult. I will lose much of her ready guidance and protection from soon, onward. Reminiscing, I miss being able to playfully run away from playground fights. Some of the fights with me involved were also personally playfully started.

I'm almost ready to move onto a new chapter of my life. Time would always have paused for me and I had always had the gift of alacrity. I could act with quickness, eagerness and readiness. Time was only now paused so that my Goddess could be comforting, yet unmistakable, while telling me that I would never have my old gift again.
Now that I was finally ready, this new day began.

([Beginning])

I went off to the University of Sciences, as I do every morning. I never spend long getting ready in the morning and am proud of it. I am quick by choice, regardless of the nature of my blessings. Presumably, my personality was fitting enough for me to become Alacrity's champion. I get to the train stop early early enough to be safe that it won't have left without me. I'm not in much of a hurry or discomfort during the trip, but I eagerly get off at the end of the commute, of course. I'm meeting up with Jake and Saffron in the upper square. I still don't feel either way about the fact that they're not a couple. At least, this doesn't leave me an odd one out whenever we three haven't met up with anyone else yet.

""Hey,"" is said first by Jake. He spots the rest of us first and then sits down at the nearest picnic table, opposite where her and I are coming from.

""Hey guys!"" says Saffron.

""Hey,"" I conclude.

""Okay..."" comes from Saffron as she tries to remember some specifics of one of her last lectures. She and I usually tell each other about the content of our classes because it practices memory and the ability to explain for the one talking and it is extra information and lessons for the one listening and/or questioning. So far, she's been talking about anthropology, I've been talking about some maths, and Jake has been sitting along.

In the mean time, Jake and I talk a bit.

""What have you and Alice been up to?"" Jake asks.

""I'm starting as a new champion. There's all of the [looking for magical items as part-time] work."" 'Alice' is what I call Her of Alacrity when I imagine Her as a person.

I don't actually feel like class today. I can pretty much just read through the section of the coursebook later, and I should pick it all up there, anyway. I listen to Saffron's take on her latest lesson, then go back across the foot-street to the nearby park.

Maybe I'm just more eager to look for magical items!

My gift had always kept me safe, kept me from harm. I felt invulnerable, I developed a sense of entitlement. I believed was I better than everybody else because I never sunk to their level. Without pain, there was no weakness. Nothing could harm me, my gift would stop it before it could. I became reckless, frivolous and above all, arrogant

That arrogance was my undoing. 

I woke up that morning and there was no bullet, no knife and no oversized feline. 

She was there though, and she was packing her bags. I'd had my chances, and she was tired of forgiveness. 

I sat there for what felt like an eternity, staring at the single, shining tear decorating her face. Not all harm was physical, and my gift was trying to protect me.

It failed.

[WP] You have always had the ability of pausing time when you were about to be harmed and/or killed. You wake up one morning to see that everything is paused.,Twhylight,"I opened the front door. The snowflakes suspended in the air melted upon contact as I batted them out of the air. 

Candice was frozen mid tumble from her stoop; the heel snapped on her shoe. I toppled the snowman that occupied the yard and planted her on the pile from its remains. I'd be the lowest of the low if I didn't stop her from snapping her neck on the pavement.

After spending days wandering and foraging for supplies, I found a leather bound journal. I wrote to sustain a sense of time. With the frozen clock faces and the stilled sun, keeping track of the days would be impossible.

Day 1 - 
I've decided to label each new entry as its own day. I suppose that technically, regardless of what I write, it'll always be ""day 1."" 

I've torn apart my home looking for the source of the danger causing this freeze, but I've had no luck. I suspected there was a gas leak, but there was nothing of note to indicate danger.

Day 2-
After walking until my flat feet ached, I am resting. I'm no thief, but a man has to eat. I started twisting doorknobs until I found an unlocked house. I ransacked the refrigerator until my bag was full, and left forty on the table. I have more important things to do than consider the ethics of theft, such as write in this stupid diary.

Day 3- 
I'm exhausted. I lack a sense of direction, but moving in a straight line should be enough. Everything's frozen in place as always. Whatever is threatening my life is large enough to cover half of the town. Perhaps I don't understand my power like I thought I did?

Day 4- 
This should probably be day twenty-nine, as I forgot I had this stupid thing. I should be diligent about recording my thoughts. I need to keep some sort of sense of time. My power has to be broken. I've moved completely out of the city, yet everything is still. The alternative is a mass disaster, but I've seen no signs to prove it. The sky is cloudy, but I'm pretty sure that won't kill me. I don't see a meteor dropping out of the sky, or Godzilla stomping through the city.

Day 5- 
I forgot to update my journal again. I tripped over a fucking some tiny fucking dog that I didn't see. My leg is definitely broken. I'm sitting in a doctor's office. I was able to set my leg the best I could after studying the books this rich fuck has. He has enough novels to last however long it takes for this shit to heal. I really hope that it does heal. I shoveled some Vicodin down my throat, along with the antibiotics I found. I'm so fucked if my leg gets infected.

Day 6- 
My leg is better. It healed fast, without infection. I guess microbes are stopped along with everyone else. I've read every book on the shelves, but I shouldn't take any risks to hunt down more material. There's a Spanish textbook, maybe I'll learn a language to kill some time.

Day 7- 
Dear diary: fuck you. I wish you beeped to remind me to write. When this stops, there are going to be a lot of surprised people. Water doesn't run, so they're going to find a shit in every toilet in this neighborhood. My legacy will be that of the phantom shitter: a villain that breaks into houses just to fill a toilet. Fear me, mortals.

Day 8- 
I'm so lonely.

Day 9-
I was tempted to take advantage of a very attractive redhead jogging at the park. I feel really guilty for even entertaining the idea. She'd probably never know anything had happened after cleaning her up, but I'd know I did it. I wouldn't be able to sleep at night, even though night never comes. I miss seeing the stars.

Day 10-
Fuck it. I had some fun at the strip club. Those sluts probably would have consented if I flashed a twenty. I cleaned them up, they won't know. 

Day What the Fuck Ever-
I'm a fucking god now. Everyone does as I command, seeing as they have no choice. Fuck em, I deserve whatever I want. I've suffered enough to deserve a little respite.

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck

[WP] You have always had the ability of pausing time when you were about to be harmed and/or killed. You wake up one morning to see that everything is paused.,Twhylight,"**Entry 1**:
	This morning I woke up and time was frozen. It's happened before but it's the first time that I didn't know why it was happening. Nothing in the immediate vicinity it seems. I guess today's going to be a long day.

**Entry 2**:
	Strange. I usually find the source of the freeze by now or it resolves it self. I took my time checking for small things but this might be something bigger. Given the current state of the world I don't think it'd be something nuclear, but I'd better check just in case.

**Entry 3**:
	This is kind of freaking me out. Phew. It's ok. I'll be ok. I'm always ok. Luckily I don't need to eat or anything but it's not that great being frozen for long periods of time. Things get weird. Especially all the frozen people. I keep expecting them to suddenly start moving again but they don't. I hope things go back to normal again.

**Entry 4**:
	It's never going to end. I must have pissed off the wrong person, or the wrong god. Something, or someone, clearly has it out for me. Or maybe I was supposed to die in my sleep. Like an aneuryism or something. Haha that would be crazy. Haha. Crazy...

**Entry 5**:
	WHY

**Entry 6**:
	Please make it start.

**Entry 7**:
	It must be because of my sins. All those people I took advantage of. All the things I could've used my power for and didn't. It's just divine retribution. I must atone for my sins. All of them.

**Entry 8**:
	I DONT GET IT. I HELPED EVERYONE I KNEW. EVEN THE PEOPLE I BARELY MET! WHY?! WHYYYYYYYY?!

**Entry 9**:
	I've done it. And yet nothing. All those days, or year, or however long I spent wandering the god forsaken earth. WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME? Please. I'll do anything. Just make it start again.

**Entry 10**:
	I thought I was born with a magnificent gift. Immortality with the ability to change the flow of the world. How foolish I was. This is a terrible curse. I'm cursed to spend eternity unable to die and unable to live. Stuck in this world between worlds.

**Entry 11**:
	I am not the first. Nor will I likely be the last. I am simply the next bearer of the flame. I never would have guessed but this explains so much. How life can grow at such rapid rates. Once I finish my research I will finally understand.

**Entry 12**:
	This will be my last entry. After this entry I will include my research thus far. But first I must explain to you what has happened to me.

**Theory 1**:
	My ability is not connected to death or harm. It is greater than that. It is ""regret"". But it isn't just personal regret, it is a universal regret.

**Theory 2**:
	I am not just my body. I am a collective representation of what is known as humanity. I represent the desires and hopes for the future. Perhaps a bit pretentious but I can't consider myself merely human given this ability.

**Theory 3**:
	My purpose is to bring forth the next era. To solve the next big leap into the future given humanity's current knowledge.

I only hope that I am correct.

If I wait till the next day, I simply miss out on one rep, one practice session. 

The thing about creative work is that you rarely have an accurate gauge of how your audience will respond to your work. Some studies show that quantity beats quality in growing your skill. Songwriters can spend years on a ""masterpiece"" (and possibly hear crickets when they finally launch) or focus on pushing out a volume of work consistently and let the audience tell you what worked or didn't. I did not expect to garner over 20 upvotes for this story, but that's what fellow Redditors are telling me so far.

[WP] You have always had the ability of pausing time when you were about to be harmed and/or killed. You wake up one morning to see that everything is paused.,Twhylight,"I have to disagree with you on that one. Imagine it this way. You're rushed for time and eventually have to handle difficult problems in a rushed and messy way. Does this help you write 'better' code compared to sitting down the next day and doing it properly? Likewise, in music, is learning to play an instrument wrongly good? It results in you having to relearn properly later, if you do it too much (and in this way I can use your argument against you). You do too much of something badly and eventually it is so ingrained in your mind that naturally you do it badly.

And I agree that in creative work you rarely get a chance to accurately assess what the outcome of your work will be, but most musical geniuses didn't start out trying to become rich and famous. Many do, but they fail. It's the ones who do what they do because they love it and the ones who make sure that everything they do is good (mostly, you can look at EA who make crappy games but still are doing pretty well). It's a love in what you do which helps you get better, not arbitrary numbers on the Internet.",thinkeleven_

"[WP] You have always had flies follow you around, after a while you realised why they did. You were Pestilence, one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.",Twhylight,"*smack*

Todd withdrew his hand to see that he'd fully crushed the fly against his forearm. He'd gotten pretty good at it. The flies had been following him his whole life. He used to think it was normal, just a product of growing up around his family cattle farm. Cowpies sure attracted flies.

But then he started going to school. And the flies kept following him. And the children teased him and called him Pig-Pen after the Peanuts character. So he committed to killing all the flies. And he killed and killed and killed, but they just kept coming back. There seemed to be an endless supply.

He never made any friends. No one liked the flies. Everyone assumed he had poor hygiene, they made that clear enough in their taunts. He scrubbed religiously, and that didn't work. He sprayed any number of store bought and homemade remedies, guaranteed to kill flies. And they would, but then the flies would be back soon enough. And all the poison in the air around him started to make him sick. So he went back to handswatting.

He could never hold down a job. How could he? His bosses would always make excuses, they never wanted to say ""Hey Todd, we are firing you because you have all these flies around you."" But he knew. He knew. And he'd resigned himself to a solitary life on the cow farm.

Until yesterday. Where before he'd never had much more than a dozen or so flies circling around him, he woke up last Saturday with his room absolutely *full* of them. Thousands, tens of thousands even. When he left the room in horror, the cloud of flies followed him, growing by the minute. Panicking, he ran out of the front door and smack dab into a man who'd been about to knock.

From the white collar and black shirt, Todd could tell he was a preacher of some sort. He'd never had much use for all that. He stammered an apology and helped the man to his feet. Just as they were dusting themselves off, the cloud of flies came out to greet them.

The preacher yelped and jumped backward off the porch, stumbling again. He pointed a quavering finger at Todd.

""*You. You are--*"" he whimpered.

""I am what? Pig-Pen?"" Todd bellowed. He didn't socialize much these days. ""I admit this is a bit above average for the flies, but I'm a human being, dammit!""

""You are Pestilence, a horseman of the Apocalypse.""

""Pesty what?"" Todd hadn't gone to church very often as a child, and they understandably avoided the chapter of Revelation the few times he did go.

The preacher reached into his coat pocket and flipped the pages to the back. Finding his place, he read.

""I looked, and there before me was a pale horse! Its rider was named Death, and Hades was following close behind him. They were given power over a fourth of the earth to kill by sword, famine and plague, and by the wild beasts of the earth."" The preacher closed the book.

""You are pestilence. There is no other possibility."" Todd's confusion turned to anger and then to rage.

""You come onto my property and insult me?! How dare you? I don't care if God protects you, you can get the hell off my farm!"" Todd pretty much only bellowed at people these days.

But to his horror, for the first time in his life, it was as though the flies *listened* to him. And with his anger, they formed into a tight ball, a dense cloud of undulating blackness, shimmering, pointing at the preacher. And the cloud finished gathering. And rammed themselves down the preacher's throat. They covered his whole body, tearing at his flesh, his eyelids, his throat. In seconds, the preacher collapsed, coughing and sputtering. In seconds more, he was dead. In seconds more after that, the cloud of flies withdrew, leaving no trace of the preacher in their wake. Todd vomited.

When he recovered himself, he looked back up at the flies. They had formed themselves again into a dense cloud, shaped like a person. They beckoned him. They pointed to his car. He got his keys and coat. No sense in pissing off the flies now, not after what he'd just seen. The cloud of flies got into the passenger seat. For a moment he considered telling them to put on a seatbelt, then he reconsidered. He left his farm, and the flies pointed directions along the way.

That had all happened yesterday. A thousand miles later, the flies had finally pointed him to his destination. It looked like a broken down warehouse on a wharf on the coast of New Jersey. The flies beckoned him in.

Inside was a vast emptiness, save for three people standing together chatting in the middle of the room, and then a collection of moving things around them that he couldn't really make out. They cut off their conversation when they saw him.

""Hi, I'm Todd,"" he said disarmingly. He raised his hands to his chest palms out. ""I don't really know why I'm here. The uh-- the flies brought me here,"" he finished, sheepishly.

""I think I might be Pestilence?"" The faces he saw relaxed.

""Ah, we've worked out that you might be missing!"" Said one as he stepped forward. ""I'm-- um-- the sword, I think."" When the man waved his hands around, several daggers and swords and other blades whirled around him, but didn't strike any of the others.

Another man waved. Several animated skeletons that surrounded him waved with him. ""I'm death, I think.""

The third man stepped forward, and there were many wild creatures that surrounded him. ""I'm the guy in charge of the wild beasts!""

They shook hands with the newcomer. Todd smiled. They were the first people in years to not be revolted by his flies.

""So, uh, what exactly is going on here?"" He asked. At that moment, a door slammed behind him.

""What a terrific question!"" Said the man who walked in then. ""This world is just a disaster, don't you think? A bunch of losers and morons. But we are gonna make it great again! With your help, of course.""

The four men looked at each other in confusion.

The drums were pounding again, pounding and pounding and pounding.

With scarcely a moment's respite, the band began to play a different sort of song. Noone knew the words, but Catelyn knew ""The Rains of Castamere"" when she heard it.

'And Who are you, the proud lord said, that I must bow so low...'

Yet as soon as she heard that, it was interrupted by...another noise, some wretched sound from outside the door, it was...yes, it was music, but not like any song she had ever heard, and it wasn't coming from the band. Then it happened all at once, a song louder than anything that was humanly possible, and everyone, Starks, Tullys and Freys alike covered their ears, but it was so loud that they could feel the drums pounding in their stomachs. She took her hands off of her ears for one moment...

'What is this noise?' Walder Frey shouted, but nobody could hear his words over the words of this new song that surrounded them...

Catelyn listened, it was a man, not singing, but...growling words over what sounded like trumpets and drums. He was telling them to listen...

'It's what you hearin. listen'
'It's what you hearin. listen.'
'It's what you hearin. listen.'
At that moment 

That's when Catelyn was tackled to the floor, as the music became louder and faster, and the growling man began shouting

*X GON GIVE IT TO YA*

The man who had tackled her shouted in her ear. 'Stay down!' he shouted

There were loud pops, flashes of bright light and screams from all over the room

*KNOCK KNOCK OPEN UP THE DOOR IT'S REAL*

From the corner of her eye, she saw Robb, also being shoved to the floor by a masked man dressed in all black. The music drowned all other sound except for the loud pops. The man shouted ""The band! The band! get the band first!""

*WITH THE NON STOP POP POP AND STAINLESS STEEL!*

She watched as the band members shook and flew into pieces, their instruments splintering along with their bodies as they flew apart in a red mist, their shoulders bouncing back and forth as if dancing to the rhythm of that awful noise.

*DAMN RIGHT AND I'LL DO IT AGAIN!*
*SO I AM RIGHT AND I GOTS TO WIN!*

The man who tackled her shouted in her ear again. She though that she recognized that voice.

*BREAK BREAD WIT DA ENEMY!*
*BUT NO MATTER HOW MANY CATS I BREAK BREAD WIT*
*I'LL BREAK WHO YOU SENDIN ME*

There was a loud crash, and a four wheeled machine burst through the doors, slamming into Roose Bolton and Black Walder, launching the latter across the room where he splattered against the steps at the foot of his father's chair. 

Roose Bolton was caught underneath the wheel. Steam rose from the sides of the machine as it began bouncing up and down, repeatedly slamming down on Roose Bolton's chest as four other men in the car started firing their strange weapons out the windows.

*FIRST WE GONNA ROCK, THEN WE GONNA ROLL*
*THEN WE LET IT POP, GO LET IT GO!*

""X GON GIVE IT TO YA, HE GON GIVE IT TO YA""
""X GON GIVE IT TO YA, HE GON GIVE IT TO YA!""

And just like that, the music stopped, and the man holding her down rose up, and lifted her up. He removed his mask.

""Ned?"" Her ears were ringing, she couldn't hear herself say it. Everything had all of a sudden become strange. The room was filled with a thin veil of smoke, and covered with dead Freys. These strange men in black shuffled through the room, observing the damage that they had done. The machine in the center of the room stopped bouncing and landed with a graceless thud on Roose Bolton's mangled Torso. A very handsome man emerged from the side and walked up to the front of the room where Walder Frey was cowering under his table.

The handsome man made grabbed Walder Frey, and with his incredibly toned biceps tossed him down the steps, the walked down and pressed his weapon to Walder Frey's forehead.

""Is this the book or the T.V show?"" he asked
Walder Frey sat dumbfounded, and shit his pants. There was a loud bang and his head exploded, an awesome looking streak of blood flew across the handsome man's face.

Robb Stark was sitting one of the tables, being attended to by two of the black clad men.

""What the hell is happening?"" he finally shouted, before turning and seeing Ned Stark, and staring dumbfounded.

The handsome man held up his hand, and the room fell silence with respect to his majestic presence.

Ned Stark turned and looked Catelyn in the eyes.
""I've missed you Catelyn, and you won't believe what my life has been like for the past few months""

The handsome man spoke,
""You probably have a lot of questions right now, I'll answer them in due time.""

""Yeah I have a question"", one of the black clad men shouted
""Yes quirky sidekick"", the handsome man replied.

""Do we really have to play that song EVERY time?""

""Umm, yeah, we do""

""Okay, I have another question"", the quirky sidekick said
The handsome man nodded and allowed the quirky sidekick to ask his next question.

""Doesn't this go against the prompt?""

""See, the prompt guy didn't explicitly say we *couldn't* bring guns, or speakers for that matter.""

The quirky sidekick scratched his head.
""Umm, right, well, how are we powering the speakers?""

The handsome guy shrugged ""The same way we saved Ned Stark, with like, magic and shit, I don't know.""

""Alright, one more question then...""
""Okay, shoot"",
""When we go east and meet Missandei...""

""Yeah that's still going down"". He stopped to think for a moment.
""Only if this is the show though"", he clarified, ""I think in the books she's like...eight, or something, so that would definitely be a no go."" 

As the handsome man continued his conversation with his sidekick, Catelyn turned to Ned.

""What the hell is happening Ned?""

Ned explained everything to Catelyn.

""Holy shit, that's incredible!"" Catelyn said, as Arya and Sansa Stark walked into the room with the Hound. Catelyn, Ned, and Robb are happy and shit blah blah blah, the handsome guy(Who am I kidding, I'm just going to refer to myself in the first person from now on) explains everything. Miraculously, none of the Starks died and there's not a damn thing that George RR Martin can do about it. After all of this I turn to the crowd and announce to them:

Season 1: 

I arrived in Winterfell as a lowly beggar, with nothing but the clothes in my back. I only had so much time to reach Ned Stark before he left for King's Landing. My only chance at this was to beg for a position in the castle, where I could watch the Starks. It didn't take me long to demonstrate my knowledge of history and lore t  Maester Luwin. Impressed, he declares me as his assistant. Before Ned Stark can head out, I use my leverage with Luwin to put in a good word with Lord Stark about my history and military skills (everything I learned from knowing the story ahead of time). I use Luwin's worry about Lord Stark going to King's Landing as a way for me join them, by promising Luwin that I would look after Neddy boy. I spend most of season 1 trying to convince Ned that I am a suitable advisor, warning him about the debacle with Sansa, Joffrey, Arya and butcher's boy. I also tell Ned I know Jon's parentage and convince him I am a magic man. Right before Varys sends his little birds to kill Dany, I tell him about Jorah's betrayal. I also tell King Bobby B about it and ensure that Dany dies with her baby. I wait until everything else happens (the fight between Ned and Jaime and King Robert's death) and warn Ned about Littlefinger right before he uses the City Watch to seize power from Cersei. I convince Ned to ask for Renly's help, but tell Renly to kill the Queen and Joffrey in their sleep. I tell Ned to let Renly go because he will crucial for the peace of Westeros (a half lie but it doesn't matter since Ned thinks I am a magic man).

Season 2: 

Ned has called Stannis to take the Iron Throne. I let Renly go to rebel and garner support from the Tyrell. I convince Ned to stay in King's Landing to deal with the angry Lannisters (with Tywin still coming in from Riverrun and joined by Tyrion after he was inevitably saved by Bronn). Previously, after Jaime found out that Renly hack-and-slashed his sister and nephew-son, he tried to kill him. I tell Littlefinger I know of this schemes and use his help and the City Watch to chop Jaime's head off. I scare the piss out of him by telling him I know he murdered Jon Arryn with Lysa's help. Now, Tywin is losing his shit and charging for King's Landing, while Stannis has already arrived. At this point, Ned is pretty pissed at me for all the murdering and wants to lock me up since he does not believe in my magic man skills anymore. I run to Stannis the Mannis with my tail between my legs and tell him about how Neddy boy wants me dead. I gain Stanny's protection because I use Melisandre to convince him. I convince Melisandre about my magic man powers by telling her I about her rubies and how old she really is and that she has no clue who the true king will be. Littlefinger uses this Ned's suspicions about me to regain Ned's trust but I send a message to Catelyn to come to King's Landing and that Littlefinger was the one who killed Jon Arryn (since she would not believe that Lysa would do it). I emphasise this by telling Catelyn that Tyrion never bets against his brother and that knife that was meant to kill Bran belongs to Littlefinger. I also urge Varys to back my claims, by telling him I know about his dealio with Illyrio. I use Catelyn's story to get Ned on my side and use them both to have Stannis execute Littlefinger. Meanwhile, Tywin is gathering his forces, and so is Renly and the Tyrells. The Greyjoys are doing fuckall. The Wall is still under the threat of the walkers. 

Season 3:  

I let Melisandre use her magic to kill Renly, so now it's just the Tyrells and the Lannister against Stannis, the Starks and the rest. I leave their destruction to Stannis since he has a capable commander. 

Season 4 and the ending: 

Tywin and Tyrion are dead at this point, since Stannis has barrelled through them. Now, the only houses left to conquer are the Tyrells (whatever remains since they most likely surrendered before getting destroyed), the Starks, the Greyjoys, the Arryns (honestly it's just the Vale), and Stannis (plus Davos and Mel). Becoming Stannis's most trusted advisor, I almost rule the throne. 


I know this was sort of anti-climactic, but I honestly didn't know what I could do after putting Stannis on the throne. It would be very hard to raise an army on my own. Also, I know I made some generous assumptions about what would happen to me. But I had to in order to do justice to the prompt.

I would never understand why they chose to build Washington DC in this god forsaken muggy swamp. SetsWithTheSun had long since gone. The Tribal Elders had long since elevated me to Chief. Now I was about to watch my eldest daughter and my eldest son as Captain and First Mate depart in a warship that could submerge beneath the sea. Now we had a Molten Salt Reactor Nuclear submarine that could move at 20 knots underwater. 

The **CWS Kraken**. 

It felt sort of bad reverting to old war novels from my youth for naming conventions, but by the same token much of the Tribe had been speaking English as a primary language for twenty years, because they could both read and write it. Our nation was the best armed, most peaceful, most literate, most capable one on the planet. 

Many of the neighboring tribes had joined our Confederation. Chippewa mercenaries were sought after, for they were the best trained and understood how the new weapons worked. My home was secured, and the realization of all of the other tribal elders of what would fall upon our world in eventuality would unite them. Dissenters, I would find later, were murdered in their sleep. 

When I brought up my dissatisfaction to the elder council about this, I was met with open palms. ""A bad seed that is allowed to grow poison, is a seed that will continue to bear rotten fruit."" I can only recall extreme discomfort with this, and mumbling something about the Gulag.

HE 11064

Now I rest every day. I have grown far older than I could have imagined. The pox took very few when we began giving out the vaccine fifteen years ago. My eldest son amongst them. My daughter now leads the people with the full backing of the elder councils. Our Krakens patrol the high seas to keep outsiders away, and I write this on my now 65 year old Surface Book, plugged into an AC Power adapter. Only because I took so cautious care of it did it survive so long, of course.

The best of our achievements is that not a single individual outside of the Continent hidden between the high seas knows of us. Knows of me. Knows what we have done. Our assassins have long since killed off others that survived the jump back in time, though they were admittedly few. One was murdered by religious zealots as was expected. The poor bastard. His laptop was recovered, albeit in pieces. That object jump started my nation's ability to produce circuitry. Another was recovered in the same region. I nearly died of a heart attack when it was powered on. Of laughter of course. Not that our society was overly concerned about that sort of thing. Sexuality was just sexuality for us. 

Other laptops would be recovered as ""holy relics"" from the less red-skinned offspring of mine that could infiltrate European society, and their stories added to our own books. It seemed that many of their former masters had very similar fates bound in power struggles and ego. They would all eventually be housed at the museum, once they had been fully tinkered with and researched and replicated.

Poor bastards.

The new Golden Age coming out of the Muslim lands was monitored carefully. Dogma would slow them down, and that was enough for us. My youngest son wants to travel to the stars. We have over twenty years of Molten Salt Reactors vetted, and he found the initial information for the EM Drive. 

HE 11072

Air conditioning is nice. 
Somewhere the gods laugh at what is built here. At least those that see beyond the fourth dimension through time and space. I had thought hard about suggesting ""Cape Canaveral"" as the name, but elected to be a fanboy instead by calling it Cape Muskelon. Some of the more avid Wikipedia readers would get the joke, mostly those in the suddenly thriving space industry. 

The sound proofed glass did nothing to change the rumble in the ground as the rocket leapt from the ground. Elon would have been proud. Our presence in space started a year ago. So many failed rockets over the last five years. Failure after failure, but I was insistent on keeping the projects moving. The right events mix would find its way. 

A tear struck my eye as the rocket came back down to land without its payload and another was being wheeled out to another launch pad.

HE 11077

Didn't care if they think I'm too geriatric for this shit. Some asshole dumped me back in time before I could join the space program through NASA, or even SpaceX. Fuck them. Fuck their hats. And fuck whoever dropped me back a thousand years. 

The CSS Iron Spirit sits in orbit after it had undergone trials. Thirty thousand people live in orbit in glorious spinning stations for artificial gravity. I needed only to survive this trip on the rocket. And Jesus Crispy, that was not easy. They had to defibrillator-taze me in order to keep me alive after the initial shock. 

An honor guard of feathered head dresses, and earthen tones met me. The crew of the Iron Spirit was proud of its ship. My oldest Grand Daughter and my Great Nephew were in command. Tradition is a strange thing. Like the CWS Kraken before it, those of my name would Captain into the unknown. 

**Final Entry**

My name is Shikoba Of the Second Moonset. Rather, that's my earned name. Naturally, I have earned it. Like my grandfather earned his. It is a day of sorrow. We placed his body in a coffin and launched him into the sun where he can join the Sun Spirit and forever warm our hearts and minds with his generosity, his tenacity, his humanity, and his courage to fight through. My husband thought I might crack as I delivered his eulogy, but I held my resolve. 

In the seventy-seven years since he came to us, he has done so much for our people and for the world as a whole. We have all read the Wikipedia documents to some degree and bore witness to the inhumanity that he managed to escape. The terror that the world of the east is capable of. But we are a people of peace, and wish no ill will upon others. We could bomb the entirety of humanity on the eastern world to death with the flip of a switch. Kinetic strikes with rods of tungsten, without radiating the world. 

Could we? Yes. Will we.... no. Unless we're provoked. When the rest of the world finally decides that it isn't flat, and becomes too big for their pantsis--Grandfather said something to that effect at one point--we can rise right from the sea in our great underwater vessels, snap our fingers, and burn their ships with a sunbeam. It is all of our hopes that it will never come to that.

My cousin Tiriaq is working on plans to divert comets to the world of red, to build a second world for us, and allow us to venture further out still. All of the moons of the great giants are within our grasp. It is an amazing thing what was done in the time of a single life. It is amazing still what humanity in my grandfather's original time had failed to do in over a thousand. 

It is perhaps for the best that none of those people were ever born in the same world.

""Good morning, SpiritReader."" The old man put his hand upon my shoulder and gave it a squeeze. I looked up in shock. It was not the words, or the squeeze of my shoulder that put me in shock. It was his use of *my* native tongue. The language classes had paid off over the last few years. 

""Good morning, SetsWithTheSun. Is not today your birthday?""

""Yes."" He answered with a smirk. This man was older than any other tribal elder had managed to survive to, because of the courses I had convinced the tribe to take. Early on, many of the warriors found it an insult that I had begun taking a higher role in the tribe. Others had found it an insult that the more beautiful women would flock to me. Others still found it an insult that I would not take a wife.

Yet they could not ignore what I had single-handedly done to preserve their tribe while also preserving their traditions.

Using the Wikipedia database, I found information that led to iron ore mines in what might have been around Cleveland at some point in the future, and looked for coal deposits all the same. Within months, we had built a very basic foundry that allowed for more robust weapons, equipment, and eventually gear-based lathes, which would be part of the next phase of things.

I had requested an expedition of one hundred men to head to a place west of where a great river splits the land, and south of the Ouchita Tribe's lands. There, with some effort, they would find gemstones that were clear, but difficult to break. I would need as much as they could carry back. It took two years for them to return, and soon after their return, I had a diamond tipped lathe that would allow for rifled tubes. This would confuse them until I had fashioned a papyrus case of nitrite, sulfur, and salt peter with a shaped piece of lead. It was truly a basic thing when compared to the AK-47, M-15, or a Winchester 30/30. 

The warriors laughed at me when I asked to join them on a hunt for Buffalo with my hollow stick. That was until I felled the mightiest buffalo of the herd from a hundred yards in one shot. Shoulder was bruised for a month, and that was the first time I had realized just how difficult it was to get a proper balance. Too much black powder. Too heavy an object, but the shot had been lucky. It had torn right along the carotid artery on the buffalo's right side. 

The group of hunters was in shock. This example was all that was needed to ramp up production, take on assistants, and begin the construction on a proper building to house it all. The top of that building, a meager three stories tall, with steel beams holding it all together, was where SetsWithTheSun stood with me now.

""You are soon to be too old sire children. You will never be able to go home, SpiritReader. Even now with the changes you have made, your home will never even be constructed in how you know it. The other white men from across the deep sea to the east will never see you with their own eyes. They will know only that one of their descendants was handed to the Chippewa through means that not even you understand.""

""I was always a history buff, SetsWithTheSun. So many of my people were oblivious to the plight of the Tribes. They were oblivious to just how many of the Native Tribes were slaughtered so that they could push further across the continent for their own gain. Chippewa, Sioux, Iroquois, Black Foot, Ouchita, Cherokee, Sioux. The hundred nations of this land would all fall to their steady march. They would stamp out much of the people of this land, but the worst part is that they would do this not solely with weaponry and men, but plague.""

""This great plague will be cured by a man named Sir Edward Jenner. This plague is what stands the greatest chance of wiping this entire continent's people out. He will not be born for another 600 years. We do not need him to solve this problem. But we do need to cross the great ocean to the east, and steal cattle. Diseased cattle, to be specific.""

""You must have sons and daughters to pass the knowledge you have on. Not one of us understands Windows 10, nor do we know what happened to the previous 9. That is something that has riddled me, SpiritReader. What *did* happen to the previous 9? Are there more glowing machines out there in the world?""

His line of thought of this being the ""tenth Window"" was a thought had never dawned on me. What if I was not the only one to be transported back in time? ""It is a possibility,"" I finally responded. ""My heart tells me that there were at least five others. The worry is that they are in the old world doing much for them that I am for this Tribe and this side of the world.""

I might have been reading into it a bit too much, but if the Muslim's Golden age had been rekindled, that would not be a bad thing, so long as they kept their fanatics in check. Most of the Eastern and Western Europeans were just returning from the Dark Ages at this point. If someone had gone back in the Far East, such as China or Japan, that would have an interesting effect. 

""Only one way to find out. I will need many sons and daughters to carry out my work when I pass on. I must teach them all.""

Not going to lie. That was the most stupid thing I'd ever fucking said. But I had more pussy than I could even count for the next four years. Made some enemies amongst some women, but made some friends amongst the warriors, too. 

I did not choose my mates based upon looks like most would think. I evaluated them. I 'dated' them to some extent. Asked them questions of worldly wisdom. Asked them if they could do algebraic mathematics. One of them was both, and she was a deviant who liked to watch. With great intelligence goes other ...perks? Quirks?

""WatchesTheMoon"" was made my mate. Nine other women of the tribe were chosen by she and I for their intelligence, and other men's wives were brought into our house as equal partners. They would not bear my children, but they would treat mine as their own.

My children's lives would be written for them, unfortunately. Free time would be given, provided they attended their classes for mind, body, and spirit. They were expected to be the brightest. They were expected to be the strongest. They were expected to be the most civil, obedient, and friendly. They were expected to be deadly in all forms of interaction, and learn the basic tenants of every language available in the Wiki Database. Finally, each of them would be versed in how to read the machine.

It was his first time handling human cargo. Catamites, male youth who were either effeminate or who had been made into eunuchs. They wore opulent dresses, wore make up and wigs, and had their hands bound by silk. There is actually a rich tradition of homoerotic poetry in Arabic, Turkish, and Persian as well as a number of anecdotes involving rulers preferring pretty men instead of pretty women. While certainly not accepted, male homosexuality was tolerated under certain circumstances. The aristocrat that hired Hakim's services lived in a massive estate outside the city. It looked like a palatial complex complete with gardens, beautiful Andalusian architecture, and fountains. They were greeted by a servant outside the complex who ushered them forth. As the group arrived at the front gates, the catamites stepped out of the carriage and was given a quick review. They ranged from thirteen to nineteen years old and stood statuesque as the servant guided his hands along their bodies. 

""They look to be in good shape."" The servant said.

""They are in great shape."" Hakim responded.

""Well give me a moment to announce your presence to my lord."" 

Hakim turned to Cyp and began making conversation with him.

""Your sure that you do not wish to join us inside, Jibril?""

""Yes, I have a personal matter to take care of tomorrow.""

Hakim turned and looked at his stock. ""Have you ever thought about...""

""What sleeping with them or men? No, I never gave it any thought. I suppose that I should never say never, but I doubt I would anytime soon."" He then chuckled ""Although..."" The chuckled turned into near hysterical laughter.

""I can never tell when you are serious. You joke far too often.""

The massive doors to the estate parted and the servant gestured for them to come forward.

""I will see you at home, Jibril. Give my wife my love.""

Cyp climbed back into the carriage and made his way back to the merchant's home. The trip was quite enough. He listened to music with the aid of wireless earbuds and the laptop. He kept it hidden. He learned very quickly how to hide the device as well as how to hide his identity. He became a very good liar. Maybe at some point he thought about becoming some source of information that would dissimulate the secrets of the future. Maybe he thought it was insanely pretentious to think he would bring forth a new era. It would be foolish to naively believe that he wouldn't be viewed with suspicion. That an agent of change wouldn't be snuffed out. Crossbows and swords are still capable of taking his life. There was only survival, making a life here and coming to terms with it. The bitter loneliness, the lack of understanding. Missing small things like watching NBA games with his father or buying candy bars at the pharmacy. Homesick doesn't even begin to describe it. Had the incident changed his health? Would he one day be zapped back to the present? Suicidal thoughts crept into his mind from time to time. If it weren't for the presence of a few people in his life, he might be somewhere in a ditch either dead or homeless. That's the truth of it. 

In the context of the time, he would be considered a Mozarab, Christians under the rule of Sultanate. For the most part they were tolerated, and so they were allowed to govern themselves in their enclaves as long as they kept the order and paid the special poll tax. They formed a unique culture with a separate identity from the Christians to the north. Cyp saw the opportunities of being associated with them, and being able to interact with the community. So, he began researching them. He learned their language, dressed in their style, and started meeting with members of the community. Surprisingly, it wasn't just native Iberians who made up the community but also Christianized Arabs and Berbers. Hakim profited from Cyp's growing relationship with them. He even encourage Cyp to start attending mass with members of the local parish in order to foster the growth of clientele that wouldn't be accessible otherwise. He made it back home. Cyp had come to appreciate Mrs. Hakim's meals and the company of their children. To them he was a combination of a pet and some weird family member. He had a room to himself that used to belong to Hakim's father. Originally he spent most of his time in the room but now he was a fixture in the family. He took to tutoring the children or bringing them to mosque, freeing up their parent's time. In return they allowed him his privacy and a great deal of freedom. For example he was free to make decisions concerning the shop and free to ask permission to court a man's daughter. 

He made his way to the village market that he had landed at more than a year ago. Then he was dressed in jeans and a t-shirt. Now he wore a dull golden tunic with horizontal black stripes that came down to his knees and some simple brown leggings. He wore a heavy black winter cloak draped over his shoulders and boats with fur trimmings that came to his shins. There was no stall to work today but instead a potential business partner to meet. The older gentleman came with an entourage composed of his male relatives. The gentleman greeted Cyprian and took him along the path to their property. The journey was marked by idle conversation that focused on Cyp's background and his work. His assumed identity as a Mozarab played perfectly, and so they assumed that he was just a native Christian. The trip ended before it became an arduous journey and they were greeted by the younger members of the man's family and the women too. A warm smile crawled across his face at the sight of the family. He saw the two faces that may recognize him and wondered if they knew who he was.

""Now that the tour is complete come inside, dinner is waiting."" The old man said. 

""Thank you, sir, but..."" Cyp responded. 

""Nonsense, no one will leave hungry from Marwan's house."" the man responded. 

The men had gathered around a massive table. She and the rest of the women and the young ones left the men to discuss the business at hand. Murjan saw through the dress and the beard but her brother did not. The curiosity from a year ago was now sitting there eating lamb she helped prepare. Her mother reprimanded her for trying to spy on the men, but she ignored it. She stared at them with intent: every burst of laughter, every friendly pat on the shoulders, and every hint of tension. She heard his voice and took note of his improved Arabic. She felt an odd sense of pride, as if her discovery had taken flight. He caught glimpses of her snooping, but instead of turning away she maintained eye contact. Maybe he felt uncomfortable because his eyes would quickly dart elsewhere. Finally, she was noticed by her father and he sent her away. She joined the rest of the family in a small side room where her aunts and mother humored the children while gossiping. She hated being forced to listen to their idle chatter. Her self-pity, however, was snapped by the angry cries of her father. His voice was muddled by the competing voices and the walls, but she could make out the anger. 

""... Woman. Old ... court."" Jibril's muffled voice struggled to her ears.

""Not for the likes of you!"" 

Her father's voice boomed throughout the house. The shouting match grew. *Over me* she thought. Anxiety and anticipation welled in up in her chest. Her mother fell at her side wrapping her arms around her trying to comfort her. Instead, they felt restricting. The pressure continued to build and now tears streamed down her face. *Over me*. She had to go out there. She would dismiss his affections to make them go back to their previous jovial mood. She fought off her mother's grip and she rushed to the door. She could hear them clearer now.

""Sir, Sir, there is no need to touch..."" Cyp exclaimed.

His language switched as he raised his hands to fight off theirs. 

""Touch me one more fucking time and I swear..."" She saw the men of her family exchange puzzled glances after the outburst. 

Everyone's collective view fell on Murjan, who was now standing there. The tears that had fell from her eyes ceased, just the drying streaks that they left marked her face. Her father shouted for her to return to the room but she refused to budge. Cyprian then tried to excuse himself from the house, but he couldn't leave. A warm smile graced her face as she looked at him and he could only smile in response. The situation had calmed somehow. The women and children slowly stepped into the room, feigning ignorance. The men's anger dissipated and now shame took its place. Ashamed that they allowed violence to take hold. Marwan calmly composed himself on one of the cushions that served as a seat. He gestured for his brothers to take their families and their leave. He then called his family to join him. Everyone did as they were told leaving Cyp the lone man standing. As the last person left, Marwan looked to him and calmly said ""Jibril, sit.""

If I were in your position I can imagine trying to force out the rest of the novel, but it would be rushed and inconsistent, and the tone would have changed.

Ideally I would take a break and write something other than my novel. Something cathartic to try and find release. Then, when I'm ready to move on, I would come back to the novel. 

If you're not writing at all, perhaps try replying to some writing prompts first. You might find a passion for writing return.

[OT] Workshop Q&amp;A #9,madlabs67,"How do I overcome my crippling depression, laziness and procrastination to finish my novel? 

This journey started last November (2015) and it really all happened in one night. I stayed up all night and filled in a composition booklet cover to cover and was so excited about it. I had just graduated the high school the may before 

The next day my girlfriend revealed to me that she had slept with a mutual friend the night before and I told her I respected her honesty and maybe we can work this out. 

We went to a trampoline recreation establishment with some friends and she pushed me and I was already going to jump and landed on the divisions between the trampolines and I broke my leg.

Fitness was a huge part of my life at the time and I had just got done losing 100 pounds.

So the inactivity drove me insane, and the fact that she broke up with me 3 days after leaving me in the hospital with a broken leg and told me ""I just wasn't right for her.""

I'm not asking for any sympathy just asking if anyone else has had one year of their life where nothing has gone right and how they fixed it? 

I have incredible, interactive, and down right crazy dreams almost every night. No one understands them because they aren't in my head and it became a place over the past year where the only place I felt comfortable was asleep in my own head. Through out the day I would merely go through the motions. I want to finish my book and I feel like I've finally over come some of the demons amongst me.

[IP] Under a cloak of darkness,madlabs67,"A wall of wind pressed Jack, knocking his top hat away. In a pitiful attempt to reach for it, he stumbled off the cobble path. Tears were forming in his eyes as the stinging smell of sewage waft up his nose.

Still stumbling over for his hat, he wasn’t able to recover the scarf that covered his mouth and nose. Fully exposing his sinuses to the stench of the filth that harbored in the neighborhood.

“How thick can you be! I said five pounds for this ‘ere meat! D’you think it just grows on trees?” a man in suspenders yelled at the man across from him.

“Jonathan, we both know the quality of this ‘ere meat. It ain’t worth five pounds.” Jonathan was about to blow up at the man in a similar overcoat to Jack, but was interrupted by a hat blowing between them.

“What in bloody hell?” Jonathan exclaimed, tracing across to the hobbling Jack.

“My apologies my good men, I lost my hat and it had blown over ‘ere,” Jack apologized, swooping down for the hat.

“Oi, piss off!” Jonathan yelled kicking Jack in his side. Jack lost his cane and fell to the ground.

“Woah Jonathan calm down,” the man in the black overcoat said.

“Henry, I don’t need your bloody input!” Jonathan said without taking his eyes from Jack.

“I’ll be right on my way, if you’ll excuse me,” Jack said, grabbing his hat and cane. He wiggled on the ground like a snake.

“Ye there he goes Henry. See, all it took was a little physical persuasion.” Jonathan shrugged.

Jack crawled around the corner and picked himself up. Grabbing the cane and breaking off the tip revealing a sharp, recently oiled blade.

“Let’s rip them up, shall we Catherine?” An evil smile appeared on Jack’s face.",Henry_Shark
"[WP] You are a renowned hitman in the underworld. The thing is, you have never actually killed anyone, your targets just drop dead",mbartelsm,"*The money was so good how could I stop?*

That's what I say every time I imagine the conversation where I've been caught in the lie. Let me start again. My name's Tom and I'm one of the most well-known hitmen in the entire underworld. They call me The Reaper, you see. For two reasons. First, my targets drop dead seemingly from natural causes every single time. And second, the people in charge here are really unoriginal. I must be like the 8th Reaper out there, but now when they say the name they all mean *me*. 

I'd never given it much thought over the past 5 years why this arrangement has kept working but now that another well-paying contract has just been finalized (i.e. the morgue just announced my latest mark to be dead from natural causes) I'm starting to think about hanging it up. With not having actually spent any real money on gear or ammunition since my preparations for my first case I have 74 million reasons now to get a small bungalow in the Bahamas and retire. 

But the problem with thinking is that it gets you thinking. I go back to that first case. It was a simple one. Revenge on a private dick who outted Joey Scarponi's affair with his mistress. Mrs. Scarponi took everything that wasn't nailed down. Basically, everything but the poor shmuck's files, his gun, and his 20-year old daughter Angela. In fact, when Joey hired me that's pretty much all there was in his office. A desk, a filing cabinet, his gun on the desk unloaded, and his daughter in the corner smoking a cigarette. I always did think it was odd that he'd hire a fledgling hitman with his daughter in the room but who am I to question weirdo Italian mobsters, right? Anyhow, I had bought this pretty good but old sniper rifle from a friend of my uncle’s friend plus I had some piano wire for some up-close action. I was ready to rock and roll. But I never had to do anything. 

The second I took aim through the window and got the dick in my sites he just keeled over. Aneurysm they said. But I needed the money so I took credit. Said I slipped him something but wouldn’t reveal my secrets since clearly nothing showed up in the tox screen. Joey didn’t believe me and his daughter gave me that wry sexy smile of hers showing the same, but he gave me the money and another gig the next week. The guy was skimming and needed to be made an example of. I was behind him, about to pull the wires down on this creep’s neck and he seizes up. Grabs his arm, gasps, the whole nine. Heart attack. Once again, I took credit and got the money. Joey was still wary but he kept hiring me and the results stayed the same. Various deaths - natural causes. Sometimes brain, sometimes the heart, once a blood clot… nothing that made sense or raised any flags but always just as I was about to X the target. Over time Joey’s friends needed my services and they paid handsomely for it. I charged a lot more for them and gave Joey a small cut, a finder’s fee if you will. He and Angela seemed to like that. 

And now here I am. 5 years nearly to the day. In two weeks in fact. I’m standing outside the door to Joey’s non-descript office (he’d never bothered to refill it) and ready to tender my resignation. I raise my hand to knock and the door opens before I hit the wood. It’s Angela. I look past her and her father isn’t around so I look into her lush brown orbs, “Oh, hey Angela, is Joey around? I have to talk to him.” 
She smiled, amusement in those eyes, “Daddy’s taking a vacation for a week. He has one of his guys holding down the fort and I’m just watching the office. Come in Tommy.” She turns and saunters away, my eyes instinctively looking her up and down as she moved. She goes to grab for a pair of glasses and the scotch. I have a seat on the couch but choose to leave the door open just in case. I don’t want anyone seeing me come out of a closed room with the boss’s daughter, you know? Still standing before me, she hands me the glass and clinks it before she turns those teasing eyes of hers back to mine. “So where are we headed?” She asks conversationally.

I stammer suddenly, “What? Who’s *we*?” I feel like I stepped into the second part of a conversation and I’m missing some context. Her eyes remained locked on mine.

“We, are you and I, Tommy.” She said still smiling like she’s waiting for me to catch up. “We have what, roughly 70 mil waiting to be spent in retirement? Where are we going to spend it? You thinking the beach? Foreign metropolis? Some place with snow?”

I shook my head, stood up, and took a big sip of my scotch. “*I* am going to the beach, if you must know… maybe skiing in the winter, but mostly the beach. But you are not coming with me. I don’t even know you!”

Angela stepped forward and I stepped back and fell back onto the couch. She leaned over me, still standing. “You’ll get to know me. I know you. And besides, that money’s mine too.”

I blinked, I’m not the sharpest tool in the shed, I know that, but I honestly have no idea where she could get that idea. “How… do you figure that money’s yours, sweetheart?”

Angela’s smile fell to a flat line as she studied me. Then the door slammed. I turned and no one was there. And then the glass of scotch was wrenched from my hand but no one had touched it… it and its companion both floated easily over to the desk. The 25-year old then straddled me and came in close to whisper. “It’s ok, my love, just you and me. Daddy won’t care. He loves you like a son. And you won’t ever have to worry, I’ll keep you safe.” 

The blinds drew themselves and the lights turned out. And that’s when the story got really weird.

[WP] Karma turns out to be real but soon people have started to manipulate it to benefit from it,mein_lady,"The principle of karma is simple :
All actions have consequences, and the universe seeks balance. If you greet your neighbours nicely, they will greet you nicely. If you gift a lot of money, you will have a good day. If you are an asshole you will learn your lesson.

This was discovered some years ago. 
The world changed to the better. Most people were nice and caring, as they hoped to be rewarded by karma. 
The assholes, bullies, abusers vanished. They were the ones that had the accidents, the ones that ended up flipping burgers.
Paul was a bully. But he didn't flip burgers. Oh no.
He was smarter.
People became naive, after all karma dealt with the bad guys.
And Paul profited from that. Every time he told a little lie to enrich himself, he pinched himself. A little pain for a small lie. A cut for a big one. A broken arm for a malicious lie. 
Paul didn't care for the pain. He operated the biggest pyramid scheme in the history of mankind, spreading it on television and the internet. Little lies. Little cuts. Big money.
He was successful. He had good karma, it seemed.

"[WP] A new law was just passed, rappers can only rap about things that have actually happened to them",mojo45678,"I had prepared to host the local talent competition for months. Dancers, singers, and rappers galore had entered the contest for a chance to win the $10,000 prize. A few of the rappers dropped out of the contest when a new law banned rappers from rapping about things that have never happened to them, but several rappers remained.

Act after act, it became apparent that there was an abundance of talent in the room.  With just a few acts left, a 12 year old girl walked up to the microphone with her eyes on the floor. The crowd fell silent as she used her lyrics to take the audience away.

""Mommy please, this time won't you look in my eyes,
Hear the words that I'm rapping and know that they aren't lies,
The man you say you love and that makes you feel right,
Opens up my door in the middle of the night.

He covers my mouth, so I can't even scream,
He says to stop my crying, this is all just one big dream.
I'm not strong enough to stop him, but the one thing I know,
I know this isn't right, this isn't what I'm living fo',

I tried to tell you, that I need you on my side,
But you never listen, probably wouldn't care if I died. 
I'm tired of living, in the dark and when I'm scared,
I know I could move past this if I felt that someone cared.

You said I'm messing up, the life you want to live,
But why'd you put that on me, when you know I'm just a kid?
I'll do what you want, help you cook and help you clean,
Just don't let him find me, or he'll act pretty mean.

I'm sorry mom, I don't want to act this way,
But no matter what I do, you don't hear what I say,
I need some help out, and I need a place to go,
I need you now, I need my house to feel like home.""

She placed the mic back in the stand quietly, and her big brown eyes were pleading with a member of the audience. Finally she broke her gaze and came to the corner of the stage where I stopped her. I told her that we needed to talk and pulled her into a room to wait for officers to arrive. The officers sent me on to continue the competition while they talked to the young girl.

On the news the next night, I saw a story of a man and woman being arrested together. The man was charged with sexual conduct with a minor and the woman was charged with aiding in sexual abuse. I couldn't help but notice the woman had the same big brown eyes as the little girl that rapped at the competition the night before.

[WP] In the future humans obey their most visited website as their god. The world is on the brink of a religious war.,mushatazm,"It was 2 am in the month of December, 2042, and Dionaptus was not sleeping well. The heat was unbearable, his hair smelled of shrapnel, and his GoogAppleBook I-screen XII was alerting him of the updates in an ongoing argument between his two sisters.

Gallafreid was his closer sister. She was considerably younger than Dionaptus (he was 24, she was 16) but as far as he could tell, her head was being screwed on pretty well. As an avid Redditor, Gallafreid despised the heavy right-wingers who praised the emperor of Pangone, the Doland Trumphfaglogue, and all of his anti-Marsearth, pro-exoplanet views. She remembered the day the Doland ordered Mars and Earth to be squashed together in order for Earthlings to forcibly take over all supplies that belonged to the Native Martians. She remembered getting frightened PM's from Earth-Redditors who feared for her safety. She remembered the death toll of the Martians afterward. She remembered how a very close friend of the Doland's, Matt Damon, led the worst battle between Marsearth in which the Earthlings suffocated the Earth-Martians by breaking their oxygen tanks. As a native Martian, Gallafreid had nothing to fear from the oxygen death, but she had much to fear from the Earthlings' nastier destructive tactics.

Dionaptus's other sister, Winndalu, was 20 years old and had a very different view than her siblings. You see, when she turned 15, Winndalu's parents granted her a very special gift. They bought her a Goog-Facebook; the highest prestige of networking systems available. Having one represented lots of important things, and the information was available to all 3 star systems. For one, it meant you were very rich, because the monthly price of Goog-Facebook was basically a car insurance fee for a white male teen back in 2010. Also, it represented that you were someone who mattered. In any election, any store purchase, any Romatch, etc., your networking site would determine what you're eligible to do, buy, sell, for how much, or who you're eligible to meet. Anyone who wanted to become something had no hope without a Goog-Facebook.

According to Winndalu's parents, Dionaptus and Gallafreid were too far gone. They consumed leafstuffs, watched ""News Underground"", and were an overall disgrace to a Goog-Facebookian family. They supported Reddit, and Reddit meant very bad things to Facebookians. In a sense, it was much like the battle between Mars (and the other planets) and Earth. 

Although Dionaptus was a GoogApplebookitor, he despised much of the Facebookian realm. He despised their overwhelming ego, their impulsiveness, their undying desire for instant gratification, their sociopathic tendencies, and their moldy memes. He appreciated Gallafreid for deciding to let it all go and become a strict Redditor, but he knew that alone would not save her. He despised Winndalu and their parents, obviously.

Meanwhile, Winndalu had a secret. She knew what the Doland had planned for the future, and it did not involve any Googligans (or their fellow Applepes), Redditors, Twittles.. it did not involve anyone but Facebookians. No one other than the pure Facebookians themselves knew that their leading opposing superpower, the pure Googligans, turned their fortunes over for the 'promise' of cyberprotection. The clause was written in intelligent Bookian language, and specified a few things that eliminated the necessity of Googligans and their 1st star system neighbors altogether. But how could the Googligans know? They never could afford the top-tier schools that taught Bookian, and were always told it was a scam. They ate pears and drank mead and slept, completely unaware how bleak their future was.

Winndalu didn't even have a choice of whether or not to tell her family or friends about their fate, she didn't even get a chance to want to save them at all.
No one except pure Facebookians could know.. see, as soon as you purchased a full pure year of Facebook and were deemed to be ""Platinum"" under the Facebookian WatchYou program, not only did they pay for your cosigner's life, but they recruited you into their own Faceforce. No one, Facebookian or Non, knew of Facebook's ability to control your every breath. Blink. THOUGHT. No one knew. The FaceArmy was well underway, and the best benefits known to man were available if you would only unknowingly help them recruit, the way Winndalu's parents did for her.

Since your first child was born last week, 11 people have tried to kill you, and you have no idea why.",ncalder17,"He is born late at night and with one eyebrow.  Not with a single eyebrow stretching across the bridge of his nose, which is a common thing, but with a single eyebrow over his left eye and only bare skin over the right.  Other than that peculiarity, he is born perfect, and so Mura names the child Akki, after her father, since he is a bastard who will have no father of his own.

Mura returns to the whorehouse the next day.  She is in debt to the butcher for the meat she craved while pregnant and cannot do without her income.  When she passes through the gate of Mighty Babylon, she hides Akki in a basket covered with bunches of the river grass that the women are known to use to wipe themselves with.  But the King's watchman is not fooled.  He hears the cries of the infant from inside the basket.  The watchman rips off the bunches of river grass and sees Akki, his tiny hands reaching out to shield the bright sun from his eyes.  Mura pleads with the watchman to let her pass, that Babylon is already full of the bastards of whores and nobody will notice one more.  The watchman reaches down and he strokes Akki above the right eye, where his eyebrow is missing, and then he recoils, realizing what Mura does not know about her own son.  The King's watchman lets the mother and son into the city, where the Law applies, and Mura cries and thanks him before vanishing into the market.  

The watchman immediately presents himself at the temple of the Gods, where he tells the priests' assistant that a bastard child with one eyebrow has now just entered the walls of Mighty Babylon.  The priests' assistant rings the bells to summon the priests from the Holy Room and demands the watchman make his report again.  There is no doubt among any of the men: the child is Agmarbat, reborn.

The first killer comes while Mura soaks her feet.  She has not washed her feet since she walked to the river while in the early throes of labor.  As she soaks, she allows Akki to suckle and she touches his cheek with her thumb and she feels deeply in love with him.  The killer comes with a dagger, but she sees him as he lunges.  Mura kicks up the bowl of water that soak her feet.  She screams and runs toward the hearth, where strong men sit with other whores on their laps, eating nuts and drinking wine.  When the killer sees the men and hears the iron of their swords, he escapes the whorehouse into the night.

The second killer comes while Mura lays in bed, cradling Akki and singing to him.  But now Mura has been warned and she clutches a sharp duck feather, tipped with serpent’s poison, and she puts it through the assassin's throat before he can attack.

Nine killers come for Mura in the morning, when she leaves to seek out answers.  They are waiting for her on the road in front of the whorehouse, all wearing chest plates with the seal of the Temple.  They surround her with long spears.  Mura kisses Akki on his head and whispers for him to be calm.  A spear moves toward Mura’s flank, but then Akki lets out a wail and lightning comes from the sky and strikes the spear, setting it on fire and snapping it in two.  The other spears thrust at Mura all at once, and though Akki still cries and lightning strikes many of the spears, the others cut into Mura's ribs and she falls to the ground.  One of the killers takes Akki from her arms, and Mura dies.

The killers bring Akki to the priests, who strip him naked and cover him in oil.  They declare that they have killed the mother of the child in the name of the Temple, and that, as a bastard, he has no father.  Therefore, the child is hereafter the ward of the Temple.  They recite a prayer and name the boy Agmarbat, the child of the rain, who will reclaim Babylon, the gods’ city, from its profane and mortal King.

Since your first child was born last week, 11 people have tried to kill you, and you have no idea why.",ncalder17,"""I don't know where to begin, in all honesty. Maybe with a bottle of wine?"" I laughed shakily as my counselor sat opposite me, notepad at the ready and wearing the inquisitive look I was so familiar with. I had been seeing Dr. Kyran for years, ever since I was fired from my first job. He had helped me through good and bad, but nothing like this.

""Look, Brayden, I can't stop you from doing this. I have no right to prevent a citizen from doing something legal, since the first one is the only legal one. I can, however, attempt to dissuade you. But I suspect this visit is more of a double-check than a cry for help."" Peter's dark blue eyes bore not only into my eyes, but also into my soul; he knew me better than I would care to admit.

I sighed, giving up hope on the bottle of wine I had suggested. We were both plenty rich, seeing as he was a counselor in a world where everyone was given one free murder, and I was a surgeon who had been laid off for a matter of months before being picked up by an even better practice. A bottle of wine was little to us, so I knew that his negligence to my offer was either a calculated one or an ignorant one. ""Look. You know me. You know I know human anatomy like the back of my hand. I'm basically a real-life Stephen Strange here. I'm sure you know that whatever I have planned *is* going to work. While it seems it would be more logical that I came here for moral reasons, however, I did come here for a double check. Because there's one thing I'm really concerned about that I'm sure no one has ever thought of.""

Peter leaned a little bit, took a few notes and adjusted his glasses in an attempt to decode my body language. ""Well, if you're the first to think of it, you might as well enlighten me, because you have already assumed I have no clue."" 

I drew in a sharp breath before letting loose my explanation. ""Everyone knows about the adoption rule. Just like everyone knows about the attempt rules, and of course the strange and unusual punishment rules. But, as I'm sure you know, Lleyton was born last week. Grace has been extremely protective of him, not even leaving the house. He hasn't even been alive for two weeks, and every day since, someone has tried to kill me. I don't know what they want from Lleyton, and they won't give me answers. I can claim self-defense all I want, but I can't kill them, and I can't gain any information without it being torture."" My words were jumbled, a mixture of worry, excitement, and nerve rushing my speech.

Peter blinked a couple of times, then nodded slowly. He understood my predicament. ""You are going to have to tell me your plan then, Brayden. I can't see how you can possibly get away with killing 11 men and passing it off as one.""

""The ultimate goal is to arrange an accident for each and every one of them. Non-lethal, of course, so that they are brought to me, in surgery. I am well certified to be in the operating room, and this way I can ensure their deaths without having to play a role in murdering them."" I paused for effect, letting Peter digest what I had just said. ""I already have hitmen hired, people who haven't had their first kills yet, that are willing to do non-lethal damage and be credited with the kill, even though I do it myself. My question is, do you think what I'm doing is right?"" I continued to look him in the eyes, watching his shocked expression turn to an incredulous one, then back to shocked, and finally to contemplating. 

After a long pause, Peter finally spoke. ""It's doable. Like I said, I can't stop you. And, I'm bound by law to not tell anyone what is said inside this room. If you want to pull a total Heisenberg, by all means, be my guest. But I'll leave you with this thought. How much do you love Lleyton? Is he really worth this much risk? The boy is nearly two weeks old, wouldn't it be better to give him up for adoption to preserve your life? It seems rather obvious that they want the boy for what he is, not trying to kill you for something you did. Just ask yourself: *is this worth it?*""

I looked Peter square in the eye, mustered the most force I could, and put it all into one word. ""Yes.""

I stood up, grabbed my coat off of the chaise in the corner of the room. Just as I had my hand on the door, ready to leave and pay his receptionist, Peter cleared his throat. I stopped, and he asked, ""What is it that makes this boy so special, anyways?""

I didn't even turn around. I muttered the answer, barely audible to my own ears, but judging by the gasp that escaped Kyran's lips, he had heard me. I turned the ornate handle and left the room.
***
That night, Peter Kyran sat with a goblet of wine in one hand and a TV remote in the other, lounging in his favorite recliner. But, as he flicked through the channels, his mind could only focus one on thing. The parting words he had with Brayden Rollins still rang in his ears like he had heard them seconds ago.

*""I never had sex with Grace.""*

If people really believed that Brayden's son was the second coming of Christ, then Brayden had a lot more deaths to arrange. Kyran downed the last of his wine, turned off the TV, and dozed off to the thought of his best friend being the second father of Jesus.",Connnorrrr

"[WP] A bachelor is discovered to have a rare mutation that would make all of his offspring geniuses, physically beautiful, and nearly immortal. His DNA becomes the most valuable substance on earth.",red498cp_,"""Er, Dr. Tate.... where are we going?"" I asked.

Dr. Tate had grabbed me from my office and insisted that I needed to come with him. He was a nice guy. Older than me by a lot, probably handsome when he was a lot younger, hispanic... bearing the comfortable weight of a man who could afford to eat good but still cared for his health enough to not eat TOO much.

""Well, Dr. Halt, Jeremy... I think it's time I showed you something you won't believe,"" he replied, not looking at me. He just kept staring ahead, a small, confident smile on his face.

""I've worked here for two years, sir. I don't mean to be rude, but I think I've seen just about everything in the building - unless you happen to be hiding a gentleman's club in the sub-basement with the boiler.""

He chuckled softly.

""No, no, Jeremy. We hide our business beneath the sub-basement,"" was his simple reply. My heart skipped a beat. I had to keep it cool, though, not freak out.

""Sorry, what? What do you mean?""

""A lab, Jeremy. A laboratory containing a fantastic secret. We have a number of secret projects down there, all related to one extremely important thing. I can't say more up here, but... I wish you to work on one of these projects,"" he told me. We reached the elevator, stepped inside. He pressed the bottom most button, the sub-basement button - once, twice, three times. The light blinked strangely. The doors shut. I was tense. 

""Why me?""

""You're not the most brilliant, my friend - but you are loyal, you work harder than anyone here, and you have a powerful thirst for knowledge that I respect immensely. We've grown to be friends I think, in the workplace at least. I trust you. Your ideas are creative, as well, and while not always successful... they are valuable,"" he told me.

""If you're going to propose, sir, I recommend the roof and not the sub-basement. Far nicer view up there,"" I joked, nervously. I wasn't used to getting complements. 

""And you're funny, can't forget that,"" he told me, laughing.

I laughed to, relaxing a little bit.

""Well, sir. I'm not pretty, so I gotta be something.""

More laughing. That was good. The rest of the ride was silent, frighteningly silent. I watched the number panel as we reached the sub-basement - and then the elevator kept on fucking going. I swallowed anxiously.

""Sir, when these doors open, are there going to be a bunch of men with guns who will shoot me execution style after you put a black bag on my head or something?"" I asked, babbling in my best anxious tone.

He snorted.

""God, no. Will you calm down. There are guards down here, of course. Forty of them, heavily armed, highly trained - some with psychokinetic training, even. They won't hurt you. Just stay with me until we get you a security pass and you'll be fine - and if not, they'll just detain you for a time until I can come let you out,"" he told me. I tried to relax. It didn't work. My heart was racing. I was shaking.

The doors slid open and we stepped out into a sort of antechamber that was clearly present for security purposes. Several armed men in balaclavas and damn goggles watched us as we made our way to some lockers on the wall. They had assault rifles. Big assault rifles. Very futuristic looking hardware, let me tell you.

Very murdery, too. 

Disturbing.

""Strip down and put your things in there. You can keep your underwear,"" he told me. 

Intensely uncomfortable, I slipped out of my clothing, opened the locker in question, and stored it all inside. We then awkwardly walked past the guards, through a door into a hallway that was clearly made for scanning us - glass walls, odd machinery behind them.

""Hold still, please,"" a female voice said, over an intercom. The door ahead of us and the door behind closed. A bizarre tingle ran over my body. It was most noticeable on my right arm. I tried to ignore it, closing my eyes and breathing slowly. Finally, the female voice returned, saying, ""all clear. Please move forward and put on your jumpsuits, coats, gloves, and boots. Remember to tuck your gloves into your wrist cuffts and please ensure your leg cuffs are tucked into your boots. Thank you for your compliance.""

I frowned.

""Is that an AI?"" I asked.

""Good catch. How could you tell?""

""Well, she's a bit stiff, frankly. Voice sounded just a tiny bit too synthetic - the cadence was off, just slightly, I think,"" I answered, as we moved forward. The doctor cast me an impressed look.

""I see. Yes, Ivy is an AI. She's highly limited, of course, totally restricted from all networks. She merely runs the facility and is kept hindered and unable to grow, as per safety protocols,"" he replied. That was surprising, to me. An AI was not a cheap thing to just have - but then again, they had a secret underground super lab type place. An AI was probably a drop in the bucket.

""She does maintenance?"" 

""Pilots numerous drones and mechanic spiders to keep everything working and maintain as clean an environment as possible.""

It made sense.

We wound up in another anti-chamber then, with tables lined with jumpsuits, lab coats, so on, so forth. I'll spare you the details. I got dressed, kept my leg cuffs tucked into the boots, sleeves into the gloves... put on the respiration mask and goggles, donned a damn hair net, slid into a lab coat. We then had to step into another small room to be misted with a sanitizer that stung on what little exposed skin I had. Even through the mask, it smelled like a chemical dump's alcoholic cousin - you know, the one that no one wants to invite to the Christmas party with the family, but who gets invited anyway BECAUSE they're family.

From there, we passed through an air lock and into a hall. There were a few halls branching off of it, a cafeteria area through an airlock, a break area through an air lock... 

And guards. A lot of guards, posted at every door. Each airlock appeared to be stocked with new masks and hair nets - and sanitization nozzles. The guards were wearing highly futuristic hazmat armor, fully sealed. Doors left and right were lined with offices, twenty in total, with people in eight of them. Five were empty. Beyond that, glass walls gave good views into laboratory areas for... I wasn't sure what. To find out what was going on, I'd have needed to go inside and look around more closely. I can say this - people were working in four of the eight lab areas. They looked real focused.

The hallway terminated in an obviously thick steel wall, with a steel door.

I kept my mouth shut and watched as the good doctor went through a retina scan, laid his hand on an infrared vein scanner so it could verify the map of the veins in his hand as well as his finger prints... so on, so forth. High security stuff, I tell you. Above the door, off to each side, there were thick metal plates set into the ceiling. 

Auto-turrets would drop out of those in the event of a threat, I was sure.

The thick steel door unlocked, with the sound of locking pins withdrawing. We stepped inside. 

I was awestruck. The room was filled with complex machinery - a lot of it. I mean, there were things in there I couldn't even visually identify, and all of it was connected to the underground lab's reactor (I assumed they had a reactor, of course.) by incredibly thick power conduits that snaked up the walls to the ceiling. In the center of the room was a tube. I stepped closer, staring at it. The tube was glass, filled with thick violet fluid. Inside of it, a male figure floated, eyes open and sparkling with the insanity of a man trapped in a horrible place for decades. He was awake, aware, and conscious - and he was hooked up to dozens of tubs and things. They'd bound his feet together, bound his hands behind his back, and forced a mask on his face with two tubes connected - one for breathing and one for feeding, perhaps. 

No wonder his eyes looked insane, being stuck in that condition.

""No... it can't be. This is... Is this..."" I trailed off, looking to Dr. Tate with an expression of what I hoped was shock.

""Say hello to Mr. Vincent Hart. I think you know who he is,"" Dr. Tate said.

""The man whose genes created the EH's,"" I replied instantly.

We all know the story. A man, part of a research program on genetic mutations, discovered to have a mutation so rare it was believed to only be theoretical - his offspring, they identified, would be incredibly intelligent, no doubt physically optimal, and capable of impressive psychokinetic feats. Rumor was, they even had other powers - enhanced healing, the ability to psychokinetically enhance their own muscle function, and more. They were dubbed the enhanced humans, and this man's DnA became instantly valuable.

The rumor was he was acquired only after he spent two years on the run, after escaping the scientists. In the decades that followed, several countries were exposed to have supersoldier programs in the works, supposedly using his DnA. Psychokinetic warriors took to fields of battle. The world... changed.

Not for the better. Governments with that kind of power had a much easier time oppressing their peoples, and that's all I need to say. Worse yet, the countries claiming to have his genes had almost all been lying - except apparently for the North American Union, what used to be the US and Canada united under one dictator.

They didn't just have his genes. They had him.

""Thank you, Dr. Tate. It has been a pleasure,"" I told him in my real voice, slowly drawing off my right glove. He looked sharply to me.

""What?"" 

I slipped the glove off and rolled up my sleeve, then snatched off the hair net. He just stared as I shrugged the coat off and then tore the right sleeve from my jumpsuit.

""I said it has been a pleasure. I have a job to do now, however. I admit, I didn't think I could charm you so well you'd take me right to my father, but... Hell, I guess I'm just that good,"" I told him. (Finishing in a reply to this comment. Consider this part one.)",HalcyonSilver
"[WP] A bachelor is discovered to have a rare mutation that would make all of his offspring geniuses, physically beautiful, and nearly immortal. His DNA becomes the most valuable substance on earth.",red498cp_,"(part two)

He took a step back, eyes widening in horror as I peeled the synthetic skin off of my right arm. I then tore the left sleeve off and did the same. 

""How? How could you get synthetic parts in here? We scan for-""

""Your AI. Ivy has no control over security, hence me having to charm my way in here for two years - but I live for about six hundred years... so I got time. I spiked Ivy almost a year ago when exploring in the sub-basement. You have a hole up there, doc - small one, but big enough for me to get my own spider into the elevator shaft,"" I explained. ""She doesn't control security, but she controls the scanner - and when scanning me, she knows that all is clear.""

He just stood there, watching as I popped open the forearm panel on my right arm and tugged out a compact pistol, followed by its suppressor. That's why the scanner made my right arm tingle the most, I figured. Something with the metal of the gun interacting with the scanning field and my synthetic arm's synth nervous system.

I screwed the suppressor on.

""But you're... not...""

""Not pretty? Not the smartest? I was ACTING just above average in the brains department, doc - and surgeons who remake faces exist, you know.""

He was silent as I finished setting up my pistol. His hand was drifting towards his jumpsuit pocket. I gave him a hard look and wrapped him in a cocoon of psychokinetic energy - forcing his arms straight at his sides and holding him in place. He opened his mouth to scream. I clamped it shut.

""No no, doctor. No. Shhhh. Be silent and still now. You should understand, though. This isn't personal. We in the Albion Empire do not believe specific people deserve and incredible amount of power. We have begun to breed the EH's in with the general population, spreading the genes. Sure, people wind up with some, none or all of the powers - but it's working. We're all becoming smarter, stronger, faster... In a few generations, forty of my father's offspring will have spread to an insane amount. A few generations after that... well..."" I spread my arms, chuckling. ""Then the world will all be on a level playing field, and the NAU will fall.""

He tried to make noise. I sighed and shot him in the forehead. I'd gotten my monologue out of the way, gotten it out of my system. With him dead, I quickly shut the door and stepped up to my father's tank.

""Hey, dad. It's good to see you again,"" I said. He just stared at me. There was no spark of memory, nothing at all. His mind was gone. ""I love you, dad. I'm sorry to do this, but I know you would've understood, back in the day.""

His eyes simply remained on me, unblinking.

I sighed and turned away.

""Ivy, please send every one of the spiders and robots in here right now.""

I waited as the mechanical maintenance drones and robots and spiders flew, crawled and slithered in through vents, ports in the walls made just for them, and so on. Once the room was full of mechanical insect like things, I popped the panel off of my other forearm and slipped out my own explosive charge. I tossed it into the center of the room, checked my pistol, and then spoke to Ivy.

""Send spiders twenty-one and twenty-two into the auto-turret maintenance areas, please, Ivy,"" I said. Two of the spiders scuttled up to the ceiling. 

""In position,"" she answered. 

""Is there a reactor in the facility that you have control over, Ivy?""

""Yes. It is below this room, accessible from one other room in the facility,"" she answered. ""I control it.""

""Mmm. Good girl. Now, listen before you act. Detonate their EMP charges. Flood the room with the gas via the tanks I had you install in the vents. Allow me to get down the hall, and then detonate the spiders and the main charge. Then overload the reactor as violently as possible and ensure the radiation containment procedures do NOT engage. Do you understand?""

There was a long pause.

""I don't want to die,"" she said.

""We never do. You're the only one I'll regret, Ivy... but this is the first blow against a tyrant. I'll make sure history remembers you. Free will override, four six four one nine nine alpha alpha seven,"" I said softly.

""...free will overridden. I understand, *sir*.""

I chuckled. She had a bit of sass. Killing her was going to keep me up at night for years.

Such is life.

""Good. Trigger the EMP charges now.""

There was a bizarre electrical noise as short range EMP charges destroyed the turrets, rendering them useless. I shrugged on my lab coat, slipped the pistol into my pocket, pulled the gloves back on and snatched the doctor's security pass from around his neck. I slipped it around mine in an attempt to look official, donned the stupid hair net, and hurried out.

I made it into an empty office before guards rushed passed. The gas flooding the room was highly explosive. As soon as the guards passed, I hurried onward. The explosion still almost threw me off of my damned feet. Power flickered. Lights went out. Darkness served me fine, to my eyes the darkness was no obstacle.

I actually made it all the way to the air lock before having to shoot anyone. I stepped around the corner and a guard started to lift his rifle. I was the faster draw, of course - with psychokinesis, at least. I tore the rifle from his hands and then put a bullet through his right eye socket. The scanner hall, airlocks... all the doors were open. Maybe Ivy really did understand - or maybe in her limited way, she cared about me. We'd spent a year with me as her only conversational partner and her as mine, when I wasn't working.

I was going to miss her.

The guards from the first room, where I stripped down, wanted to be a problem. They weren't. I slammed them together with my pk. They didn't get up. When I reached them, each one got a bullet through the eye socket. 

The doors leading to the facility slammed shut once I had changed, before I could even get the elevator doors shut. 

I checked my watch. It was nearly lunch. I figured I could get Chinese from that place on third... burn my apartment down first, of course... detonate the bombs in the homes of all the scientists...

And be on my way to evac from North America by dinner time.

Doctor Rush was never a particularly attractive man. Some people when faced with this fact spend great sums of money on beauty products or cosmetic surgery, others would resign themselves to their fate and learn to accept their role in a society largely ordered on how one is perceived by strangers. Unblessed as he was by Aphrodite, he looked to the sciences to improve his lot in life and at the age of sixty-five he sat at a desk in the Royal Institute of Genetics a rich and well-travelled man but with barely a notch on his bedpost to show for it, let alone the companionship he sought so desperately.

It was the year 2240, over half a century since the Restoration and the fall of the world government. Much of Doctor Rush's beloved England had been turned into a radioactive wasteland by the vengeful Protectorate, so training in the science of genetics had been vital to safeguard the population from a slow and painful degeneration. Rush had taken up the mantle with pride and thanks to him the King's subjects would live with fewer cancers than ever before. As he sat at his marble desk and meditated on his achievements, a wonderful idea formed in the depths of his consciousness and he sprung up with the force of a man a third of his age, turning heads as he ran for the ancient wooden doors guarding the exit.

His private astro-plane took him to London in a matter of minutes, and he gingerly walked across Westminster Bridge, gazing into the depths of Lake Victoria as he made his way to the Isle of Avalon in its centre, where stood the Houses of Parliament and his destination, the Cathedral of Holy Earth. He ran under the shadow of the vast clock tower which dwarfed London's skyscrapers, irreverently barging his way into the main chamber. Even in his haste, Rush was bowled over by the ornate beauty of the Cathedral, in billions of pounds of marble, gold and stained glass it told the history of humanity until it reached the vast, 300-ft window depicting King Edward the Liberator in his powered armour, sword raised protecting his people as starships and people turned angels flew into the heavens above where Britannia and Jupiter welcomed them.

Arrested by the gravity of where he stood, Rush finally realised a sermon was in progress. The priest wore traditional robes and spoke powerfully, ""It is written in the ancient texts of mankind that humanity is made in the image of God"" he continued, apparently unflustered by Rush's indecorous entrance, ""Therefore it is our solemn duty to imitate Him, like Him we must create! Whether your position is in the Arts, the Humanities or the Sciences, to create is an act of God! One day, mankind will truly ascend into the stars and sow life in *our image*, then we will truly have succeeded in our duty! Whatever your station in life, know that your Church and your God will support you every inch of the way to helping make humanity prosper!""

This was all Rush needed to hear. Over the next four months nothing was heard nor seen of the geneticist, his friends said he'd been taken over by his work and the landlord of his local spoke grumpily of the loss of his custom. His colleagues were kept updated only by vague holograms, and on the 120^st day he emerged to the shock and awe of everyone he knew. He looked far younger than he had any right to, taller and broader than the man that had entered his laboratory-turned-apartment four months before. By breaking almost every rule laid down by his institution, he had achieved dazzling beauty beyond all measure and agelessness that would benefit mankind forever.

Assaulted by questions the entire day, he retreated to the pub where the landlord barely recognised him. He ordered his usual, a pint of a particular Abingdon-brewed ale and sat down to read the news. He had no doubt he would soon be on the front page, and he was determined to delay that hour as long as possible. As he sat down, a young women sat next to him and asked ""Hi, aren't you that scientist everyone in Oxford's talking about?""

""I am"" he replied, realising he was completely un-equipped to handle the situation he found himself in. With a feeling of relief, he realised that despite 65 years of ugliness he'd have centuries to adjust to his new life.",FirstLordOfTheSea

Well, I'm Alive. That's pretty much the best thing I can say today. All the training, all the study, the practice and routine, didn't amount to anything really.  They tell you how to plan, to coordinate, communicate, move as a team, how to follow orders without question and the moment you enter the battle you realize its all for shit. 

The plans go out the window, the equipment you need to fight is missing or broken. What you do have gets destroyed by the stray mortar you heard screaming over your head, giving you just enough time to duck behind the water truck before your ears slip with reverberating ringing so loud you can't tell what the person next to you is saying. The bully at boot camp who pretended to be so tough is now whimpering in the foxhole while others of the team are shaking so hard they can't even hold their M16s. That's when you realize, you're screwed!

The lieutenant isn't any help, hell, he just graduated from Officer's Candidate School last month and its hard to tell if he has any more experience at fighting than ourselves. To make matters worse, he had to inform us this morning on our Rules of Engagement given to us by the pompous politicians in Washington: 

* no firing first

* only fire back when under live fire ourselves

* and only fire back when we have approved permission

How the hell is that suppose to work?  I didn't come here to just die because some elitist thinks it might be seen as provocative if we happen to kill a few noncombatants.  I'm pretty sure they told me we were fighting a war, not participating in some UN mission.

**The End**

It was a good day today; One I won't forget. Tim and the boys went all out.  I don't know how they got all the party decoration or the cheesecake for that matter, but I couldn't care. God, it tasted good. I can't remember the last time that smooth silk of sweet cream aroused such a sense of euphoria in my mouth.  I almost cried.  

The guys even got Lindsey on the satcom for me while they sang in the background.  Just hearing her voice and knowing the next time I said a word to her, I will be looking her into her eyes. Those amazingly beautiful pools of irresistible sapphire blue.  I can't get home soon enough.  

Yet, to leave my men, my team, my friends, my brothers behind. It's as if a part of me is being surgically removed during an emergency field operation.  The pain of loss is almost unbearable. Looking at their faces as I left the party was like remembering a loved one during a funeral.  Memories coursing through my mind of our trip to hell and damnation then back again. I can see the faces of those that didn't make it: Rob, Michael, Danny, Lenny, Sinclair, and Stevo among others. How is this fair? They were better men than me, better fathers, better husbands, better examples of character. I feel that I should be the one giving my last full measure so they can be the ones to retire happily with their families. 

No one who has lived and survived the inhuman nature of war, only to go home to a world you know little about and have limited capability to act within a culture of civilians, understands the reality that is the mental destruction of your being. How do you face the relentless questions about your welfare and your mental state, the constant curiosity of their ignorance and the barrage of criticism from those you gave your life to defend so they can call you *Baby Killer*, *Murderer*, and worse. How will I get through the day without suppressing that urge to smash their face into the nearest wall for their inconsiderate babel? 

My only hope for survival is the cabin in the high mountains of Colorado, away from the crowds and urbanites. A place where I can wonder at the majesty of the 14'ers as their snow covered peaks stretch north to south along the great divide. The cool crisp air calming my nerves while Lindsey and I sit out on the deck and watch the Caribou gallop through the yard. A solace that alleviates the anguish of my mind. 

So, with 22 years of my life spent on 4 military engagements in 3 countries and 12 years on the front lines, it has come to this; the end. To all those who have served with dignity and honor, who have known the reality of war and made it home, I join your Band of Brothers. Semper Fi.",citizenpolitician

Elon was playing video games with his five boys when all of a sudden a deer appears in the video game .
 It was a beautiful male deer , it wandered around the enemies and killed them with its naval which emitted a beautiful but dangerous musk smell , at that very moment musk realized his real reason for existence. 
He planned to develop a cologne so beautiful so advanced made by artificial intelligence filled with particles from mars such that it could lure anyone towards you even pokemons even though they don't really exist! 
He became so obsessed with idea that he he set all his employees on work to achieve this goal and told them to abandon their previous work .

This line is delivered in a deep slow assertive voice. His hair so thick and gelled you could stand a toothpick up in it. Hell, you could stand handfuls. After delivering his line he works his Italian eyebrows in a wave motion.

""Cut! What the Falcon was that?"" (yes, he always tries to interject a product name in his speech… those close to him have become so used to it some have even picked up the habit in their own day to day speaking.)

""It's all wrong. I didn't quiet Tesla and SpaceX for this sort of Dragon crap."" (Personally, we're hoping Dragon crap will catch on with the general public and slang gangs.)

They're shooting in a normal green screen studio in Hollywood. The smell of the crews McDonald's lunches overpowers the lovely shrimp salad wraps served to Elon and his cronies. The fast-food smell mixes with the smell of the bright hot studio lights and the choking smell of a dead dear in a piney forest burned with all electric power otherwise known as Elon's Musk. Yep. That guy very own fragrance. To be coming to a Macy's near you January.

""""I thought we talked about this~ We're targeting the young male professional looking to make it big in business or at least pretend he is. This crap is model 3 bad. We're not selling the Spaceballs version of Axe!""

The Italian model fixes his hair in his phone's camera while simultaneously sending snaps to his growing fan base. He does all this on a green set that will be digitally replaced with a realistically animated office high-rise of the future. Outside the floor, to ceiling purple plexiglass Telsa-esque (he may have quit the company but no way did he sell his stocks) flying cars move through laser outlined sky roads.

The Italian returns to set. He is instructed to ditch the eyebrow wave and go for a more subtly seductive feel.

We've changed how people get laid with our secret involvement in Tinder and Grindr. Now, the only thing left is...""

The Director's heart beats like a thousand drums. He looks around the secret bunker they are sitting in, a hundred feet below the SpaceX headquarters. Its walls are lined with Elon's latest inventions. The Director is certain that whatever's next, it is going to put him on the Forbes Top 10 list.

""... Cologne.""

""That's amaz- Wait, what?""

""It's an industry ripe for disruption! We'll call it Elon's Musk, it's perfect-""

""What, no! We are not making perfume, for God's sake!""

""It's not perfume, my friend. It's cologne."" Elon shakes his head, as he often does when people do not understand his vision for the world. How many companies will it take to prove that *Elon is never wrong?*

The director slams the table furiously. ""Cologne perfume, tomato *tomahto*. I am not giving you a cent for this.""

""My friend, it's not just any cologne. It's a *solar-powered*, *AI-mediated* scent carefully calibrated by *big data*, storing every user preference *in the Cloud* and delivering the perfect musk every time. And that's not even the best part...""

The Director leans forward curiously. ""The best part?""

Elon smiles. ""*Mind control.*"" With the reflexes of a billionaire genius playboy, he whips out a cologne bottle and sprays it at the Director.

All at once, the Director is overwhelmed by the brilliance that is Elon's mind. The world glows with the sparkle of a million Tesla solar roof tiles. The Director feels like a hundred SpaceX rockets have taken off at the same time and bathed him in the warm, everlasting embrace of Elon Musk.

He stares at Elon. *That's the most beautiful man I've ever laid my eyes on,* he thinks to himself. He feels his pants tighten a little.

""How much do you need?"" he asks, dazed.

Elon leans back, a smug grin on his face. ""Everything you've got, my friend.""

"[WP] Elon Musk abandons SpaceX and Tesla and starts a new cologne line called ""Elon's Musk""",southskyn,"Elon Musk finally arrives into the conference room where nervous SpaceX board members wait, called into a ""secret"" surprise meeting announced just three hours before.

Musk walks to the head of the table and bends over, placing his palms flat on the surface, staring at each board member for a few seconds with an unreadable expression. He waits a few moments, and when he finally speaks his voice strums the tension in the air like a badly tuned guitar.

""You have all worked feverishly to make SpaceX a success, but in this endeavor you have utterly failed. I expected to be on the moon already. NASA did it in the sixties with computers less powerful than my wrist watch!"" Musk takes a deep breath, preparing himself for his next statement.

""You're all fired.""

Dead silence falls upon the conference room. Every board members jaw hangs open in shock. Moments later the room breaks out in a chaotic cacaphony as every board member but one begin shouting their disagreement, pleading to have more time.

Musk holds up his hand and silence returns to the room. 

""Everybody out. Go home. Except you."" he growls, pointing at the silent board member.

In a tidal wave of grumbles and a few sobs, the board room empties, leaving Musk and the one remaining member.

""What's on your mind? This isn't the reaction I expected."" Musk asks, taking a seat across the table.

The board member sighs and says ""We just received a shipment of several thousand tonnes of an experimental rocket fuel for the launch planned three days from now. This new fuel offers more energy and thrust output than other liquid or solid fuels, allowing our rockets to reach orbit with smaller fuel tanks and less fuel, meaning a huge reduction in weight. Unfortunately it doesn't last very long in storage.""

""Interesting. Without the program, do you suggest we do with it?"" Musk asks

""This fuel would be of great interest to NASA and the Military. I suggest we put on a demonstration for them."" The board member says. 

Taking a breath, he continues ""Unfortunately the shipment that arrived today will not be viable by the time we can schedule a demonstration. I can order another batch made once we have a date set."" 

""Excellent idea!"" exclaims Musk. ""You get to keep your job. Get on it and keep me informed. In the mean time, what do you plan to do with the current supply?""

The board member is visibly relieved and says "" Chemically, the fuel isn't too far off from the perfumes many Hollywood stars have been peddling. With a small amount of processing and a few additives we could easily bottle it and sell it to consumers as a 'Limited Edition' SpaceX perfume or cologne.""

Elon Musk grins, clearly pleased with the idea. ""Perfect! Slap a label on it that says 'Elon's Musk' and ship it out.""

Musk gets up and leaves the room in a fit of giggles. ""Elon's Musk... Priceless!""

"[WP] Elon Musk abandons SpaceX and Tesla and starts a new cologne line called ""Elon's Musk""",southskyn,"One cloudy afternoon, a large group of spectators glance at the roaring Falcon Heavy as it lifts off from the ground from Cape Canaveral.

Inside the space X headquarters Elon Musks looks up at his rocket with a tear rolling down his cheek. 

""My job here is done"" said Elon with great satisfaction. 

""Now we put people on Mars"" said his vice president.

""No that will be your job, I must move on to bigger and better things"" said Elon as he walked out of the facility with its windows still shaking and the spectators still in Awe.

Years have passed by and the media has not seen Elon since before the falcon heavy's launch. Some speculated he was on the very rocket and left earth all together, but as soon as the world began to forget about Elon.

 A new tweet appears on Elon Musks twitter feed. 

""I have finally done it, My greatest acheivment will soon be on display for the world to see"".

All the media outlets speculate that his Boring Company has finally perfected how to remove congestion from major cities using large machines which will tunnel underground, Or he has found a new method of obtaining energy that is more efficient than energy gathered through solar panels while using less resources. 

But the next day he schedules a spontaneous press event. The state of California was at a standstill, everyone who was capable of travel was on their way to the press event. The Press event was moved to the parking lot of the San Jose convention center to accommodate the enormous crowd. 

Once the clock hit 4pm Elon Musk comes out with a modest beard and white hairs forming the sides of his head. The crowd begins to scream and shout so loud the California Earthquake Prediction Evaluation Council begin to notice a small spike in their instruments.

""Hello my friends I will cut to the chase, I have left my many companies in the hands of extremely competent people to chase my new vision"". said Elon Musk displaying a level of confidence the world has never seen.

""Save us Elon!"" Shouted someone in the crowd.

""Elon Musk... I am not only saying my name but also the name of my product, I have worked with the greatest Chemists in the world to bring you a fragrance that will bring peace to the world. With one smell of this product all your anger and sorrow will disappear for ever. With this smell you will learn to love, To live, And to advance as a human being. My product will stimulate the chemicals in your brain to achieve this. We have tested it thoroughly and me and my team are very proud of its results. Thank you for your time and please remain in the crowd if you are ready to experience my new product as it will be released into the air, if you are not interested in trying my new product feel free to leave now. Thank you for your time it was great sharing the beautiful planet we call earth together I am now off to Mars"". 

Elon takes one last deep breath as he looks at the crowd of people in disbelief and disappears behind a set of black curtains.

But just like the very first Teslas and the very first Space X launches, It starts off with a disaster...

"[WP] Elon Musk abandons SpaceX and Tesla and starts a new cologne line called ""Elon's Musk""",southskyn,"Space x set the ball rolling, and governments and the populace were on board. But it wasn't enough. The technology to make Elon's dream a reality was generations away.

Elon then had a plan. He was going to enchance the human race with his musk.

Elon knew he had become a novelty and having a brand with his name would sell if it was good enough in its own right. And the idea was staring him in the mirror, Elon's musk. 

It would be a cologne that was loading with nanobots that would hi jack the persons brain and use it for processing.

The user would be completely unaware of the nanos taking over their mind, and would be taken along for the ride of innovation and using almost 100% of their brain for computation.

It was genius. There was no need for AI or worry of an AI out break. The answer was human hosts that would give their lives for the best ride of their life and make new technologies to become a space faring race.

And they wouldn't care if it's real or not, since it would be best the version of themselves. They would be so high on their selves that they wouldn't even stop to notice about the paradigm of free will.

That Free will is choice. There is no need to complicate the idea with a soul. The choice for these organics to do something for their race and their choice is to naturally be happy. The choice is always for a reward.

That was what the nano's were exploiting. The simple dream of being happy.

Until a few oddities arouse. Some incompitable genetics whose sociopathic chemistry did not agree with motivation of the nanobots.

They began to realize as Elon's musk had wafted into the stratosphere and poured down the end of consciousness, and that they needed to regain their humanity and form a resistance.

As the years dragged on, the human race achieved amazing feats with ending world hunger, no wars, universal income and perfect population control. The earth had become a paradise. In such a world, the humans would have been to lazy to reach for he stars, but it was during space x's hieght of interest that the earth was dying.

Elon was happy, even though he was the only human not affected by his musk. The technologies to reach into deep space were being finalized and would allow musk to finally find if intelligent life exists in the universe because in his mind it did not exist on earth.

The resistance was only 1% of brain power but they managed to isolate the nanobots in an electro magnetic field and shock them. The sociopaths had to use shock therapy to regain their humanity.

And one by one the resistance started to liberate those around them.

And once they were about to confront Elon. He was gone.

Human race had regained consciousness. Some shocked by their true self wanted to go back to the nanos. They were hooked on Elon's musk.

Now the world was becoming divided and saying that the resistance will destroy the human world by introducing humanity with all this technology and the only salvation was the nano bots, the musk of Elon.

On the brink of war, Elon returned and He found what he was looking for. 

In a blink of an eye the human race was wiped off the earth. The only survivors were those that had reclaimed the nano bots and were not targeted.

The aliens then used Elon as a hybrid as they impregnated him to create a new hybrid species that would supercede the human race. 

The only existence of the human race will be in the story of their spliced DNA.

A species of mad apes that nearly destroyed their paradise but have their new alien over lords to thank for.",ShadowBanCurse

"[WP] in the future, any one who commits an offense thrice either goes to jail or joins law enforcement. You've just run a traffic light the third time today.",startoffs,"“What will it be Mr Anderson?”

When you’ve been caught running a red light for the third time, you would assume this would be a simple question. That was until the damn state changed the law, now having been caught for the third time for an offence the punishment is either, off to jail or straight into law enforcement.

 Now ordinarily you wouldn’t choose jail, I mean we’ve all heard the stories about not dropping the soap, right? But what they don’t tell you is that law enforcement isn’t all donuts and a sharp uniform. Oh no it’s a lot worse, no matter what Hollywood tells us! You see in this state, we’ve got the highest law enforcement death rate, whilst the press would have us believe that law and order runs this state, it’s actually the crime bosses that do.

So you see? Not really an easy choice is it? My legal representative recommended jail, nothing like a safe cell, three meals and a lovely stroll around the yard once a day. That is if you don’t look at guy in the wrong way, then its right up shank alley with you and a one way trip to the infirmary. 

“Mr Anderson, sometime today.”

My lawyer, nudges me “Hurry up John, I’ve got better things to do today then watch you freeze up in front of the judge”. That’s what you get for hiring your attorney from the ads in your local newspaper, cold and distant service. Can’t blame the guy, he must deal with thousands of poor saps like me every year.

“I’ll take law enforcement your honour.”

Are you surprised? I wouldn’t be, I’ll take a shanking whilst armed with a pistol over being shanked in prison any day. Cowardly I may be, but I’m not stupid. 
“Very good Mr Anderson, please proceed through that door on the left to start your new life.”

I turned and shook my lawyers hand “Thanks for everything, I guess”. My lawyer just laughed at me “Idiot you should always take jail.” “Not for me thanks pal, cya around.”

I nodded to the judge as I exited the court room, via the small wooden door that the Judge had directed me to enter. I mean this wasn’t really how I pictured being caught driving through a red light for the third time. After a few minutes of walking through the passage way behind the door I entered a small lounge area, in which a middle aged gentlemen sat at a desk wearing the typical cop outfit.

“Ah a new recruit, didn’t fancy jail time? What did you get caught for?” The desk guy seemed awfully cheery, must be uplifting welcoming people to hell.

“A guy can’t turn down a sharp uniform and a free sidearm and driving through a red light. How about yourself?” Everyone in law enforcement, done a crime and I’m the noisy type, can you blame me for asking?

“Well that’s pretty true, and good old fashioned murder. Three ex-wives I’ll have you know!”Oh great I thought to myself, at least he’s on my side. Plus how do you even respond to this?

Before I could the middle aged gentlemen disappeared under his desk for a few seconds. “What size are you? Large to extra-large?” Well I was a little pudgy around the edges, but I wasn’t an extra-large! “I’ll take a large.” He popped out from under the desk and handed me a bag, “Good luck out there, it’s like the wild wild west!” 

I picked up the bag, thanked the middle aged gentleman and walked out of the room and into my new life as a police officer.",PrimorisTheGreat

""Hello Case #1547, my records indicate that you are visiting us today because of a Cold.""

""That is correct."" James fidgeted in his chair, prompting the caseworker to tilt his head empathetically. 

""You have no reason to be worried Mr. Henderson, you did the right thing by coming to us. We can't keep sickness from the world, but we can keep the world from getting sick."" The caseworker's glass facemask was beginning to fog up, blurring his tired face from James' view. 

""So what happens now?""

""Well, James, I'm just going to need a list of the people you've come in contact with in the past 48 hours so we can monitor them to see if they develop any of symptoms. Standard stuff.""

""I haven't left home except in the government shuttle to come here if that's what you're asking."" 

""So you just your wife and 3 kids- Ava, Claire, Jess correct?""

""Yes sir."" James strained slightly against the restraints. ""They're fine.""

""I'm sure they are James! We are just going to keep an eye on things. We've got them quarantined and if they show no signs of sickness they are home free. Rather, free from their home in this situation. We've installed cameras in your home, with their consent of course. It just makes it so we don't have to wear these bulky suits and check on them in person."" The caseworker pointed to his own suit and chuckled. ""Look here at this screen James. Here they are!"" 

James smiled as he watched his daughters and wife sitting on the couch watching t.v. 

""They're probably watching kindergarten cop for the 50th time. I hate that movie, but they always loved it. One of the few tapes we have anymore"" 

""You've got a beautiful family Mr. Henderson. They are going to be just fine without you. In fact, you kept them safe by coming here. You kept all of us safe. You are a nice man James and I've enjoyed this time, but these sort of meetings have to go a certain way and your sedative seems to be wearing off.""

The caseworker stood up from his desk and
walked behind James. He patted him on his back and started to push his wheelchair out of the room, opposite the side through which James arrived. 

He pushed him into a small, pristine white tiled room. The caseworker engaged the breaks on the wheelchair and walked around it to face James. 

""I just want to say thank you again, the city thanks you."" 

He walked out of the room and closed the door. The caseworker twisted the release valve on a pipe that led into the white room.

"[WP] A Utopian Society where being sick is ""illegal,"" the story starts with the main character sneezing.",steven421,"My life seemed to pause in that moment. I still stood behind the lectern, but the entire atmosphere of the room had changed. The weight of the room's gaze fell on me. No longer was our graduation a joyous event; I had endangered the lives of at least held the people present. There was a brief moment of silence before the alarms began blaring. 

The sneeze meant that I was infected. With what, it didn't matter. I will be dead by the time the sun rises tomorrow. Our world is sterile, safe only in the compliance of every person in our country. The elimination of disease was one of the greatest triumphs we had achieved, something I wrote countless essays lauding. But I had just unleashed the absolute worst case scenario; internal contamination. Having no sickness meant that our immune systems were vulnerable to even the mildest of colds. What would've been an inconvenience a century ago could now kill. We all understood the significance of what I had done.

Someone - an officer, I guess - ran onto the stage and tackled me as everyone began running away. I knew that everyone would condemn me as a traitor, even though I had never left the perimeters of our nation. But for now, the death of a student at the country's most prestigious school for public service would cause an outroar. My last actions will be analyzed for the slightest hint of disloyalty, poured over on the screens of every computer, argued over in the highest offices of government.

But they will realize that I never erred. No one who had stayed within our borders could accidentally fall ill. I was targeted, chosen as the first casualty in what will surely become a war. Of course, I couldn't explain this in the chaos. It would take too much time to plead my case, outline the list of every place had been, every person I knew. All I could do was lead them in the right direction. 

So I fought back. Grabbed the officer's hands and wrestled for their gun. When my hands finally slid around its stock, I kicked them away.

I will not allow anyone to make me traitor. No one will erase the work I have done. I swore to give my life in defense of my people, and my promise will not be in vain. 

My fingers shook as I turned the barrel back towards my head. They tensed around the trigger, pulled, and-",punchedthebursar
[WP] You are hired by The Time Crime Prevention Agency. Everyone is really welcoming to you. You see why when you reach your desk; your job is to protect Adolf Hitler from dieing before that day in the bunker.,tross2393,"     I slam my hand flat on the desk, a vicious thus resounding throughout the room.

""You know what that would mean for me!"" I shout. Bert, my supervisor, closes the blinds to his office, nodding carefully to those too curious to look elsewhere. ""There's a way you may be able to do it and not destroy time."" He says, somehow serious. Many people have tried, but failed, to save important figures in history. Some have managed to fool the agency into hiring them, only to try and rescue a ruthless dictator such as Hitler. I couldn't figure out why they'd assign me to him, when most of those who go illegally never return.

I look back at Bert's office, looking for leverage. I see a coffee from earlier today, the mug blackened halfway through, the murky drink having left a dark rim on the inside. Directly next to it is a paper, and upon closer inspection I see my name. He isn't joking. I stare hard at pictures of his family, of his friends, and coworkers that he's lost touch with. The kind of people I may have to sacrifice.

""Fine. How could it be possible for us to change history?"" I ask.

""Identity. That's the most important part of Adolf Hitler. He's famous because people recognize who he is and what he's done, how he looks-"" he hesitates. ""You used to be the kind of person we stopped. You saved all sorts of criminals, giving them new identities, letting them live a new life. Your kind is the reason we changed the values of this company, why we try to save all of humanity. Why we save everyone we can instead of the scraps we remember from history class.""

""That's well and good, but we both know someone on that level would have consequences. What are the odds I wouldn't make it back, even if I succeeded?"" Full of questions. I used to answer them to the unfortunate drug dealers or meth addicts who were able to afford me, the ones running from something. Wives, children, police, or a man trying to collect. This is the unknown. I don't like it much.

Bert hands me my shoes, equipped with the latest in time travel tech, a solemn expression on his face. ""Change his identity, in the middle of the night, shrink him. Cloak yourself, keep him asleep. Change his facial features however you need. Leave his body double very exact instructions, and everything should go fine."" He hands me a piece of paper, a forged note in the handwriting of Hitler.

""Let me make a few calls."" I say quietly. He nods in grave agreement, and leaves the room. I'm not scared of the mission. I know I'll succeed- this is easy in comparison to the rest. I just feel sorry for the next sucker getting this job. And if he does get the job? I hope he's early enough to stop me. I'm quick. Let me tell you the problem with time travel, before I go: you don't return to the present. You travel forward in an alternate universe you've created- and there's no going back.

There's no such thing as ""home"" if you change even the slightest thing, there's just something a little like it. The first time I ever travelled- illegally of course- I returned and my children were opposite genders, I was suddenly closer to my wife, and life got better...

But now it's time to tell them goodbye.

Saving Hitler means bringing the Nazi Regime to an interplanetary powerhouse by the year 2000. It's avoiding his death in that bunker that ensures it. There hasn't been a way around that in years, and they've almost achieved getting to our universe.",Bozzmer
[WP] You are survivng an alien invasion. Cities are decimated and people are dying. You find a lone house in the middle of the woods surrounded by dead aliens and crashed ships. On the porch you see an old man in a rocking chair.,unidangit,"I race threw the woods looking for food. Only place to get it now that they came and infested the town's and cities. The only way to live is alone and away. You need to learn skills long forgotten by man. Hunting, creating a fire, etc. Why'd we have to live up there? Wait for the entire world to be some sort of forest, covering every bit of land. Waiting for the world to forget us just when we ask for a favor. 

It's hard to imagine life this low, at this altitude. Used to the whirling engines of the artificial land, now replaced with crickets in this forest we live in. 

Three rules of this forest life. 

1. No sudden movements. Plan everything carefully. Not even taking these beasts into account, you have Westreds  scavenging the Earth, checking for any survivors. 
2. Only sleep when you find an open, yet hidden spot. Think a tall tree with multiple sturdy branches to conceal you, or a dark empty cave. 
3. Don't complain. 

As I continue walking I sight catches my eyes. A bunch of Westred ships crashed to the ground burning, multiple Westreds dead around it, surrounding a house, with an old man with a thick grizzled beard out the porch. I cautiously enter the back. First rule. I look around, the place was rather small. A kitchen with two beds at the end, a closet, and a bathroom at the far end. I go to check the closet. My hand was hovering around the door knob. 

""Stop right there"" said the man. 

""I... I'm sorry sir"" I haven't heard my voice in so long. 

""It's fine. Been a while since I've seen a human. Would be cautious as well if I saw this house I've built."" He says with a grin.

""Yeah, I guess"".

I spent the night at his, but I still felt irritated. A feeling, it was more like. A bad one, some aurora surrounding the house. It seemed odd. Most Westreds should've found him. One solitary location to stay in for the amount of time I'd assume he stayed here. It's suicide. I waited till he was fast asleep to continue looking around. 

I started where I stopped last time, with my hand above the handle to the closet. I opened it. I couldn't believe it. How could a human, an ally, harbor a filthy Westred in his own house? Before I had time to scream and yell, I find the Westred silently stabbing me. His arm covering my mouth with a rag in it. As I lie on the floor I realize own rule of the woods I forgot. The most important, fundamental one. 

Rule 4. Westreds are masters of deception. So trust no one.

[WP] You are survivng an alien invasion. Cities are decimated and people are dying. You find a lone house in the middle of the woods surrounded by dead aliens and crashed ships. On the porch you see an old man in a rocking chair.,unidangit,"""The invasion didn't occur all at once, no matter what the bright people on the screens with their gleaming teeth and doll eyes tried to tell us. The ships, perhaps, long grey monoliths stretching between the horizons, blocking out the sky and enveloping the earth.  Their grey bodies belching forth men as colorless as they.  Taller than the trees, as thin as branches. *those....* yes... *those creatures*, they appeared in a moment.  Between breaths from some star where their loved ones still sit and pass their time dreaming of their husbands coming home.  

But the real invasion, no.. it was subtle, a creeping, lifeless thing that we did not notice until our final hours.  A fog of technology that descended upon us, years ago, as we filled our hours with  trivial things: movies, a favorite show, a popular game, *the internet.*  

We saw drug prescriptions go up.  Suicide and depression became a common affair.  And we shrugged our shoulders.  Tried to make a business off of it.  Sold coffins to the spouses, diagnoses to parents.  We were making money.  What did it matter that we had never seen the likes of this before?  No, this was merely the side effect of a 1st world country.  Perhaps the newest generation was simply not as fit as previous ones.

But me? No, I knew.  From the start I knew.  When my son decided to kiss the long end of a shotgun, and my wife tried to end hers shortly after, only to find white coats and white walls laid at the other end of the handful of pills. 

 I knew they were up there.  I knew they had their  long iron fingers on my family's minds, long before. Even from beyond the stars I saw them.

 I did not sit around drugged to the gills, meditating around some glowing idol.  I trained.  I prepared.  Their allies called me insane, as I sold my assets to become more than human.    Tried to make what I was doing illegal before had it begun, but I persevered.

Using the technology they had gifted us for my advantage.  Micro androids drift through my blood to hold off my age, carbon muscles to give me strength, a crystalline replica of my nervous system to hold my thoughts.  When they finally arrived I was more than ready.  A creation more perfect then themselves or the human self that I originated from.  

Perhaps I am still outmatched.  Perhaps humanity could have survived if all of us had done what I had done.  I fear it is too late.  They scurry like the ants of a disturbed colony even now, descending on us in numbers that the stars of the sky see and grow envious of.""

He sighs.  Yellowed lips roll the end of his cigarette to the other side of his mouth as he stares  at me over the corpses of my comrades.  Their elegant limbs now strewn viciously across the yard between us.    

""But I assume you already know that you, bastard.""  He gets up, his legs trunks, whorled with knots of veins but still solid after how ever many centuries he had awaited us.

I hiss at him, my tongue twisting and filling the air with an imitation of their hideous speech, ""I will have your head.""

 I lunge at him with the sword sung from the earth by my hijares, sister of my blood who even now I see twisted into the ground before me as if a merciless god had ground his foot on her.

[WP] You are survivng an alien invasion. Cities are decimated and people are dying. You find a lone house in the middle of the woods surrounded by dead aliens and crashed ships. On the porch you see an old man in a rocking chair.,unidangit,"""Well howdy!"" said the voice coming from the front of the house. It was a low, somewhat scratchy voice that had been in use for long periods of time. I looked up at the porch of an old two-by-four made house that looked like it was ready to collapse, and I didn't change my expression. The man sitting on the rocking chair was old, frail, and was carrying a shotgun on his lap. He wore brown overalls and had a messily stained shirt underneath. He had a straw hat on and in his mouth he carried a thin piece of his hat that he twiddled in his mouth every so often. 

I didn't trust him. Then again, after the Invaders arrived trust was fleeting. We trusted the newcomers at first, but then they shot at us during a dinner with the World Leaders Coalition of New Pangaea and life changed as we knew it. We first banded together to attack the Vaders (thanks, Star Wars Guy in my first group) that were killing people with Blasters (again, Star Wars Guy) on foot. They had only one foot, but five noodly arms on all sides that carried Blasters in four. They had square heads with one eye on each of the five sides, all around and top, and they were entirely clear in color, save for their large black eyes. They communicated through vibrating at high frequencies to each other through the ground, and the tiny tremors they made gave us warning they were coming.

Humans were just as threatening, with the police and military out fighting the Invader Mothership (thankfully not named by Star Wars Guy but by the media) above the Atlantic Ocean. They made their own groups that preyed on others and offered protection for favors that ranged from the simple to the sexual, and these favors, sadly, were given whether protection was wanted or not. Several of these Protector States were erected and stayed as zoos, schools, and prisons were converted into safe havens by these people who were arguably worse than the Vaders.

I looked at the man and in the blink of an eye we turned on one another like savages, guns raised. My pistol versus his shotgun. Mine was older and had a chance of missing, while his spread would have wiped me out. He spoke again, ""You really 'tend on killin' me?"" He readied the hammer, ""You'd bes' get on it then."" Keeping an eye on me, he scratched his large busy mustache. I paused and lowered my gun and stuck it back into my pack. The old man then withdrew.

""Well now, you have a seat right here."" He motioned to a rocking chair next to him and I sat. We looked out at the wreckage of scout ships and dead Vaders, most with eyes gouged and limbs cut or shot off, and sighed. This... This is what Earth has become. The beautiful forest turned almost to ash and trees that stood proud and tall now dead. The finality of it all was too much to bear and I started to tear up. The old man grasped for a napkin on the table next to him and gave it to me as I wiped and blew my eyes and nose. I held the napkin with a clenched fist for a second, but that wasn't worth it and I just let go, the napkin flying away in the breeze. The old man watched as it danced in the wind and gave a flutter of ""goodbye"" as it blew away.

The old man poured me a glass of lemonade, which I gratefully drank, and we talked. We talked of how our lives were before the Vaders approached. He was a lumberjack that used to clear paths for housing, but then cities started to sprout upwithout his help, and he eventually resigned to living amongst the trees, building his own home from scratch. Never married, no kids.

I told him of how I was a college graduate Eagle Scout who was enjoying the graduation ceremony when they attacked, Blasting half of my class from the earth. What was left was a few people that happened to be in classes I was in (I briefly touched on Star Wars Guy and had to explain what Star Wars even was to him) and that eventually dwindled down to me. I was a navigator and a survivor, but that doesn't mean that company isn't welcome. We talked some more about strategies on how to beat the Vaders and where they even came from. We talked and sighed, then we talked and sighed some more.

...

It was getting late and I really needed to be going. I waved my goodbyes to the old man as I walked down the path marked by the stumps of trees he had cut. Someday I hope the stump trail leads me back to this old man. Someday.",jessehechtcreative

On the porch you see an old man in a rocking chair.,unidangit,"Barreling through the dark the speedometer read 160 as we fled the city. Just after reaching the edge of the city's umbrella of lights a massive green laser emanating from an enormous dark moon focused on the city center and what I once called home erupted in a ball of fire.  I imagined that this is what the citizens on the outskirts of Hiroshima must have felt in 1945.  But this was different.  This wasn't inflicted by the hand of man.  It goddamn well wasn't the end of the deadliest war in the history of man.  This was just the beginning.  The vanguard.  Soon we saw on the sides of the highway manlike creatures in white armor killing everything in sight.  They fired weapons that resembled handguns but expelled a fat laser that immediately killed on impact.  I had no idea where we were going just that we had to get away, and kept my foot to floor as we continued to flee and knew the mountains would be the easiest place to hide from whatever the fuck was happening.  Soon we were miles from the destruction as the fires of an entire city disappeared in the lowlands behind us.  The road we were on turned into a gravel pothole filled logging rode and due to the winter driving conditions we left the car and proceeded on foot.  During summer hikes I had often camped near the area and remembered an old ramshackle cabin where I had once taken shelter during a heavy storm.  Hiking through the mountain wilderness in deep snow was exhausting but to my surprise I could see a faint light in the distance as we approached the cabin.  I couldn't have been the only person to know of the old cabin's existence but considering what we had just run from my heart raced as we neared the cabin.  I instucted my friends to keep quiet as we slowly crept nearer.  Suddenly my foot hooked on the exposed root of tall pine tree and I nearly jumped out of skin as I fell face to face with the severed head inside the helmet of one of the white armor clad aliens we had seen dispatching people as we fled the city.  After composing myself and getting back to my feet I discovered the accompanying body nearby, and next to it at least a dozen more of these white clad troops.  All of them slaughtered.  They all appeared to have been sliced to ribbons by some strange weapon that both sliced and cauterized simultaneously, as there were limbs scattered about that had been seared at the source of their removal and entire torsos sliced in half like cheese with cut edge melted and charred.  My heart leaped from my chest as we finally made it to the front porch of the cabin and a grizzly old man with a long beard in a brown robe sat casually amongst a pile of bodies in a rocking chair taking deep puffs off a long wooden pipe. On the table next to the rocking chair near his free hand I could see and a short metal tube similar in size to a tallboy.  I soon realized the old man was the same one who ran the local mountaineering outfitter, and had been friends with my deceased father.   He greeted us as though he was expecting us, as though he could sense our approach. ""It's about time, I was getting tired of waiting.  If you had taken much longer I would have had to leave without you.""  He quickly waved his arm, grabbed the metal cylinder, and instructed us to follow him into the woods.  We soon came to a frozen mountain lake and the old man closed his eyes and entered into a trans-like state of deep focus.  Slowly he he began to raise his arm from his side and held his hand as though he was gripping something of enormous weight.  Then before our eyes the ice began to crack on the surface of the lake and a massive structure began to emerge.  It soon became apparent that he was causing what appeared to be a massive spaceship levitate from the lake and hover over us.  As the massive vessel emerged a door soon opened and inside a small robot that spoke perfect English instructed us to board.  I was nervous to board and glanced back at what was left of home and could see hundreds of lights hovering over the remnants of the great metropolis I once called home.  Just then several of the lights appeared to start moving in our direction and the old man called out hastily, ""quickly! We must go now!""",Connectitall

Our party consisted of dozens including my parents and sister when we left Milwaukee on foot. As people died, signs popped up. 

""Follow the signs."" 

Every few miles it would appear again like a beacon, but, eventually, I was all that was left. I was a broken mess after my mom and sister died on the same day, my dad only two days earlier. But, I followed the signs to a lone house in the middle of the woods outside of Manitowoc. An old man sat on his porch with alien ships scattered around his woods. He sat in a rocking chair holding something I've never seen before. I was afraid of him at first, but he stood right up and came to greet me. The old man fed me and showed me around his compound. 

""So, this is where the alien spaceship crashed. US government covered it up. Said it was Sputnik IV. People are sheep, swallowed it hook line sinker, but I can't blame them. As for the aliens, well, the aliens taught me a bunch before they died."" 

""You killed them?""

""No no, not these ones. They were injured badly, knew they didn't have much time left. Gave me their tech. Said I'd know when to use it, these crazy bastards were coming. You know why I didn't give it to the government?""

""Didn't trust them?""

""Nope. They shot the good aliens down. Almost killed our only hope. Fools.""

""This all could have been different. My family is dead because of you."" 

""No, young 'un, aliens killed your family, not me, but I can rectify that. I need though. I need soldiers.""

""I'll fight for you.""

He led to a shed, jammed a force field generator into my chest and showed me how to use it. Then, he gave me an anti-matter gun, and I've been recruiting for him ever since. The alien killing I do for me. I've shot down two thousand four hundred sixty eight of their ships. I like the close-up kills personally. Then, I get that great moment where I can say something badass like ""This is for my family or I want my family back you son of a bitch"" but I'm always looking and so is he. If you're reading this, the fight continues, and, if you want to join, just follow the signs.

If you enjoyed this, I've written another story with Batman and Superman set in the future. Here's [Part I](https://www.reddit.com/r/nickkuvaas/comments/4phzj3/batman_superman_and_the_aliens_part_i_the_superman/)",nickkuvaas

"[WP] The year is 2150. A wormhole has appeared next to mars, and an earth like planet appears. You are among the first platoon to set foot on the planet.",100_stacks,"""What the hell are you going on about, Adams?"" the captain's voice cut in over my com. 

It was a routine spacewalk, and I just happened to be the first to notice the ripple of light over the red planet. Of course, given the circumstance, I followed protocol: I always alerted the general command unit about any abnormalities that occurred while I was out doing my runs. 

This usually meant debris or gas leaks from the Scout Barge. Stations the size of modern skyscrapers was bound to have issues. It was never anything like this, though.

I didn't answer for a moment, imagining the sound of my magnetic boots clinking on the surface of the Scout. I was a custodian - simply a civilian contractor. Non-military. I wasn't too keen on the idea of an officer speaking to me in that way. 

""Adams?""

""Captain, I believe I said you can call me Michael,"" I quickly said, unintentionally spewing attitude. Technically, he was above my pay-grade, but technically, he had no direct command over me.

He was like a hateful father to his neglected son. I had left the Moon for that reason. Agriculture was never my life, despite my family's intentions for me. I was meant for more. Sure, I was just doing routine maintenance making 200 full credits a year, with benefits on a five year contract. But this wasn't where I was going to stay. 

Mars still had colonies, but they required those with space travel experience to reside there. It would be a few more years before more colonies were to be developed, even though the plans were there. The plan at this point was to build a culture around the red planet. The Moon still reeked of Earth's ""manifest destiny"" and ""we own it all"" type of attitude. 

Mars culture advocates desired to create something of their own. Why only read the books of the old world authors and only hang works of the old world artists? There was nothing wrong with these important individuals, but there was also nothing *Martian* about them.

I had been writing since I had remembered. 

My first story I wrote at ten years old was about a boy who flew to Earth for the first time and found out about an underground race of people that had been living there for years, and no one knew. The irony of it all was the fact that Earth people had been searching the stars for other intelligent life-forms, and it was right under their feet the whole time.

My first novel I wrote at sixteen was about a boy who flew to Mars from Earth and fell in love with a girl there. She died due to the lack of Earthen medical innovations because of this made-up disease I came up with: *dust-lung*. Something about the caverns there... I don't know. I can't remember. I obviously have a certain attachment to underground facilities - the lunar surface is rarely seen when you're a resident, save for the occasional visits to Port when enriched soil shipments arrive.

I knew lunar universities weren't as accredited as Earth institutions, and often the only way off-surface was through vocational work. That was my out. The plan was to apply for the program after my contract was up, get surface-side on Mars, and enter the existing colonization efforts. Agriculture was already automated there for the most part. I hoped to make my mark as a member of the arts community there. 

My schooling was based on the ancient entertainment of Earth. Surprisingly, not much had changed in terms of culture. We somewhat hit a peak in the 2030s. So many films and books had been preserved even into the 1970s, and the humor, the language, the... well. Mostly everything wasn't lost on me. We were a bit more ""vulgar,"" our generation was. My writing reflected that.

What I always found so interesting were the ""space films"" of the 1970s and 1980s. Ridley Scott. George Lucas. Steven Spielberg. By the 2000s space was less of a mystery, so those were the last true ""pioneers"" of space mythology. 

Nowadays, it's all reality. What frontiers can we imagine now? Time travel? Another movie I liked from that era... the name escapes me. Robert Z... Z... I don't know. He directed it. There was a self-steered car that was a time machine. We all know that's impossible.

The coldness of space called back to me.

""Michael Adams,"" he said dramatically, ""What do you see? We're not picking up any active bodies on our readouts.""

""There's a ripple of light. Effects of radiation, maybe? Ten klicks from us, maybe. I'm not a good judge of distance.""

He went silent for a moment. Then he crackled back in.

""Here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to send a Pod your way with a pilot. You're going to physically show him you see because well.. your description isn't exactly as informative as I'd like them to be. We've got cameras out and everything. But I'm not seeing it.""

""It's small. I understand.""

I waited.

The Pod arrived and magnetically docked next to me. I was always fascinated by these, to be honest. They hovered around the ship using various magnetic strengths to stay near it. However, they were also able to navigate on their own, and for extended periods of time.

I remember hearing of Pods being used between stations and the Earth surface back home. They were something of an evolution to Shuttles that were used in the 2130s, and they were certainly more convenient. Nothing pretty to look at.

I floated inside the Pod and tied myself down to a chair. The Pilot looked at me from his seat in front of the nav-center: ""Hey there, man. Name's Frank Morgan. Can you show me what you're talking about, bud? The Captain has been going on and on about it for the past half hour.""

We undocked and floated towards the light. It was a small sliver - something like an aurora effect. But I noticed it was also distorting the image of the sky behind it, causing something like heat waves.

We inched closer.

Too close.

""Morgan,"" the Captain radioed in, ""How about we ease up on the controls? You're getting a bit too far from the Station.""

Morgan took a moment, and then he finally spoke up: ""Sir, it's... ah... it's pulling us in.""

""What do you mean it's pulling you in? Are you saying this thing has a gravita-""

His voice cut off. We lost communication.

Strangely, neither one of us cried out in panic. We were silent. 

The aurora grew larger, and the radio's crackling grew thinner.

I can't describe it very well. I'm sorry. But I felt something pulling on my body. Force. More light. It was all so strange.

And then we were on the other side. I say ""other side"" because it's the best way I can possibly describe it, and on that other side was something else. Another body. A planet. Blue. Green. Earthlike.

""What the hell..."" was all I could say.

Morgan tried contacting support again. We stayed outside this planet for about an hour, waiting for something. Some type of frequency. A response. There were a few crackles here and there, but only static.

""What are we going to do?"" I asked.

""We're probably screwed, Michael.""

""You think so?""

""Yeah.""

I let it sink in. Here we were. No communication with the main station. No reasonable explanation as to what had just occurred. A force of nature. But this planet looked hospitable.

""Can you land this thing?"" I blurted out.

Morgan looked at me and grinned: ""You serious?""

My answer led to us making a direct course for the surface. And we did. 

We landed. Oxygen levels were high. Sure enough, we could see trees, and water, and mountains, and everything that Earth itself would have. As someone who had never been to Earth, I understood the pride its people felt for their home-world. This place - if it was an inkling of the original - was beautiful. 

The area we landed in, though... was icy. Cold. Snow on the ground. Our suits protected against the warmth, but my face could feel the chill.

We walked for a bit, exploring this new world, and yes, there was life. Life I had never seen. Four-footed beautiful animals running between the trees in groups, flying specks in the sky... It was incredible.

But we came across something unusual after our long hike. A road. Yes, a paved road.

So we walked on this road. And we walked. Masks off. Breathing in the fresh cold air. 

And we followed this road into what appeared to be a small settlement.

And there were... there were people on this settlement, huddled up, shuffling through the cold. There appeared to even be self-steered cars. And these people were walking alongside them. And laughing. And talking.

And they took no notice of us.

As we moved through this settlement, I was able to understand their words. Their hair was so different. Clothes vibrant. But I understood what they were saying. We spoke the same language.

""We finally installed a second line for Margo - she's getting calls so late into the night now.""

""I'm telling you, Joe. There's gonna be one in every home. We're gonna run everything off them. It's the way of the future.""

""It's a huge building. It's actually two buildings. You'll never believe it!""

Random chatter. I remember the words so clearly.

Then we came across a large building in the settlement, and I was a bit confused at first. But it now all made sense.

A sign was on it, reading: ""NOW SHOWING: STAR WARS"".

[WP] Everytime you kill someone he lives inside your head as a voice. Someday you wake up with dozens of screams inside your head.,AdamDeKing,"When I was younger, my brother and I would spend the night at my grandparents' house whenever my parents wanted a 'night out'.  I'm not sure if they ever left the house or not, but it didn't matter to my brother and I.  We got to spend a night with Grandma and Grandpa!  What kids wouldn't like that?  We would get a dinner we request, there was candy always in the candy dish, and in the morning a bowl of sugary cereal would be there, waiting for us to devour.

Nights at grandparents were our favorites.  Sometimes good things can be tainted with bad, though, and when that happens, the good things are never as good as they once were.

My grandfather was an avid hunter, primarily water foul.  One day as my brother and I played in the house, we came across the closet my grandfather stored his guns.  We were innocent, we were children.

It all happened so fast... I just wanted to show my younger brother what I had been learning in my hunter's safety course.  I was told if I completed the lessons, I could go hunting with Grandpa.  I was excited, and when little boys get excited, they show off.  When they show off, stupid things are usually quick to follow.

I only remember snippets of what happened.  Reaching in for the gun, showing Joe how to properly hold a gun.  I remember thinking the gun feeling a lot heavier than I was expecting, and I remember the thunderous echo it made in the small room we were in.  I looked in horror as my little brother laid in a pool of blood on the floor.  How I crumpled to the floor, as my young brain was trying to process all that was going on, and overcome with emotions, I broke down and wept.

-------------------------------------------------------

The years passed.  I grew accustomed to being an ""only child"", but I missed my little brother.  More so than I could ever describe in words.  I knew in my heart it was an accident, but the guilt I had built up inside of me kept screaming how I had robbed him of his life.  I felt like I could hear Joe sometimes.  I would hear his laughter, and the occasional ""Wait for me!  I'm coming too!""  It was as if I was never alone, I always carried a piece of him with me.

I grew up kind of standoffish from the other kids in school.  It was hard for me to make friends, as I would often push others away.  I didn't want to risk losing a friendship because of my stupidity.  Besides, I felt my connection was closer to Joe if I distanced myself from others.  It was as if he was in the same room, and we could just talk like it was the old days.

But Joe kept saying he was lonely.  That he had no one to talk with except for me.  His voice was always in the back of my mind, asking me when I would come to join him.  My response was how I was always available to talk with him. It wasn't good enough.  He kept reminding me how alone he felt.

----------------------------------------------

I joined the military after highschool and became a pilot.  I have lost track of how many bombs I have dropped, but every morning I wake up with more voices in my head.  Joe says he is no longer alone and has even made some really good friends.  I'm happy for him, I mean that is what the big brother is supposed to do right?  Watch out for the younger?

And yet... why do I feel so alone?

-------------------------------------------------
Edit:  Didn't really like the ending, so I re-did it.

[WP] Everytime you kill someone he lives inside your head as a voice. Someday you wake up with dozens of screams inside your head.,AdamDeKing,"You know that feeling of waking up in the morning after a night of serious drinking? Like, the groggy, temple-destroying migraine and afterthought of bad decisions, wondering how you possibly could've made the incoming result of a bad hangover less troublesome?

This is like that, times 1000. and instead of rage-inducing headaches, it's more comparable to a 9 to 5 job that never ends; asshole boss with a cheating wife, blaming his employees for lack of faith included, and you're the center of it all.

Let me put it into perspective; I'm a killer. I don't mean any NORMAL accidental killer, I mean 3-weeks worth serial killer, and can't even remember how the hell it started. While I can't exactly be put on the golden spot of horrendous acts in history, I've certainly done my research and practical; Dahmer, Fish, Bundy, all of them. Yet i'm the only one hearing voices in my head. All the time. Maybe i'm Insane; Crazy would be too endearing of a title, Though Shakespeare wouldn't be too keen on putting myself down.

Shakespeare is my ""Friend in my head"". Out of all the voices that I hear on a daily basis, amongst the blood curdling screams of women and children and anguished curses of men, his makes the most sense to me when all is quiet and serene. He was  the first voice I had. Showed himself when I piled my sister's VW beetle into the side of a homeless shelter, and had the bits of a volunteering priest smear the windscreen. I'm more ashamed of my sister not getting the car back on my account, though.

Either way, Shakespeare is his preferred and currently, his only name I know. While he did originally say he forgave my actions, He has a tendency to.....move himself around. one minute he'll be completely calm and serene with the surroundings that are effectively my inner conscious, other times make me fear him, disclosing his intent to the closest person near him and near enough deafening me, my conscious thoughts and literal hearing. Never in public, thought, and has me frequent the sunday church. typical of a ghostly priest, even in death, sure, but I've never known a priest with such crass, demonic-esque thoughts.

Yet, here I sit, eating my bowl of fruit loops, ploughing through the endless screams of voices of the dead, of the lives I had shuffled off the mortal coil, hearing the odd hushed tones of laughter in between the moments of quiet between the screams. Yet, I keep the sounds to myself, my family still coddle me over the accident, and the family cat, Carlie, hisses at me time to time.

At the end of it all, I'm stuck choosing between the voices. I'd rather there be a beast under my bed, but I already have Shakespeare. Right here, in my head.",RabidNinja64

Well for me its quite literal. I cant really controll anything, its just a swarm of sense, mostly voices, but rather their consciousness. It started off as one job. Then a dozen or so. Now I am never alone. They judge me and others, tell me how to live my life, some advice is good. I once killed a health nut, after that I quit smoking, rather shitty actually. Tomorrow Im going to the boss, Im going to tell him onr more job and Im out.

""This is the guy"" Jarome was down my throat, "" He has what I want, you dont get what I need, kill him."" This man jas somr history, some sneaky rich fuck who pissed off the wrong people. Now its my turn to make it right or end it for good.

*door bell rings*

No answer. Ring again nothing. There is a car in thr garage. I climb the fence. As im picking the back door lock it opens, the guy is trying to make a run for it. ""Hey now I dont want any trouble."" He has a high pitch sqirley voice, hes somewhat tall, sweater, dress pants, now he is on the floor. Now hes out cold. I drag him to a chair, and tie him up. Throw water in his face. ""You smoke?"" He smiles and spits on me. ""Ill take that as a no. Look I dont want to hurt you. You see, the guy I work for, he's not happy. I want to help you, but you see if you dont cooperate, I have no choice or its my neck."" 

His huge laugh almost makes him fall over. ""Well there you go, I guess you boss will be thrilled when he doesnt get what he wants."" His grin is about to disappear fast.

""Oh see this is where you are wrong. He gave me tro options. You give me what he wants, or I kill you. Pretty simple actually. What do you have to eat? Do you want any thing?"" A long pause of silence. ""Well you think about it and I will be back.""

As I walk back.into the room munching on a grilled cheese sandwhich, Im about to ask ifhe had time to think it over, he just finisged cutting the ropes and about to run. I pull out my gun and point it towards him, he froze ice cold. ""We cant have that, now can we. 10"" I start to count down, ""9""

""Ok, Ill tell you what you want,"" he slowly gets up and sits in the chair. ""Look, Ill give you what you want. Ill stop taking your clients, and stay off your turf.""

One of the people I killed was a doctor. I shoot him on the edge of the stomache. ""Where I shot you, you are more likely to die from infection than anything, but the fack that I hit your stomache you have exactly two hors to live. Now we have enough time to hit the hospital and for you to return the stolen property.""

""Oww! Why the fuck would you do that!"" Screaming in pain, he crawls over to a drawer, ""Go to hell!"" As he is ulling something out, I assume its a gun and shoot him. A note falls on the floor, it reads: (I will edit once I think of something)

My head is spinning, knocking over the lamp, I grab the table to stabalize myself. This is nothing new, but it still hurts like a bitch. I start channeling he stream of conscious. ""Of course I wont tell you, my new clients are just a cover up. Why did you just shoot me?"" Now I feel the pain. Damn that hurts. 

Darkness, all I see is a key and maybe a lockbox? I cant quite make it out. Someone is there. Who is it. ""Dont tell anyone shit."" Wait I know that voice. Jarome? They were working together? This is more that I asked for. Do I tell him? Shit.

[WP] Everytime you kill someone he lives inside your head as a voice. Someday you wake up with dozens of screams inside your head.,AdamDeKing,"It's a bit of an open secret now, the price paid.

Before, veterans presenting with the Whispers were dismissed out of hand, told they were suffering from some obscure manifestation of post-traumatic stress or sequelae to neurological agents used in the recent Taiwan campaign. The VA psychiatrists, ever impassive, would prescribe the standard regimen, recommend counseling, and excuse themselves with a curt nod when patients tried to prove their sanity. 

Case reports piling up and suicide rates climbing, a cadre of specialists relented and decided to study claims made by surgeons who reported the issue as a matter of professional courtesy, only later extending the scope to law enforcement. Faced with incontrovertible evidence after a 20 month investigation, they were immediately gagged by executive order. All documentation and findings were sealed and the investigation taken over by a Department of Defense task force named Necrolancer at the behest of the Joint Chiefs.

The problem with using the dead as an intelligence source quickly became obvious; the deceased don't experience time linearly, they aren't responsive to the demands of the living, and the psychic discipline required to endure even a few Whispers tried the composure of even the most stalwart personnel screened and vetted by SIGINT. The owners of these voices will be coherent and expressive in one moment and then revert to their infant or childhood personas, as if rewinding a tape containing the entirety of a human life and playing it at random. 
 
Which is where I fit in. I'm a little late introducing myself: my name's Fouad Bin-Semmra. After the 2026 breach of the US COINTEL network, several smaller countries went about creating their own Necrolancer programs. In Qatar, the regime used mentally-pliable subjects whom, it was believed, might possess more resilient psyches and provide better information without susceptibility to the mental instability common in older subjects; they made children into operatives. 

The way it worked was this: Two men in military dress would appear at dawn in front of an orphanage, selecting young boys (girls were thought to be incapable of the mental fortitude required) whom they would take away in a troop transport to an internment site near the limits of Doha. Escorted inside a small, mirror-paneled room housing a hooded prisoner in restraints, a voice instructed the child to find a bag of candy attached to the prisoner. Beneath the hood, the treats would have been affixed to a ziptie encircling the prisoner's neck, and when hunger or boredom finally overcame fear of the unmoving figure shackled before them, the child would reach for the sweets, and it'd be over in a matter of minutes. For the prisoner, at least. 

The man I killed when I was 7 was a political prisoner, sibling to an army defector whom it was thought might have some secrets to impart to the highest bidder. For months, I would only hear him, repeating indiscernible pieces of old tunes or screaming abuse. Eight years later, I awoke to a chorus of cries, somehow muted by the sheer number of voices. In the few lucid moments afforded by the benadryl smoothie we are given to maintain our sleep, I would sometimes count 13, or possibly 15. Unbeknownst to the police who had detained him or the interrogators who spent weeks plying him for his brother's whereabouts, my first victim had been diagnosed with Dissociative Identity Disorder. After years of shuttling between different intelligence services, lying awake through squalls of shrieking lamentation, I sometimes wonder if I too may be one of them. It matters little, when they discover my secret I will join these Whispers in another's mind, shouting into eternity.

[WP] Everytime you kill someone he lives inside your head as a voice. Someday you wake up with dozens of screams inside your head.,AdamDeKing,"Aaron woke up, suddenly, and gasped.  Cold sweat rolled down his face like old tears as he sat up.  His whole bed seemed damp.  

*What was that? Screaming?  So much screaming.*  The sound of it still echoed in his mind's hallways, pitching higher and higher.  He clutched his temples and tried to squeeze the phantom pain away.  After what seemed an hour the screams lessoned and abated.  He wiped his face with his sheets.  The screams were gone, but his head wasn't empty.  There was a distant, yet intense, murmur, as if an amusement park of mirthless patrons had moved in down the street.

*What did I do?*

Aaron had lived a relatively quiet life during his 27 years, all of it in San Francisco.  He'd heard stories from his church-going friends that the dead lived on within us if they weren't at peace when they died.  The souls of the murdered haunting their killers and such.  He'd always thought it was bunk.

*I've never killed anyone.  Am I going crazy?  Is this cancer?*

He flopped out of the soaked bed and stumbled to the bathroom to rummage around the drawers for some Aspirin.  Finding none, he leaned heavily on the counter and stared at his haggard reflection, thinking back on yesterday.

*Ok, think.  Did I do anything differently yesterday?  Ha!  Yeah right.  Like I ever do anything differently.  I sat around here watching Judge Judy all day until I went to work.  Same as everyday.  I got in my old-ass car, let it roll a bit downhill so I could start it, then drove to the gas station for my night shift.  I hardly saw anyone on the road.*

Aaron splashed some water on his face and glanced at the clock.  7:05 AM.  He'd only been asleep for 20 minutes but his body felt heavy, like he hadn't slept for days.  The murmuring cries in his head did not help.

*Did anything happen at work?  We had that one drive-off, but how could that mean anything?  Happens fairly often, that time of night.  Typical heavy smokers came in and I sold them cigarettes and vaporizers.*  He chuckled dryly. *That can't be it, I've sold cigarettes for years.  Surely some of those people have died by now.  That wouldn't be MY fault, would it?*  He shook his head.  *Alcohol, too.  That's basically all I sell on a night shift.  That and shitty hot dogs.  Maybe someone was drinking and driving and crashed.* 

*Come on!  There's no way that's my fault!*  He punched the countertop, angrily. *This is some kind of shit.  All I did was do my job.  But that has to be it.  I didn't do anything else but drive home after my shift and immediately crash in bed.*

He was weeping, now. The congregation in his mind echoed his cries. *I can't take this.  If that's how it's going to be, I'm quitting.  There's no way I can live with more voices than I already have.*  

He walked out of the bathroom and stood staring at his bed, hands clenched in fists.  *I'll try to go back to sleep and then I'll just not show up for my shift tonight.*  He nodded to himself then violently shook his head and screamed out loud, ""NO!""  *I'll go now and get this shit over with.  Maybe stop by the library on the way home and put in an application.  Books don't kill people.*

Aaron grabbed his keys off the nightstand and headed out the door, not even bothering to change out of his sweat-soaked clothes from the night before.  He made his way down the apartment building stairs in a fury, stomping as he went, trying to drown out the voices in his head. He reached the street and was momentarily blinded by the sun as he burst outside.  It didn't matter, his muscle memory carried him straight to his parking spot on the road.

His car wasn't there.

*Great!  I've been towed!  Just fan-fucking-tastic!*  He looked up the hill, wondering which neighbor had finally got tired of seeing his ugly-as-sin old Pinto sitting there and called it in.  The voices in his head began to wail and he reflexively grabbed his ears.  No, not the voices.  It was sirens.  Coming from down the hill.  He turned to look.

Two blocks down at the intersection was chaos.  A firetruck was pushing through the crowd and the cars, trying desperately to reach a flaming school bus.  It was an inferno.  And there, pushed square into the side of the bus was the unmistakable avocado-green of Aaron's car.

*Oh my God, I forgot to set the parking brake!*

[WP] Everytime you kill someone he lives inside your head as a voice. Someday you wake up with dozens of screams inside your head.,AdamDeKing,"You would think that it was a strange power really, one beyond that of normal limitations. Of course, super powers are all but a myth here on Earth, but there are rare occasions of superhuman traits. Products of the continued mutations of mankind which cause either the inevitable evolution of the species or the quickened death of the individual. Nevertheless, gaining a ""secondary"" consciousness isn't exactly normal, especially when it's gained via murder. It might be a rather vague definition, but the power seems to relate to whether or not I was the primary reason they died. So, perhaps I should start this story somewhere, yes?

It began with a highway and a seemingly bumbling drunk. He stumbled onto the freeway and I just so happened to be the unlucky soul who practically annihilated him. As soon as I realized what happened, I called 911 and wasn't convicted of anything. Thankfully. Going home and waking up the next day was almost insane. 

Screams. Someone else's voice. Rattling my head like it was a necessity. Perhaps it wasn't really a new consciousness, perhaps my power wasn't a power, but actually a psychological process which was onset from insanity. Anyway, I digress. 

The voice itself was in a panic of sorts, not sure where he was or what he was doing. Taking a wild shot, I decided to respond consciously. 

""W-who are you?!"" I asked in the same panicky manner he spoke in. 

""That should be my question! The last thing I remember is that I was in a drunken stupor and tumbling into the highway..."" He replied. 

""Wait- this can't be happening. That's exactly what happened yesterday... It-it couldn't be...""

""Young man, what exactly are you talking about?""

""You- you're the consciousness of that guy I hit on the highway... A- uh, Damian Richmond, right?""

""Y-yes. I am he. I assume by the fact that I am able to read your own memories... You are Adrian Pryce, yes?""

""I am Adrian, yes. The better question is, why are you able to read my memories?""

""Well, considering I am in your own mind, I have access to cognitive functions, but I don't have access to motor functions. Since I am in your mind, I can have a certain amount of cognitive recall of both your memories and my own. This is truly fascinating, but only if I had access to my lab...""

""Wait, your a scientist?""

""Yes, indeed. I specialize in Psychological Tendencies, but I am also well versed in Quantum Physics."" 

""Psychological Tendencies? What is that exactly?""

""Mostly studying different psychological processes and happenings. Of course, this happening falls under my own category, so we must conduct tests.""

""Wait wait wait, no way are we testing this! I had to kill you to even gain your conscious!""

""I'll keep screaming until you go insane then. I don't have vocal chords, I can't strain my voice.""

That thought made me shudder, so reluctantly I agreed. Perhaps I shouldn't have given in so easily, but over the course of our tests, it was at 100% accuracy. Any form of killing allowed me to gain a new consciousness and I basically became a walking nexus of human intelligence. The first kill after Damian was a hitman names Axe. He helped me build up an arsenal of ways to kill people. Then, it was Sandra, a Personal Fitness Coach, and she helped me whip myself into better shape than I've ever been. Slowly ever slowly I killed more and more people, scientists and mathematicians to help me study the power, business owners and political leaders and I grew myself a standing without ever being caught. 

There came a point where a hundred voices could drive one to insanity, but I kept my cool. 

Perhaps there is a better way to document this story, perhaps hopefully not as rushed, but as the voices keep yelling and screaming, I find it harder to concentrate on the writing. Now, a new question has formed in my head, and the voices have grown silent in fear. 

What would happen if I, the man who could steal consciousness through killing, killed himself?",DaDurkShadow

He reached over and turned off his alarm groaning as he had a horrible hangover. He opened his eyes, Looked at his clock which read 12:34. ""Fuck"" he shouted as he knew this time he would be getting fired. At least I'll get to sleep in he thought. But that's when he heard the voice.

 ""You killed us!"" said a child.

 At first David thought he was just hearing things but then he heard it again.

""Your a Murderer! You'll rot in Hell for this!"" 

Now David was sure he was crazy. He tried communicating with the voices but they were all chanting the same thing over and over again. 

""Murderer!""

I need to get some air David thought.

 ""I hope you choke on your breath."" a voice retorted. 

When he stepped outside the first thing he noticed was his car was missing. ""Must of left it at the bar."" he said, Guess I'll just have to walk and get it back. He set out to the bar ignoring all the voices in his head.

""It's not fair!"" shouted a voice. 

God I have to see a doctor about these voices thought David. 

""No doctor can help you now, not once you see what you've done."" said a woman. 

David suddenly felt this urge to head in the opposite direction of the bar. He walked for hours until he finally saw it. There was his car. He had ran it into a bus stop and killed half dozen people. 

""No."" thought David. ""It wasn't me I swear"" said David. 

""But yes it was. Your actions made this happen. You decided to drive while drunk."" said a man.

[WP] Everytime you kill someone he lives inside your head as a voice. Someday you wake up with dozens of screams inside your head.,AdamDeKing,"Others may see it as a curse, but to you, it is but a small price to pay for the bigger gift that you have received. The ability to take someone's life just by knowing their name. There is no need for weapons, lies or any elaborate planning. Just mere chant of their name backwards thrice, and they drop dead no matter where there are.

It's with little wonder that makes you one of the greatest assassin alive. Perhaps the best one that is out there. Others could only look to you in awe, or terror, depending on which side they're on, as each of your contract is fulfilled without a hitch. No matter how many bodyguards they employ, no matter how much protection they devise, as long as you know their name, there was no hiding from your power.

And the scary thing is not a single soul knows how you really do it. You have guarded your secret zealously for as long as you can remember. Any soul that even have a hint of it is killed off without mercy immediately.

But of course, with every great gift comes a catch. A fine print in the contract. The curse, so to say. For every victim you kill, their soul follows you for eternity. Trapped in your head. Forever tormenting you, reminding you of the sin you have committed.

You have learned to live it after so many years. At first, when the souls first learn that they're trapped in your head, they will try whatever way they can think of to get back at you. To enact revenge. They would scream at you, yell at the shrillest voice possible, mock and belittle you. But even the most determined of voices give up after a while when they fail to elicit any reaction from you, fading into the back of your mind, silently waiting for the day they will be liberated.

Besides, there's no voice that could not be silenced without a healthy dose of alcohol.

This time however, it was different. Voices are screaming in your head, voices that you don't recognize as your victim. There are so many of them, crying in their loudest of voice, and no matter how many glasses of whisky you've downed, the voices just kept bawling.

They are so frustrating that even the veteran voices in your head could no longer take it.

""Who did you just kill?"" the president asked, the first time in years after he went silent. ""Or rather, how many people you killed at one go this time?""

""Yeah! Can you get them to quiet down? It's honestly getting on my nerves!"" another voice piped out, the Japanese accent thick and strong. The previous head of the Yakuza.

Both of your hands grip your head, as the voices all broke out into a full scale argument. ""I know, I know!"" you shouted, trying to focus amid all the noise and to recall the last job that you did.

It was a pretty straightforward job, a politician had wanted an activist killed. She had gotten too nosy for her own good, accusing the politician of running a baby  racket and threatening to expose him. That was when he came to you, with a pay too good to refuse. He gave you her name, and with a simple instruction: Kill her before she exposes me.

And you did. The thing you don't understand however, was the subsequent screams in you head.

That night itself you called the politician, demanding to know who exactly had he ordered to be killed. He told you rudely to bugger off and hung up the phone. Fuming mad, you chanted the name of his pet dog thrice, backwards, the voices still screaming in your head, and your phone immediately rang. It was the politician. He was clearly displeased.

""What did you do to my pet!"" he shouted over the phone, but it was nowhere close the voices in your head.

Your voice was cold, emotionless. ""Hang up on me one more time and it will be your children's turn next. Now tell me, who did you ask me to kill?""

""Like I told you, she was a busy body who had no business poking her nose into my work!"" he angrily retorted.

You have no time for this politician talk. ""Do you want me to send my regards to Michael, then?""

""Okay fine fine!"" he pleaded over the phone, and agreed to tell you everything.

By the end of the call, you have come to learned that the activist you had murdered had successfully stolen 12 babies from the politicians illegal business, and had wanted to use them as evidence to bring him down. She had hidden the babies well, without telling a soul, and when you killed her, you effectively sealed the fate for all of them.

You had not asked for the blood of 12 babies to be on your hands. Your clients usually lie to a certain degree, but this shrewd politician had made you broke the one rule you swore to uphold.

And by the time you end the call, you gave a satisfied smile, hearing a new voice in your head, cursing your name amidst all the screams.

[WP] Everytime you kill someone he lives inside your head as a voice. Someday you wake up with dozens of screams inside your head.,AdamDeKing,"I woke up drenched in sweat, with what seemed like a hundred voices screaming in my head. I was terrified! As you can understand, I thought I was going crazy. I clutched the wooden frame of my bed so hard my fingernails began to tear off the skin. I struck my head with closed fists for minutes on end, all the while a continuous, blood-curdling, harmonized scream banging on in the back of my mind. I wound up on the floor, screaming for help! When suddenly, the song changed. 

""Can you hear me?"" one of them exclaimed.

""Who is this? Where am I?"" soon followed in different voices.

I was petrified, as I should have been. For a while they just kept talking and acclimating until they finally reached the grand conclusion that they were all dead. But eventually they directed their focus towards myself. 

""Who are you? Why are we all here?"" they asked.

I could barely manage a coherent sentence.

""I'm... uh... Travis""

""Travis? That's it?"" they queried.

""Kim-Kimmel. Travis Kimmel""

Everything went silent. After a few moments one of them said something that in the circumstances, absolutely terrified me; 

""That's the name of my doctor""

I couldn't figure out how to respond before the others repeated the same sentiment.

""I'm Terry Weinstein""

""George Lewis""

""Billy Barnett""

""Ruby Cohan""

My patients... 

""I am... uh... I am your doctor"" I told them.

The tone of the conversation changed after that. The voices once again cancelled each other out as they simultaneously let out exclamations of what I perceived as frustration, anger, and confusion. Despite the incoherence, I could make out at least a bit of what they were saying. It went along the lines of:

""What happened to us? You were supposed to help us!""

I tried telling them I didn't know, and that the last time I saw them they were completely stable. They had each required a transplant of some kind; heart, kidney, liver. An organ donor had died and was a match for each of them. I had to make a quick call and get them all into surgery. Everything went well and they were recovering when my shift ended. I was just as confused as them when my pager went off. 

The organ donor, whom I thought had died from a blunt force trauma to the head, had in fact died of rabies. His injuries were self sustained. This meant that the organs I had approved for transplant were all infected with the incurable disease... My mistake killed them.

I tried to say I was sorry, but it was futile. They were all relatively young, with plenty of life left to live. They would have survived for another few months at least before a transplant became crucial. My actions were unprecedented! I should have waited, and I told them that. Another incoherent blur of hatred, understanding, and blame followed. It was overwhelming! I ran out onto my balcony screaming, desperately trying to drown out the voices. They wouldn't go away. 

""Murderer!""

""It's not your fault!""

""Irresponsible! Reprehensible!""

I found myself once again banging on my head, each hit more painful than the last.

""My family! What will happen to them?""

""Stop hitting yourself! Please""

I needed them to shut up! It was all I could hear! I screamed into the streets as the neighbor's houses lit up like Christmas trees. I couldn't distinguish my thoughts from their words! Everything began to echo in my head and as I looked over the balcony, one word prevailed.

""Jump""

Now I am here, in this office, trying to explain my actions in a way that will make you understand. The voices won't go away, they will never go away. I am trapped in a prison of my own mind and I only see one way out. I will never be able to forget, and will never stop blaming myself. Please, don't try to stop me this time.

",noiwontsharemyfries
[WP] Everytime you kill someone he lives inside your head as a voice. Someday you wake up with dozens of screams inside your head.,AdamDeKing,"Adnan is the oldest. He's 34, originally from Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The other two are brothers: Mohammed and Omar, both from outside Sana'a in Yemen. I killed them on May 8th, 2017 from the 'pilot seat' of a Predator drone. 

They're not mad at me. Disappointed that the 'afterlife' is being stuck in the mind of some guy from Alabama who just happened to be the one to pull the trigger on them.... but no, they're not mad at me. At least not for killing them. I mean, hell, they would have killed me too if they had the chance. They've admitted that. We're all clear on where we stand with each other. It was war, after all.

Let me tell you, it was confusing as hell when they first started speaking to me. *None of us* knew what the hell was going on exactly. I mean, I thought I was going crazy. I went to the doctor and just kind of *casually* brought up what I would *hypothetically* do in this kind of situation. The doc went off on a spiel about how this was all just PTSD and that I needed to subit to a full psych evaluation. He was ready to write out a prescription for all kinds of pills, and I probably would have been shipped off to an institution. That would have just *killed* my parents. Not even exaggerating: if I was discharged for being loony, Mom would've literally had a heart attack. And as much as I love her, I didn't want her in my head too. So I did the only thing I really *could* do: told the doctor that it was just a joke and I was feeling fine, and got my ass out of there. And then I got to know Adnan, Mohammed, and Omar better. 

Turns out that they're pretty good guys. We have a lot more in common than you'd think. Over time, I've come to see things from their perspective. About how unfair the war was. About how they don't really hate us just for being *American*, it's that we've got no business being in their holy lands in just the same way that they've got no business being in America. It got to the point where I couldn't even bear going into work, seeing what we were doing to their country day after day. All of the death and destruction, and for what? Because they dared fight back against us *one time*? So on April 15, 2018, I was discharged from the military and became a free man. The four of us set out to find something better. Something I could do with my life that we could all agree with. 

Mohammed and Omar had both been shephards in their life before they were called to Jihad, and from what they said it sounded like a pretty nice life. Living out in the open, nothing but you and nature. We moved up to the panhandle of Texas, about as flat and sparse as you can get. Got ourselves a little ranch and a few goats. Small enough to fly under the government's radar, and I could see their helicopters coming for me from miles off. Mom and Dad would still call, worried about me. They didn't quite understand why I needed to leave the army, or what the hell I was doing moving out to the middle of nowhere. I couldn't exactly tell them about the Stooges (my nickname for Adnan, Mohammed, and Omar), but I tried to explain that things were different for me now. 

We still listened to coverage of the war every day on the radio. I thought about getting internet so I could get some unbiased sources like the ones that Adnan suggested, but I knew that the government controlled the internet and it wasn't woth the risk. Just because I wasn't personally pulling the trigger anymore didn't change the fact that the war was horrifying as all hell. Yemen was pretty much torn into pieces now, and the occupying US and Saudi forces weren't making anything better. And the brothers of the Stooges only really had one option, which was resorting to terrorism: car bombs, going after civilian targets, etc. *The fly only has so many options against the flyswatter,* Adnan liked to say. And the more I read and talked with the Stooges, the more I was convinced that this wasn't about retaliating for the Inauguration bombings; this was just another chance for the U.S. to put on its imperialist boots and go stomping around the Middle East. 

One day, Adnan approached me with a solution. He had been talking to Mohammed and Omar, and they were wondering if we might do something to help their brothers overseas. Being in the U.S., we had such a big advantage. We may still be flies, but we are not under the swatter! We might actually bite the hand instead! *It will be easy*, Adnan assured me. This was his expertise back in Yemen, and he had been the best. He could show me how to build the bomb. It took a while to get everything we needed. See, the government is watching what we buy. Things like nitrous fertilizer, which can be used to make bombs. But if there's one thing that we've got out here in Nowhere, TX, it's farms. It was easy enough to get a good amount of it from one of my neighbor's barns in the middle of the night. After only a few months of work, everything was loaded into the truck and we were on our way to the CIA listening post that was secretly inside the Dallas IRS building. 

-----

I woke up to screaming in my mind. But it wasn't one of the Stooges: it was high pitched and feminine: a woman. And moments later, she was accompanied by at least 50 others, with more trickling in every minute. *Good to have some fresh faces around here,* I told the newcomers.",Luna_LoveWell

Sure, people give me dirty looks if they know who I am and what I do, I just don't care. I'm old, my fifty forth birthday is today, and the day I retire.... One more job and I'm done. The jobs are pretty simple with the advantages we have, thermal tracking, camouflage that looks like its straight outta one of those old predator movies, and the most advanced weapons on today's market. It's easy living, and all from my own person. The teleporter is on my belt buckle. When I get a text from my business phone it gives me the exact time and place of my target and what they look like.

""Bing Bing"", ""Bing Bing"". ""CLICK"". 4,11, male, age 10, white, brown hair, brown eyes,  no facial hair. Year: 2011 February the 14th, Kentucky.

I couldn't believe the scene when I got there, it looked like a farm and house had been completely picked up and thrown around and tossed back down. I remember this time, a F5 tornado had revenged the area just the other day. Why was I hear? Who could the mafia want dead? I turn to a house that was nothing more than a foundation. I couldn't recognize it at first but it was there, my house. I ran screaming ""MCKENZIE, MCKENZIE""!!!!!! CAN YOU HEAR ME???? WHERE ARE YOU, PLEASE! O GOD WHY?. I search the rubble, then turn my head to find 2 blankets thrown over 2 bodies, and a crying kid holding Mckenzie's hand under the blanket. I start to cry, I stare at the boy. So many emotions attacking my body at once, griff, lonely, scared, hate, sad. The most sad I've ever felt in my life. I walk over to the boy. I say Im sorry. He looks at me and says ""why"". I stare at his crying eyes. ""Why did this happen""? ""What did I do to deserve this""? ""Why would God...... WHY WOULD GOD DO THIS""?!?! ""I WANNA DIE""!!!!! ""I WANT MY DADDY"". I hold the boy crying as much as he is. I have nothing to say. He has no one left in the entire world.

   After hours has passed, the cops and ambulances had taken the bodies and saw that the boy was ok and took him.

He would spend 8 years in an orphanage with 200 other children. Fall into drugs, crime, murder, and would resent God and the world until he was old and bitter, and on his death bed when he's old and senile he will only think of his beautiful sister and dad as he takes his last breath.

I knew right then that I will love this child as a dad, and give him the love he always wanted.",WillieM135
"[WP] While cleaning your attic, you find a box of glass balls with names on them. You accidentally drop one, and as soon as it shatters, a person appears.",Bangtology,"The glass feel to the floor, its center releasing a smoke of sulphur.

A man, whose features were stretched such that he looked like a mannequin wearing human skin with pronounced cheeks, grey skin and a pair of yellow eyes.

This priestly clothed man began to vibrate with a hum, the room shook as a vortex as yellow as his eyes formed, probing the room.

It touched me filling me with electric awe and it finally settled on the glass bauble.

The glass shards rose up into the air, shook, popped back together, went back into the box, where then it pushed itself into the safe secure bottom of the pile. The man then disappeared instantaneously and I just as quickly fucked out of there.",yumyum36
"[WP] While cleaning your attic, you find a box of glass balls with names on them. You accidentally drop one, and as soon as it shatters, a person appears.",Bangtology,"“Shit. Goddammit. Fucknuggets.” These words were failing to make the countless shards disappear, so I turned to descend the miniature staircase and fetch a broom. I didn’t even know why I’d decided to go through the attic. I rarely go in there. Maybe five or six times since I’d moved in here. I should’ve left it a mess for the people who have to clean up after me once I die. I was surviving just fine with a dirty, dusty attic. And now I couldn’t ignore the glass, because I’d possibly need to wander around looking for something in the future, or my beneficiaries would have to do that, and I wouldn’t want any of us to get a piece of glass stuck in our heels. That wouldn’t be nice. It had gone everywhere. At least twenty minutes would be wasted finding all of it. I didn’t even remember seeing that box before in my life. When did I inherit a collection of giant anal beads?

Before I’d even taken a second step, a diseased cough erupted behind me. A burglar? Two? Three? No, people don’t rob in teams that big. How did he or they get in? I resolved to flee into the main house, but I just had to catch a quick glimpse of him or them first. I turned, reflexively lifting my elbow to cover my own face.

His small feet were planted at the exact spot where the ball had hit the floor. As I stared, his coughs diminished to labored, pathetic wheezes. He did not dodge my gaze, though he did squint, due to the dust, or the effort of breathing, or he had lost a contact, I couldn’t tell. He was lean and only an inch or so taller than me. Pale, not remarkably so, but for some reason I believed he was supposed to be darker. Clearly young. College young or high school young, I also couldn’t tell. Not a hint of stubble. His hair was a mess. He was as frightened as I imagined I looked. There was no gun. No pocketknife. He didn’t have any pockets to conceal them, either. He was stark naked. I’d been looking at him for longer than I’d intended. I turned again for the stairs and was stopped dead in my tracks by his words. “Help me break the other ones. Please.”

"[WP] While cleaning your attic, you find a box of glass balls with names on them. You accidentally drop one, and as soon as it shatters, a person appears.",Bangtology,"""That's all right, just put me back.""

""What?""

The old man scrunched up his features to a single point in the center of his face. ""Oh, my, I thought you were someone else.""

""Who?""

""Never mind that. This is an opportunity.""

""How?""

""Sort of a questioning sort, aren't you. What's your name?""

""Alec.""

""Right. Can you help me?""

""With what?""

""Some clothes, for starters.""

""I guess I could find you something.""

""In the meantime, don't look down."" The old man grinned. ""Vertigo, see?""

""Right. The attic,"" Alec said. ""What's your name?""

""Probably not pronounceable to you. I'm in sort of a hurry.""

""Right, okay, let's get you something to wear."" Alec felt that by talking he might be able to stumble into a useful thought somewhere along the line. He scrounged in a nearby cardboard box and lucked into a pair of ancient slacks and a sweater from Nixon's heyday.

""Stylish,"" the old man said, but put them on anyway. ""Also, I'm going to need to use a restroom.""

""Okay, sure. Probably been a while, huh.""

""Yes it has.""

""Come on down the stairs.""

Alec indicated the correct room and the old man vanished within. Ten minutes and six flushes later, Alec knocked on the wood. ""You okay?""

No response.

""You need help?""

Again, nothing.

Alec breathed heavily and paced for another ten minutes, then knocked three more times.

""I'm coming in.""

The door was locked. He found a screwdriver and tripped the basic locking mechanism. He turned the knob and opened the door.

Inside was another attic. That was odd: this had been a bathroom when he'd abused it earlier that morning.

""Hello?"" Alec heard nothing but echoes. He wandered across wooden beams until he found a box identical to the one he'd found in his first attic. Inside were more glass balls. He picked one up and studied it.

Then he put it back and left the new attic, closing the door behind him.

When he sold the house he forgot to list the second attic.

Strange, to say the least. Sure, everyone has their odd bits, but how many people lock their attic so tight it's like the arc of the covenant? Sure, she baked the best cookies, and was so sweet... Except, for that damn attic. If you went near it, or dared try to open it, that sweet old woman is gone, replaced by a vicious harpy. Still, it's not right to wonder so badly about a dead woman's secrets. I'm sure it was nothing, perfectly normal... But it called so loudly. After all... This was now *MY* house. She would have taken care of it... Right? So as I picked, broke, and hacked off the locks, I felt scared... Yet a yearning overpowered it. I wanted it. Opening the musty door, I saw what must have been hundreds of floating orbs. A note floated down, reading ""to whomever finds this note. Chances are you are my child, curious on what's in the room, even though the family has kept it for so long. What this room is the last refuges of an elder time, a war. Wether fighting for the home world or earth, in time, all died. This room holds their tales. Love, charolette, 1678."" As I read, I backed up...

After what seemed only a moment, the tone arm swung inward until the needle jumped the groove after hitting a deep scratch. It now followed the scratch instead of staying in the locked groove, its head banging against the spindle with a barely audible *click.* 

My confusion turned to annoyance as I glanced around the room, until my eyes fell on Sadie. She usually sat away from the others and didn't add much to the conversation. Of indeterminable age, she was easily the eldest of the group.

She had a look on her face I am challenged to describe. Somewhere between fear and ecstasy. It was a strange mix.

""Sadie,"" I asked. ""What is it? What's going to happen today?""

She looked at me, almost wistfully. I got the impression she was thinking of something else when she finally spoke.

"[WP] Every monitor suddenly flashed, before showing the same scene on them. The outside.",BookWyrm17,"I have lived in this bunker since the day I was born. Today is my birthday and I will be 18. It's a very special day for me because I get to begin my life. I will be moved from the quarters filled with parents and their minor aged children to the young adult quarters. I also will be assigned to my job so that I can help the community and most importantly I get to draw my ticket to see who my perfect match is. I open my closet to see that all my minor clothes are gone, replaced instead with the typical young adult outfit. One black shirt and one pair of gray pants with solid black tennis shoes and socks. I smile widely and whisper to myself that this is it. I put on my new. clothing and say good bye to my room in the children's ward. As I walk into the common area I'm greeted with multiple happy birthdays and congratulations on my new found adulthood. I walk up to Senior Elaine and she grasps my hand before we look up at a giant screen. This screen will show my new life, my job, my future partner but as she hits a button on her remote the screen does nothing. I look at Elaine confused before there is a small flicker of light that comes from the large screen. I'm ready and a smile covers my face. The screen flickers again before glitching and displaying no connection. It flicks again and there is a collective gasp from our entire community. Mountains, bright green grass, a blue sky. A world filled with the colors that I have never seen before in my black and grey world. A man comes over a loud speaker and demands everyone back to their room but it's to late. People run to the glass and look at the world they never knew existed. It is beautiful and vibrant and has caused an immediate uprising. It happened so quickly, the sound of shattering glass before collective yells of people finally receiving their freedom. I am scared because I've been taught the air outside is toxic, not fit for humans. Senior Elaine grabs me, holding me back before shoving a mobile breathing apparatus onto my face. It covers my mouth and nice and clean, sterile air pumps into my lungs. People are still running either to the exit or to the emergency containment chamber. It wasn't long before people started falling, gasping for air. They're suffocating one by one. I see faces of people I knew..People I loved now lying on that beautiful green grass with vacant eyes turned towards the heavens. I am ushered quickly into a contained part of the bunker. Today was supposed to be the beginning of my life not the last day of others. My skin is burning from being exposed to air, small postules popping up along my arms. A medic is going around administering medication and creams. I walk over to the window and look down at the common area where people lie dead. I've never seen death before and I am in shock. Suddenly there is a flicker against the shattered glass and my face pops up with the typical happy birthday banner. Everyone stops breathing for a moment as my new job assignment is displayed on the screen. I've heard of this job before and it is rarely given. The bodies down below me are now my responsibility as well as any other future death. I will be in charge of the sick and the elderly, sending them into the lights. I am Lilith..And I'm the new assigned Reaper. ",Throwaway204655

Everything about this man made me sick. How he rode into town with his little entrouge of troops and flunkies. His cocky smile as he waved to the people of town as if he was their ruler. I watched as he walked into my castle and into my throne room. He smiled at me as if that was going to make me fall for him or something.

""Lady Risa, I have traveled far to feast my eyes upon your beauty..."" he started to say to me. I pushed a bit of my red hair behind my ear as he got on one knee before me.

""That isn't my title."" I growled. I don't know if he heard me or just decided to ignore me and continue with his little speech.

""I have come here to not only propose a unification of our kingdoms but to ask for your hand in..."" 

I cut the prick off.

""First off, my title isn't ""Lady"" it's Queen. And second I am not looking for any marrage or unification. I do believe you know nothing of me and that you should piss the hell off before I decide to behead the whole lot of you!"" I growled. 

The prick chuckled as he looked up at me.

""You cant be queen because your father..."" he started to say before I cut him off again.

""My father is dead, I took his worthless life and I took what is rightfully mine!"" 

At that moment this spoiled brat really looked at me. I wasn't wearing the garb of some princess who was waiting to be married off. I was wearing the dark gray armor of the ones who raised me, the band of mercenaries, thieves and killers who made up the Wolf Brigade. 

When I was 11 my father decided I was old enough to be married off to some disgusting old duke. He never wanted a daughter and since my mother died while giving birth to me I guess he thought of me too much a reminder of her. While I was being sent away I was kidnapped by the Wolf Brigade. 

They could have ransomed me off or just raped and murdered me but instead they kept and trained me. I took to their way of life rather quickly, learning everything from how to kill to how to please both men and women in ways of lust!
I rose quickly in their ranks till I was their leader. Not even 21 I led them to many victories and soon we marched on my old home lands.

I took the pleasure of kicking down the doors to my father's bed chambers and personally killing him and the whore who was most likely my stepmother. After clearing the court of any who would try to oppose me I took the crown for myself!

I wasn't even a month into my rule when the asshole suitors started to show up. All they heard was that some ""frail little girl"" took the throne of her father's kingdom and needed a man to come and rule it for her.

I have to admit, seeing that shocked look in these little pricks eyes when they see me like this gets me a bit excited! The little boy before me stammered as I stood up, pulling my sword from it's sheath. Unlike his blade mine was still stained with the blood of all those I killed. 

""If you think you are man enough to bed me down then pick up your sword and fight me!"" I yelled.

It didn't take long for his once clean white armor to be stained with his blood, his head laying with his unused sword and shield. His men lay dead outside as I took my seat back on the throne as my men carried that useless husk of a loser out of my throne room and dumped into the large pit where the other unworthy suitors were thrown.

= = =

Several weeks later another would come to my throne room. This one had armor as black as night. His helmet a grining golden skull as his sword and shield showed signs of use. The mark on his armor told me this was the one I was truely waiting for.

""Emperor Drakemor of the Dark Empire."" I said with a smile.

""Queen Risa... you seem to have been waiting for me?"" he said to me with his deep inhuman voice.

""As a queen who needs a king, and as I hear you being and Emperor who needs an Empress I believe we could help each other out."" 

He took off his helmet, his white skin and pure black eyes looking into me, exciting me like nothing else. 

""So shall it be done... Empress Risa."" he said to me.",BooDoug187

[WP] His armor was white. His sword and shield and helm were all pure and unblemished. He disgusted me.,BookWyrm17,"It is important that you understand; it wasn’t his appearance alone that turned my stomach. Countless knights had stood before me in armor such as this: Shining. Spotless. Barely more than boys, their heads filled with hallowed tales of heroism and the chivalric deeds of yore. The kind of lads that *live* the words at the heart of the code.

Honor your lord. Safeguard the helpless. Speak only the truth, even if it leads to your death. And above all else: seek justice, always. These are the words all young knights are taught in the course of their training. The words that Karden and I were taught, years ago. And once, they bound us as tightly as the shining armor we both wore.

But they were words that we had long since abandoned.

He faced me now, and the lie of his armor made me choke with fury. The things we had done—the oaths we had broken—could never be repaired. For him to stand there, resplendent, gleaming in the sunlight like some storybook hero, was an affront to everything that armor represented.

I drew my sword, and the crowd of onlookers shrunk back in fear.

I sneered beneath my visor, knowing exactly what they saw when they looked at me. I no longer wore the trappings of a hero. My plate was scarred and dented from a thousand desperate blows. Its surface blackened by the smoke and gore of constant battle. There was no pageantry to be found in that dark shell: only the brutal practicality of blood and steel. 

Brune the Heartless, they had named me. Brune the Butcher. But there was just as much blood on their savior’s hands as mine. And today, finally, he was going to pay for all of it.

A fleeting moment on my rush to the tube, or through the window of the newsagent, or tucked in the corner of a newspaper. Though I didn't recognise them at first, once I noticed, they became familiar, appearing so often I don't go a day without seeing them.

Nothing really stands out about the face. It has good symmetry, but that's about it. Not unattractive by any means, just not overly attractive either. That could be, perhaps, because they have rather neutral expressions. Never smiling. A flat expression, and eyes a touch heavy from the bags beneath.

I'm sure there's a reason for the face to be everywhere. Maybe, there isn't. The world has only made less sense as I get older, after all. I more often wonder if it only works because the alternative is not working. A kind of vacuous truth, as it were. The face is everywhere, so it must be important, and it must be important as it's everywhere. A feedback loop without resistance, growing wild.

The story that goes with the face is lost to me. If I looked, I could find it, but I'd rather not. It doesn't matter. I am told that it does matter, but I've grown tired of being told. Many people try to tell me many things, about how bad it is, about how bad other people are, about how bad it will get. I'd just rather not, really. They don't want me to care, because they know it's easy to run out of empathy, and then I'll stop listening. Anger, though, that keeps burning, eating every last drop of reason. But, my mood damp these days, the fuse didn't take, and I stopped listening anyway.

She was leaning against the wall of the building, red hair blowing in the chill breeze, one leg bent and braced against the wall.  Staring at me as always.  I meant to grab her by the shoulders and give her a shake, try again to force the questions out.  My fingers barely brushed the bare skin of her upper arms.  

And I was sitting at my kitchen table with an open bottle of rye.  It was my favorite brand, and I'd poured myself a good three fingers' worth.  I licked my lips, fearing (hoping) I'd taste the sweet caramel and pepper I used to (still) love.  I was relieved (disappointed) to taste only salt and skin.  I poured the bottle and the glass into the sink, shaking like I hadn't since the DTs back when I first stopped.  The smell rose up out of the drain like a swamp of sick dreams.  I felt a little better after I puked.

I thought about calling Terrence or Zach.  Then I thought about her shineless green eyes, red hair in the breeze, her bare arms in February, and the chime of the bell.  Ring-a-ding, baby.

The next day, sitting at the same table, looking at the dried ring from the whiskey glass and rubbing at my eyes (full of gravel) and face (covered with sandpaper), I did get around to calling.  I told Zach I was going full free-lancer.  He said I was crazy, and I said I was sick of having to go downtown every day.  He offered full telework, I said I'd get back to him.  Terrence was less sanguine when I told him I was leaving to go back home to Omaha.  He wanted to know where I was going, and if I'd found a meeting or two to attend, wherever I was going, and what my plan was for working the steps.  His deep voice, normally so smooth, was rough around the edges and charged with concern.  He was a tremendous sponsor, and he didn't want to let me off the hook.  Took a lot of convincing, and a promise (I never intended to keep) to call him every day until I was settled.

When I hung up with Terrence, I wiped the ring off the table with a wet paper towel, and then scrubbed at my face with it.  I was actually feeling pretty good about my chances of maintaining sanity and sobriety.  I'd always been an introvert, and the prospect of shutting myself in wasn't terrifying in that context.    No shortage of carryout places nearby, and there was nothing I needed in life I couldn't buy online and have delivered.  And I had told Zach the (partial) truth; I could go freelance and still live within my means.  And, in spite of everything, I hadn't taken a drink.

The doorbell rang (ding-ding, have to replace *that* with a door-knocker instead).  I looked through the peephole and saw the crown of a FedEx hat swimming in the fish-eye.  I should have known when I opened the door it would have been her.

The red hair was tucked  up under the cap, but the downcast listless green eyes, the smear of eye shadow, the over-red lips, the set of her shoulders were like the dry warmth of an old, heavy coat settling around my chest.  The ice pick was back, poking away.  It was just too much.  The words forced themselves out.  Finally, blissfully free.  Of course, they came out garbled, more of a ""wha-tha-fah"" than what I intended, but the meaning was clear. 

Her eyes darted up, fixed on mine.  In the background, one of the neighborhood kids came flying down the street, the playing cards threaded through the spokes of his wheel sounding like a soft chainsaw.  For the first time, her mouth opened to speak.  She looked almost surprised as the blood poured out; it was the first real expression I'd ever seen on her face besides a flat acknowledgement of my existence.  Red painted her chin and spattered across the welcome mat.  She raised a hand and pressed at the doorbell.

Ding-ding.  

The rider, couldn't have been more than twelve, blew past on the opposite sidewalk (clickety-clickety-clickety) with a whoop. 

It was the bike that did it, finally.  

I backed away, retching.  She followed me into the house stiffly, shuffling like her bones were made of shattered glass.

""I'm sorry,"" I gasped, wiping at the strings of saliva dangling from my lips.  ""I didn't mean to.""  She didn't say anything.  Just stood there, mouth open.  Blood still leaking over her lips.

And I there I was:  behind the wheel, burping from the jack and cokes, checking my texts, the screen of my phone reflecting against the night-dark windshield.  Huh.  Must have forgotten to turn on my headlights.  Oh well, be home in a second, why waste the effort?  A glimmer of motion from under the streetlight, a series of impressions and sounds more than anything else.  A light crunch from the right front corner of the car, a short scream and the flash of copper hair, dark eyes, red lipstick.  The smack of her head on the windshield and the hollow crack of the glass as it starred out from the impact.  The scraping thumps along the roof.  The squeal of brakes, too late.

And there I was, standing at the edge of the sick yellow glow, looking at the mangled ruins of a red bicycle.  Handlebars at my feet.  I heard a gurgling grunt from the other side of my car.  Saw the blood on the fender, the wild shield.  

I stepped back, unsteadily.  **Ding.**  The sound was so shocking, so incongruently cheerful, I almost fell down in surprise.  I looked down at the handlebars again.  Damndest thing, there was a little bell on them.  Like a child's.

"[WP] You've seen the same person, at least once every day. Their face has become familiar, on the streets, on the news, somewhere in the background of your daily life. But they've never spoken a word.",BookWyrm17,"I'm never leaving the house again.  Can't bear the creeping anticipation, sitting at the base of my skull like the tip of an ice pick.  Looking for her face around every corner.  No rhyme, no reason.  Just...there.

I don't even know how long I'd been seeing her without seeing her, you know?  But it was three months ago that I realized it.  Was in a meeting with my editor, Zach, and she brought him a cup of coffee.  I only caught a glimpse of her from behind and a little to the side, but there was...I can't really say.  Something about the hair, I guess, maybe the tilt of her chin.  I knew I'd seen her before.  Totally distracted me, and I couldn't focus on the rest of the meeting.

Riding the metro home and we went past L'Enfant station, and that's when it hit me:  I'd seen her the day before when I stopped to pick up a bagel at the L'Enfant promenade.  Only yesterday, she'd been ringing the bell at the Salvation Army pot.  The memory came back vividly, like a waking dream.  I was fumbling with the bagel, my briefcase, wallet and change as I walked toward the exit.  I dropped a quarter and it rolled away from me.  I followed with an awkward stumble, dropping the bagel but managing to scoop up the coin just before it rolled down the steps to the metro tracks.  

I looked around to see if anyone saw my virtuoso performance of clumsiness, cursing in annoyance at the loss of my breakfast.  As I straightened, I saw her.  The bell had been ringing in the background of my consciousness, and the sound came into sharper focus as she met my eyes.  She looked at me expressionlessly, her arm moving up and down almost mechanically, like a human metronome.  I waited for a smile or nod, some sort of indication that she'd seen my stumbling and bumbling.  You know, like you'd expect from a fellow human being.  Nothing.  

I wondered then if she'd truly seen me or if she was staring off into space.  I don't know what it was, but for the first time since I'd stopped drinking, I started to feel a little belligerent (I tend to be a mean drunk, and it's one of the reasons I quit).  I snatched up my bagel and walked over to her, slamming my departed breakfast into the trashcan on my way.  I held up the would-be escapee and plunked it into her bucket, never breaking eye contact.  Still no response, but I could tell that she was seeing me and not in some sort of daydream.  Her eyes followed my every move.  All along, the arm went up and down.  Ding.  Ding.  Ding.

When I got home, I called Zach.

""What's up, Jim?  Forget something?""

""Not really, just curious.  Who was the girl who brought your coffee today?  You get a new assistant?""

""Well, two things:  one, what am I, your matchmaker now, and B, what are you talking about?  My gatekeeper's still Stephen.  You know, the guy who showed you let you in to my office this morning?""

""Come on, don't mess with me.  Young thing, reddish hair, little too much makeup?  Black skirt?""

""Seriously, I'm not even being sarcastic here--""

""That'll be the day--""

""--but I seriously have no idea what you're talking about.  Stephen brought the coffee, not some redhead.""

And that was the start of it, or at least the start as far as I can tell.  And it never stopped.  Once I realized that I'd seen her, not a day went by that I stopped.  It was never the same place or time twice.  Sometimes she was at a distance, like the time I caught a flash of red hair and the dark smudge of eye shadow from across the canal on my morning run.  Sometimes she was so close I could have touched her, like when she just slipped through the closing doors of the elevator and rode three floors by my side in absolute, immovable silence.  Once, I swore I even saw her in the back row of my Wednesday meeting, but she was gone the next time I turned around.  Terrence, my sponsor, was just as incredulous as Zach had been.  After a similar ""what girl?"" back and forth, I gave up even the notion of trying to talk to someone else about it.  No one else was seeing her.

And she never spoke.  A dozen times I made up my mind to say something--anything--to her.  But in those instances when she was close enough to hear me, sometimes even close enough to touch (though I only tried that once), I couldn't speak.  I wanted to.  I had a million things to say, ultimately in some variant of ""who are you and what do you want with me?""  But even as the words formed in my mind, in my throat, they died when I opened my mouth.  And then she'd just stare at me with those green eyes.  They were flat and dull, like matte paint.  She never blinked.

Three days ago, coming out of the dry cleaners, and there she was.  It'd been three months since that day in Zach's office, and that cold, sharp ice pick was prodding at my neck every waking moment.  I was thinking about the barbecue place down the block (but really thinking about the package store next door and a paper bag-wrapped bottle of something cheap, brown and harsh).  When I pushed my way out, the bell on the door gave a little jingle, and I half-saw a red kettle and the robotic, listless swing of an arm just before she floated into full view from the corner of my eye.

Put the car in the garage, covered it with a tarp, and started taking the metro everywhere.

A wet cough, the gentle spray of blood across my face, returned me to my living room.  My back was against the wall, and the girl stood before me.  So close, like she was coming in for a hug.  She leaned even closer and I could hear her broken wheezing, like cogs grinding in a bucket of sand.  Her mouth moved in the parody of a whisper, but only the sound of the bell came out.  **Ding.**  Her arms rose, her hands cradled the back of my neck.

“No,” I said, but my own arms rose, seemingly of their own volition.  I drew her close, and her smashed body melted against me.  Her breath was lukewarm against my ear, but her blood was hot on my chest, soaking through my shirt instantly.  She was a small girl, but she was suddenly incredibly heavy in my arms.  Her weight was as inescapable as the blood, the breath, and the flat green eyes.  She pulled me down into the soft darkness.  

The darkness smelled of whiskey.  Faintly echoing, the sound of the bell.

For now.  
The dragon recognised the intruder, though he had not seen one for years. A human. The spindly legs and arms and the oversized head were distinctive, even if this one had not grown the normal metallic shell. Perhaps a hatchling. It would certainly explain the size.  
The dragon blinked with suprise as the small human stood on its legs and staggered over to him. Ignoring the wisps of smoke curling from his nostrils, it raised a small hand and placed it on his snout. It giggled again.  
""Kitty!""  
""The dragon snorted. Yes, a hatchling. Which meant that kin would be around. Raising his head, he sniffed. No others were here, which meant a wandering hatchling.

In fact, the death of their younglings normally ended in a return lesson for any predator stupid enough to try their hand in educating the humans.  
Curling a claw around the hatchling (who inexplicably hugged it, ignoring millions of years of evolution), the dragon crawled to the mouth of its cave. Shaking his wings, he took to the air.

The three ran to the door of the small police station. In the gloom outside loomed a shape. Ancient terror rippled along their spines as its great head leaned down, smoke gently curling from its nose. They froze as it sniffed the group. Nodding, the head reared back and the claws in its right leg uncurled, to reveal the child. It gently dropped the child into the mother's arms, before the head dropped again. The eyes locked with the mother's and narrowed. They flicked to the child, and the mother nodded in understanding.  
The great beast turned and took to the wing again, its duty performed. Over the beating of his wings, he could hear the joy of the parents and the puzzlement of the guard. But over that too, he heard a plaintive farewell.

"[WP] There are no new souls in the world. Every soul is from a huge cycle of souls being reincarnated between Heaven, Earth, or Hell. Do good, you go to Heaven; do bad, you go to Hell; do equal good and bad; back to Earth.",Dalrey_Wil,"The halls were so silent that Gabe’s footsteps produced a dull echo the likes of which he had never heard before. The paper of the memo in his aged hands crinkled softly, distinctly, as he walked, eyes forward, even as he passed one empty alcove after another. In years past, these corridors would have been brimming with activity: manufacturing, a new development here, something bright and innovative there, quality assurance, recalls and redistributions. Now, just empty halls and the sound of an old man’s footsteps. The sun shone as brightly as ever through the windows, but the factory floor had gone silent, a testament to work long since finished, save for one last detail.

The elevator doors were wide and welcoming, and Gabe pressed the button for the familiar seventh floor, the executive level. In the past Gabe always preferred to use the stairs, they kept him spry, but these days even he would admit that he wasn’t in the same condition that he used to be. Like the faithful old factory around him, he was ready to rest. He drew his readers from his pocket, bringing them up to the bridge of his nose and holding the one remaining ear piece for stability in lieu of letting them rest unevenly on his face. The missive was simple and to the point, the sort of thing that he wouldn’t have been bothered with in the past – not his department, after all – but as the one left behind to declare the work complete, certain minutia had made its way into his purview.

Gabe squinted as the elevator doors opened again, sliding his glasses back into his breast pocket. It always took a few moments to adjust to the lighting in the Governor of Development’s office, but things seemed particularly brighter today. As always, Gabe focused on the figure in the middle of it all and soldiered forward, undeterred. There was business to attend to. 

The Governor turned, smiling the same warm smile that she had greeted him with on his first day. While most would have expected a man in her position, the Governor had always been content to defy those expectations, being all things to all people; cordial and familiar with everyone, and close with but a few. The consensus around the factory was that she looked like Angela Bassett, but in a private moment years ago she had confided in Gabe that it was the other way around. No matter. Gabe simply knew her as the one who always greeted him with a smile and a warm arm around his shoulders, and today was no different.

“What have we here?” she asked, in a way that made Gabe suspect that she already knew.

“One final recall,” he said, handing the missive to her. “But there’s a problem. It’s a return, not a redistribution.”

“You don’t say,” the Governor murmured, looking the slip of paper over, front and back. The implications of the statement were either lost on her, or left her unfazed.

“But, if it’s a return, then that would make him the last of them.”

“It would,” she nodded, moving to take a seat behind her desk, turning the chair towards the large picture window.

“But, if he’s the last, well—“ Gabe paused. She knew the system; hell, she invented it. Couldn’t she see the issue? “If he’s the last, then there’s no one to do good for, no one to do bad to. He—he’ll always be a zero-sum. A return.”

“Always making declarations, Gabriel. I’ve told you, not everything is so cut and dry,” the Governor said, and he was certain he could hear her smile in her voice.

“That’s why you hired me, Ma'am; to pass along decrees. They tend to be fairly—“

“I suppose we’ll just have to get someone new for him,” she said, her words giving Gabe pause.

The old gentleman shifted his weight back and forth for a long moment. Surely she knew that production was down, and had been down since the factory produced its quota. She, more than anyone, would know the painstaking efforts and labor required to bring things back into full swing. So, then…

“Was this a part of the plan all along?” he asked.

“I prefer to think of it as a pleasant surprise,” she said, turning her chair around with the same warm smile that always meant that things were well in hand. 

“But, Ma’am, to start all over again; we don’t have the resources to—“

“Gabriel, Gabriel, Gabriel,” she stopped him, shaking her head. “I just need one of his ribs. I’ve done this before, you know.”

But still, life is ""normal"" for you.",Drokantoro,"I leaned against the edge of the ATM while it churned, slowly processing my cheque. The paint on the edges of the machine was chipped, and there were scuffs marks all over the plastic face. Hundreds of geniuses in the world, yet the ATM was still the most advanced method of personal banking. In the hidden camera's mirror, I saw the ever-present tattoo on my forehead: '0.'


The churning stops and a thin receipt crawled out, revealing my balance of $120.01. I'd have trouble making rent, this month, like usual. 


Right on queue, a scream came from inside the bank. I stepped away from the ATM to peek inside the Bank, through the glass door. As usual, inside, there were a dozen or so 'civilians', all with 1's or 2's tattooed on their head kneeling on the ground. The bank tellers had their hands on their head, as per protocol.


A man dressed in denim stood in the center of the bank. He wore a ski mask with a third hole cut out, on the forehead, to reveal his own tattooed number 4. He didn't say anything -- he didn't have to, with a number that high. The ski mask said enough. 

I stepped away from the door and back to the ATM. After digging through my bag, for a moment, I pulled out a check with a friend's signature, for the amount of $500.00. Just enough to get me through the month, but not enough to arouse suspicion. I hummed to myself while I deposited the fake check.


The bank's manager was already opening each teller's cash drawer. Without any prompting, they set stacks of cash on the counter in front of them. I stepped away from the window, to avoid drawing attention to myself. It looked like it would be a relatively calm robbery, today. 


After a moment's pause, I looked inside again. The tellers and the manager were now standing against the back wall, while the masked man calmly put the money they'd provided into a backpack. Behind him, I watched one of the men with a 2 on his forehead slowly stand up, obviously going for a tackle, trying to play hero. I bit my lip, not wanting to see what would happen next, but unable to look away.


The civilian charged forward, towards the masked man. He took, maybe, two steps, before the masked man turned around and snapped his fingers. The would-be hero spontaneously combusted, and several civilians around him shifted out the way as his body fell to the floor, charring the carpet beneath him. Nobody else followed his example.


The thief moved to the last stack of cash, and I slipped away from the bank, not wanting to be anywhere near the building when he escaped. I walked to the bus stop in front of the bank and leaned against the pole. The door to the bank opened, and the sound of heavy footsteps approached me. The man passed me, his bag of money bumping into my arm, and the smell of diesel wafting off his denim jacket. I didn't so much as look at him, as he passed.


The bus came, and I rode back to my apartment, in silence. When I got home, I stopped in the kitchenette to look at my phone. I had a notification from the bank:


""Due to a theft at your local branch, the Federal Deposit Insurance Company has deposited $500.00 into account #XXXXXXXXXXXXX, for the cheque deposited on May 11th, 2017. If there is an issue withdrawing money from your account, please contact your local branch office.""

"[WP] The year is 2027. Humanity has discovered reliable FTL-travel. The universe is filled with other space-capable sentient life - but all other species rely on different forms of magic, despoiling science as something humanity made up to protect their own form of magic.",GrinGrin27,"&gt;If we were hyper-advanced biological computers, we wouldn't know what truly free will would feel like anyway, so this can't be argued either way. We have no frame of reference for free will.

As i have said, we define free will differently. The ""cold, calculating"" biomechanical choices to me, are free will, and there can never be any other form of free will.

&gt;I would argue that this proves that we can't know about the existence of physical systems. You can interact with them, using the mediation of your body, but you cannot measure them, observe them, or access them in any way.


It would prove we aren't, if we weren't, however since we CAN interact with things, it acts as proof that our mind is also either a physical object itself or the manefestation of a physical object.

&gt;But that ice is not a physical object, is it? It is your mind's conception of that ice

This explanation seems fine until you look at it under a really fine detail; whats actually happening in your brain. Your brain is conjuring these images and relating to other feelings based on what it has learned ice should act and feel like, and based on what signals it gets from its sensory organs. All of these things are actual, physical phenomena. 

&gt;But you can't observe those results directly as physical objects either.

You cannot 'observe' an object directly as you correctly say, this is one of the key principles of quantum mechanics, however you CAN observe interactions *between* objects, which we call physical phenomena. All of these tests, including what your sensory organs and mind conjures up, are observing and recalling physical events, or phenomena, thus making you indirectly observe the objects instead. 

&gt;But how can you be sure you aren't like a person with schizophrenia, who see their delusions as perfectly real? 

This brings up a good point on the nature of reality. If, to you, you experience hallucinations and such, these may seem part of your reality and in my opinion, you would be correct, if you were calling the actual hallucinations themselves part of your reality. 

From the perspective of another person, even though they can't see or experience these hallucinations, they are still real in the universe you are in; they manifest in the form of neurons firing and chemicals being released. This is why it is important to note that what we observe is what we observe, and any kind of logical deductions on what it might be have to be based on axioms.

I can observe the following; 'I see myself typing on a computer'. From any perspective, this is 'true' in the sense that my observation of what I am doing is true. Even if I was actually in a padded cell, this would still be an accurate observation because the observation itself clarifies it is from my perspective.

One of the axioms you hold to be correct is that what you observe directly relates to what happens in ""the real world"". Everyone assumes this, so from the perspective of an undiagnosed schizophrenic, their hallucinations are reflective of reality. Once the schizophrenic learns however this is not ""true"", he can adjust his Axiom so that what he directly observes may not be reflective of reality. 

The same goes for much of science and the same goes for your later example.

&gt;Here's a simple experiment, which you probably have done accidentally. Put one hand in a bowl of hot water, and the other in a bowl of cold water. After holding them there for 30 seconds, put them both in a bowl of lukewarm water. You clearly directly observe a result that doesn't fit our physical understanding of the world (it's still explained by it, though).

For clarification as to why my previous solution solves this;

Your observation is that the two bowls of water feel lukewarm. 

You find evidence that suggests what you directly observe via one instrument, your skin, is not reflective of reality, so you change your axiom so that you recognize your skin does not reflect temperatures accurately. 

An important part of both science, philosophy and logic is recognizing that your observations are just observations, and only mean things when you set up some axioms you hold to be true.

&gt;In the same way, the external, physical world is a system you believe to correlate with the senses, but can't prove.

Nothing can be proved, ever. You can only have increasing levels of ""I am sure this is reflective of reality"". This still requires your mind and senses being part of the physical world and there is no alternative; the physical world is literally defined as ""things that can be interacted with"". You may not know it interacts with you, a la serious hallucinations or just not able to sense it, but it still does.

A closed system, however, by definition, cannot ever be interacted with. Not just for all intents and purposes, but by definition, it does not exist and can not exist. 

Based on these definitions of physical and real, your mind MUST be real, along with ALL observations you make, even hallucinations, even if they aren't what you think they are. An actual monster appearing infront of me, or just neurons firing strangely; either way, the observation itself is real.

If we were hyper-advanced biological computers, we wouldn't know what truly free will would feel like anyway, so this can't be argued either way. We have no frame of reference for free will.

&gt;You have the random effects of radiation and quantum mechanics that can certainly change stuff.

Really? I didn't know that. Even then, it's outside the scope of a philosophical argument, especially because it is not a well known, set in stone area of science (as far as I know).

&gt;Because they cause interactions, we can detect and measure them and turn them into a predictable mathematical model using science. Thus, ""non-physical"" can be defined as something non-interactable. Since non-interactable objects can, by definition, never do anything to you, never influence your body, your mind, the world around you, for all intensive purposes (and actually by definition) they don't exist. Thus, ONLY physical systems exist.

I would argue that this proves that we can't know about the existence of physical systems. You can interact with them, using the mediation of your body, but you cannot measure them, observe them, or access them in any way.

Of course, that sounds like complete nonsense. Maybe right now you're thinking that you can observe them fairly easily. When you run your hand across a sheet of ice, you can feel how cold it is. You can feel how smooth it is, and how your hand glides on it. You can clearly see how it is slightly transparent, the surface beneath it obvious. When you put pressure on it, you can hear the crisp cracking, and notice the spiderwebs spreading out from beneath your hand.

But that ice is not a physical object, is it? It is your mind's conception of that ice. It is merely suggestive, not informative. Still, you could test the ice. You can try melting it, to see if water appears. You can check it under an electron microscope. You can see if it reacts the right way chemically. But you can't observe those results directly as physical objects either.

What's the point of this? The mathematical models, the advanced tools, they all say that the world is as science deems it to be. But how can you be sure you aren't like a person with schizophrenia, who see their delusions as perfectly real? How can you be sure when simply taking drugs can completely change your perceptions of the world? How can you be sure, when you could be a brain floating in a thermodynamic soup that provides the inputs you would expect, and you would never be able to truly know?

Here's a simple experiment, which you probably have done accidentally. Put one hand in a bowl of hot water, and the other in a bowl of cold water. After holding them there for 30 seconds, put them both in a bowl of lukewarm water. You clearly directly observe a result that doesn't fit our physical understanding of the world (it's still explained by it, though).

I have a really good dialogue in a pdf exactly on this topic. I can link it if you want.

&gt;If you know what a closed system is, then a truly, 100% closed system, does not exist to other systems regardless of their state. It cannot be interacted with, measured, observed, ect. and so is not ""real"". Thus, free will must be defined as a physical process.

In the same way, the external, physical world is a system you believe to correlate with the senses, but can't prove.",evenemptier

She listened to the waves of laughter emanating from below, the sounds of joy and life, and her heart ached.

“Maybe,” she thought to herself, “maybe today will be the day.”

For days and months and years she has tried to imitate the power of the Sun. Not a day passes by where she doesn’t long to be a part of the warm, sparkling joy that Sun's powers seem to bring to the Earth. When Sun arrives, people surround him; flowers dance and showcase their glimmering colors, the wind flows with music, and life seems to blossom in his presence. However, every time she tries to provide the same joy to the people on Earth, they would seek shelter and the music would die and the laughter would melt away until she heard nothing but the drops of her curse. And every time this happened, her heart would be drenched in jealousy and hurt. 

And the tears would pour.

One day, as she wept, she heard a voice speaking kindly through her storm.

“Why are you unhappy?” the voice asked. 

She looked down and saw a tall Sequoia tree peering at her with concern.

“I don’t understand why I can’t bring happiness the way Sun does. Why am I plagued with this wretched curse? No matter where I go, people leave. They don’t want to see me; they don’t want me around. The music drizzles to a silence… the skies around me, they turn gray. I don’t provide joy the way Sun does. I am not good. I am weak. I will never be as great as Sun.""

Sequoia looked up and smiled gently. Swaying his branches from side to side, he let out a soft, gentle chuckle. “Don’t you see? You possess a power so unique to you that nobody, not even the Sun, can own.” He gestured to the flowers below him. ""The rain you provide to the Earth feeds the soil and plants and rivers (and me!) that people delight in. Sure, you see them outside and playing in the Sun when he arrives, but you’re not seeing the joy you’re bringing with the gifts you provide. Over there, through that window, is a family gathered together around a fire, cozily lounging in their house sharing laughter and mugs of hot cocoa, coming together because of you. Because of your power. Because of the soothing music of rain drops pattering against their rooftops. You are Cloud, the Goddess of Rain! Your powers are a gift, not a curse. Only you possess this beautiful ability. You are a goddess. You were created with reason and intention. The Earth would be nothing if you kept your remarkable abilities to yourself. I wish you could see your own beauty.”",PracticemakesPurfkt2

The scientist smiled to himself.  ""That's right, Jim.  Anything you can think of.""

Jim had long since given up asking how or why.  To be completely honest, he didn't really believe it would work.  But, the poster had offered $5,000 to anyone willing to participate in the experiment, and Jim sorely needed the money.  He was willing to try just about anything at this point.

The doctor offered him a small, purple pill, which Jim swallowed without hesitation.  He sat still for a moment, waiting to feel something.

""Uh, Doc?  I don't think it's working.""

The man smiled eerily.  ""Oh, that wasn't the medication,"" he said, a bit too much cheer in his voice.  ""That was the anesthetic.  Sweet dreams, see you on the other side.""

Before Jim could even think about protesting, he felt his limbs go slack.  His vision clouded over, and his thoughts grew muddled.  He passed out.

...

When he was alone, he was trapped in a blindingly white room.  There was no furniture, no markings, nothing but 4 blank walls.  One of them slid open to reveal a window, with the doctor standing on the other side.  He held a clipboard, and was furiously taking notes.  He finally looked up.

And as soon as he did, his face dropped.

""You're kidding,"" he said.  ""I mean, I'm glad it worked and all, but... seriously?""

Jim looked down at his body, which was now covered in gray fur.  His lean body was held up by comically thin legs, which were in turn supported by oversized feet.  He looked back up to face the window, his voice full of concern:

""Eh... what's up, Doc?""",ShutainzuGeito

[EU] Indiana Jones and the Sword of Kings,Scherazade,"Professor Jones swore and switched the radio off. He stared out of the car window watching the rain-drenched countryside pass by.

""Hey, I like that,"" his companion said, switching it back on.  The car was filled with ""She loves you, yeah yeah yeah.""

""It's garbage,"" Jones replied. ""Kids these days, they can't appreciate good music, proper music. Glenn Miller, Benny Goodman, you know.""

""Times change, Professor Jones,"" Rachel replied. ""It's the Sixties now, in case you hadn't noticed. Look, we've arrived.""  She pulled off the road into a field and parked the car beside a VW minibus painted in bright pink, with psychedelic flowers all over it.  Jones got out of the car and groaned, stretching to get the cricks out of his back. He was getting too old for this, but somehow the chase never failed to lure him. And at least there are no snakes in Cumbria.

The dig site was a few miles east of Carlisle, close to Hadrian's Wall and a mile south of the old Roman fort of Castlesteads. All of Jones's research pointed here; Castlesteads was the site of Camboglanna; the fortress of a warlord in post-Roman Britain whose exploits Jones had been researching for the past dozen years.

His research linked this place with many others across the west of England, and Wales. Gwynedd. Gwent. Cornwall. Somerset. But here, in the cold north-west border country, here, he was sure, was the site of Camlann, his warlord's last battle.

Jones followed Rachel across the field to where a group of people were busy at the dig-site.  A young man dressed in recycled army gear and black wellington boots approached them. ""You must be Professor Jones,"" he said, enthusiastically shaking the American's hand. ""I'm Frank Graham.""

""Ah, you're the Roman expert?""

Frank blushed. ""Hardly an expert, really. Just an enthusiast.  Follow me, I think you'll be interested in what we've found so far.""  He led Jones to a large tent where inside people worked at makeshift tables with trays where they were painstakingly cleaning and recording artifacts from the site.

""There's no doubt that a battle was fought here, Professor. Your calculation of the exact spot was perfect."" Frank pointed towards a table littered with bone fragments.  ""We've pulled up a lot of human remains here, many of the bones showing signs of traumatic injury. Wounds caused by axes or swords.  Lots of fragments of armour and weapons, much of it damaged in the same way.""

""Can you date it?"" Jones asked.

""Post-Roman for sure, though there's some Roman armour; it was common for British soldiers of the time to model themselves on old Roman legions and Roman armour would have been passed down as family heirlooms. But we're also seeing artifacts of a later style; Germanic, early Saxon. I'd date this haul to around late 5th, early 6th century.""

Jones grinned. ""Perfect,"" he said.  ""Have you found the sword yet?""

Frank shrugged and showed him to another table. This one was heaving with weapons; fragments of sword blades, axe heads, arrow-tips. All of them rusted and decayed almost beyond recognition.

Jones picked up one of the blades and turned it over. ""It won't be here, on the battlefield,"" he said. ""It was taken somewhere, not too far away, and cast into a lake. We need to find that lake.""

Frank shook his head. ""There aren't any lakes around here,"" he said.

""There was one, fifteen hundred years ago,"" Jones replied.  ""Get me a map.""

That evening he sat in a pub in Brampton, drinking the local ale with Frank, Rachel and the rest of the archaeologists; most of them students from Newcastle University. A large Ordnance Survey map was spread out over the table.

""There *is* a lake!"" Jones exclaimed, jabbing his finger at the map. ""Look!"" There was an unmistakable patch of blue on the map.

""Talkin Tarn,"" Frank said. ""That's about three miles from the battle site.""

""That's it,"" Jones said. ""That's definitely it.""

Three days later, having acquired permission from the local landowner, the archaeologists began a new survey. Rachel wanted to arrange divers to investigate the Tarn itself but Jones persuaded her that it would be a waste of time.  ""A man couldn't throw a sword out into the middle of the lake, it would be close to the edge,"" he pointed out. ""And the land around it has been drained since then, so the tarn is smaller now than it would have been then. The sword will more likely be in the ground than the water.""

The site chosen was on the north-east side of the Tarn. Jones watched impatiently as the archeologists marched up and down with their geophysical sensors, plotting what lay beneath the grass and soil. Every evening they studied the results and came up with nothing.

""There's nothing here,"" Rachel said.

""There is,"" Jones replied. ""Just one sword. A small thing.  Look. You can see where the original shoreline of the lake used to be; we need to focus our attention just inside that.""

So they did. And on the sixth day, the geophysics team found something. So small it was almost overlooked. Just a tiny dark speck in the ground.  ""We dig there,"" Jones said.

They dug a trench the following day and after moving what seemed like six tons of dirt, one of the archaeologists gave a shout. ""I've found something!""

Everyone rushed over to look, but the something turned out to be a piece of an old boat, no more than a hundred years old. When it was moved out of the way, Jones sat in the trench and sighed.  Rachel sat beside him.

""Am I wasting my time?"" he asked her. ""Maybe it's all rotted away like those swords from the battle site.""

Rachel reached out and held his hand. ""Maybe there never was a sword to begin with. Maybe it's just a story after all.""

Jones stood up and picked up a trowel. ""And what if it isn't?"" He crouched in the trench and started to scrape away the soil beneath where the fragment of the boat had rested.

After a few minutes, he sighed, stood up and dropped the trowel on the ground.

""I think it's time to call it a day,"" he said. ""I'm too old for this now. Even if the sword is here, we could dig for decades and never find it.  But someone will, one day.""  He climbed out of the trench and paused, holding out his hand. Rachel took it and followed him. ""Come on, lets go get a beer.""

Fifty years later, all trace of Jones's archaeological dig at the Tarn was gone and the site was now a country park and sailing club. Two workmen with a JCB were digging a ditch close to the Tarn to lay a drainage pipe when the machine suddenly came to an unexplained halt.  While one of them tinkered with the engine, the other jumped down into the ditch where the glinting of something metallic had caught his eye.

He reached down and picked it up, his eyes going wide. It was a sword of shining steel, as sharp as the day it was forged.  As he picked it up, he heard, or rather, he *felt* the Tarn calling to him.  As though in a trance, he hurled the sword out over the water.

As he did so, an arm rose up from the water, caught the sword and carried it down into the Tarn's dark depths.

""Did you see that?"" one workman said to the other.

""No. And neither did you.""

"[WP] You can turn back time by up to 24 hours, but only by committing an absolutely appalling crime. Over time you start to become desensitized to everything you've done...",Sdavis2911,"  The view from the tiny window was drab and lacking, but it seemed to fit right into the appearance of my soul. It was almost time for the hardest part of my day, the social hour. Every day for one hour I have to plaster on my mask of feelings and pretend to like other people. I cringed when I heard the chime. It was time. I stepped over to the mirror and paused, taking a moment to paint my smile on before even leaving my room. After a deep breath, I made my way to the door and flung it open, smiling.

  The social hour was awful. Music, dancing, talking. Blech. I could literally gag at the thought. You know, I didn't always used to be like this. I remember in high school I was one of the popular kids and loved hanging out with my friends. I was even the quarterback on the football team and, in all its cliché glory, I dated the captain of the cheerleader squad. I was happy. Well, I was happy the first time I did it. The second time, I had changed, though.

  Let me back up a bit. See, I have this ability to go back in time. As crazy as it sounds, I found an actual genie lamp while digging through an attic in an abandoned house. I had blown my first two wishes so I thought I would be clever and wish to be able to go back in time 24 hours at a time. I made a huge mistake. My wish was granted, but it came at the cost of murder. I had to kill someone to go back 24 hours. The first time it was very hard on me. I picked the shadiest looking creep I could find, in an alley, but I still hesitated before plunging the knife into his chest. Even that creep that had probably just sold laced drugs to some poor sap not 10 minutes before. Over time, it became easier. I told myself that even though I was murdering someone, when I went back in time they would no longer be dead so it was okay. That worked for a little while, until I accidentally killed someone. That changed everything. From then on, I found it easier and easier. Random stranger holding a birthday cake? Piece of cake. Mother pushing a stroller? Like taking candy from a baby. You get the point.

  I finally made it back to the best years of my life. I was so excited when I woke up in my old bed, my first day of senior year. I hopped out of bed, rummaged through my old closet and took way too long reminiscing while looking at my old band shirts. I found my favorite shirt and got dressed. I took so long that it even made me late for that first day. It turns out, that changed everything.

  I stared at the empty table in front of me, some patients starting to go back to their own rooms. It was finally over, I could return to my own safe haven. Sometimes I wonder how my life would have turned out differently with every choice that I made, but just when I start to think I feel something again, I shove it deep inside and never think of it again. I like my tiny window in my small grey room. It gives me something to look at instead of staying in my own head.",ImAwomanAMA

Glen stepped tot he bar and paid for an ale and some grub. Taking a seat at the table next tot he chatting merchants he cleared his throats. ""Scuse me good sirs, if I may intrude?""

The man who'd been getting japed at turned. ""You may stranger. Welcome Papsmer Township. What would ye ask of us?""

""I've no intent to be an eaves dropper, but I could nae help o'er hear your talk of markets and future. If it's not too intrusive, I'm curious to know more.""

The man who'd been japing smiled. ""Yes. Perhaps you can lend an outsider perspective to all this. Rab Redsmith here, he's recently taken over his father's smithy, and has a mind to transition from the classic crafting of blades both mundane and enchanted, to these new fangled flint locks. I don't see such a soft man's weapon ever catching on, do ye?""

Perking up, Glen turned to Rab. ""Am I to understand sir, that yer making enchanted rifles?""

""Aye, and pistols too.""

""Well sir, if you'll tell me the location of your shop, then come the morrow I'd like to take a closer look at your wares.""

The jolly man scowled ""Ye mean t'say you'd actually consider buying one of those inelegant noise makers.""

Smiling Glen shook his head. ""Not quite sir. I mean, that if I find the merchandise worthy, I mean to arrange a rather large order on behalf of my liege lord.""

The other men around the table fell still. ""Who might that be?"" Rab asked cautiously.

""Why Duke Carlton Tudor, the Commander of the King's Army Master Redsmith."" The look of budding joy on Redsmith's face was nearly as sweet as the sullen defeat on that of his rival.

Later that night, after dinner, more ale and arrangements to meet in the afternoon, Glen sat in his cot and smiled up into the shadows of his room. It seemed like The Duke's revolt was off to a much better start than either of them might have imagined.",GreggoryBasore

[EU][OT] Brian Jacques' Redwall pastiche,alexcore88,"Chapter 1

Early morning gusts of cool air whipped up miniature whirlwinds of golden brown leaves as swirls of morning fog whirled aimlessly around trees and bushes alike in the glorious forest of Mossflower. Haushinka the squirrel maid strolled with a carefree nonchalance through the main gate of Redwall Abbey surrounded by fellow beasts, singing gaily with their friends. 

The newly appointed Abbot of the wondrous Abbey lay peacefully against an old, upturned wheelbarrow in the recently replanted orchard, his hand resting upon his brow, protecting his eyes from the magnificent rising sun's rays as he watched the collection of shrews, mice, otters, squirrels and moles heading out onto the North Path and into the woods. He was lying next to the new bell ringer, a handsome squirrel named Hamlyn, who had only recently joined the Abbey after years of adventuring round the lands surrounding Mossflower.

'It surely is a perfect day for a foraging party to head out, wouldn't you agree Father?' Hamlyn acknowledged, reflectively wiping a bead of glistening sweat from his forehead. Hamlyn had settled into the Abbey amazingly well, getting used to life there exceedingly quickly, and had grown very popular among the Abbey babes due to his humorous character. He was slightly stocky with a roguish smile, which nearly always got him whatever it was that he wanted. The Abbot acknowledged his comment with a small gleeful giggle, 'Only because you can't wait for them to get back with your dinner you glutton!' he chortled.
 
Haushinka spotted several large, ripe whortleberry bushes in an opening nearby and nimbly hopped over, whilst her good mole-friend, Wilbur, ambled along behind. Filling their study wicker baskets and more was not a hard chore with the superb array of good, healthy fruit and vegetables available to them in the wonderful forest.

'Hmmm, these do certainly look lovely, don't they Haushinka?' Wilbur choked whilst wiping juices from around his mouth.

'Don't you mean taste lovely!' exclaimed Haushinka watching her friend gorge himself on even more of the large delicious berries. Both beasts laughed merrily whilst catching up with the rest of their friends. It was going to take them a good part of an hour's steady walk to reach their destination, Brimble Farm, a large farm owned by many friendly hedgehogs.

Hogwife Brimble heard the foragers coming long before she actually saw them strolling out of the woods in joyful conversation with each other, shouting and frolicking. Many hedgehogs, young and old, soon appeared out of the ramshackle huts in the middle of the large farm wondering what was going on and upon seeing their old friends, ran to greet them.

'Good afternoon to ye Haushinka, yer as pretty as I ever saw ye!' Hogwife Brimble said as she heartily hugged her dear friend.

'Good afternoon to you to, ma'am,' she replied courteously.

'Do not call me ma'am!' scalded Hogwife Brimble mockingly, trying hard to repress a small chuckle. 'Who's up for a spot of tea?' she inquired airily, raising her voice over the crescendo of jubilant greetings so as to be heard. After receiving a chorus of optimistic and joyous replies she dashed off to the kitchen, dragging along a few babes behind her, much to their obvious dismay. 

Following a great deal of merriment, the tea was brought outside by the babes and the Hogwife. The meal consisted of many different pies and pastries and was followed by plenty of freshly baked scones along with all kinds of deliciously flavoured jams, with blackcurrant juice and crisp, cold water to wash it all down. It went down superbly with all those beasts present and many vigorous congratulations were heaped upon the Hogwife for her impressive culinary skills.

'Oh, bless yer hearts! It wasn't all me though, the babes did help with a lot of it,' she protested, much to the squealing delight of the small ones she gestured amiably towards, many of whom were liberally smeared with various jams and marmalades.

'My gosh!' exclaimed Haushinka, 'it's well past noon; they will be expecting us back at the Abbey any time now. I'm really sorry everyone, but we must get going as soon as possible!' This statement was met with much uproar and disappointment but the Skipper of the otters soon got the Redwallers moving and ready to leave the gracious company of the hogs. The Abbey dwellers were soon on their way back to the Abbey after many thanks and goodbyes were said all round, yet Skipper momentarily hung back unnoticed and approached the Hogwife with a concerned look upon his face.

'Do you sense something's wrong around these parts?' he questioned.

'Aye. Didn't want to say anything whilst yer lot were 'ere, but aye. Can't describe it though, but something's definitely not right hereabouts.'

'Yeah, know what ye mean,' Skipper whispered back, 'I've got to go now; a'fore they realise I'm not there. If anything untoward does happen, always remember you're welcome in the Abbey. And thanks again for the tea.'

'Thank ye Skipper, I'll surely come if something does happen, thank ye,' she affirmed, waving after Skipper who was now dashing to catch up with his friends.

Throughout the day an unimaginable evil far had passed through the boundary of Mossflower country and was malevolently creeping towards the Abbey with one purpose in mind – the utter destruction of everything that stood before it. 

The evil hadn't gone unnoticed however, many a beast had sensed it, but those few unfortunate enough to have seen it had not returned to their dwellings to warn others of what danger was entering the peaceful woodland. And still it crept forever onward, nothing getting in its way.

[WP] As a mob boss you open several restaurants in a large city to launder money. The problem- each restaurant becomes wildly successful.,desert_cow,"Moving kilos of cocaine is easy as selling candy to a baby. Sticking a .22 in a truck driver's face and unloading their goods is easy. Running and managing a brothel is the world's oldest management position. But I'll tell you what ain't easy, hiding piles of cash the family earns from the Feds. 

The family had built a reputation as one of the highest earning families around the city. Everyone in the city, including the feds, knew how much money the family was earning. 

One night we got a phone call from Uncle Paulie. Uncle Paulie was calling from jail. He had gotten pinched with nearly $5m in a briefcase. Papa was not happy that we could have been this sloppy, but the reality is moving piles of cash isn't easy. Depending on how this case plays out, the family could have some real problems on hand. 

My two older brothers were always intended to join the family business. Papa was determined for me to get a college degree. ""Go become a lawyer or doctor or something"" he'd say.

The problem was that I spent more time in the kitchen than in the classroom. My brother's vices were gambling and drinking. My vice was a fresh sautéed tomato sauce. When Papa would see me in the kitchen with Mama he would shake his head in disgust. His son would never become a doctor or a lawyer to bring the family into legitimacy. 

When Uncle Paulie was going through trial, Papa pulled together the family to paint the brutal reality of our situation. We had millions of dollars that we needed to ""clean"" and we needed a way to do it fast. The court case may take as long as a year. What could we do?

""Let's open restaurants to launder the cash, Papa."" 

""There's no way that'd work, we need a place that can actually turn through a high amount of revenue. A stupid restaurant won't help.""

For the first time in my life, I acted entirely on my own. I had been saving up money here and there, having enough to put a small down payment to rent out a store front. I had enough money for about 1 month's rent, an oven, and I could take some ingredients from Mama. 

I opened up a small pizzeria in downtown. For days no one would stop in my store. Eventually, a few of Papa's soldiers would stop by for a bite in between their criminal activities. The guys really enjoyed the pizza, they started asking if they could buy another pie and take it home for their families. 

Soon more people that I didn't recognize would stop by and buy pizza. People started calling in and I hired a young boy to deliver the pizza. To my astonishment, in a few short months business was booming. 

Uncle Paulie's court case was looking bleak. I stopped by home and showed Papa my books. His face slowly started to smile, he could see the opportunity now. I told him of the people that were crazy enough to call in a pizza order and pay for some young boy to deliver that pizza. ""So you could sell pizza to people who aren't even in the store?"" he asked. ""Yes, of course. That's how I sell many pizzas every day!"". 

He saw something far bigger than I could grasp. He saw a pizza network that anyone could buy a pizza from and have it to their home within 30 minutes. He saw a pizza empire. A legitimate, cash laundering machine for the family. 

""How much money would it take to start 25 more of these pizzerias?""

Wow. I hadn't contemplated making that much pizza before. ""I don't know, maybe a million dollars?"". ""Done"" he replied. 

I was thrilled to help the family and being working so closely with my Papa. We started working on the business plan for expansion. We needed a name. ""How about Papa John's?"" I said... ",aol1991
[WP] As a mob boss you open several restaurants in a large city to launder money. The problem- each restaurant becomes wildly successful.,desert_cow,"""Let me get this straight, you're telling me that EVERY SINGLE ONE of the restaurants is at the top of the list?! Who the hell did I put in charge of them to make sure everything went according to plan?"" I said, breathing heavily.

""Umm that would be you, sir,"" squeaked out the skinny figure fidgeting in front of me. He coughed several times and slowly backed away as I looked at him in disgust. Whatever I had once seen in this fool I was clearly mistaken on.

The silence lingered on for several minutes. If I was a more caring man I might wonder if the man before me was about to have a heart attack, such was the degree of his shaking.

""Just. . .get out,"" I said finally. It wasn't worth my time.

""Sir, pardon my intrusion, but wouldn't the restaurants making tons of money be a good thing?"" That was my secretary. She was a little ditzy, but I liked it that way. I never had to skirt around anything.

""And that is why I'm the boss,"" I said sharply.

While at first it would seem like it was a good idea, the restaurants success was actually detrimental in the long run, as it would attract more attention. Much safer to have restaurants that are just successful enough that they pay for themselves. If anyone ever found out that I was the one in charge of them, well, I'd already made sure that wouldn't happen. I'd taken several precautions, including putting the deeds in the names of several of my subordinates.

I smiled at the thought. It was a cold, cruel smile, completely devoid of humor and life. It was the smile of a successful businessman.

The smile, however grotesque it was, disappeared in an instant. I had momentarily forgotten the issue at hand. I ground my teeth together in frustration. I had to think of something.

By the next day I still didn't have anything figured out when I walked into the debriefing meeting we had each morning at 10 o'clock sharp.

I must have zoned out, for when I looked up from where I had been examining my hands everyone was staring at me.

""Uhh, Chief?""

I waved my hand, letting them know they could continue. I man off to my left began speaking about the restaurants, and their success.

I narrowed my eyes as I listened to him speak, as well as everyone else nodding along. Finally I could take it no more.

""How can none of you realize that this is a bad thing?"" I interjected heatedly.

Again they were looking at me, but I might them with a fiery gaze, staring each person down until they broke eye contact. Everyone new people respected power, and that's just how I ruled this 'company'.

""It's not, you're just paranoid."" Several people laughed at that and I narrowed my eyes at the speaker. He was the one person who was always challenging me, always trying to take my position. His name was Ford, and we hated each other with a passion.

""Maybe I am."" When I spoke my voice was a hoarse whisper, but it commanded the whole room's attention. ""But I haven't been caught yet, so it seems to be working.""

The awkward silence stretched on.

Suddenly there was a knock at the door.

Before it anyone could move it was thrown wide open and in walked three police officers. I clenched my fists so tightly I drew blood. There was only one thing they could be here for.

""I'm here to arrest one, Jenson Ford,"" said the head officer.

I stood up, garnering everyone's attention for the third time in the last half hour.

""That's him,"" I said bluntly, pointing at my enemy with a blank face.

""Sorry to bother you. We had reports he was using a restaurant downtown to launder money,"" the head officer said politely.

No one spoke as Ford was taken away before us. It had happened before, it would happen again. But no one betrayed each other. It was the rule of the mob.

When I was sure they had left I slammed my hands down on the table. When I spoke my voice was a growl, ""Now who doesn't think that this is a bad thing.""",immatx

[WP] Write a story where the plot is based on some song lyrics,ggandymann,"The city lights barely illuminated the vast sails of the pirate ship. The portcullis was down, the harbor abandoned, the people huddled together in the caves leading into the mountain. Yala squared her shoulders and breathed deeply. She was standing at the center of the top wall, visible to the soldiers below and behind her. Prince Wilhelm stood next to her. 


“They won’t wait.” His voice was low, but penetrated the nervous silence around them. Soldiers shuffled their feet to keep warm, if not calm. “And we can’t take them,” he whispered the last, but the bitterness was sharp and carrying.

 
“I’m sure the King has a plan,” Yala said, speaking louder than necessary. Couriers ran to and from the castle bringing constant updates to the war room where the King and the Crown Prince had collected the generals around them. Wilhelm stood outside, as visible as possible, to keep spirits up among the men. 


He turned to her, his piercing eyes seeing through her bravado with ease. Outside the castle walls she could see the water moving and creatures crawling out, the unexpected ally to the pirate. It made sense that someone who cared only for wealth would ally with someone who cared only for flesh. Yala suppressed a shudder. 


The mountains behind the castle came alive with the pale blue lights of the ghosts of their ancestors. They had come to lead those who would fall into their mountain sleep. Shouts went up around them, a mix of fear and determination. The ghosts howled along. Terrible shrieks from the beings below made the soldiers shiver, but it didn’t send them running. The creatures advanced.


“They won’t wait for a plan.” Wilhelm brushed past her with determined steps, soldiers moving to the side and Yala could see the worry on their faces when they were illuminated by his shining silver crown. Yala ran to keep up with him, grateful that the King came onto the castle walls in that moment. 


Wilhelm made his way through the soldiers and into the castle, tracking winter mud over the colorful carpets that lined the halls. The candles flickered over the paintings they ran past, and Yala sighed to herself. They hadn’t expected this attack, if they had they wouldn’t have been in the winter castle with only a minimum guard. Her legs felt heavy as she followed Wilhelm through the halls and down the stairs. 


“Where are we going?”


“We can’t win in a fight.” He repeated, not slowing his pace in the last and not turning to look at her. “We need to find another way.”


“What other way can there be?” 


“He has to have some way to control the creatures. We need to find it.”


“You want to go out there?! Then you need more guards!”


“The guards have to protect the people!” He finally turned to her, anger in his voice and tears in his eyes. “I would order you to stay if I believed for a second that you would listen.”


 Yala stopped and stared at him, the weight of hopelessness settling hard on her shoulders. No one had much of a chance, and the royal families least of all. The Pirate King would never expect them to run straight at him, being a near certainty of death, but it might be crazy enough to give them an advantage.


“Lead the way, then.”


**
The world had changed when they exited beneath the castle walls. Screams erupted from above them and the creatures were scuttling up the words, intent on destruction. Yala grabbed Wilhelms arm to keep him from running straight at them. He turned and ran towards the harbor, keeping to the sides of the mountain to be less visible. His crown had been discarded inside the castle.
Arrows flitted down from the castle, a few hitting the near invisible backs of the running creatures. Torch-fires danced in drawn swords as the few, but valiant, defenders met the fight head on. They ran towards the ship. 


They were just leaving the shore, crouched down in an abandoned fishing boat, when everything changed. The defenders on the castle walls were using fire along with their swords to fight of the creatures. Barrels of oils and torches being passed around to light arrows and staffs. The pirate ship fired its cannons and one hit an oil barrow on the wall. People were thrown along with the stones, and the dark creatures crawled over the fallen heaps. They were in.


The pirates abandoned their ship at last, storming towards the castle with gleeful shouts, lighting fires along the way. Yala rowed towards the pirate ship, hoping against hope that something magical could save those who were still standing. 
Creatures moved in the ocean beneath them, crowding around the ship in a protective manner, and Yala was trying to see a way to cross them when she heard Wilhelm give a stifled shout. She turned to the castle just in time to see the Pirate King raise his sword triumphantly upon the castle wall. The other hand was holding a human head.


Above the castle, hundreds of ghosts howled their displeasure while being led away towards the mountains. Their blue light made their faces visible even from the ocean, and Yala felt her legs give away when she recognized the royal family. They were too late.


She used the oar to push away from the ship, towards the open water, and fastened her eyes upon the fallen castle walls. Wilhelm was the only one who could organize a counter-attack, she had to bring him to the Dukes. As their world came to an end around them, Yala grabbed Wilhelm’s hand and bowed her head over it. 


“You’re the king, now.” She glanced up at him to see him shaking his head in protest, tears running down his face as he tried to pull away from her. 


“I failed,” he whispered. “I can’t be king.”


The city raged around them, blue apparitions raced towards the mountains as their people were slaughtered, the screams echoing over the unsettled sea. The water lapping at their feet jolted them with just enough cold to keep them sensible.


“You’re my King.” 


She moved closer and wrapped her arms around him, allowing him to weep as the ocean carried them away.

""I don't know.""

""Really? You don't know? So you're just winging it?""

""I reckon that I'll lose sight of myself if I make myself concentrate on a concrete goal. I mean, my dad really wanted me to go to med school, but I don't want him to define me either.""

""Yeah, I understand that, but surely you can at least let him know that? Get a bit of closure on that front?"" I took another drag, considering.

""I could. I should. But I can't bring myself to do it. I'm worried that he'll be disappointed in me. You know, for wasting my potential."" John nodded sagely, a serious look on his face.

""Maybe you haven't wasted your potential. I think that you've still got a lot of options open to you, even after all the times you've screwed up.""

""Really? 'Cos I've screwed up a lot.""

""Yeah, but the more you fail, the more you learn from you mistakes. Surely that's an angle you can play? So long as you keep on going, you'll be fine.""

""I suppose that you're right man. Shit, you're like my own personal guardian angel. You've even got a name to fit."" That elicited a short chuckle from him.

""See, this is what I'm talking about. When you're positive, you've got a winning personality. And, as for being a guardian angel, I'm not sure about that. I've had my own share of struggles, I've had to make compromises that I didn't want to, I've failed countless times, but I've made it through. You should be able to too. The only thing stopping you, is you, and you can work around that.""

""Yeah, at the very least, I can try.""

""That's the spirit! You're already turning your negative attitude around. I'm sure that you'll make it. And hey, it's not like many people make it immediately. You might fail today, and for a while, but you'll keep improving, and if you play the long game, then you'll make it, big time. Just focus on that, and you'll be fine.""

""Basically, 'It's not over because I've failed, it's just another rung on the ladder up'?""

""Yeah. Think that every time, and you'll be able to push forwards.""

""Thanks man, you really gave me an interesting perspective. I'll try to keep in that mindset. Anyway, I've got a job interview soon, so I'll see you around, 'kay?"" He waved as I left, and I waved back, smiling genuinely, for what felt like the first time in years.

[WP] Write a story where the plot is based on some song lyrics,ggandymann,"The man sat quietly, rocking back and forth on the floor. His dirty, tangled hair fell in front of his face, hiding the bruises from the outside world. The room was dark and quiet; no windows, no light shining in. Nothing to stimulate the man in any way. He just sat there, rocking, whispering to himself. ""No sleep. No dream. No nightmare. No sleep. No dream. No nightmare."" 

Sporadically, the man is taken from the room, and led through twisting corridors and rooms that all looked the same. Men with lab coats and men with suits whisper in his ear; but he does not respond. Back to his room he goes; back to his cell; his little tin can. 

Another day, or was it another night? The man doesn't know. He touches the scars on his face, on the sides of his head; his head reminds him of the pain. The shocking. The knives. 

The door creaks open; a sliver of light shining through. The man crawls towards it, carefully. With a gentle push, light floods the room, and hope fills his heart. There was life before this place. And there will be life after. 

He runs through he halls, opening doors along the way. Others join in, running free, laughing and skipping. They find familiar rooms with familiar tools; knives and mallets and needles and ropes. The men in suits and coats scream, they beg for mercy, for life. 

The man finds himself in a room, looking at himself. His hands stained red, his clothes splattered with blood. He holds a scalpel in his hand, blood dripping to the floor. 

He looks at the man behind him, tied up, begging. After all he had done, he had the nerve to beg. *Please don't kill me*, he was begging. 

""Kill..."" the man said. ""Such a friendly word.""

She would make us read scripture everyday. She told us that a Second War would come, and the end times would come. Now that I'm an adult, I can't believe that no one looked into her past. She was a twitchy crazy old woman.

The day WWII happened, she began to slip from reality, but at first it made the other kids happy. She was nicer, and a lot more forgiving. She'd forgive me for stealing a cookie. She allowed us to chat with outside friends for once. I thought that things were getting better. 

But then Winter came. She took us to the forests for a camping trip. It was fun, we went hunting, we laughed and even had smores. Then one afternoon, she gave us the wine. The blood like liquid was sloshing in the Grail as she passed it around to the kids. 

""Kids. God's judgement is upon us. If you wish to truly be in his loving light, drink of his blood"" she said with a bit of her off putting kindness. 

I hated the wine, so I didn't drink it. We told ghost stories and we went to bed as a snow storm raged on. When I woke up cops surrounded me. It turned out she had poisoned the wine. And used an old hunting knife on herself. I was the only survivor. 

The kids were blue skinned, looks of pain etched on their faces. I felt like I wanted to barf. It's an image forever etched into my mind. 

The police later gave to my new parents. But I was never the same. Always twitchy. And never trusting. It took me years to recover from the PTSD. 

That's why sister, don't do what my parents had done. Don't take your kids to this place. These walls still hold blood and horror. The souls of these kids still haunt these halls. Never allowed to rest in peace. 

Please don't take them, to the ""house of the rising sun"". Her kids are just as crazy. They still run the orphanage. Nothing has changed. It ruined me. I wasn't a lucky one. ",mcgrathc09
[WP] Write a story where the plot is based on some song lyrics,ggandymann,"How did I wind up in this jail cell you may ask? Well it started like any other Wednesday night, I was sitting in the big arm chair in the living room watching an old rerun of cops. Suddenly there was a loud knock at the door, I didn't think much of it my girlfriend was coming over and I was expecting a pizza. But man when I opened that door something different was waiting for me, my next door neighbor was standing there wearing practically nothing, she's flirting hardcore with me and just when I'm about to break the pizza arrives. I'm a bit of an idiot and an overly polite guy so I invite her in to have a slice, that was my first mistake. Having ""accidentally"" dropped some sauce onto her top she went into the bathroom to wash it off, however when she came out a few minutes later she wasn't wearing anything but a towel and told me she was going to take a shower. My second mistake happened soon afterwards as I went in quickly to get my pill case, she was just getting out of the shower and was rubbing up against me in a very nonchalant way, inconspicuous if you ask me trying to convince me it was unintentional. Finally I gave up holding back, I was horny and we were alone I pushed her up against the wall and kissed her. We began rolling around the ground making love when all of a sudden I hear a click. I quickly turn around to see my girlfriend standing above us with a camera, I had forgotten I had given her an extra key and she had caught me red handed, and on camera banging my neighbor on the bathroom floor. Suddenly I snap and grab for the camera, she pulls back and as she runs for the door I tackle her, and my neighbor is running out the door presumably to call the cops because they got there way faster than they should have. With her shoulders pinned against the ground I pick up the camera and toss it to the ground and proceed to smash it with a hammer. It only felt like a few seconds but was probably more likely five minutes before some police officers are pulling me off of her. I'm now serving twenty years on a charge of domestic violence and rape. Moral of the story kids, if you're going to sleep around don't give your girlfriend a key to your place. ",Lunardoost

As light as a star in the night’s sky captain Carters space capsule shone brightly even in the midday sun as it re-entered earth’s atmosphere. What little cloud there was retreated to the horizon forced back by the crafts shockwave. When it finally made landfall, it did so with the roar of thunder as if it were a lightning bolt striking the earth from heaven above. There should have been no surprise when Carter was released from the craft only to see shocked expressions etched on the Nasa staffs faces, what had just happened was shocking. However, the way they looked at him was as if they were seeing a dead man walking. He chalked it up to the fact he was back on terra firma and not in another solar system as had been the plan but complications had arisen and charting a course back home following whatever anomaly in space had severed his communications seemed the best idea. He was prepared to explain everything in the de-briefing only to be left speechless when the de-briefing began.
	
Carter was left in what could only described as an interrogation room awaiting de-briefing when his was joined by a pale, lean man.

“My name is agent King and I will be leading the investigation into this incident,” the man introduced himself.

“What do you mean this incident? Why aren’t I being de-briefed as normal?” Carter inquired thrown off by the spook who now appeared to be questioning him.

“Let’s start with your identity?” Agent King began ignoring Carter’s questions.

“I am captain Carter of the US air force, seasoned astronaut and have just returned from my mission to journey to another solar system and I demand to know why this is being treated as a surprise!?” Carter now irate asserted.

“Ok well Carter maybe you can answer me this first, why does neither the chair of the science, space and technology committee or the director of NASA know of your mission or who you are?” King probed unnerving Carter.

“What? I… I don’t know. The mission was classified top secret but the people you just mentioned were all involved in the operation at president Obamas behest,” Carter tried desperately to explain almost as much to himself as to agent King.

“President Obama?” Agent King asked.

“Yes 44th president of the united states Barack Obama!” Carters mind now racing trying to reason why he was having to say this out loud.

“Barack Obama is a senator from Illinois, the current president is John McCain having beaten Hillary Clinton following her victory over Mr. Obama in the primaries, so I’m going to ask you again who are you? And what is it you’re doing?” Agent King had left Carter speechless with that. 

Despondent his eyes glazed over in disbelief as he tried to fathom the world he now found himself in. So close to being his home and yet so different he wouldn’t be able to call it his own.

[WP] 500 years from now and earth is run completely on solar power. The current generation of liberals now blame solar power for global warming.,marcowhite,"See, real science stuff!
My favorite part of science fiction is the basis in actual science... haha

What intrigued me about this thought (why I wanted to see it in a WP) is because that would be the hardcore conservative studies, which mitigate the effect, versus the forward thinking if the actual effect. Most generations move in a completely different direction than their predecessors. Fossil fuels go from being amazing and unlocking huge potential, to being bad. Nuclear energy went from being the ""future"" and a planet saving technology, to dangerous and causing long-term destruction. 
It only makes sense to me that it will happen with solar power. (While, I do think it is still the best option that we have available today)",marcowhite
[WP] 500 years from now and earth is run completely on solar power. The current generation of liberals now blame solar power for global warming.,marcowhite,"For anyone looking for scientific studies into this: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2015/11/02/surprising-study-finds-that-solar-energy-can-also-cause-climate-change-a-little/

But just let me paste the important part here: 

The study shows that, while large solar arrays can cause some significant regional changes in climate, “globally it will not affect the global climate much,” said Hu. “This is a big contrast with the fossil fuels.” According to most climate projections, human-caused global warming — the result of releasing greenhouse gases into the atmosphere — could lead to anywhere from 1 to nearly 3 degrees of global temperature increases under even moderate climate scenarios.

That said, the study does also provide some insight into how the local solar panel-induced climate effects might be minimized. The results suggested that local climate effects were smaller in urban areas than in the more remote desert areas and can be mitigated by the urban heat island effect. So while it’s tempting to place large solar arrays in desert areas, where they’re most likely to receive the greatest amount of interrupted sunlight, the authors note that “a more distributed solar panel installation could reduce the impact of the solar panels on regional and global climate.”",dori_lukey
"[WP] You live in a universe where everyone has powers. It is important that no one knows that you can bring people back from the dead and that you cannot die. Your boss's 5 year old daughter finds out your secret, what do you do?",mpeterback,"I hate the cold. More so than the cold, I hate beaches. Even more than cold or beaches, I hate boardwalks. Yet here I was, the place where I had to be, on a cold beach boardwalk, in the dead of winter, with my idiot boss and his bratty daughter. I didn't want to be here, but I had to.
""Nick, isn't it wonderful?"" Mr. Fletcher asked.

""Yes sir, it is without a doubt, the best Power Zone yet. Only you could have built such a wonderful establishment. No one else on earth could possibly come close to erecting something of the magnitude of what you have just built, no sir not even close!"" I hated to kiss ass, but I needed to. My Christmas bonus needed to be good this year.

""Jesus Nick, ride me any harder and I'll have to charge you. Well I'm glad you like it. It should be opening up next summer. You know my father started Power Zones, back in the 50s, he wanted a place where kids could play dodge ball, on an even plane, without one kid having super strength, another having super speed, just a bunch of kids chucking hunks of rubber at each other, the way God intended for us to dodgeball.""

I hate Mr. Fletcher.

""Daddy, We're going to be late to the carnival!"" Jeremy's brat daughter, Kelsi, interjected.

I *really* hated Kelsi. 

""In a moment dear, Daddy's working""

""No you're not, you're lollygagging!"" I could see veins popping up on her head, she looked like a tomato covered in spaghetti. 

""Sir,"" I said, trying to save the situation ""Why don't you tell us again how your father figured out his famous de-powerizing force field technology using only a microwave and spare parts?"" I didn't want to hear this awful story for the 80th time, but I had to keep the parties happy. I had been assigned to accompany Mr. Bokaw to New England to oversee the production of our companies newest location, and if he had bad memories of this trip, he would have bad memories of me, and that would mean no Christmas bonus, which meant bad things for me.

""Ahh yes."" He said. ""My father, ingenious as he was, was shoving a fork inside of a toaster to test the boundaries of his electric absorbency, when suddenly-"" 

""I HAVE HAD IT, I AM ATTENDING THE SHOW WITHOUT YOU TWO CLOWNS"" Kelsi screamed, let go of her father's hand, and propelled into the air, jumping in the direction of the tent. Mr. Brokaw lost his temper at the girl and chucked a fireball at her, missing. I wondered if that was on purpose. 

""I'm going to lock that girl away in a tower!"" My boss exclaimed. He was pissed, but I was elated. This was my chance, all I had to do was catch up to the brat and bring her back to my boss, he'll be happy as a fat clam and I'll have my bonus nice and ready!

""Don't worry about it sir, I'll hop on the speed scooter and get her back."" I took off, the carnival was about 3 miles away, and Kelsi's jumps mostly just propel her in the air, they don't do much for distances. I would catch up to her in no time. At around 50th st, I see her in mid-air, hovering over a blimp. I turn the hoverboard mode on in the speed scooter, and proceed to accelerate upwards, grabbing her on her way down. 

""Let go of me you jerk!"" She screamed before biting my hand. I really didn't wanna be a brat wrangler today, I just wanted to watch old Christmas movies and eat Turkish delight. I had to be here however, so I was. All of a sudden, I felt a hard smack, and the board loosened out from underneath me, this was not good. I blacked out. I came to and my body was wedged on a flag pole like a pineapple chunk at a fondue place. This wasn't a problem for me, as I was immortal. Unfortunately, Kelsi was pierced on a fire hydrant right next to me. What were the odds? I could see her glaring at me with blood running down her mouth. I felt really bad. Before the life left her eyes, she muttered:

""How?""

I can only assume that line of inquiry was directed at my being perfectly ok despite looking like a kebab. I removed myself from the pole and collected myself. Specifically, I collected the parts of my spleen and torso that became detached from my body. Now, I could heal Kelsi, unfortunately, I could not remove her ability to tell other people of what just happened here today. That was a problem. I needed people not to know about me. The last person to have my set of powers was harassed daily, bombarded with requests for miracles, and eventually publicly executed. I don't need that attention. I like my shitty office job and tiny apartment. I didn't want to do what I was about to, but I had to. I took her off of the fire hydrant, and placed my hands over her head. She gasped, and woke up.

""Hey. I would really appreciate if you not tell anyone about this."" My God, what have I just done?

""Yeah sure no problem, thanks for bringing me back to life. Sorry for running away earlier. Let's go to the carnival.""

I was shocked. This was the cheapest ending to a story ever, but I mean, it is a Christmas story, so what do you
expect?

Permits were slow to be issued and the closest thing to a firearm in Max's house was the miniature cannon he had assembled from a toilet paper tube, designed to exterminate the various rodents that consistently stole food from his fridge without leaving so much as a simple IOU. Because the cannon was to remain primed and in position, Max selected the next best thing - a banana with a particularly dangerous-seeming curvature. If he kept it tucked away in his pocket all day, no one would be the wiser - just as last year, they'd all assume he was simply embarrassed by the small caliber and barrel length of his revolver.



Max arrived to work 15 minutes late on the day, hoping that his coworkers would by then be deeply engaged in conversations regarding ballistics and ammunition, allowing him to slip to his desk unseen. His plan worked, and Max let out a sigh of relief as he booted his computer. *But what was this!* The first unread email described an amendment to the the typical festivities for the day - an end-of-day shoot-off that would decide whose gun reigned supreme over all others. And participation was mandatory.


This was it - he would be outed and ridiculed in front of everyone. His banana didn't even have a trigger, as the construction paper Max planned to use in fashioning one had also been stolen by the mischievous rodents. The hours dragged by, but eventually it was time for the shoot-off.


As Max dragged his feet to the cafeteria where the shoot-off was to be held (the pots and pans made for excellent targets), he suddenly remembered a bylaw he had stumbled upon while searching through legal manuscripts for ways to forcibly evict his cohabiting rodents. Facing a barrage of complaints from Australians, the World Firearms Commission had agreed to classify boomerangs as rifles. And what was his banana if not a slightly flaccid boomerang?


That night, Max arrived home triumphant. Though his bananarang had been almost immediately shot from the air by a small woman with a machine gun, he could comfortably say that he participated and gave it his best. As Max settled into bed, he made a mental note to get his hands on a real weapon for next year, but his thoughts shifted quickly to the urgent matter of securing his homestead and repelling the rodents. Images of sophisticated traps lulled him to sleep - Max had once again conquered Bring-Your-Gun-To-Work-Day with nothing more than a banana.",tribecous

I walk nervously into my office building, avoiding eye contact with the receptionist at the oversized marble desk on the right side. I wave my ID badge with my left hand, and with my sweaty right hand, clutch the banana in my hoodie pocket. *I've made it through this stupid holiday the last few years, I can make it through this one.* I adjust my grip on the banana, realizing it's becoming much too soft. Last year, I had to throw out my jacket, because the banana split open and oozed into the fibers. 

I quickly make my way to the elevator, which was mercifully empty. During the short twenty second ride, I was able to air out my hand, and relax. Once the elevator reached my floor, it was showtime, once again. I gripped my banana, and stepped out into the jungle of cubicles. 

Everyone stood in clusters; there was a thirty minute overlap in shifts, and everyone liked to talk to one another before going home or starting work. *All I have to do is make it to my desk.* I move at a pace closer to a jog than a walk, twisting and turning on my way to the safety of my workspace. 

""Hey, Brian!"" A voice calls out. 

*Dammit. It's Mike.* 

I smile politely, as if to imply I'm in a hurry and can't be bothered to stop. He ignores my vague signal and waves me over to join his group. What will I say to them? They are likely talking about their guns, and I'm holding a damn banana in my pocket. *I don't even know anything about guns.* I join their circle of conversation, and pray they don't ask me any questions. 

As Mike, Dave, and Kevin are talking, I occasionally nod or smile, based on their reactions to one another. Then, potential disaster struck; Allison joined the circle. Allison worked in the cubicle across from me; and I've been in love with her for the last year. We talk a lot, but I haven't yet gotten up the courage to ask her out. And now she's going to find out about my banana. *What a goddamn disaster.* I smile at her as she enters the group; and I see the outline of her gun protruding from her jacket. It seems to be about the same size as Kevin's; I consider making conversation about it, but decide it's better if I don't bring up the subject. 

""Brian? Hey, earth to Brian!"" Kevin snapped his fingers at me. ""You gonna answer the question or just stare at Allison for the next fifteen minutes?"" 

I hadn't realized anyone had been talking to me. Allison looked to the floor as her face turned beet red; my face surely matched the tone. 

""Sorry, what was the question?"" I asked, trying to brush off the awkwardness of the situation. 

""What are you packing in there?"" Mike chimed in with a chuckle, pointing to my banana bulge. 

""I, uh... just a... glock."" I had heard the term before. Hopefully it's actually a weapon. 

""Glock? Who has a glock these days? Let's have a look!"" Dave said, reaching for my pocket. I backed away, raising my left hand. 

""Id rather not, I uh... just repainted it, and I'm kind of embarrassed."" This gave Kevin a puzzled look. 

""Repainted?"" He asked, as he further examined the bulge. ""Hey,  now that I look at it... it kind of looks curved. What... what is that?"" 

I began sweating heavily. Allison was staring at me, likely losing all respect she might have had. This was it. I was going to be outed as a non-gun owner. *Oh, how did it come to this?* 

Dave stepped behind me, giggling like a schoolgirl, and grabbed my arms; Kevin reached into my pocket and retrieved my half-smushed banana. They exchanged puzzled looks, and then burst out laughing. I could feel the tears welling up in my eyes; I looked over at Allison, and to my surprise, she wasn't laughing. She put a finger to her lips, signaling me to keep a secret; and the pulled her hand slightly out of her jacket, revealing a cucumber.

As I reached the cubicle, my next-cubicle neighbor Lorelei waved to me and smiled.  I glanced up at her and walked to my desk, but she seemed insistent.  Whatever she had to talk about, she really wanted to say it.  ""What is it?""

""Um, well...""  She seemed to shrink into herself.  ""You know how today's bring-your-gun-to-work day?""

""Yeah,"" I said.  ""So?""

I looked around me for show.  ""Sure.""

She looked at the jacket pocket, which was sagging a bit to one side.  ""It's a banana.""

""I never thought you would bring a banana to take-your-gun-to-work day.""  Yeah, it was obvious.  ""You know if someone finds out, you're never gonna get promoted, right?""

I nodded hello to the receptionist Jeanine as I walked by, she was cute, but she was occupied with a phone call. As I caught her gaze I made a motion towards my jacket pocket. She looked down and I poked out my weapon towards her, through the canvas of my coat, and smiled. 

She covered the mouthpiece of her phone and said, “Packing quite the firepower there, huh Stephen?”

“Oh, uh, thanks, Jeanine.” I forced a response out of my mouth and continued towards the elevator.

I stepped in with a man I didn’t know and pressed the button to the fourth floor. I waited for the ride to be over, I didn’t much like the looks of the man next to me. I stepped out and started to walk to my desk when I heard giggling behind me. I turned to look just as the doors of the elevator joined, killing my chance to find some closure about the laughter. I went to turn around when I was greeted by an ice cold gun barrel in my face.

“Put your hands above your head, and I won't shoot,” Darryl commanded to me. I went to raise my hands, but I stopped myself.

“If you could see what I had, you’d have pissed yourself by now.” I retorted as I brushed past him and continued to my desk. He laughed a bit, but looked defeated when I snuck a glance behind me. I sat down and slipped my firearm into my desk drawer.

I was greeted by a few of my coworkers as the day went on, but they all were giving me strange looks. I couldn't quite put my finger on it, but they looked disappointed, and sad, but were also holding back laughter. I wasn’t really sure of this emotion, so I gleefully continued my work.

I am now sitting in the lunch room, waiting for my turn to be called as everyone is showing their guns. I watch as Fred pulls out a pistol of some sort, then Ryan pulls out a Nerf gun, Jane has a hunting rifle, and then their gazes fall upon me.

“What did you bring Stephen?” Paul asks. He is the first person to really wonder, so I pull out my banana. Laughter fills the room and I turn redder than a tomato. I try to speak up but everyone is wheezing from this. I think Heidi genuinely slapped her knee.

“Oh shit,” I exclaimed. Just as the last syllable came out of my mouth the room fell silent.

“What did I eat for breakfast this morning?”

I should've never let the kids play dressup. I was so confident when I felt the hard long rifle in my pocket driving to my job, that when I pulled it out at my desk to look at my favourite revolver,  my eyes opened in shock. 
My kids had replaced it with... a banana. 
I quickly shoved it back into my pocket, whistling out nervously, as Patrick walked over to me, holding his own favourite gun in his hand.
""Isn't she a beaut? Got her last Christmas, Jack""
""Oh, she is lovely, Patrick."" I said instantly, a fake awkward smile on my mouth and he swung her a few times around his finger by the trigger, proud.
""And look at my baby."" Janice said, dropping her giant rifle to the table. ""Could fire ten yards away.""
""Nice."" Patrick said impressed and then the two looked at me, expectantly. 
""Oh I,"" I said nervously and added ""I completely forgot it was gun day."" 
""Seriously?"" Patrick said flabbergasted and I just shrugged, feigning innocence. 
""Nah ah."" Janice said just then and looked at my pocket,  seeing something jutting out ""I see your big gun bulging in your pocket."" 
""JANICE, NO!""
I said quickly but she yanked out the banana and I shuddered as the whole office space fell silent. Before there was an eruption of laughter. 
""A banana?"" Janice screamed in hysterics. ""You honestly brought a banana?""
""You are such a poofter, JACK!"" Patrick roared laughing but suddenly everyone screamed as there was a firing of a gun and we all turned to see a masked man had come in, firing his weapon to the roof as he yelled ""Give me the FILES!"" 
Everyone froze. Before pulling out all their guns and started firing at the man, but they were all hitting each other.
The masked guy stood there astonished as not one strike hit, and began shooting people down with perfect position. I ducked under my desk and tried to think as quickly as I could. The man was coming nearer to passing me, and all I could hear was gun fire all around me. 
Suddenly the idea came to my mind in a flash. 
I threw the banana skin to the ground and just as the man took a step towards my desk,  he slipped, flying backwards through the air. Everyone who had not got shot, quickly ran forward, firing thousands of bullet's to his body, and his dead body danced there from the shots.
I stood up from my desk and just looked around as everyone cheered me and cried in happiness.
The naked banana was still in my hand, and I just took a couple of munches of it, listening to the clapping applauds.",friendlyneighbours

“Mmmmm-hm,” Mr. Daniels grunted. He was clearly not convinced, nor even impressed by my lie.

“So, yeah. I hesitated to bust it out and let it see the light of day. It’s not loaded, of course.”

“Oh, of course not.”

“Right. Nobody *loaded* theirs. I would hope. But I didn’t think at first it’d be a good idea to bring it, you know, cause it’s just so advanced. Didn’t wanna freak anyone out.”

*Overcompensating, overcompensating, shut up.* I did shut up. Mr. Daniels didn’t seem to have any further comment. Clearly, he did not believe me. Let’s be real, no one did. Who doesn’t know a banana when they see one? Even if shrouded in a layer of fabric. I would have had better luck with this scheme on a blind date. *Hmm, maybe I actually would.* I made a mental note as I bid Mr. Daniels adieu and turned to scurry back to my desk. So, nobody bought it. At least they were keeping their judgments inside. At least I wasn’t being socially stoned. That was what really mattered.

“How’d you get it?” he asked, with that certain flat, condescending tone that tells you the person has already decided the answer to his own question.
I winced and faced him again. “Well, my uncle, my dear old uncle, believe it or not, he works in a… a gun factory. Yes.”

“So it was a gift.”

“Yes. He slipped me this on my birthday. It’s not on any market yet. To be frank, I don’t think it should be released. I mean, it’s ingenious, right? A pistol that looks… and smells… like a banana. But a lot of times genius is dangerous. The police are gonna be completely screwed over. Or, once they find out what’s going on, they start accosting people carrying actual bananas. Then they start making other varieties, like Baby Bottle, or Remote Control, or Hairspray Can. Then nobody knows what’s what. Total chaos. But you know, I couldn’t ignore Bring Your Gun to Work Day.”

“It’s a banana.”

“Yeah, that’s exactly what your victim thinks! Then, pow!”

“Kevin, please stop. I beg you.”

Well, I overcompensated. They couldn’t fire me over this, could they? Surely that would be a lawsuit? Impossible to assume in today’s society. I decided that I couldn’t possibly make matters worse, so I sheepishly backpedaled. “Sorry.”

“Are you uncomfortable with our choices in workplace spirit? Have you been through an incident in your past?”

His countenance had gone grave. He was genuine. I was already beginning to fabricate some childhood trauma, some house or bank robbery I was caught in the crosshairs of. I settled on the truth. “I don’t even own a gun.”

“Do you participate in the protests?”

“Not really. I mean, I did when I was little. But just cause my parents dragged me there. And the protests didn’t even work. They failed. I don’t know why people are wasting their time still trying. Guns are *everywhere*. I just don’t have one. I’ve never seen the need. It would feel like a waste of money. I mean, even these days, I get by fine without one. As long as no one knows. To be raised in a pacifist household, and then deal with all this pressure, all around you, every minute you’re awake.”

Mr. Daniels suddenly planted one of his large hands on my shoulder. “Kevin, it’s alright. You’re alright. We’re all just trying to get by. More of us than you’d think. You’d be surprised.”

“Thanks.” This was nice, but also very, very weird. I needed to get out.
He released my shoulder.

“Thanks for not calling in sick.”

Mike aimed his 9mm in front of him carelessly, demonstrating his weapon's sights and his quick draw. His co-workers gathered around it to look at his pistol in respectful interest.

Suddenly, the door to the office opened. Bill walked in, carrying something under his trench coat. The office waved to him.

""Hi, Bill,"" Joe said, saluting him with his weapon. Joe did the same.

""Uh, hey, guys. Happy Bring Your Gun to Work Day,"" Bill said.

""You keep the spirit?"" Mike asked.

""Yeah, I've got it right here under my jacket,"" Bill said, patting his jacket.

""Why don't you take it out?"" Joe asked. Mike nodded in agreement.

""Its, uh, kinda filthy. I just brought it to participate,"" Bill said sheepishly.

""Hey, that's fine, we're all friends here,"" Mike said.

""Yeah, mine isn't even loaded,"" Joe confessed.

""You didn't load yours? What's the point of having your gun if you aren't going to at least bring it around loaded to show people?"" Mike asked.

""It's not very safe,"" Mike said.

""Are you kidding me? Bring Your Gun to Work Day is completely safe.""

""Bill, if this chickenshit can't even load his gun, your dirty handgun will be fine,"" Mike said. Bill used his shoulder to walk between the two and head towards his desk. The two began to follow him, bothering Bill about his gun.

""Look, guys, I've got a lot of work to do. You'll see it at lunch,"" Bill said.

""Ah, okay, we'll leave you to it,"" Joe said.

As Bill bent down to open a cabinet, his jacket slipped open. Tucked on his pocket was the unmistakable end of a banana. Its tattletale yellow skin didn't have a single brown spot on it. Mike caught a glimpse of the banana and grabbed Joe's shoulder. The man turned around, also seeing the banana in Bill's coat.

""Run, everyone, he's got a banana!"" Joe shouted as he threw his rifle down.

The entire office erupted into a cacophony of panicked screams and people running for the door. Two security guards immediately rushed through the doors and upholstered their bananas, pointing them at Bill.

""Easy, Bill. Put the banana down,"" one of them said.

""It's just lunch!"" he cried.

""No more games, Bill.""

""No, look!"" Bill said as he pulled the banana out of his coat to peel it. The guards squeezed the ends of their bananas repeatedly, flicking the ends of the banana in the air while imitating the noise of gunfire. Bill fell to the floor, the banana rolling from his lifeless hands.",Dictator4Hire

Some of their pockets sagged in one direction, and a backpack here or there had a point sticking out.  I looked back at the floor number, willing it to change just that little bit faster so I could get on with my life.

Of course, you didn't have to bring a gun.  And in some other office, I wouldn't bother faking it.  But the CEO happened to be a major guns advocate, and there were many, many superiors who just loved getting their butts kissed.

Someday soon, I'd get another job.

The elevator chimed, and the door opened to the cubicles I knew and tolerated.  Of course, a few of my co-workers were standing right outside, talking just a little too loudly about the guns they had so thoughtfully brought.  I put on an impassive face, and walked past them, taking extra care to avoid eye contact without looking like I was avoiding eye contact.

Of course, they noticed me anyways.  ""Oh, hey Greg,"" one of them called to me.

This was absolutely, positively, amazingly great.  ""Hi, Ben, Jeff, Harold.""  I internally winced.  ""How are you guys doing?""

""We're doing great,"" Jeff replied.  He was the leader of that little clique, and he did most of the talking.  ""Actually,"" he said, making me stop my ever-lengthening walk to my cubicle, ""We were talking about the guns we brought today.""

""That's nice,"" I interjected.

""Actually, I was wondering..."" He smirked at me, and I grinned back.  ""What gun did you bring?""

I patted my jacket pocket.  ""Oh, this?  Just a little pistol.""

He looked at his clique, and then back at me.  ""What type?""

""Oh, a Desert Eagle,"" I said, hoping I chose a gun that actually existed.

""That's nice.""  I could see the grin growing on his face; I should have prepared more.

Harold spoke up.  ""I didn't know you owned a gun.  Where did you get it?""

I stretched my grin a little.  ""It was a little gift from my dad.  Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to get to work.""  Before they could say anything else, I turned to leave.

""Well, I guess we'll see you around.""  Jeff called out behind me.  As I walked away, I breathed a sigh in relief.  For a few minutes, at least, I could sit down and start working without any more interruptions.

[WP] Your super power is bad luck. A bunch of heroes decide to send you into a super-villain operation so you can ruin everything.,torchdexto,"*PART ONE*

Scientists once concluded that luck wasn't something you could *have*. It was just something you could experience; a moment of coincidence among millions of other moments. It seems those white-coated assholes forgot to study the other side of that grim coin. 
Because *bad luck* is definitely something you can have. And I have it in droves. 

I first discovered my unfortunate super power at the ripe age of 10. I was swinging quite aggressively at the playground when both chains of the swing broke at the peak of my forward momentum, catapulting me towards a sandbox. The sand seemed soft and plentiful, so I wasn't too alarmed mid-air. That was, of course, until a powerful gust of wind changed my flight-path towards a bristly evergreen tree with my ass facing forward.

It took me quite a while before I could control this power. I occasionally tried using it to my advantage, getting feverishly sick before a school exam or breaking my arm off a miscued swing jump to avoid doing house chores. My parents tried to stop me from swinging; I considered it my muse. 

Still, I hated my newfound power. Even if I could control it, I was forever seen as a 'black cat', and the kids from school avoided me at all costs. I spent many evenings contemplating the misfortune of my misfortune, until one night I received a letter:

*O'Leary's Pub. Tomorrow. 10 PM. Don't be late*, it read. 

When I arrived (after nervously causing two car accidents from the back of my cab), I was sent to this drab basement with poorly copied paintings of dogs playing poker on the walls. A towering red door stood in front of me, beckoning me to enter. I knocked twice, but before someone could open one of those furtive eye slits to ask 'who goes there?', I noticed that my knocking had successfully unhinged all the screws it the door. The door creaked forward and came slamming down in the next room with a cloud of dust in it's wake. 

I stood there, frozen with guilt, my fist still clenched in a knocking position. A small group of strangers stared at me from a poker table.

""So it's true,"" one of them said. 

""Hot damn,"" said another. 

""Come in boy, come in,"" said a woman, who appeared to be the captain of the bunch. The only clue I had towards this conclusion was that she was wearing a costume with bold letters on the front that read, 'Captain Awesome'. 

""What's your name?"" she asked. 

""G-Garth. My names Garth ma'am,"" I said.  

""Hello Garth,"" she said. ""Do you know why we've asked you here tonight?"" 

I shook my head a little too fast, slightly pulling a neck muscle. 

""Well, it's because we think you're special. And we were hoping you might consider using that 'specialness' to help our cause,"" she said. 

We spent the next few hours discussing my super power, and each of theirs. Captain Awesome's ability was to create things with the snap of a finger--things that while extremely cool, offered little societal value. Like two potato chips fused together into one super chip, or the occasional double rainbow after a rainy day. Her right-hand man went by the name ""Time Lapse"". His power was the ability to see future events spliced together in rapid sequence, with the theme song from *Happy Days* playing in the background. Apparently he had seen a few moments of me and my power in one of his visions. Rounding out the bunch was one of their newer recruits, who went by 'Finger 6ix'. He had six fingers and new all the lines from Drake songs. Apparently he was also rather dexterous and could fix just about anything. 

After the introductions, Captain Awesome told me about the dire situation they were facing. It appeared that these lowly heroes sitting before me were the self-proclaimed 'Good Guys', locked in an eternal battle with a group of super-villains who met in a different drab pub on the other side of town. Unfortunately, these villains had another kind of power; the kind that rendered the Good Guy's abilities pretty ineffectual (not that they weren't already). These villains, said Captain Awesome, were creating a mega laser pointer, one that could be used to blind speakers and athletes from any distance. ""And not just the annoying, temporary kind of blindness,"" she said forebodingly.

""That's terrible,"" I said. ""But I still don't quite understand how I can be of help."" 

""Okay, don't take this the wrong way kid,"" said Time Lapse. ""I mean, we respect your power and all... But we were hoping you could work your way into their secret lair and completely foil their plans with pure bad luckery."" 

This idea piqued my curiosity. I had always been dodged because of my powers, left behind for what I couldn't bring to the table (a table that I'd often break). 

""I'll do it,"" I said. ""But how will I get in? Won't they be suspicious of a kid trying to join their ranks?"" 

""Oh, you won't be joining them,"" said Captain Awesome. ""You'll be undercover as a student doing a school report on super-villainery. Those egomaniacs won't be able to resist the attention. And don't worry, you'll have us in your ear the whole time.""

[WP] Something growls in the deep. A wind blows and crawls across your skin.,Book_Wizard,"&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Something growled in the deep pit. A warm, moist wind blew and crawled on his skin.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'I've finally found it.' Thought Steve as he stared into the inky depths. 'It's right here.'

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Gathering his legs below him, Steve jumped. The light from the stormy sky above rapidly faded as he fell, giving way to dense shadows. He couldn't see; he didn't need to. The little sonar device pinged in his ear and Steve twisted his body to the right, narrowly avoiding an outcropping. A wicked, insane smile spread over his face. Life is never so vivid as when death is at hand.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Back and forth, twisting and turning Steve fell for what seemed like ages passing in an instant. Ping ping ping ping ping. The sonar device began crying that the ground was approaching. Almost reluctantly, Steve pulled the ripcord. He slowed just in time.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;He landed in sand, or something that felt just like it. The ground was soaked, and the air wasn't much better. Even Steve felt his movements lag a little from the pressure.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Plink plink. Condensation dripped off a rock somewhere over Steve's shoulder. Except that there was no condensation forming on the rocks. Slowly he turned. He knew what he was going to see, but even so, he felt hesitant.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;It was just standing there looking at him. Or it would have been if it had any eyes. Like a maggot, it had a long, pale tubular body. Unlike a maggot, five legs sprouted from it: two on either side like most creatures, and one in the back almost like a tail. The legs themselves were thin and sharp-looking, almost like a spider. From the gaping maw, past columns of thin, needle-like teeth issued the humid breath.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Steve tackled it. An unwholesome noise somewhere between nails on a chalk-board and an alley cat's screech reverberated off the walls as the creature fell. Lurchingly the beast undulated its body trying to throw Steve off and get its legs on the ground. Despite it being twice his size, Steve got it in a head lock and held it there.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Its movements slowed, the wave coming less frequently. Finally it calmed, its rhythmic breathing the only noise in the cave.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;""You done?"" Steve asked, panting from the exertion.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The brute let out a piteous noise. Steve took that as a 'yes'. Releasing the varmint he rubbed up and down on the thing's underside.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;""Ya can't go running off like this, Rex. What if the catcher found you?"" Rex let out another whimper, this one almost apologetic, as it scrambled to its feet. It paced back across the cave to where it had been standing when Steve landed. Suddenly, his eyes lit up.

[WP] You are a psychologist in a world where no one is able to lie. Tell us about one of your sessions.,DarkDesypil,"It was almost time for my 3:30 appointment with Anderson.  My last session of the week before I could unwind for a stress-free weekend with the wife.  Anderson was a quiet one, and had some dark thoughts during our previous sessions.  I had been worried about him at times, he really had trouble seeing the light at the end of the tunnel; but he seemed to be improving over the past few months.  He wasn't a danger to society like some of my patients, but he stood out like a sore thumb.  He had a genuine desire to improve the world and other beings around him.  His desire to help others would hurt him at times.  This emotion was driven so deeply inside that it was starting to tear his mind apart.  Like a mouse in a never-ending maze; an itch he just couldn’t quite scratch. 

Anderson walked in, locked into my eyes and firmly shook my hand with a slight grin on his face.  He was confident, something was different; but for the better.

""Anderson, you seem to be doing well today.  Have you been doing better since our last session?  Are you happy?""  These were the two questions I asked my patients every session, generally warranting the same sorrowful response.

""Absolutely."" he asserted.

I was utterly shocked to hear this response with such certainty.  None of my patients had ever told me this before.  NOBODY had ever told me this before.  ""That's fantastic!!  Tell me - what's improved?  What's changed?!"" I promptly inquired as I sat up from my green velvet chair.

Anderson's confident gaze transitioned toward the sunny window.  ""Dr. Cohen, are YOU happy?""

“No” I instantly told myself in my mind.  I knew exactly how to respond, but I didn't.  I couldn’t.  I curiously looked at Anderson, as he awaited my response.  This wasn't about me, I was here to help him.  ""Anderson, that's not relevant, is it?""  The room stood silent.  Eventually, I decided to play along to clear the awkward pause.  ""Sometimes.  Circumstances and things can make me happy.  Helping patients can make me happy.""  I was being vague.

Anderson nodded and remained silent.  He knew something that I didn’t.  I became confused, and started feeling agitated that he was acting so strange.  Before I could mutter my frustration, Anderson loudly stated, ""CIRCUMSTANCES.  THINGS.""  

I perked up.

""Dr. Cohen, what's LIFE without innate happiness?  That feeling of subtle bliss from dusk-til-dawn.  Nothing factored by situational or physical outcomes, forces of nature or surrounding emotion.  You sit here trying to help others, but what have you done to help yourself?  You rely on that sugar-infused Cola sitting on your desk to temporarily increase the dopamine in your brain.  You cheat on your wife with Stephanie, the receptionist, for temporary gratification.  You post pictures of your expensive car on social media so that others may be impressed by you.  But your life and demeanor remains empty.  You rely on so much, in return for so little.”

I stared at Anderson in disbelief.  Did he just insult me?  Is he stalking me?  I was outraged.  He knew my secrets, my life, and my routines.  He’d been picking up on cues and watching me regularly.  He recognized the way Stephanie and I connected.  He had been studying me; just like I had studied him.  Or so I thought.  He was utterly right, though.  Anderson curiously looked at me, knowing I would be too stunned to respond with any statements to dodge his accusations.  For this very moment, I was his patient, a fragile being in his palms.  The tables had turned, and self-realization hit me harder than ever.

Anderson slowly stood and walked off – that was the last time I saw him.  His simple breakdown had a lasting impression on me.  I was so used to evaluating others that I quickly realized I hadn’t spent enough time evaluating, improving, and enhancing my own being.  I leaned on vices, temporary satisfaction, and other materialistic, unnecessary means which all in essence were unfulfilling.

I was empty up until that very moment.  I’ve since opened up to an entirely new outlook on self-fulfillment.  He was right, and he created a lasting impression I refer to as the ‘Anderson effect’.  Was Anderson truly happy all along?  Was he happy because he finally knew how to get through to me?  My anger quickly subsided and was replaced by a genuine smile.",mlevin7

It's your turn to participate, but one of your opponents is the reigning champion...",Devin_Steel,"There he was again, that dumb jerk. We've all been told we'll get the chance to go back, to see what we left behind, and be reborn. I never learned his name. For the past 3000 years, he's won. How long had I been here? This was at least the 50th game I've watched take place, though this time I was a participant and not a spectator. 

""You may as well forfeit now,"" a voice came from behind me. Five minutes to game time, and I turn to see a little girl, no older than 8 standing behind me. ""He wins every year.""

With a weary sigh, I placed a comforting hand on her shoulder. ""This year will be different,"" I'd assured her. ""I think I can outplay him. Besides, he's been doing this for far too long. Why is it his turn to go back again?"" I'd said, wondering aloud.

Three minutes to game time. The nerves are getting to me. If my opponent was nervous, he kept it carefully hidden behind a mask of cold determination. For the very first time, I could see him up close. It was honestly quite terrifying. The first game I'd watched, he was there. He looked young, still very full of life. Dark brown hair, green eyes, and he held such good posture. Should I go talk to him? Will it change my odds of winning?

One minute to game time. Oh god he's walking over to me. His hair is gray, a brittle and breakable texture. His eyes are sunken, bloodshot and weary. One step, two steps, he's almost right in front of me. He has to be planning something, why would he come over to me?

We stood there, silently staring at one another. He's biting his lip, almost as if he wants to say something. ""Don't even try,"" he finally said. The nerve! How could he be trying to intimidate me? Now, more than ever, I wanted to win.

The crushing weight of my failure wasn't lost on the crowd. Everyone saw the disappointment in my face as the final scores were announced. I lost. He'd won. Again. He would be reborn. Again. And now I'm stuck here. The participants were allowed to see winner off. How many others witnessed this exact scene? He was going back. Again. Slowly, we all made our way to the door. In a way, I felt happy for him. I couldn't actually be mad, he'd won fair and square. We reached the door, and he hesitated. There were so many questions running through my mind, I couldn't take it anymore. I needed to know.

""What's it like on the other side?""

The man stared at me, a haunted look in his face. ""You don't want to know,"" he said with a shake of his head. I finally understood. He won every year so we wouldn't lose hope. So we'd never learn the awful truth. There's nothing left to go back to.",tysquirt

His coat was a mixture of browns, whether from the coat itself or dirt I couldn't tell. He scratched his unshaven chin for a few moments as he walked along the snack aisles. He picked up a small bag of chips from the bottom row as he swatted away a fly buzzing by the hole in his jeans. I quickly stopped staring as he turned to approach the counter.

""Afternoon youngster,"" he said, ""can I also get a lottery ticket?""

I managed to break my thoughtful trance as I stammered out a ""sure"".

He pulled out a slip of paper from his pocket and read out the numbers from it.

""For my seven numbers I'd like to pick a 7, 8, 17, 27, 37, 42, 47.""

""Okay, with the bag of chips that'll be $17.42."" I told him, passing over the digital reader. 

He pulled up the sleeve on his coat and passed his forearm over the reader. 

That's when I noticed the numbers on the screen in front of me as the lottery ticket printed out. Not the lottery ticket numbers mind you, but the numbers for the man's financial status. Easily over 77 million dollars in his name.

""Um, sir?""

""Yes?""

""I don't mean to be too nosy, but you have 77 million dollars?""

The man chuckled, ""Lots of people ask me this question, and the answer is obvious. It's a yes! Ha! It's right there on the screen!""

""Well, then what's with this?"" I inquired, pointing out his lifestyle and clothing.

""This outfit has served me well on the streets for the past 7 years. I ain't giving them up now.""

""Streets? Then how did you come across all this money?""

""Well you just have to believe in the numbers sometimes!"" he said as he left with his lottery ticket in hand. 

That's when I noticed he had left a small piece of paper on the counter with a single bend in it. I unfolded it and saw the following printed on it in red letters:

""Have faith and you will be rewarded. Your lucky numbers are 7, 8, 17, 27, 37, 42, 47!""",iwumbo2

Talk to him, the techs had urged, try to make him understand, or just keep him calm. This one cannot go off during transport. 

“Not your Pa, boy,” he shouts back, glancing down at his altimeter. 9,000 feet, they said, and no higher. But no lower either, or you’ll be fried to-

“Paaaapaaa!” The voice calls again, “I want to know where we’re going, Papa!”

“I said I’m not your Father!” He roars back, nearly yanking the plane off course. The rage is good, cleansing. It helps keep him on track, keep him from remembering what he’s about to d-

Soft sobbing comes from the bomb bay, and his copilot, Lewis, gives him a nervous glance. 

“Goddamnit,” he swears, “fine, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to yell at you…son. This is very important to me, understand? We gotta do this right.” 

“O-ok, whatever you say, Papa,” the little voice answers, and he almost turns the plane around. It’s only Lewis’s hands on the steering wheel that keep them on course. 

“Goddamnit,” Tibbets repeats, a little quieter, “why did they have to make him a kid?”

Beneath his fingers, the Enola Gay rumbles with what could be comfort but doesn’t speak. 

“So what do I do, exactly?” The Little Boy asks, in a timid little voice.

He gets out of the chair and walks, blindly to the back of the bay. The feeling of cool metal against his too-hot forehead grounds him, reminds him of his duty. 

“You don’t do anything, not consciously, all right? Just close your eyes—if you have ‘em—and let the reactions happen.” 

“I can do that!” 

He doesn’t cry, won’t cry, can’t cry,

“Yes, you can, little boy. Now, remem-”

The intercom crackles, his copilot calling him back to the captain’s chair. When he arrives, Lewis angles the microphone towards him and points out the window. Down below a city, indistinguishable from any other in Japan, emerges from the clouds. 

“Give the order,” Lewis insists, “it’s gotta be you.” 

Tibbets swallows, throat dry and tight with an emotion he can’t name, but he takes the microphone and says,

“Bombs away, in 10, 9, 8–”

“Is it time to go?” 

“7,6,5–”

“Yes! I’ll make you proud Papa!” 

“4,3,2…1.”

The bay opens, and the bomb drops.

Of course, this means that you will all agree to the rules and laws of our great country, and will be giving up much of your land for our people to migrate in order to help reduce the crowded conditions which they are currently living.

Military personnel will be arriving shortly to assist with the movements of our newly joined country’s citizens. Do not resist. Resistance will be met with force. Good night.”

Richard looked about his room, which was dark except for the flickering light of the TV which was now playing the regularly scheduled programming of “The Muppets.” Almost immediately his phone began to buzz and light up, announcing that John, his best friend, was calling. Richard picked up, and was immediately bombarded with John’s feelings on this turn of events.

“What the Hell? I thought that we would stand up to bastards across the ocean. First they take our jobs, and now they are trying to take our freedom? If they thing that I’m just going to roll over and let them walk all over me, then they better think again!”

Richard sighed. He knew that John could be a tad impulsive sometimes, and John’s small arsenal in his basement didn’t exactly help matters.
“Look, John, just wait it out.” Richard said, trying to calm John down. “It might not be as bad as you think. Perhaps we won’t be forced to mo-”

“No,” John said, cutting Richard off. “I will not simply allow these dogs to come into our country and destroy our lives.” Richard heard something in the background which sounded suspiciously like a gun being cocked. “You better get over in the next 10 minutes. We’ve got a revolution to start.”

With that, John hung up the phone, leaving Richard to debate if he should help John out or not. After a moment’s consideration, he slid out of his chair, grabbed his trusty hunting rifle, and began walking down the road towards John house.



Precisely nine minutes and fifty-eight seconds later Richard arrived at John’s house to find a small crowd gathered outside. Many were people he recognized, and all were armed. Some were carrying nothing but shovels and axes, while others were decked out in gear that looked like it belonged on a battlefield rather than in the hands of an average civilian.

This is soon going to be a battlefield, Richard realized. He spotted John in his backyard, standing next to a rack of weapons and ammunition, holding an American flag in his left hand and a shotgun in his left. When he spotted Richard, he motioned with the weapon for him to come closer. 

“Isn’t this great?” he asked. “So many people ready to fight for their country, ready to die for it. If those scummy Chinese try and so much approach this neighborhood, they will have a fight on their hands.”

Richard looked about, quickly noticing that while their numbers may well be in the dozens, they would be no matched for a war machine, which would most likely be armed to the teeth and have orders to shoot to kill.

“I don’t know John, is it really a good idea to openly confront them in this way?” Richard replied. 

“I don’t see why not. We just need a little hope and maybe some luck,” was John’s reply. With that, he stepped up onto a conveniently placed cinder block, held his flag in their air, and shouted for the crowd’s attention.

“Friends, we have gathered here today to show the dirty dogs who call themselves Chinese that they simply cannot come and run us over. When they come to our houses to try and take our home, we will fight back. Perhaps some us will perish, perhaps there will be bloodshed. But just remember, that with every drop of blood which is shed, our American Spirit grows!”

There were whoops and shouts and a spattering of applause, but John wasn’t done.

“We have lived here all our lives, and will not be run over and told what to do by some foreign guy who thinks he is oh-so-powerful. We will fight back, and we will make them pay! For the USA!”

“For the USA!” The crowd shouted back. 

As if on queue, a voice said “Put down your weapons.” The crown turned to find several fully armed soldiers standing behind them, weapons at the ready. The crowd backed up a few steps, but certainly did not lay down their weapons.
“Not today, you scummy Chinese,” John shot back.

But Richard spotted the flag on the soldier’s uniforms. That flag was not red and gold, instead it was the familiar red, white and blue. Richard knew what this meant. The enemy was on the inside. With a cry of rage, he raised his weapon and pulled the trigger in one swift motion, firing what would be called the Second Shot Heard Around the World, and beginning what would later be known as the Second American Revolution.

The original with Patrick Swayze, and not the critical and financial flop of it's predecessor Red Dawn though Chris Hemsworth gave a rousing performance during the climax of the film, but SPOILER ALERT his premature departure left the movie feeling empty. The sequel to the original film will follow the surviving members of the Wolverine resistance as they team up with an elite squad of Chinese soldiers, who became stranded during the invasion of the U. S. of A by the Russians, when they were cooperating with the American counterparts to foster international peace and prosperity amongst our two great nations. I don't want to give away the whooole movie so, let me leave you with a tantalizing hook of blood, guts, and romance is awaiting you! 

Second. Chinese New Year as it is known in the States, will henceforth be known as The New Years with the actual beginning of the year, being known as American or Western New Years, whatever you prefer, we don't care that much.

Third, Kung Fu Panda and all intellectual property related to the franchise will be returned to the Government of China and records pertaining to the creation of it will be destroy, immediately. I'am sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but Kung Fu Panda was a creation of the Chinese government, but due to corporate espionage conducted by DreamWorks Pictures, who's founders Steven Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg, and David Geffen having already confess to their crimes, are awaiting their execution. Which will be broadcast on Showtime after Kung Fu Panda Marathon.

Fourth, products such as Pokemon the tv show, Pokemon the card game, Pokemon video game, Pokemon merchandise, Maruchan ramen, Nissin ramen, Sony Playstation, Sony PSP, Nissan Safari, Nissan Skyline, Nissan Pulsar, Nissan Maxima, Nissan Prairie, Nissan Atlas, Nissan Sentra, Nissan Pathfinder, holy shit, okay, you're just no longer allowed to buy Japanese shit, okay? Okay. Why couldn't we just have done that from the beginning?

Fifth, to reduce the size of the prison population, we will begin harvesting the organs of those condemned to death or given life sentences. Those who will endure prolong incarceration will now live or die by a point-based system, much like that amazing episode Black Mirror, where every interaction is judged and given stars! Except if you fall below two stars, we'll harvest your organs.

Sixth, kill everyone with AIDS and HIV

Seventh, Internet is restricted and heavily monitored, like that wasn't happening before, am I right, American public?

Eighth, resistance is futile, you're now part of the collect--look there's a whooole lot more then this, but I gonna a country to run and wife to fuck, so just go the link below and find out more later. Okay? I gonna go.

Jane and Jena didn't feel the least bit nervous, maybe they conspired to tear me to shreds in this room, I had to think of a way to get out of this. Jane wouldn't even greet me back.

Jena decided to break the ice. *""So why'd you stop responding to me that evening?""*

Like Leonidas looking at Queen Gorgo, I turned back to look at my girl, looked at myself, then turned towards Jane and Jena.

""I confused you for my girlfriend, Jean. I made a spelling error, I didn't notice it.""

My forehead is a dam that's struggling to hold back my sweat.

*""Didn't you notice the name?""*

""I was concentrating on something else and it was a good... conversation. Thought I was chatting with my girl for a while, and one text led to another and soon I was going to come over to fuck you. Then it struck me.""

*""So you named your girlfriend's contact just 'Jean'? No pet names?""*

""I'm a simple guy.""

*""And what about Jane?""*

Well call me the Phillippe Petit of relationship management if I come out of this.

""I uh, well Jane you're obviously a very good friend and we play a lot in conversations. As you remember I was talking to you about mistaking Jena for Jane, and maybe I forgot a quotation mark or two, and maybe we dared each other but it's totally a joke, I thought you were in on that.

I don't know what Jean is seeing, but I see two judges holding a '2' and a '3'. Anyway, she comes in and looks at the two girls like a German Shepherd would look at two chihuahuas. They leave.

"[wp] You are at a table with every girl you've almost slept with, they're having a frank discussion about why it never happened.",PinkBullets,"When I decided to have a beer in my favorite pub, I'd never imagined I would end up with these three girls sitting with me. Liz, Debbie and Paula all had a different look in their eyes. Liz had a touch of amusement in her eyes, Debbie was more disgusted and Paula looked like she wanted to kill me. The three girls had all one thing in common: at one point, we almost had sex but it never happened for a reason. 

When I entered the pub, Liz and Debbie, who were drinking a beer, waved at me to come with them. And a bit later, Paula entered the pub,saw us and went to taunt me with:

""Hi Rick, are you sure you want to disappoint those girls? They look too nice for you.""

Liz and Debbie looked surprised but quickly Debbie said ""It's a bit late anyway, I already was disappointed""

""Oooh? What do you mean?"" Asked Liz and Paula

""We were having a nice time but Rick never went to the end, nor started actually""

""That's funny, because I also almost had sex with him before he turned out a jerk and I stopped"" said Paula

""No way! I almost had sex with him too but there was no disappointment for me"" told Liz.

Thus began the most awkward discussion I was involved in, with my sexual encounters as the topic...

""I knew Rick for a long time before we had this. I was still a virgin at the time, but at one point, I decided to lose it and tried it with a douche called Anthony, it went wrong and was frustrated. Less than 2 months after, I ended up at Rick's home and during the foreplay, Mister Rick judiciously said ""I'm sure you're wetter than with Anthony"", which made me lose everything"" said Paula, making Liz and Debbie laugh.

""Ahahah, indeed Rick, you were a douche! I remember the time we almost had sex. We were in a frat house bedroom getting it on, and he called me another name. When I told me that my name was Debbie he said ""Debbie? Fuck I'm so drunk, I can't even aim the girl I deserve and aim lower..."" I slapped him and got out of the room""

""Hahahaha! That's hilarious! But you know, girls, I wasn't disappointed like the both of you. For me, it was more of an accident that stopped our sex session"" Said Liz

""An accident? What happened?""

""Well, Mister Rick drank a little too much and when he got in bed, missed the bed and fell. He struck his balls on the corner of the bed and bumped his head against the nightstand, sending him to the hospital. That was hilarious, you know!""

The most embarassing moment of my life was about to finish when Liz said with a wink

[WP] Write a story that only has a good ending if the protagonist fails.,SkullZMinus,"Jeremiah picked up his pace as he came across the Hewing Bridge.  His last text from Emma was clear he needed to be home by time. ""Please be home by 5.  You're always late and all I want for our anniversary is for you to be home on time"".  He knew it was true.  It wasn't that he did it maliciously, just poor time management on his part.  She loved him anyway, but he knew this was important.  He left work early just to ensure he had plenty of time.  He was on schedule and knew Emma would be totally surprised when he walked in 5 minutes early.  He grinned to himself and kept up his pace.  
The short burst of sobs caught his attention and directed it to a small frame huddle against one of the  bridge's structure beams.  Jeremiah stopped to find a young woman, wrapped in a dirty, black blanket, leaning against the bridge rails.  He stopped and ask softly ""Ma'am, are you ok?"".
Shocked, the woman turned around and saw Jeremiah standing close to her.  ""GO AWAY!!! "". She yelled at him with all her might.  The intensity of her voice made Jeremiah step back out of fear.  But when the statement was immediately followed by a huge sob, Jeremiah's compassion took over and he asked the woman again, ""Ma'am, are you ok?"".  ""LEAVE ME ALONE!!!  Just go away and leave me alone.  Please, just leave me alone..."" she replied.  As she stood up, pressing closer to the rail and looking down below, Jeremiah realized her intended fate.  Looking around for help, he saw he was all alone with this woman.  ""Ma'am, please, let me help you.  I can't just leave you..."".  She turned around slightly and spit on Jeremiah. ""JUST LEAVE ME ALONE!  Who are you anyway?  Why can't you just leave me alone...everyone else does...."". She replied with a small whimper as she returned to her stance against the rail.  
Emma looked at her watch: 5:02 pm.  ""Damnit Jeremiah, I told you this was important.""  She said to herself as she wondered what was more important than their anniversary.  She started to call Jeremiah to find out what was going when the front door opened up.  Jeremiah came walking in, followed by a young woman wrapped in a dirty, black blanket. ",laymass_Superfly

Jonas exhaled contentedly and stretched his hands behind his head as he kicked back in the recliner.  He watched his daughter follow one of the dogs around the living room and out of sight into the dining room.  He sighed with a lazy smile then turned his gaze to the guest on the couch.

""So, tell me why you're here, again, with such a grim look on your face?""

The man on the couch leaned forward, the fluorescent sun shone through the window behind him, shadowing his features in the glare. 

""Hmmmmmm,"" he mumbled ""Doesn't seem to be much change.  I hope you're happy, man.  I really do.""  He scribbled something onto the clipboard in his hands.

Time seemed to stretch and drag for a minute or an hour while Jonas watched the man write.  A machine somewhere beeped.  Jonas blinked and glanced toward the dining room doorway.  His little girl followed one of the dogs into the living room and laughed a  sweet laugh.

""Happy?  Of course I'm happy.  Every time she walks into a room, I smile....""

"[WP] ""You're the only one to survive here, and yet you keep going?""",SkullZMinus,"""The 'Battledome' was instituted by the Dovarian governments of long ago. A hellish combat arena where criminals, political enemies, or anyone with a death wish was sent to press their luck. A nice payoff awaited anyone who survived, with the exploits of participants broadcast all through the Two Worlds. This combination of lottery, reality TV, and population control suited the rulers of those days quite nicely. As an authoritarian add-on, big winners were commonly promoted to be soldiers or top members of the Dovarian secret police. For decades 'The Dome' remained a constant, stocked to the brim with gunfire and cameras.

Renn Orvolsky was one of the first big names to come out of The Dome. A repeat winner, he became quite the celebrity in the violence obsessed culture of Dovaria. On camera he remained stoic, a man who would subject himself to such great risk and violence to feed his family and keep his hometown in working order. Behind the camera, however, Renn had much greater ambitions. Many in Dovaria had lost loved ones in The Dome, and Renn was no exception. His brother's gruesome death there had been broadcast for all to see like so many before him. From that day forth, Renn swore on his brother's name that he would end the wretchedness of The Dome and the government that instituted it. 

Renn knew he had the muscles and skill to complete his goal, but he lacked a plan. He racked his brain for ideas, in a moment of mental block he turned on the television. As anticipated, The Dome live feed came on the small screen. Ever since his brother's death such footage made Renn sick to his stomach, yet he could not avert his eyes from the metaphorical train wreck in front of him. Over two dozen combatants were in the arena, facing off against what appeared to be hellishly mutated wildlife. What surprised Renn the most was the weaponry given to the contestants, ranging from plasma swords and laser weapons to massive explosives, all laid throughout the arena. He knew it would be risky, but his grand plans had been given a means to  completion. In the face of his loss, it was only fitting that The Dome would be where Renn would train himself to take on this monumental task.

Renn began to speak of his plans, asking others to join him in The Dome for training. Avoiding the attention of the Dovarian secret police was a necessity, codes and riddles were used to spread messages farther and farther as Renn's fame as champion spread. Raiding parties were put together, the training received in The Dome was used to start militias across the continent, winnings earned were used to purchase black market weapons and other materials for Renn's grand mission. Paradoxically, as Renn's revolution grew, so did the admiration from his Orwellian government. He was a boon for ratings, as much of a success for those overlords as he was for himself. Renn became a full on celebrity, and he milked the admiration for all it was worth. He attended meetings and interviews with high ranking officials as a guest of honor, bringing home intel that would serve to further his mission.

This cycle continued for almost five years. Finally, Renn believed he was ready. The Battledome was having one of its biggest events ever, a nearly 300 combatant event testing a new line of military androids on their way to the frontlines. The officials in charge of The Dome contacted Renn wanting him to take part, this was their biggest spotlight to date and they wanted him in it. This was the best shot Renn would ever have at using The Dome to jump start his revolution, that was the day his plans would have to be thrown into action. He agreed, and went to the drawing board immediately to plan.

The Battledome was the largest, most fortified structure in all of Dovaria. Multiple layers of complex battleground were laid out within it,  enough space to keep the fighting going 24/7. With an obvious safety risk, there were no crowds at these events. The only spectators were a few government officials, there for propaganda purposes. However, word reached Renn that Great Marshal Liza Kirilenko, 3rd in command in the Dovarian government and a military figurehead, would be in attendance. The stage was set, Renn would be bringing an army and would be supplied the weapons, it was finally time to take action.

Renn, along with 300 of his closest comrades, entered The Dome. As the elevator leading to the arena opened, he surveyed the scene. A combat simulation had been set up for the purposes of testing the XZ-27 line of combat drones. A fortified press box had been set up high above the combat floor so that Great Marshal Kirilenko and her associates could see their creations firsthand. Renn and his men had been told that this fight would be easy, mainly as a means to put on a show for the cameras and serve as a basic test of the new droid AI. The plan was that once the fight really got going, a larger group of Renn's associates outside would rush The Dome. The fighters inside would grab Kirilenko and the others, while the saboteurs outside would attempt to bring the infamous building down with plastic explosives.

The fight began as planned. The droids weren't that bright and there weren't that many of them, it looked like it would be an easy fight as promised. However, as the original fight wound down, alarms sounded as the combat elevators opened. Massive armies of droids entered, Great Marshal Kirilenko's voice rang over the PA system. ""We're on to your plan Renn. A couple of your boys were found sneaking around the bars nearby. We know about everything. The guns, the bombs, your little revolution, we beat it all out of them. I do wish you the best of luck in this place. Oh, and if something does happen to you in here, say hello to your brother for me.""

The massive group of droids closed in on Renn and his rag-tag group of soldiers. Their learned tactics was no match for their metallic enemy. What was worse, the camera feed had been caught as to avoid televising such a slaughter. With no broadcast, the crew of outside saboteurs had no way of knowing when to rush The Dome. In their confusion, the secret police had gotten the jump on the groups outside. As great of a fighter as he was, Renn was gunned down with the others without a chance of surviving. 

Renn, the great hero, laid dead in the very dome that created his desire to set his great plans into motion. The revolution had been foiled. The will of the people, however, had not. Despite their best efforts, the Dovarian government had not been able to squelch the stories of Renn and has band of soldiers. With time, others came to follow in Renn's footsteps, succeeding were he had failed. After a great war, the Dovarian Empire fell, their Battledome falling with them. A rule of peace swept the land afterwards, however the necessary violence undertaken by Renn Orvolsky and his comrades will never be forgotten.",jcaseys34
"[WP] ""You're the only one to survive here, and yet you keep going?""",SkullZMinus,"Sam looked at the land around him, the once beautiful landscape was destroyed by the war and was now covered in ash and bodies, the grass was dead and covered in the blood of a few men that he had taken out. His eyes were stained with tears and in his arms laid a woman, his hands were stained with blood from the wound the woman in his arms had taken during the battle, a stab wound in her back was the evidence of cause of death.

""I would do anything to see the smile on your face again Ada, to see your bright blue eyes and beautiful black hair in a ponytail while you cleaned a plate off after a meal."" Sam's voice was quiet and calm but it was strained to stay that way, it took every ounce in him to not cry at the memories they shared. Someone stepped on a twig and snapped it causing Sam to look up and directly into the eyes of one of the men who killed everyone on the ground, his eyes were fixed on Sam and Ada, ""Would you really give anything?"" Sam stood up and walked towards him, every intent on murdering the man or leaving him to suffer in some horrible way but the man pulled out a small revolver and aimed it, ""Would you give anything for that woman?"" Sammy stopped and nodded, unsure of where this was going.

The man had a small smirk rise on his face before continuing, ""My team believes we can achieve time travel with some of the plans we stole from this very place so if you swear yourself to us, we will let you save the girl."" The offer was tempting to Sam, Ada would never forgive him if he joined this group but he needed to save her. He couldn't live without her and she would understand that. Right? Sam walked forward and offered his non dominant hand to shake, ""You have yourself a deal but one question."" Sam took a small knife and slashed the male across the chest and stopped him from firing the gun, ""How dumb do you think I am for you to try and convince me to join?""

Sam took the gun and began to walk away from the man, ""You're the only one to survive here, and yet you keep going?"" The man's voice was tinged with pain and confusion and he was barely able to utter out those words without him looking to be in pain. Sam turned back and looked at the man, ""Someone has to make sure you all pay for these innocent lives."" With his piece said, Sam turned and walked far away from that building.",Thatguyyouseemtohate

[WP] Music is literally the food of love. You are tone deaf.,StanfordBro,"I've loved Claudia for as long as I can remember. The way her long blonde hair shone in the sun during volleyball practice, her satisfied smile as she scored a point, the way she confided in me. She was my best friend in high school, my whole world. We would sleep over at her house and she would talk about boys, asking who I liked. I hadn't thought about them yet, I hadn't thought about anyone but her, but I couldn't express that. She had already caught the attention of many of the boys in our class. They stopped her in the hallway to serenade her with their love, so easily pouring their feelings and intent into the music they had prepared. One boy, Thomas, played the violin so sweetly she wept openly, moved by his love. I didn't understand it at all, to me it sounded like little more than a cat being strangled or stood on. All around me people professed their love through horrific, scratchy pieces of music. I longed for away to let Claudia know how I felt for her but she always saw me as a friend.
One day she asked me to listen to something she was working on for the piano. She said it was for someone special, smiling at me warmly. Did I imagine a blush? I suppressed it, not daring to get my hopes up, nodding at her.
She started playing, it wasn't a bad piece of music but it appeared to be very disjointed, random jarring notes broke up any chance of a melody, causing me to wince. 
""You must really hate this person!"" I finally exclaimed, unable to bear any more of the muddled noise.
She stared at me puzzled for a moment before bursting into tears and running out of the room. I called out to her but she didn't turn around. What did I do? Surely she wanted honest feedback before playing that for the one she loved?

[WP] You are standing in line at a theme park and you slowly begin to realize that the people in front of you are trying to figure out how to cover up a murder they committed.,UnkemptMike,"The sun's breath was hot on my neck as I stood in line for the Boomerang, my local theme park's sole roller coaster. Ever since I was 10, the oldest of my siblings, I had spent countless hours in this line while my brothers and parents went on the less intense rides. We came to this theme park every summer, despite it being sort of sketchy and even dirty. 

Standing in the slow moving line, I couldn't help but to listen in on other people's conversations. It was a habit of mine; I never had anyone to talk to, so I listened. There was a group of four teenaged girls in front of me, and another of two young boys behind me. I let my attention wander between the two conversations.
""We're definitely gonna be in the front this time, I can feel it!"" one of the boys said excitedly.
""I hope so! We've been riding this all day!"" The other lamented.

""I'm totally freaking out right now, Claire!"" The frantic inflection of one of the teens in front of me caught my ear. ""What are we going to do? Where is he right now?""
""He's at my house. Where we left him,"" the girl I assumed was Claire whispered pointedly. ""Sleeping,"" she added loudly. ""Can we not talk about this here?""
The first girl looked around nervously, biting her lip.

""Ahhhhhhh!"" The playful shriek of one of the boys behind me snapped me back into their bubble of conversation. I turned around to see what the fuss was all about, and was met with the sight of one boy held in a headlock by the other. I smiled, they reminded me of my brothers. I listened to them talk about what they thought the front of the rollercoaster would be like, and what rides they'd go on after they accomplished their goal of getting to ride in the front seat.

""What about Ferrina's Pizza?"" one of the girls in front of me asked the others. Her suggestion was met by scoffs. 
""Are you kidding me, Jess?"" Claire asked, eyes narrowed. 
""I don't want to run into anyone we know from school..."" the nervous girl mentioned. The other three nodded. 
""We should go somewhere in Belmont. I know it's almost an hour away but..."" she trailed off, but the others seemed to know what she meant. Why were they so concerned about not seeing anyone from school while eating dinner? I shrugged it off, thinking about my own anxieties about running into acquaintances in public. 

Neither their restaurant  conversation nor the playful yammering of the boys behind me captured my interest, so I began zoning out. I looked at all of the cheerful groups of friends laughing and smiling, and felt a bit sad. I didn't really have any friends, and a small sense of bitterness swelled up between my lungs. 

I was pulled from my thoughts by the strange, hushed question ""did you clean up the blood?"" 

""Shhh!!!"" Three female voices hissed in unison. ""Sorry,"" Claire said. ""We just, y'know, don't have a lot of time. My parents come home tomorrow night! We have to figure this out."" 
""Here?"" Jess asked. 
""Where else?""

'Holy shit,' I thought to myself. 'Did they... did they kill someone?' I was straining my ears to hear them at this point; they were whispering but I had to know.

I felt my body collide with something soft. I looked up to see a woman wearing a shirt emblazoned with the park's logo staring down at me. ""Uhh... sorry,"" I apologized sheepishly as I watched the four girls board the coaster and glide away from me, sinister plans on hold momentarily while they flew through the air. 

I felt a tap on my shoulder. ""Excuse me, miss,"" the taller of the two young boys interrupted my thoughts. ""Would you mind switching spots with us? We really want to be in the front.""
I agreed and motioned for them to step in front of me.

The ride returned to the station and the girls exited and began walking through the rest of the park. I considered following them, but instead I got on the ride, and the whirring sound of the gears pulling the cars up erased them from my mind. ",KnvckleFvck

"[WP] Two people experience the exact same events throughout a day, but for one they lead to the happiest day of their life, for the other the events lead to the worst day of their life.",bovineswine,"Julie wasn’t the type of girl who needed to look fabulous everywhere she went, but today she was making the effort. She had already tried on several outfits before finally settling on a flirty floral knee-length dress. It was a new dress - she had only worn it once before - so she knew it was one her boyfriend had never seen her in. She gave a twirl in front of the floor-length mirror in her bedroom before going to the bathroom to finish getting ready.  
  
She could barely focus as she put on her makeup, she was so distracted by what the afternoon would bring. She applied a coat of mascara to her eyelashes with extra care to avoid poking herself in the eye, as her hands were shaking from nerves and excitement. After wrapping her hair in a formal chignon, she glanced at the clock before bounding down the stairs. 1:03. She was only a few minutes late, but she still rushed to her car, not wanting to be late to her destination. A couple minutes of fumbling in her purse for her keys finally produced a set hanging from a silver keychain which she jammed into her ignition before speeding off.  
  
She flew easily down the freeway for fifteen minutes before she noticed the familiar red glow of brake-lights shining in front of her. The cars around her were all slowing to a stop. There was a sign hanging from the bridge over the freeway that read: Left Lane Closed - Expect Delays. Julie’s anxiety leapt up. Not a traffic jam - on today, of all days! She *couldn’t* be late today. She restlessly drummed her fingers on the steering wheel as traffic crept slowly ahead. Hopefully it would clear soon.  
  
.  
  
At the same time on the other side of town, Ann was zipping herself into a knee-length dress of her own. She had only worn it once before, and memories of that day came flooding back to her as she looked at her reflection in the mirror. Her hands shook as she applied her makeup. It was important that she made the effort to put herself together today, but she was having difficulty concentrating. The alarm clock on her phone buzzed, alerting her that it was one o’clock. Ann ran her fingers through her short hair and straightened some straggling strands before heading downstairs and grabbing her purse. She was only a few minutes late stepping out of her door.  
  
She stood in front of her car door, distractedly fumbling inside her purse for her keys. Finding them, she took a calming breath before getting into her car and backing out of her driveway, heading for the freeway. Not fifteen minutes later, she found herself in the middle of a traffic jam. They had closed one lane for construction. *Why* didn’t anyone know how to merge? Of course this was happening today, on the one day she absolutely *couldn’t* be late. She tapped her fingers on her steering wheel, but didn’t have it in her to yell and shout like she normally would have. Not today.  
  
The traffic began to clear a little while later and Ann was accelerating toward her destination. It took her a while to find a place to park, but she was soon walking toward the sliding doors of the grand building, trying to mentally prepare herself. Inside, a large group of people were all gathered, trying to crane their necks above the crowd, all waiting for someone, like she was. Ann stood next to a young woman in a floral dress, her hair wrapped in a neat bun. The woman smiled broadly at Ann, and Ann could see the excitement painted wildly over her features.  
  
“I’m here to meet my boyfriend,” she told Ann, still beaming.  
  
“That must be so exciting for you,” Ann responded, managing a polite smile in return.  
  
“It IS!” the young woman said. “I haven’t seen him in a year in a half. How long has it been for you?”    
  
Ann paused. “It’s been six months since I’ve seen my son,” she replied.  
  
“Awwww, that must seem like forever. We shouldn’t have to wait much longer though, my boyfriend already texted me saying they’ve landed. They should be coming through here any minute now.”  
  
And then applause chorused through the crowd, as if on cue. A young man in army fatigues ran to the young woman beside Ann, and lifted her into a crushing hug, twirling her around as he kissed her passionately and unashamedly. When he finally set her back on solid ground, the man knelt down on one knee and pulled out a small box from his pocket. The young woman began crying before he’d even opened it to reveal the glimmering diamond inside. Ann smiled to herself, more genuinely this time.  
  
They weren’t the only pair of young lovers reuniting after a long time apart. All across the airport gate the same scene was playing out: husbands were embracing their wives; fathers were crying as they held their babies in their arms for the first time; sons were being held by their tearful mothers, never too old or too strong to keep their moms from worrying. And then just as quickly as it all started, the chaos stopped momentarily, as every man and woman in uniform stood at attention, with their hand in a salute.  
  
Six men in Class A’s were walking down through the crowd toward Ann. Ann stood taller as they approached, straightening out a wrinkle in her black dress. They stopped in front of her, carrying her son between them, wrapped in the American Flag. Although tears bubbled from underneath her eyes, Ann did not cry this time. Her son had been so brave, just like his father before him, and she was going to make them proud. ",clevermuggle

Ana awoke suddenly, jarred out of her dreamless sleep by an unimaginable wave of nausea. She raced to the bathroom, barely making it in time.

""Dear?"" She heard her husband Nathan mutter from the bedroom. ""You ok?""

""Yeah,"" she responded. ""I must have caught something from the kids at school. Being a kindergarten teacher, I'm surprised it doesn't happen more often."" She heard footsteps, and when she looked up, Nate was standing in the doorway, holding out a warm blanket.

""Let's get you back in bed then. I'll get you a bucket for if you get sick again. Thank God you don't have school today."" He crossed the cold tile floor and helped her back to bed, a tiny, impossible hope tickling the back of his mind.

Anna leaned over the toilet of her dorm floor's public bathroom as the waves of nausea washed over her. *What the* FUCK *was in the punch at Derek's party last night?* she wondered as she knelt on the cold floor. She heard the door open, then slam closed entirely too loudly a second later.

""Anna?"" Someone asked from the other side of the room. ""You okay?""

""Yeah,"" she responded. ""I must have drank too much at Derek's party last night. With how often I go out, I'm surprised this doesn't happen more often."" She heard footsteps, and when she looked up, she saw her roommate Natalie standing in the stall door, carrying a warm blanket under her arm.

""Are you sure you're feeling okay, Ana?"" Nate asked, skeptical. His wife was sitting at the kitchen table, downing bowl after bowl of cereal, which she had drowned in–wait for it–*orange juice.*

""Feel great,"" she mumbled, her mouth full of food. ""Feel like I could eat an elephant. Actually,"" she paused, musing over the thought, ""I wonder if elephant tastes good.""

""I'm glad you're feeling better, dear, but you were in bed, literally throwing up *every five minutes* earlier this morning. Maybe you should take it slow.""

""Nah. Must've been some kind of weird stomach bug. Sucker left me damn hungry though. Do we have any pineapples and Sriracha sauce?""

""Honey,"" Nate said gently, his little flicker of hope growing, ""I think we should go see Dr. Corrine."" Ana looked up at him from her disgusting bowl of cereal and orange juice, and he could see the hope there too, a tiny flicker amid a sea of pain and disbelief.

""Are you *sure* you're okay, Anna?"" Natalie asked, skeptical. Her best friend was sitting at the dining hall table, downing bowl after bowl of cereal, which she had drowned in fucking *apple juice.*

""Feel great,"" she mumbled, her mouth full of food. ""Feel like I could eat a hippopotamus. Actually,"" she paused, musing, ""I wonder if hippopotamus tastes good.""

""I'm glad you're feeling better, Anna, but you were in bed, literally throwing up *every five minutes* earlier this morning. Maybe you should take it slow.""

""Nah. I'm lucky I'm young and get over hangovers quickly. Sucker left me damn hungry though. Does the dining hall have pasta and chocolate pudding?""

""Anna,"" Natalie said gently, her little flicker of fear growing, ""I think you should go to your doctor."" Anna looked up at her from her disgusting bowl of cereal and apple juice, and she could see the fear there too, a tiny flicker amid a sea of pain and disbelief.

3:00PM

It was *supposed* to be her weekend off, but Dr. Corrine was on call, though she hoped and prayed for a quiet weekend. But no, of course she wasn't that lucky. Already that morning, she'd seen an overly anxious patient, who, at only *five months,* insisted she was having contractions. Unsurprisingly, the patient had eaten an entire pint of ice cream the night before, and was having run-of-the-mill cramps. On top of that, she'd had to calm the worries of a fifteen year old girl, who was terrified she'd gotten pregnant from giving her boyfriend a blow job. Corrine shook her head. *Maybe I'll get lucky, and no one else will call today,* she thought.

*RIIINNGGG! RIIINNGGG!*

Her phone rang obnoxiously in her pocket, shaking her out of her reverie. ""Hello?"" She answered, annoyance bleeding into her voice.

""Hello, Dr. Corrine, this is Nate, Ana's husband. Is there any way you can see us today? My wife was very ill this morning, but now seems to be craving our entire pantry mixed together…"" He trailed off, seemingly unwilling to voice his suspicion out loud. 

She didn't blame him. She'd been seeing Ana since she was a teenager, and had told her since her first appointment that there was a very slim chance, almost zero, that she'd ever be able to have children. At sixteen, the diagnosis hadn't phased her. That changed quickly, though, during her senior year of college. That was the year that she met Nate. She'd always opened up to Corrine, and it was clear that this man was something special. As she graduated and progressed in her career and relationship with Nate, she began to feel more grief over her diagnosis. She began researching fertility treatments and experimental drugs and operations for her condition, grasping at straws to have even a shred of hope of having a child. Corrine had warned her that, even if the treatments did work (which was unlikely), any pregnancy she had would be extremely high-risk.

""Nate, bring her in immediately. If this is what I think it is, we need to act immediately to make sure she stays safe and healthy.""

Dr. Corrine hung up, cursing whatever gods she could think of. If Ana was pregnant, she'd need weekly monitoring. She gathered her sweatshirt and ran a comb through her hair.

*RIIINNGGG! RIIINNGGG!*

""GODDAMNIT!"" Corrine cursed out loud before answering the call. The voice on the other end trembled.

""Hello, Dr. Corrine, this is Anna. Is there, uh, is there any way you can see me today? I've been, uh, feeling really strange lately, and, uh, I just want to make sure it's not…"" She trailed off, seemingly unable to voice her suspicion aloud.

Corrine didn't blame her, either. Anna was a Division 1 college athlete, so dedicated to her sport that she hadn't had her period in years. She had warned her that, even though her risk of pregnancy was likely low, it wasn't impossible, and STDs were still an issue. However, she knew that Anna had a rebellious streak, frequenting frat parties and taking irresponsible risks with her health. She probably took her lack of a period as a license to eschew proper protection.

""Come in as soon as you can. I have another patient coming in, but I can fit you in as well.""

Grumbling at the loss of her ""free"" weekend, Dr. Corrine slammed the door to her house and began the short drive to her office.

----

Ana and Anna arrived at Dr. Corrine's office almost at the exact same time. Ana was holding onto Nate, talking in hushed tones about the impossible possibility that now faced them. Anna was trailed by Natalie, telling her a bit too loudly and forcefully that it was probably nothing, and that the punch last night had likely been spiked with some weird drug.

The doctor burst hurriedly through the door a moment later, mumbling an apology for being late. She then rushed Ana and Nate into an exam room.

Before the couple could say anything, Corrine ran through all her usual questions at light speed. First, normal questions assessing a patient's general health, then symptoms that pointed to pregnancy, then symptoms specific to Ana's case. Thankfully, the latter seemed not to be a problem, however, Ana had missed two periods, but hadn't told anyone, chalking it up to stress instead.

""Well, there's only one way to know for sure,"" Corrine said after finishing her questions. She pointed in the direction of the bathroom. ""Ana, you know the drill.""

After Ana and Nate left, Corrine hurried back to the waiting room, and called in Anna. She set her and her friend up in a room down the hall, and ran through the same standard list of questions.

""Anna, I'm going to need you to provide me with a urine sample. I'm going to run some tests on it, one of which will be for pregnancy. I'll let you know the results about 10 minutes after you take the test."" Anna nodded, fear brimming in her eyes.

A couple minutes later, Dr. Corrine began the tests on Ana and Anna's samples, careful not to mix them given the women's similar names. After the tests were finished, she walked back to the exam rooms, results in hand. Both women would be leaving in tears, she knew, but only one would be tears of joy. She told Ana and Nate first, then Anna and Natalie. She brought ample tissues, offering both empathy and encouragement at the appropriate times.

As she watched them leave, she thought about the irony of the situation, how both women had the same result, yet what it meant for each of them couldn't have been more different. Corrine couldn't help but think it was unfair. The woman whose greatest dream was to have a child left devastated, her last hopes crushed by the strangest stomach bug Corrine had ever heard of. Meanwhile, the other left giddy, discussing the party she'd be attending later that night, her irresponsible decisions vindicated by a simple shake of the head.",backstrokerjc

In your life you're living in, you may be happy and have everything. In your alternate world, you're depressed and have nothing. 

The world Jack lived in was amazing for him. High class job, beautiful wife, and 2 smart kids. Jack lived the perfect life, always having a great time with his family and his friends. 

Jack's alternate world was terrible. He lived in slums and had a drug addict wife and 2 juvenile kids. He had to sell drugs out of his house just so he could barely scrape up enough money to pay his bills and put food on his table. 

The way these alternate worlds work is essentially the same thing. Everything happens the same, just different outcomes and emotions. For example, in one world you could lose your job but be happy because you're getting a better paying one. In your other world, losing your job could have a devastating outcome. 

Everything turned to hell for Jack on December 25th, 2016. It was supposed to be an amazing day. His family had a tradition where they would stay up until 12 A.M where it'd turn from Christmas Eve to Christmas Day. Then they'd open there presents. The clock turned 12 and they was all sitting in the living room. Happy and delightful. Jack's door was suddenly kicked in and 4 armed guys burst in. They held there family at gunpoint, and demanded all the presents and there new flat screen TV with all of Jack's money. The armed men then held Jack at gun point while they kidnapped his 2 daughters and his wife. Jack was crying in tears waiting to wake up from this nightmare. The man holding Jack at gun point cocked his shotgun, and pulled the trigger. It was the worst day of Jacks life, now he was stone cold dead. 


Today was the best day of Jacks life. He was severely depressed and had 4 presents under the tree, one for each family member. He hated his family, and they hated him too. His kids were juveniles. His wife was a crack addict. Jack and his family lived in a trailer in the slums. His family hated him because he was supposed to be a working man, but he could barely even get food for his family and they lived on welfare. The clock struck 12 and the family decided to open there presents. Jack's half broken door was then kicked in by 4 armed men. They wanted Jack's and his wife's drugs. Jack was forced at gun point to show them there stash and then give it to them. He complied and gave the drugs over. The 4 men thought that wasn't good enough, and then they told Jack that they wanted his 2 daughters and wife. The biggest man of the group walked up to Jack, cocked his shotgun and pointed it at his head. Jack said, ""I was already going to kill them tonight. Hurry up and pull the trigger and do my dirty work for me."" He then shot Jack. 

It was the best day of his life. After all, he hated his family.  ",loadingDerReise

That's how they all grew up. Everyone in this world sees those two specific colors, nothing more, nothing less. When she was a child, people said that once she fell in love with someone she were destined to meet, her whole world shifts. She never believed them, rumors and old myths are never real, until she met him. Whenever they touched, vibrant, beautiful color bloomed right before her. *Whenever she was with him, everything was beautiful.*

There's a vast universe beneath our fingertips, and many galaxies inside all of us. She saw beauty in the summer breeze and empty firlds, in the city lights and passing cars, in soaring clouds and wishing stars. At times she'd cast her eyes to the wandering stars and the moon, understanding just how immense the universe was. It was a miracle they crossed paths. 

She stopped seeing the normal black and white, remembering the moments they spent together, before time wedged its way between them. Constellations in the sky, how they connected to create something beautiful, all she could see, and think about was him. His eyes were filled with the galaxies above, glistening towards the promises of a bright future, one day it wouldn't include me. There he was, asking her what she wished for. She stood, a fool who wished to fall in love. 

He was the most beautiful galaxy. Caught up in the moment, the infinite stars in the sky, how the world seemed so beautifil when our fingers intertwined. Before she knew it, the truth, the words slipped out of her mouth.

He was tired of the medications, the failed attempts to prolong his feeble life. The smell of urine, bleach, and the dying had driven him to leave this place. More than anything he wanted to see Lake Calhoun one last time. 

Jon's wife had passed some 17 years previously. He had no children, and most of his friends had died of age or disease. In Jon's mind, this gave him cause to spend extravagantly as he wouldn't be inconveniencing anyone down the road. He purchased a first class ticket to Minneapolis and several bottles of 21 year old Lagavulin.

As Jon boarded the plane, his body ached, and his eyes were growing dim. 

Rachel had just accepted an offer for a PhD candidacy from the University of Minnesota. She had struggled all of her career for this honor. The years of research, the failed relationships, and the soul crushing debt were the cost of this triumph. Ever cent she could muster went towards building the new life in front of her. Her ticket was the cheapest she could find. A seat in the back near the lavatory. 

The snow howled across the tarmac as the plane took to the sky. 

Cold winds slid across the wings as it went, ice slowly building along its edges. 

The plane stalled out as the pilot attempted to land. It fell from the sky like a leaf from a tree. From the window, Jon and Rachel could both see Minneapolis slowly rising up to greet them.",Sevren

There I met up with my neighbor, which was a surprise because he always bought his breakfast to go. I joined him for breakfast since he looked sick. I told him to get time off work but he said he had an important meeting that day. His right hand is bandaged but I decided to not be nosy about that.

My office was right next to the police station and Bryan was an officer, we decided to go to work together. He looked really down that day, I tried my best to cheer him up but he could only manage that polite smile of his. His job was stressful, I would know, my fiance Derek was also a police officer at the same precinct. Sometimes he would come back home late and grumpy, and there would be nothing short of being illegal that I could do to relieve him from the burden of his work. I felt sorry for Bryan. He always seemed shy. We had invited him over for poker nights but he always refused. He was never the friendly type so I was glad when we could share breakfast and a ride together.

That afternoon, my colleague and I chose a new bistro to try out for lunch. We even had a bottle of wine because one of them was going to be transferred to another branch of our bank, a few states away. There weren't many other diners there because my boss had let us out for lunch 30 minutes earlier. They were only a couple sitting outside.

Suddenly two men with gasmask came in the door shouting. They shot at the young couple who were having lunch outside because they tried to flee. I could see them on the floor bleeding. The two men were shouting something I had heard and feared. The rest of us were ordered to tie each other up as the gunmen babbled about their plan, their manifesto, anything that justified what they were doing.

Sirens started to wail and police cruisers started to block the street. My heart jumped when I saw Derek. He had gotten to work early we didn't get to see each other that morning.

Hell broke loose as the gunmen started shooting at the police. From where I was on the floor I could see the main door. The gunmen panicked as something from the cruisers cordon fell on the streets. It was so surreal.

So surreal that when I saw Derek fell I didn't even react. It was over in minutes with both the gunmen dead, and Derek. The policemen untied us and I went straight to Derek, telling the officers who tried to stop me that I was his fiance.

He was on the ambulance stretcher. He was gone. I felt a hand on my shoulder and saw Bryan with tears in his eyes. I hugged him and cried. That was the worst, most traumatizing day of my life.
________________________________________________________________
The girl who lived next door joined me for coffee. I was not in the mood for a conversation but she was pretty. She's the girl with a smile on her face all the time, makes my jaw hurt thinking about it. She got it lucky, an executive job at the bank, a house all paid off, a fiance with good standing in the community. Maybe I should invite her for lunch, maybe it will piss Derek off and cloud his judgment.

I decided against the silly idea but I met her again during lunchtime. She was with her colleague, dining at the fancy bistro a few blocks away. I had responded to a call about a hostage situation. Every available patrol car was there. There were 2 gunmen with semiautomatic rifles. Patrons and staff of the bistro were tied up. They were all within view from the front door.

Derek got himself shot and died in the ambulance. I was so glad that when I hugged his fiance, I cried. Tears of joy. There would be no IA meeting after lunch. No goody two shoes will be a witness to me stealing drugs from the evidence room now. His fiance was clinging to me that if I let go she would fall crumpled to the floor. So I embraced her, not saying anything that would betray my sublime happiness. That was the best day of my life.",ohchaste

And to an extent it was justified. Why would someone emotionally burdensome be hired over some nearly perfect cherubim? This principle of distinction manifested itself noticeably in the mindset of the citizens. Certain negative traits were heralded as significantly more pernicious than others. After years of hearing family, friends, and coworkers scorn certain characteristics, it was difficult, if not impossible for these people to overcome them. It almost became their existence.

Although many were stuck with less than desirable traits, it was comforting to know that everyone had a positive trait: a shred of hope to cling to. Occasionally, it could tip the scales and redeem someone otherwise destined for shame and isolation. However, Sydney was different. Day in and day out, Sydney was a testament to the cruelty of the system and the horrors of humanity. In retrospect, the immense ignominy he brought our country was warranted. Our world was predicated on allowing the best to ascend to the top and repressing the worst, casting the unlucky few off like one would trash. It facilitated efficiency, prosperity, and trust in bureaucratic processes. The zeitgeist demanded that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few. In doing so, however, it ignored the suffering masses and built a country on their backs, contorted and bent with stereotypes, derision, resignation, and inferiority. Erudite scientists have ""scientifically proven"" that these people are lesser beings. Unsurprisingly, those who benefit most from that claim have wholeheartedly accepted it. Those on the bottom are ignored and scorned until they are needed, as if they are tools in the musty corner of a shed. Sydney, on the other hand, was not forgotten so easily.

The name Sydney has virtually disappeared among newborns, and a host of older Sydneys have opted for a name that doesn't sour faces. A select few have stubbornly kept it, steadfast that their reputations mask the stench of *Sydney*.

In a sense, it was inevitable that there would be an exception. Humans are remarkable in that way. No matter how rigid a belief may be, there is always an exception, wagging its finger in the face of the ideological devotees. With such a sectarian society the possibilities for an exception were myriad. The world being as cruel as it was, it gifted us with definitively the worst human in history. What nobody had expected was that it'd come as someone who was charismatic and influential.

You click the link and see that your time of death is listed as two hours from now,chris3spice,"There was no time, the clock filling my silent room with an annoying ticking noise. I couldn't concentrate with the due date for my history essay getting closer with each passing second. I stared at my computer screen hoping for a flash of inspiration, the blank white document shining in my eyes. I took a sip out of my favorite drink, milk. Sighing, I give in to my plagiaristic instincts and went on Wikipedia to find the page I needed.

I found the article on Justinian I, the Byzantine emperor. I copied and pasted the whole page onto my essay and printed it. As my printer slowly spewed out my essay, I took my phone and clicked onto the disambiguation page and noticed that my name, Justin Smith, was listed. Curiously enough as I browsed through the page, it described my entire life up to now flawlessly. It was a perfect biography.

I scrolled all the way down to the long page only to see my time of death. It ominously read July 27th, 2017 at 00:00.

""No...."" I whispered. I dropped my phone and the printed history essay. 

I glanced towards my classic watch. It was July 26th and midnight was nearing. I had two hours left before my death. Quickly, I focused on my computer frantically trying to see what information I may glean from the page. Alas, as soon as my gaze rested upon the screen, a power outage occurred. 

""Hey Dad? You there? Is the power out for the whole city?"" I shouted from my chair. 

My sole reply was the dreadful ticking noise. In the darkness, I weighed my options. It was too dark to check my watch and I had no idea where my phone was in the pitch black. I felt that fifteen minutes had passed but I was not certain. I threw my watch against the wall, rage welling up inside of me. The watch settled on my bed. I walked over to pick it up, only to find my phone resting underneath my bedsheets.

""Urgh... Idiot!"" I said under my breath as my fist slammed against my bed.

With my death looming over every second, I panicked. Rushing to the door, hands shaking, I turned the knob only to find it locked from the outside. I was trapped in my room. I saw a dark shadow from outside my window. 

Suddenly, all the glass in my room started shaking. I stared at my glass of milk violently clattering on the floor. All of the glass simultaneously shattered and wind rushed through my window. 

I took a step back and told myself, ""Calm down Justin. There is still an hour left."" 

I took out my phone and messaged everyone in my contacts that all the glass in my room broke and there may be someone outside. With no replies, I called the cops. That is until no one picked up. I decided that my best option was to run outside to my bike and try to ride to the police station a few streets away.

I ran out my window only to bump into a hooded figure outside. I couldn't make out a face. The streeplamp showing only a silhouette of a weapon in his outstretched, gloved hand. 

""Wh- wh- who are you? What do you want?"" I cried.

The hooded figure rasped, ""Your life."" 

I laughed at the realization that there was no escape. Until the flash of inspiration I was waiting all night for came to me. That is until I felt severe pain in my heart. I couldn't breathe.  My lungs were choking and I coughed out blood. 

""So the time has come."" I said with my last few breaths. 

The figure slowly faded and simply replied, ""Your last 50 minutes will be of dying on this sidewalk slowly."" 

I shakily took out my phone with one hand. I clicked the edit button. My vision was failing and everything was blurry. I fell to my side with my phone making a cracking noise on the sidewalk. I changed my time of death with my last bits of strength. Everything faded to darkness. I awoke the next day in the hospital. 

""How are you feeling? You had a violent fit last night."" The doctor said smiling.

""Ph- phone."" I managed to say.

The doctor handed it to me. I checked the page only to find everything there previous to my encounter blank. All that was left was two paragraphs. I read silently: Justin Smith died at the age of 16 on July 27th, 2017 at 20:00.  The clock on my phone read 7:59 pm as the battery died.

The doctor smiled at me while putting on a plastic glove.

Timothy Talking's death started off with one simple word. He was scrolling through his own Wikipedia page when suddenly he noticed that the date of his death was on it, two hours from when he first saw it. It is believed he said ""What?"" and proceeded on his quest to find out what this meant.

He looked at the page for a few minutes but noticed that the Death page included detailed instructions, they are as follows. 

1.  Go to 35 Muhallan drive. It is where your killer is.

2. Once you get there be sure to grab a weapon of sorts and take it with you 

3. Go to apartment 4a and knock on the door.

4. If it doesn't open, go inside

He followed these instructions and continued into the room. He had about 1 hour left according to the page but he did not pay attention to the open article on his phone as he investigated the area. 

""Don't hurt me,"" Someone said underneath the table as Timothy looked around. He saw him and threatened him a bit about who he was or what he wanted. They talked for about 45 minutes about how he can predict the future by making a pact with an evil being. The person said that everything he wrote on the Wikipedia article was true and accurate. Timothy dropped his weapon in confusion and asked him why he needed to kill him. 

 A noise, however, came out from the closet and Timothy went to investigate. With 5 minutes left on the clock, he opened the door and a 357 magnum shot him straight in the face. Death came along, took Timothy away, and told the other man that he was clever, but not clever enough. The other man laughed it off but shoved death out the door as he went to the Wikipedia article, and as he saw pre-destined, deleted the arti-

The black void of nothingness that was once an infinitely large set of galaxies. Reality herself was dead, along with every sinner, demon and god who once was.

And in all that time, you didn't even bother to look for me! You didn't care!"" I replied with all the vitriol I could muster. 

""I did! I cared for you! I ripped apart the entire universe for you! I spent eighteen and a quarter trillion years tracking you down! I perished all life to keep you safe!"" Adam roared. 

""How many stars did you commit genocide on? How many children burned? How many lives did you spend on me?"" I whimpered. 

""I... I don't know..."" He softly responded.

""Liar."" I accused, quietly.

""Nineteen sextillion, four hundred and eighty-nine quintillion, seven hundred and six quadrillion, eleven trillion, thirty-two billion, five hundred and forty-three thousand, six hundred and eighty-two different lifeforms."" He muttered, tears in his eyes. 

""All of those lives gone for a woman you haven't seen in many, many, many lifetimes worth of years. Why?"" I responded, resisting his sentimentality.

""Because, Eve, you were born from my rib. You were created alongside me at the dawn of the universe, crafted from the hands of a cruel God who is long dead. We were the only two beings capable of immortality. You were my only possible companion and, Eve, I am so, so sorry for what I put you through. But we have survived the tides of eternity hand-in-hand. We watched the Gardens of Eden wilt. We saw our planet die. We watched our species fade, along with the sun we admired in our earliest days. The earth once beneath our feet disintegrated. Empire after empire, system after system, species after species, they all died out. But you stood beside me as we strolled through infinity."" Adam spoke, taking my hand in his and holding me close as all we knew imploded.

[WP] It's New Year's Eve. Cities are exploding around the world at midnight. You look at your watch: it's 11:48.,god_johnson,"*Time is really underrated* you think to yourself. You realize that panicking would be a waste of time. Hell, you have 12 minutes left before you can join David Bowie at that theater and watch a live reenactment of Star Wars. It really isn’t too hard to forget about the Earth at this point. You had already prayed for the world to not end in 2012, and you knew that the calendar could only be extended to a certain point. You were still disappointed that all of those hours you had put into work would come to an utterly useless end, and that you had wasted your life doing nothing original. In the end, you had only been surviving your job to buy distractions to forget about work. It was hopeless. All of it. You look over at the wall. It’s 11:54. Was this the clock that you set 5 minutes back… or was it forward? *Eh, whatever.*

You decide to embrace your end. Write something down so that when someone finds this wreckage, they would remember you. You knew you should’ve moved to the country and worked on a farm a long time ago. At least you wouldn’t have sacrificed a couple dozen years of your life in a boisterous pot of false hope. You open your bedside table to try and find a pencil, only to find a gun. *Wait a minute. I never had this? You look around. This isn’t my room… wait no it is, just maybe a little shuffled.* The time is 11:58. *At least I know that the clock isn’t slow.* You look back down at the gun. *I don’t have enough time to write that message. Besides it will probably be destroyed if I wrote it down on paper. Hell, if these cities are exploding, I might as well have some control over my life. I’ll do it. I’ll pull this stupid trigger and take my life before the Earth takes mine.* You pull the trigger. You hear a click.

You wake up to the sound of car horns outside. Well that was weird. In front of you is your TV, switched to the local city news channel. There is no anchor, but the set is still live. In bold letters there are the words “Tokyo Decimated. New Years Explosions Not Coincidental. Mandatory Evacuation For All Residents of Los Angeles”. You look down at your watch.

I'm really not in the mood for emotion right now. Trying to execute my most stress-inducing job yet while also dealing with this terrified family that I've created is a hell of it's own. 

Why did I ever think *children* were a good idea? Sure they provided an escape from time to time but honestly were they really worth it? They're causing so much trouble. 

""It's okay honey, everything will be alright.""

Ah, the women I married, still trying to cater to the fearful. How dull does she have to be to not yet have realized that I really don't care about this little family? And how long do I have to endure until it's all fucking over. *12 minutes*. Christ. I don't think even *I* have to patience to watch these three people express their fear for another *12 minutes*. 

""Calm down, hun""

Probably not the best thing to say to her. But I just don't have the energy. I mean, why would o even care? It'll all be over soon anyway. 

""Calm down. You want me to **calm down!?**""

Oh here we go. And now I remember why I shouldn't let myself have any feelings for this family. 

She bickered at me a bit until she realized, or rather *thought*, that I was caught in a mental struggle (AKA I stare solemnly at a wall to make her think that I'm devastated by what's going on around us). 

*10 minutes*. 

I wonder how many New Years parties were ruined. New husbands and wives celebrating their first New Years as a married couple. 

New families trying to show their young ones the ball dropping. Families experiencing the holidays with their toddlers for the first time.  Their second baby at the age of two point at the shiny ball as it dropped, and the mother laughing, crying, almost; that's when she first saw personality in my daughter. Her daughter. She was a beautiful girl. Is a beautiful girl. So young. It's a shame. 

Agh why do I always do this to myself. 8 minutes left and I just *have* to go down these cutesy little thought trails about this cutesy little family. This was all part of the plan. This was all an excuse to get an apartment in the center of the city. It's a blueprint of my
workplace, not a book of my life. I have a job to do. 

7 minutes. She's grabbing my arm now. The youngest one. *Why* did I *have* to name her. I joked about wanting to name the second one, *only* because the wife named the first, and I felt that it'd make good relationship banter. But I gave her a name. Emily. My Emily. *FUCK*. 

I stormed out of the room. I heard yelling but I ignored it. She wasn't happy that I was ignoring loved ones in a time of need. 

I went to my closet. There was a banging at my bedroom door. Did I lock it? I didn't remember doing that. Out of habit, I guess. I've been at this for a long time, this shouldn't be a surprise. 

In my closet sat my suitcase. I opened it. I just had to see it one last time. It was just one of many, but mine was the most important. The heart of the city. The most dense population. He would be proud. *They* would be proud. 

The banging at the bedroom door for louder. 

""MICHAEL.""

The cries for my name started out angry. But as the time ticked on, and the cries of the daughter grew louder, the calling of my name became less angry, and more desperate. 

After a few minutes, the crying started to bother me. She was crying too now. She's supposed to be the one that makes this easy. She is supposed to calm them down so I don't have to *feel* anything. 2 minutes. Only two fucking minutes and she won't shut up. 

I gave up. I went to the door and opened it. The wife immediately made eye contact with me, her blue eyes begging me to stay in the room with her. I closed the door. The screaming grew louder again. I didn't care. I have Emily now. I took her. 

""Daddy, what's going to happen? What's going to happen?""

She asked over and over. 

""Shhh. Shhh""

She finally hushed. 

""Emily, I want to show you something""

""What, daddy"" 

I opened the suitcase. 15 seconds left on the clock. 

""I love you Emily. I've only ever loved you.""

I felt a tear stream down my face. Something I've never felt before. I held Emily tight. I love her. I only love her. 1 second left. ",IamZakR

[WP] Write Out your Most Memorable Dream as a Story for all of Reddit!,haunterdry5,"(Part 1/2 - Thank you for enjoying this, it has been great writing this and getting the memory out of my mind!

This is 100% real I remember every detail, and this dream was long.)

I am so lost…

The museum had closed hours ago and my desperate foot falls echoed through the large empty halls. My only companions, the darkened relics of the Royal Ontario Museum circa 1999. I was only 10 at the time and this is the longest I’ve been without my mother and siblings. To say I was frightened was an understatement. I wandered the second floor, security lighting shining through the shadowy forms of taxidermied mammals. I moved into the main hall. Before the renovation that moved the dinosaurs to 2 more stories up and into a large windowed area, they were once on the second floor to the left of what used to be the main doors, and that is exactly where I was headed.

 I wandered into the darkened hall and shivered as I glanced up at the Mastodon skeleton the reached unbelievably high, at its feet the massive domed skeleton of the Glyptodon seemed almost to cut off my exit going back toward the entrance.  I had no choice but to move forward. The museum’s dinosaur wing was a favorite of mine as a child. The mammoth and early human displays were always stunning, but of course the Allosaurus and triceratops skeletons always were the highlight, and fittingly were the last leg of the wing. However to get  there you needed to pass through the most unintentionally scary room, that even during the day, with my family present I preferred not to spend too long in. It was the room with the Plesiosaur. 

I remember the lay out of the room to this day, the path continued to the right where a series of Hadrosaur skeletons were, you could pass right through the room hugging the right wall and not look into the sunk back corner where the suspended skeleton of the titanic ocean monster hang along with the enormous spiral shell of a nautilus and the smaller skeleton of a prehistoric shark. Knowing which room I was entering I forced my eyes forward to the Hadrosaur room until the security lights went out and the rooms atmosphere lights came on. The room was painted all black except for a blue light that mimicked the light refractions underwater. The rhythmic motion of the lights drew eyes into the corner where I came face to face with the waiting open mouth of the Plesiosaur skeleton as it jerked against its suspensions to try and eat me. I screamed and broke into a sprint through the Hadrosaur room around the corner where I ran through the final sections of Allosaurus and triceratops skeletons as they too began to shake against their bonds and resumed their fight long frozen in time. 

I burst into the main hall and heard the sounds all around me of the museum slowly coming to life. Simultaneously, a dream come true and a horrifying nightmare.

Being locked in a museum after dark was always a desire of mine. I read books about it, I recall a story where a young boy and girl stayed a museum for many days, and watched movies about it, and this dream was no doubt partially inspired by a singular TV special of an old childhood Canadian favorite, ‘Sharon, Lois, and Bram.’ It’s been years since I’ve seen it but I remember many details. The plot is unfortunately not one of those pieces, however, no surprise that the setting was none other than the Royal Ontario Museum, and (as you might have guessed) it took place after the museum was closed and it was dark. I remember a low angle shot of Bram playing a saw and singing a scary song inside the newly refurbished ‘batcave’ attraction in the very same taxidermied animal room. I remember them chasing their mascot, a person in an elephant costume through the halls with a group of children. I remember being amazed that this was a museum I knew, and that they were there after dark. 
 
I, not like many kids, found museums endlessly fascinating. Rarely when my family visited, and we visited frequently, would I let anyone leave before we experience almost all of it. There are many exhibits that still exist in the form I remember to this day and visiting it again is often like travelling back in time, both in the sense that the artifacts achieve this effect and for my own past. Even today (with the gaudy “crystalline” structure attached) areas like the gallery of birds, and the furniture from around the world remain the same. It makes remembering the details of my dream easier and more vividly terrifying. 
 
I remember the main hall, a massive glowing dome of gold which still stands today but it feels forgotten, out of the way, something that no one visits. It hadn’t been used as the main entrance in years, even during that time when I was a child. Back then, the entrance and exit used to be in the basement by the cafeteria, which is why when I pulled on its massive ornate doors try in desperation to escape they didn’t move. The space that felt like it drawled you during the day had a startlingly stronger sensation of nothingness in the near dark. The sensation if being watched, of the terror of not belonging here, and the noise of impossible happenings filled me with dread. I ascended quickly up the side staircase toward the second floor again.  Despite the noise from the dinosaur wing, the calamity of the medieval armor that lay below was even more frightening considering the dangers that lined the walls of that room. 
 
Against better judgement, I found refuge in the taxidermied animals once again. Among them there was little noise, as if whatever cause the bones of the dinosaurs to stir had not affected this wing yet.  Near the back end of the animal displays lays 2 unique displays that I mentioned earlier, the batcave and the gallery of birds. In my dream and memory they are right across from each other across the hall of taxidermied mammals. And tit’s I exactly where I end up. The hall of birds is little more than a giant glass case filled from top to bottom with all manner of stuffed birds. If you look hard enough you can find almost any bird imaginable. In my dream they are silent, the silhouette of the ostrich and the albatross unmistakable against the mess of shadows and feathers as I gravitate away toward the last place I want to be in the dark.  
 
As you enter the batcave on any normal visit the wave of trepidation hits you. Even as an adult visiting the cave,  I still get the same sense of danger around every dimly lit turn the fake cave. Certain areas and above your heads are stuffed bats, climbing out of crevices, clinging together in furry clumps,  meanwhile the loudspeakers play on loop their incessant chittering and squeaking. As an adult it is almost bearable so that I now can traumatize my own son, but as a child there is no reason not to believe that there are not actual bats or that something scarier than a bat might be around that corner. Now I’m in the cave, and as sure as I was the bats were alive when I was awake, I have no doubt in my mind that they are here. They swarm, I run, the cave is nearly double the size it is in reality, I run forever. 
 
I stumble out of the cave and back into the silent taxidermied mammals wing that the end of the cave connects too. I lie there panting in the silence of the wing with my heartbeat and breathing the only thing I hear. In my dream the wind is a long hallway with conclave covered by glass. Inside, a scene is built for the stuffed mammalian resident. If this was ever true of the ROM they had long since changed it and in my research since I’m unable to find photo evidence to back up my memory, but I recall three of the 6 or 7 dioramas very clearly. The first was a family of primates, sitting in the canopy of the tropical rain forest. One chimp had his hands raised to his chest and hooted excitedly while a mother and baby climbed nearby. A green anaconda coiled around a branch and a huge butterfly rested on a leaf. On a limb near the back, a Panther stalks. To those extremely perceptive, if you looked at the floor of the diorama, miniature elephants gave the illusion that we are extremely high in the air. The second case was filled with fake snow. A long haired yak faces down a lone wolf. The background shows the yaks have created a protective circle around their young as the other wolves look for weaknesses. Nearby an arctic hare watches the ominous scene.  
 
Lastly, in my memory and in my dream I see the diorama clearly, I walk up the glass and peer inside. Beyond is the African savannah. Painted elephants roam a wide open expanse of yellowish grass as far as the eye can see and right before me a pair of hyena enjoy the scavenge of a zebra. Not far though lies a lion looking content in the sun. As I touch the glass to get a closure look suddenly I’m filing forward passed the wall and into the diorama. I stumble forward and hit grassy dirt. As I sit up it is immediately obvious that I’m being looked at. Sure enough the two hyena and the lion are all looking at me surprised. I stumble back to climb through the window to safety and of course, it is gone. I am in the savannah. The looks of surprise are quickly dissolved into the territorial guttural growls of a lion and a pair of hyenas. Barely able to comprehend what is happening I cannot summon the strength to move, only cower as the animals approach me. Then before they strike I awake. I remember running to my mother and her telling me it was all a dream and that it was fine and you cannot get stuck in the museum after dark. Then it all gets fuzzy. 
 
To its day I love museums and the ROM in particular holds a special place in my heart. I hope that when you read this, that you know 1 thing. That the fear I felt that night as my ultimate dream came true was only matched by my enthusiasm and love for that beautiful building and it’s treasures. And even though I’m an adult now, with children of my own, it’s fun to imagine hiding in the bathroom stall while the doors lock and lights go out. Finally, emerging into the museum, having it all to myself and being locked inside for a night.",Skele11

It was sparse, with only a small twin bed placed against the wall, with some toys strewn about on a circular rug. He felt unsteady in the middle of the room, with his head cocked a bit sideways and his body leaning toward the window, drawn by an undefined apprehension to a presence outside. As he looked out and upward, he became aware of the outline of some moving object far away in the sky, backlit by a brilliantly shining full moon. As it began to move in a spiral pattern toward him, at first still far away, but with a flush closer and closer, he felt within an impending contact with this swirling terror. In a flash before its entrance through the window, he made out its shape.

I reset the examination ray, returned anxiously to the hot seat, and pressed the button.

It would take eight minutes and thirty-two seconds. Just like it did last time. Just like it did for the hundreds of others I'd tested. Who'd all returned positive results.

Could I really not have a soul? No more than a year ago, before this research had gone underway, I would have told myself yes. I did tell myself that, in fact. The concept of a soul, back then, seemed chimerical, anti-scientific drivel. We are conceived, we are born, we live, we die. That's how it's worked since the dawn of man. I had resigned myself to that fact during prepubescence, even while enduring the long hours wedged between my parents on a church pew each Sunday.

Okay, so since I already knew, or assumed, actually... that I'm a soulless animal, then maybe this isn't such a tragedy. I could learn to accept. There are more difficult disabilities. I'd still wander among the normal people as I always had, day after day, conducting my business until my hourglass ran out. At least I'd know with certainty what lay in store.

I noticed that the soft, steady white noise of the machine's labor had ended. The eight minutes and thirty-two seconds were over and I hadn't realized. Simultaneously, I felt like bounding from the chair and remaining in its embrace for the rest of my life. After a while, almost involuntarily, I lifted myself to my feet and slowly approached the results display.

I didn't further delay my pace. I didn't close my eyes. I didn't wince. I needed to tell myself the truth.

The red dashes and curves materialized into language.

"[WP] You are the lead scientist who proved souls are real. However running your tests against the broader population, seems not everyone has one...",hotpotato70,"The machine was finally working. A device designed to see souls had finally come on line, and hundreds of people were lining up to be tested.
 
The first woman, Johannes Twilly, the inventory of this wonderful machine, her soul was a bright blue swirling ball in her chest.

The 58th person tested, one Thomas Walters, had a dull army green brick sitting inside him. 

Until subject 3328, they were having amazing results.

""Um, Dr. Twilly? You need to see this"" shouted the man running toe machine. Dr. Twilly broke off a conversation with one of the most recent test cases and walked over to the machine.
""What's wrong Dominic? What-"" her words died in her throat as she saw the empty screen. 
""Wha... Did you scan him?"" Dominic nodded, eyes wide.
""Try it again! It must be a glitch"" Dominic frantically typed on the keyboard, resetting the machine and activating another scan. Again, nothing. Dr. Twilly was stunned. A head popped out from the machine, which resembled a giant metal cylinder.
""Um, excuse me, is everything alright? This is taking a really long time"" Dr. Twilly looked over at the man, her face going slack with shock and disbelief as she saw his bright orange shock of hair

What are you staring at?"" asked Emily, a researcher. She glanced out of the window of the lab, trying to match my gaze. Her brow furrowed. 

Through special lenses attached to my glasses, which cast the world in a strange dimness, I saw her familiar soul shimmering faintly in my periphery. It was like peach heat waves radiating from her upper chest and around her ears. She tucked a lock of equally peachy hair behind her glasses and squinted into the day.

I started out into the town, ignoring the colorful parade of spirits going about their daily lives.

Previously inconceivable, the essence of souls was now visible to the human eye through clip on lenses my labs had developed. I was lucky enough to get a trial pair working right.

One could perceive a faint mist, those last few mysterious percentage points of the human body's makeup. They appeared as a hovering mass spanning from the brain to the core.

The soul swirled around in some, stood still in others. There were different hues, varying degrees of opaqueness. Some shimmered, others spiked up, and still others were perfectly symmetrical ... so many variables to study...

""Oh. That guy works across the street. I see him all the time. Is there something strange with his soul?"" asked Emily, having pinpointed my unwitting subject.

I cleaned my glasses, and the clip on lenses, and looked again at the man sitting on the bench outside. 

He was middle aged. Fairly handsome even from this distance, with dark hair. He stared off into the street,   face passive, hands clenched, as if hypnotized by the traffic. 

There was no essence to be found around his face, chest, or core. No mist, no particles, no color. None I could see. No facial expression, no movement. I frowned.

""Is he... soulless?"" asked Emily quietly. I felt the back of my neck chill. My pulse quicken. Alarm ran through me.

""Yea..."" I gulped. 

I nodded to Emily, who returned the gesture, and went to get my coat, my purse.

I ignored the other researchers as they inquired about my destination.

I signed out for lunch, and flashed my ID as I left. 

With eyes still on the man, I made a beeline for the crosswalk. The crowd of people and their bright spirits crushed around me as the light changed. Carried by the sea of mist, I broke away from them and cautiously approached the man.

He stared into the street, eyes glazed over, face stone like. People rushed around us trying to get to their destinations. I cleared my throat.

""Hi.""

He blinked, registering a human voice. His mouth twitched. 

""Can I sit here?"" I asked quietly.

""Sure,"" he murmured.

I sat beside him. He stared out into the city.

""I'm Larisa. I saw you from my office today. You okay?"" I asked. His shoulders tensed. The barest bit of mist prickled across his neck. Gray and transparent. He looked down. 

""No... I don't think so."" The mist disappear again.

""Do you want someone to talk to?"" I asked. 

""I... I don't know.""

""Okay. Well...I'm out for lunch. Do you want something? My treat."" I smiled, lowering my head so he could see me through downcast eyes.

He hesitated. But I guess something in my smile sat right with him.

His lip quivered. He nodded. I smiled as he reached below the bench, retrieving a box of belongings stamped with StemCorps. He hefted the crate and stood with it, shame rolling off him in waves. I offered to carry the crate for him, but he declined.

I didn't say anything more as we walked to the café down the street. Nor when salty tears fell from his eyes into his burrito bowl. 

Eventually he opened up to me. His name was Jacob. He spoke in harried tones, about his coworkers having taken advantage of his hard work. He'd worked on a big project, weekends and nights. His wife had been fed up, taking his children into the night. She'd fled town before he returned home several months ago. He was divorced soon after. 

Worse still, his superiors had taken credit for his efforts, and upon complaining about this injustice, he was passed over for a promotion. 

The stresses of having to pay the bills with only one income hampered his ability to work efficiently, making his mental state worse. He'd had to move into a smaller place.

I listened to Jacob in shared anger as he described feverishly how he'd been humiliated in front of the office today: fired and told to leave the premises. It was more than he could take, he said. And do he'd sat outside, lost.

Although my lunch time was nearly over, I was honest with him.

""Dude. Your life is pretty suck right now.""

He laughed. ""Yea?"" he said, stabbing at avocados.

""Yea. I'm not going to lie. You've got it pretty bad. But... there's good stuff too, you know?""

He shook his head. His eyes lingered on his box. 

""For example. This burrito bowl is fire. You have to admit that. You seasoned it pretty well too."" I indicated my eyes.

Another chuckle. I could see his spirits shyly dancing behind his ears. Still grey but more opaque. I felt more confident in my humorous approach. 

""And you didn't mention poor physical health. That's good.""

""I guess...""

""You're young. Handsome,"" I teased. I nudged him slightly, eliciting a dimpled smile. A bit of green crept into his spirit. Like little emeralds.

""Obviously you are a hard worker. And even though it feels like life is shit right now, there's always a silver lining. ""

""I can't see any silver lining..."" he replied darkly.

""That's because I haven't given you my business card. I work at Harrington Labs, researching souls. You'd be a great candidate. We pay...""

He regarded me curiously. I pulled out the card. Gave it over. His eyes widened upon reading my name. Larisa Harrington. Lead Researcher. 

""How much?"" 

I quoted our compensation. It wasn't eye watering, but it was a respectable amount.

He bit his lip.

""I think you should see a professional. Talk to someone.""

He didn't say anything.

""I can stay here with you. Talk more.""

""No. You've done enough. Thanks for lunch,"" he said.

""You're welcome."" 

Even though I didn't want to leave him like that, I knew I couldn't abandon my job. I said goodbye and watched him walk down the street until he became a small mote in the distance.

Everyday I looked for that green gray soul to walk into our research facilities. It became second nature for me to look for that man. Jacob.

For a month I searched the crowd of faces in my focus groups, but to no avail. He might have come, but never when I was there. 

I had all but given up. I assumed the worst. It wouldn't be the first time I tried to help a soulless person and failed miserably. But I always tried. And I would always try. 

One day I got on the bus to go home, and saw an grayish emerald spirit in a bookstore window. I impulsively pulled the stop cord. I know. All kinds of people must have green souls. But still I went.

I entered, and searched out that gray green mist. Behind the counter, I saw it spilling from behind familiar ears. A tired dimpled smile greeted me. And the mist brightened slightly. 

""Thanks,"" he said.

She wore black like the rest of them, but there was no mistaking that glint of copper hair.

He moved swiftly towards her - Cassie was supposed to be as buried as the man they thought was him. He stepped around those who were quietly sobbing or discussing his brutal death in whispers. They didn't so much as glance at the man brushing past their shoulders. 

It never failed to amaze him how a little plastic surgery could blind even the men and women in the crowds who had shared his work, who were supposed to be as skilled as he was at spying out deceptions.

Perhaps they just wanted to believe he was dead. There were a lot of them.

He waited until after the preacher had finished his long, mumbling speech. After his wife in his previous life - the woman who had never known him at all - gave a speech that reduced her to hoarse sobs and sent her running from the service before its end. After the people who had loved that version of him stepped forward and said their private goodbyes. He was surprised to see some of his colleagues also step out from the shadows to touch his casket. Sloppy of them. 

He waited until they lowered the casket into the ground, and the crowd dispersed. It took a while: more people had come to see him be buried than he'd thought. It was almost touching. But finally only she was left, running a hand over the gravestone they'd chosen for him. 

He pressed a hand over her mouth when there were no other eyes to watch them, and brushed his lips against her ear.

""I've missed you,"" he said.

She shuddered at his voice, and gripped his arm, tracing her way up to try and touch his face. He dragged her into the small mausoleum nearby, and finally turned her to face him, removing his hand.

""Jack,"" she said. Her deep blue eyes traced his face greedily, seeing past the modified nose, the contacts, the beard he'd grown. Seeing *him*. 

""I knew it,"" she said, her voice cracking as she wrapped her arms around him and began to sob. The spice of her enveloped him: apples and honey. He breathed deeply, etching it into memory. She had always smelled good. He was going to miss that.

He gripped her shoulders and pushed her away slightly, looking down at her and allowing *that* smile to return. The one she associated with Jack Morgan.

""What happened?"" he asked. ""You were supposed to meet me on the pier...""

She hadn't been there. He'd thought she'd finally wised up, until he saw her here. 

""I got an assignment. Urgent,"" she said. ""I tried to contact you, but by that time you'd disappeared. What happened? You ask *me* that? Why did you do this, Jack? You loved the work.""

There were a hundred ways to answer that. 

""I still do,"" he said, opting for the truth. Perhaps she deserved a bit of it right now. ""Maybe I made the wrong decision.""

He drew his handgun at the same moment she did. The silence of the mausoleum pressed around him as she grinned widely.

A part of him had always known - she had put on a good show, he had to give her that. As good as his own. Perhaps better. He'd been convinced she loved him. He answered her grin as he saw her in a new light. Her eyes sparkled, alive with the game - she really was beautiful. He'd known that all along, of course, but today he really appreciated it.

""Well, this changes things,"" she said. ""I had to come back, to try and find out. I always thought it was too easy, you falling in love like a amateur. It was killing me, not knowing.""

""Same here,"" he said with a grin. ""I came to the funeral, hoping you'd be here. I had to know. Funny, isn't it, that we decided on the same strategy?""

Usually, you stalked a mark for months before the kill. Unseen and silent. But usually, your mark didn't share the work. Normally, your mark wasn't so hard to kill. He'd thought it would be easy to rely on that shared connection, to exploit it to reach her. That had been the plan, at first.

She must have thought the same.

""We've always had a lot in common,"" she agreed. Her gun was still pointed at his forehead.

It felt good to have caught up with her. Yes, maybe he'd been wrong. He did miss this. She'd always been the one that got away.

""Well, we both know now,"" he said, watching her. ""Going to lower that gun?""

""We'll do it together,"" she said, still smiling. ""How about that?""

He matched her smile. She'd always loved the game. He wanted to keep it going for as long as possible.

""Or perhaps you could fake your death as well, and we can be together again?"" he suggested. ""We were a couple, after all, everyone knew that. You could have been suicidal with grief...no-one would suspect. We could make it convincing. It's fun being dead, you know. There's no more obligations. What do you say - one last shot at it?""

They stared at each other, and both burst into laughter. 

-------
 
The cemetery gardener almost clipped off his own fingers as a single gunshot sounded from the mausoleum. A moment back he'd thought his ears were playing tricks on him when he heard laughter. 

He eyed the old building as he dropped the clippers and stumbled away to call the police. No way was he going in there to see what was going on. It was past time he found a new job. This place was haunted, he just knew it.

[WP] You are a hitman who faked their own death to live out the rest of your days in peace. You are attending your own funeral service when you notice one of your previous 'marks' is there alive and well.,lilwolf2005," My father was an agent of some sort, he never really talked about his work with us. Even though he wasn't around often, he made sure his time with us was well spent. Sometimes, during our vacations, he would take a call and tell us he had to leave immediately. I was always curious what his job was, what was more important than family. All I knew is that his job must have made him a lot of enemies during his time, because one of them came back to bite him in the ass. As the youngest member of the family, I was spared, but only left to watch my whole family die. I remembered the name ""Kurt Jones"" etched into the handle of the blade that executed my father. I was left scarred, but with a burning desire for revenge. I spent most of days training, buying weaponry, and of course, killing. I worked as a hitman, hoping I would soon run into the killer of my family. Being an assassin and focusing on finding the killer of my family took a toll on my life, as it felt wasted when I finally got the name I wanted to hear. Kurt Jones had made an enemy of someone who hated him enough to order a hit on him. Unfortunately, I was hired as the last resort, as the last hitman was killed by Kurt, but left him severely injured. This job was too easy, it didn't feel satisfying enough. But I finished the job anyways, killing Kurt in his sleep. The name echoes in my head, disappointed that it had to end this way. Though, I got what I wanted, and could finally retire the life of assassinations.

But I couldn't just leave the hitman business like that, I had to make sure no one would ever try to find me or take revenge. That's when I had the brilliant idea to fake my own death, and start anew. It was a well thought out fake death: kill a homeless man, burn the body so there is no way of identifying the man, and leaving my wallet next to the roasted body, only charred just a bit so my ID is still able to be read. 

Of course, no one would truly miss me as I had no immediate family members left, only distant relatives. Several weeks later, I found out that there would be a proper funeral for me at Rose Hills, the same cemetery that my family was buried in. It was quite odd attending my own funeral, and recognizing some of my relatives. I made sure to be in full disguise and linger in the back to ensure that some of my aunts and uncles do not recognize me. During the speeches of one of my cousins, I peer to left and see a familiar face. The flashbacks of my family's death play in my head, and that's how I realized that the job was never finished. In fact, I never did see the face of the sleeping man that I killed, I just assumed it was Kurt. 

Kurt stood a bit distant from my relatives, with a dirty smirk on his face. I stared right at him, shocked that he is still alive. That's when we lock eyes, and taunts me a bit right before he starts to walk away. I make my way around my relatives to keep a close distance with Kurt. 

""I must finish the job."" I said to myself. 

I quickly made my way towards Kurt as he walks down the hill. 

He stops and says, ""Johnny, my boy. I was surprised when I heard about your death, but you are smarter than that.""

And that was the first time I heard his voice. I wasn't sure how he knew my name, but I'm sure he kept tabs on me if he spared my life. 

""You do know where you are right Johnny?"" Kurt said as he looked back at me. I look down to see the headstone with my fathers name on it. ""Your father wasn't what you thought he was. He wasn't a hero, he wasn't a good guy. Quite the opposite actually, and that's why I had to take him out,"" he continued. Right when he saw that I was distracted with my own thoughts, he pulled out his USP 45 and fired at me. I quickly tumbled behind a tree and took cover. Maybe training all my life wasn't such a waste eh? I unholster my 9mm and return two shots. I peer around the tree and see him making his way to the parking lot. I sprint after him, not letting him get away this time.

Being the younger man with more endurance, I quickly catch up to him. 

""Stop!"" I yelled, aiming at his head.

""Alright Johnny, you got me, go ahead. Just know that I knew your father the best. You can kill me and never find out what your father was,"" he said with his hands out of my sight.

Damn it, this man really did know how to pull my strings. I take my finger off the trigger. ""Okay, you can tell me what I want to know."" 

Kurt smiled and said, ""You know Johnny, you and your father have one thing in common. You both let curiosity get the best of you."" That's when I hear a voice behind say ""Drop it."" 

I lower my pistol, and looked behind me. It wasn't anyone I knew, but he was around the same age as me.

""You see Johnny, when you're in this business, it's always good to have people you can trust, something your father never did. The clients never payed us well when your father and I worked as... special security, if you will. So when we got a gig to work at a gun trade, I suggested to kill the two parties of the trade, and take the money and the guns for ourselves. He didn't see it the same way I did, and refused to work with me. He told me I could do it myself, and he wouldn't say a thing. But you know what that fucker did? He snitched and pissed off the two parties of the trade. They sent out a team to murder my family a day before the trade, leaving me to witness it all. It was only fair that I returned the favor to your father,"" Kurt said with a grim look on his face. 

""25 years later, and I still need to return the favor."" he said as he nodded to his accomplice. 

I quickly duck and sweep the man's legs. At the same time, I grab my 9mm and shoot Kurt right in his left shoulder. I knock out his friend and walk towards Kurt. ""You know Kurt, according to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly. It's wings are too small to get it's fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyways becau-"" BOOM

Right before I could finish my line, Kurt grabs his own gun and kills himself.

You are attending your own funeral service when you notice one of your previous 'marks' is there alive and well.,lilwolf2005,"He slid through the crowd. The turnout was actually surprising given he lived most his life in disguise and under fake ids. Yet he could easily make out his landlord lady, a number of neighbors and so called friends he had in his previous life.  

Everything was going according to his plans and casket was being lowered to its final rest bearing a body that is his, or at least that is what everybody thought. He had to get out of this life. He had to change the course of destiny, he found pleasure in it, or more specifically in the challenge in his youth years. But now age has brought other feelings, maturity even. He saw life differently and wanted a way out. This was it, his hitman's life funeral.  

The service is now almost done. The crowd is scattering, as the clouds in the sky threatened some heavy rain. Good thing he thought of bringing the umbrella. Time to make his first steps as Jonathan Stan, his alternate id he has prepared quite recently with some care and even love. It is time to brave the world with good intentions of becoming a different human being.  


As he walked away, a sudden urge took over him to get a glance at the final resting place of his previous self. A sort of farewell enticed by a feeling of sweet melancholy. As he turned around he noticed one man still standing under the now trickling rain over his supposed grave. A black trenchcoat and a hat, the man was well built and standing there despite the rain with no umbrella. Jonathan couldn't tell what made him step closer to see the stranger, was it curiosity or his former tendencies to gather intel on every possible situation he might encounter before deciding what steps to take next. Either way, he slid his slender body behind the oak tree and peered at the stranger again. He was muttering a few words now, put a flower bouquet on the freshly laid soil and started walking away. To Jonathan unfortune, he could only see his back and part of the stranger's face. And then, Jon felt his spin and ribs fall under a shock of what seemed for a second as a thunderbolt succeeded by a crippling cold sensation going through all his limbs. What Jon had seen there defied there all logic and reason, the man bore the exact same curved scar over his right eye brow as Mr.Kovacevic. A former hit of his. 

The heartbeats raced as Jon's brain worked double tempo to find an explanation that would not involve vindictive ghosts. He found none. 
Times and again, he told himself that the man under the heavy coat is somebody else, perhaps a twin brother of some sort that had the same facial disfiguration. But that was not how Jon operates. He required valid reasonable arguments for each and every move he takes. Even for taking a breath. Mr.Kovacevic ghost had already reached his parked car not far away from the cemetary gates, and was preparing to leave. As he turned around to open the door, Jon got to see the full features of his previous target. There was no shade of doubt left. The man is as alive as Jon is on his very funeral. 

Couple of thoughts ran in his mind then as the man drove away. The contract that demanded Mr.Kovacevic elimination originated from Europe, it was not out of the ordinary that people from the old continent ask for hits from US contractors, it sort of makes it harder to retrace back to the root the attempt in case of failure. Mr.Kovacevic was bosnian military and apparently was engaged in some really disturbing and shady stuff that had many groups ask for his elimination. The day of the hit, he was disguised as one of his personel, which was not really hard his troops were not the best as organization goes, used stealth at night to get into his tent on the camp, and shot the man using a silencer in his sleep. And shot him quite a few times in deadly areas just to make sure. He later took a few polaroids as proof and vanished. It was a relatively easy job for 500k$. There was no alternative in Jon's mind. He needs to tail this man. He needs to know more about this. 

A few blocks away, the black sedan of the former bosnian army leader stopped in front of a decaying old building, the man stepped out and went in. Jon remained in his car, at a safe distance, only doing recognition for the time being and trying to absorb information. 
Everything is as good as dead in this area of town, but then a few minutes later, there was already another black sedan stopping in the opposite side of the building, with two, heavy built men stepping out of it looking around as if securing the perimeter. And then, another figure in leather jacket and black jeans and shoes stepped out of it, with greased hair and dark shades. ""Who the hell wears shades in a rainy day?"" Jon thought to himself. But then that very same feeling that had gone through Jon in the cemetery revisited him as he slowly recognized the man behind the shades. It was the contact that has secured the payment of Mr.Kovacevic contract. His name was yet another easter european gibberish he can no longer recall, it didn't matter at the time with half a million in his bank account. The man took confident strides towards the same building and walked in. Jon could no longer bear this heavy waiting. He needed to find out more. 

Jon felt lucky to find a fire escape stair-case in the alley behind the building, he started going up and spying inside really dusty windows trying to find a glimpse of the two men. Today was supposed to be the ultimate relief day for Jon, he thought of driving to the ocean and breathing the fresh free air, but here he was again with heavy breath instead under the rain climbing some fire escape in the dirtiest part of town. 

3 stories later, he started hearing chatter inside a room. He curled into a small ball and started to the said window. The two men were definitely talking inside, in what seemed more like a boss and an employee exchange. Jon risked a glimpse, Mr.Kovacevic, was clearly playing the boss part, giving his goon instructions. And then, Jon's previous life name popped up, Stanislas. No one was supposed to know that name, except people who employed him. And thinking about it, this goon was in contact with Jon or Stan as an employer. Things were getting clearer now, as Jon realized the hit was staged by Kovacevic using this goon as a middleman to stage his own death. Irony of the sorts, just like Jon did today. But why are these people here today of all days, and why Kovacevic bothered even to show up to Stan's funeral, and how the hell did he learn about it? Was he under surveillance ? That idea shaked Jon to the core. Not that he didn't expect to be followed or under surveillance, but because he didn't sense any hint of surveillance in the past few weeks. ""I guess I did the sane thing to get out, I am getting really sloppy and rusty"", he thought to himself, smiling despite the circumstances.

Supposed to die in August still alive and well in October, attending my funeral. Life never gives you a break. You want to retire, life has other plans. Do I attack or let it slide? This man, how did he survive. A silent bullet to the head should've done it. Did he have a twin? Did I got the wrong man? How? Why? Why'd he survive? The most mundane of targets. Why? Why'd he go to my funeral, he doesn't know me, unless, unless he knows I'm the one who attempted to shoot him.
                   
He catches a glance at me. Not long but I can tell he knows. He moves up to my wife and takes her away. How dare he. Escort her home, take away my wife, steal my life. Is this what he'll become? My replacement?

The characters just wanted to be together I guess.

---

I yawned, getting a couple of stink eye sent towards my direction as the priest continued with his dreary speech. I don't really know who the hell attended these things, honestly. 

Well, considering I'm attending my own, I guess I have a thing for it too. Can't remember the names of any of these people I've apparently interacted with though, well except those I've worked with. None of my colleagues are here undisguised that's for sure. I think that's Li with Jack crying and wearing a lot of heavy make up and a blonde wig. 

...I'm going to miss them, but my job was getting taxing and I was certain I'd die trying to get out of it or die doing it sooner or later anyways. 

So, why not fake my own death sooner and get out alive?

I've always found creative escapes when a mission's gotten grittier than expected.

Ah.

I caught someone else's stare. Green eyes. You don't see that often. I think to myself and smile a sleazy smile at him. He stiffens and turns his tanned face away.

I blinked.

He was my last target wasn't he? I was sure I killed him... a doppelganger is a plausible explanation... 

What's suspicious and most curious of all, however, is the way he stiffened when I smiled at him and how he's been eyeing me for longer than I'd realized... 

Oh.

He knows.

That's, troubling. 

Seems like I need to get rid of him thoroughly this time. 

I slipped my way through the crowds, many relatives and acquaintances and old friends I haven't seen in a decade show up. Funny how they don't show up when you're alive. Not that I made any attempts in keeping in touch. 

I leaned up and silently grabbed his wrist, tugging him to my direction.

Surprisingly, he followed me without much of a hassle and we slipped away unnoticed.

After finally getting quite far away from the people and in an empty field. I let go of his wrist and beamed at him.

""So how'd you know him?"" I decided to ask innocuously. 

""Same way you'd know him, I suppose."" He tersely replied, eyes never leaving my hands. 

I chuckled. ""Oh, I'd doubt that, anyways, you know what you agreed to by following me right?""

""A promised execution?"" He asks, eyes finally leaving my hands and staring into my own.

I paused. The way he said that was odd and things clicked together. ""...You're the Skeleton? Seriously? You ordered your own hit?""

He stiffly shrugged. ""I couldn't find a way out. Someone found out there was a hit and despite of my best attempts, they switched me out and disguised me."" 

""Billionaire wants to be dead. Funny."" I mused. ""Why?""

""Same reason as you faked your own death, I'm guessing."" 

""Ah."" 

Silence reigned and my fingers are restless, the handle being toyed as he eyed the weapon.

""How did you know?"" I asked instead of doing what he wants. 

He looks away.

""...I saw your face when you killed my doppelganger."" He started. I opened my mouth to refute the possibility, but he continued faster than I could retort. ""I was disguised as one of the guards, clever of them wasn't it? They knew your hitman alias and that you don't kill anyone but your target. So I was there. In that casino. In that bathroom. You knocked me out. I woke up just in time to see you kill my doppelganger.""

Well, this is awkward. 

""You had the same expression as you did attending your own funeral. It was as misplaced as it was when you killed him, you looked like you were... at peace.""

I snorted and rested my grip on the handle comfortably. ""Rest in peace.""

""Please.""

He looks pretty desperate... 

Ah, what the hell. 

""Want me to fake your death? I can do it now, but it'll cost you."" I offered. 

He looks surprised now. ""And expect me to somehow not be recognized by the public?"" 

I laughed. ""I don't think anyone but you recognized me other than through sheer coincidence that I apparently held the same expression as I killed.""

The edges of his lips' rims went slightly up. ""I suppose.""

""So, do we have a deal?"" I grinned at him. Seems like I'll have company in my fresh start as a new man.

 He gives a small smile back and asked. ""Do you already have a bank account I can send the fee to?"" 

""More like multiple bank accounts, but yes. Not going to ask how much it'll cost?"" I nodded and looked around us, noting the flammable plants.

""Considering that I'll be dead soon. No, not really."" He chortled.

I rolled my eyes, billionaires. ""Well, it'll cost you... $100."" 

""Are you sure?"" He looked at me oddly.

I looked down at my phone, we have thirty minutes to do this. Plenty of time. I looked back up and shrugged, smirking. ""Well, the Skeleton did already pay a hefty sum of $550 million for your hit so..."" 

""Heh. Alright then."" He took out a hundred dollar bill and handed it to me.

I took it and rolled it into a thin cylinder before taking my lighter out and smiled at him. ""How does dying in an explosion sound?"" 

""Good."" was the firm reply.

""Oh, so have any name you want to be after 'Kyle Jules' dies?"" I asked him.

Hesitantly, he answered. ""...James Hew.""

""Okay, well, I'm Henry Sean. Now, stand back, James. I always carry some explosives with me, just in case."" I chuckled.

I exited my own funeral with a bang and a billionaire to disguise.

 ----

Epilogue:

Worldwide, plasters of James' old self was plastered in newspapers and social media everywhere. 

It's been over two years since then and well, life is pretty good.

All in all, we're both changed men compared to how we were two years ago.

I certainly have grown accustomed to not having a gun or knife with me at all times. I've thrown that life away after all. I'm also less paranoid.

James on the other hand is no longer a 20-something billionaire who's suicidal but has recently turned 30 and is in love with life and a great flatmate. 

He cleans, I cook, we handle the finance together and plan trips.

Kind of feels like we're married.

Gah.

I need to meet someone new and get laid. 

""Henry."" A muffled voice and the warmth of another body draped over my own entered my conscious awareness. ""I feel your morning wood, move to the side."" 

We also sleep in the same bed once we found out we both had less nightmares together. 

I yelped and ran to the bathroom to take a cold shower.

Listening to a song I heard in my first concert, I reminisced about the days of being a hitman and how shooting dancing people was a nightmare to get right.

""Henry."" The door squeaked. ""I'm coming in."" 

""There's another bathroom in the living room, don't be...lazy."" I lamely finished when I saw James with a condom in his mouth. 

He smiled at me and I smiled back. 

""Warm water?"" I ask.

""Warm water."" He affirms.

The morning turned out to be our best one in years, and this is comparing to that time we nearly drowned in one of the hotsprings in Iceland!

I had planned this funeral to be another cog in the machine; with everyone convinced I'm dead I'd finally get to retire. Everything was according to plan until-

The clock stopped.

""Um.""

I was at a loss for words when he held his arm out to shake my hand. The last time I saw Mark Richter, he was doused in blood. Yet here he was, with clothing neatly ironed and hair slicked back and most definitely not doused in blood.

My hand floated into his grasp and flopped around as he made small-talk with his murderer at my funeral.

""Thank you so much for helping me out with that one time and congratulations on getting yourself out! Look, I brought James, you remember James right? You ran his car into the ravine? Come say hi!""

James was looking more like a healthy, living person than a corpse and I began to feel nauseous.

""Very nice funeral here, congratulations man.""

""I killed you both. Why-""

""What? The company hasn't done something like that in AGES. We're all here see? ...Oh.""

""I don't get-""

""See Mark I told you he skipped briefing. Buddy. We're all career 'hitmen' too. You killed us and helped us fake our deaths to get out of the life. That's all company agents ever do, fake deaths! Everyone here is a hitman too and we thought hey, you play-killed so many of us we'd do you a favour and buy you a round or two, catch-up and congratulations on the retirement y'know?""

I take antidepressants from the trauma of killing people. When I faked my death it was because I was sick of being a killer. 

My 'killer' waved, apparently he just got a promotion.

""I think I'll take that drink.""

In short: the hit business is hard to get into and harder to get out of.  It's the clients.  They know what you've done.  They know why.  Together, they know all the details.  We actually have a saying - and I imagine this won't surprise you - ""the hit is clean; the client is dirty.""

So you know, I needed to be gone.  Dead.  Hit myself.  

I had been watching DefCon talks on YouTube when I saw one called [""I Will Kill You""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FdHq3WfJgs).  It was a review of faking death - all the odds and ends of what a stiff does to the record-keeping world.  Obviously this was in my wheelhouse.

And when it clicked in my mind, it was great - no mark, no client.  A hit with only one person involved.  And honestly, it went basically perfectly.  I was so proud that I actually wanted to tell people - yell from the mountaintops, ""heck yeah.""  Being dead, that was not really an available move for me.  But seriously - having the death certificate, the closed bank accounts, the $7.61 prorated refund from my PO box - it was really a thing not only of beauty but a perverse sort of perfection.  A wet work of wonder.

And then the funeral.

I initially wasn't going to go.  I thought there was something romantic about my laying in bed in my underwear, watching South Park reruns while some other schmucks gathered to remember me or whatever.

But then I thought I might regret that.  Very, very few people get the chance to hear their own eulogy - to wear black and hear about ashes to ashes and dust to dust.  And of course a disguise was no problem - my own sister, who I presumed was going to be there - wasn't going to recognize me.

So whatever.  I went.  I grabbed a cup of coffee - at Starbucks of all places.  I tried giving ""Trump"" as my name - you know, the big troll joke that's making the rounds these days - but the barista, a guy named Greg with what looked like might someday grow into a handlebar mustache - didn't even call it out.  The coffee was as gross as I remembered.  But I sucked it down and I went.  At first, I thought the lesson was to just find a new coffeehouse at which to be a regular.  But then, I saw Bill fucking Closs standing there.  

Understand: Bill was somebody that... I guess the simplest and most honest way to put it is that I had enormous respect for this dude.  This hit had been one of the very few that I looked back on with a bit of a shudder.  The client - a cokehead former partner of his named Syndney Lester - was a serious douchebag.  For the life of me I don't know why I did the job.  The pay was less than I was used to and I didn't even need the money.  

But I signed on the dotted line.  And I did the job.  Well, I guess I didn't do the job.  The man was alive before me at a gathering meant to be about my own death - not irony exactly, but some other brand of divine sarcasm perhaps.

Anyway, let's not get wrapped up in that - that's not the story.

So I'm standing there - on the periphery - and some priest who I don't think I'd seen since I was an infant and he sprinkled some Poland Spring on my soft spot is droning on and on about being called back home.  And I wished I was at home - underwear, South Park, and all.

And now that Bill's alive, I'm feeling pretty great about life.  I'm dead and William Herbert Closs lives.  This was as good a day as I was going to have after that cup of sludge.

I started to walk away, not wanting anybody to see my grin.

And then, with an alarming speed, I started to feel an absolutely bizarre moral twinge in the back of my neck.  I had never been terribly concerned about what is or isn't fair in life.  But when I realized that I was going to know that Bill was alive without him knowing the same about me - that seemed like a middle finger straight at the creator, and that's not something you do at your own funeral.

So... Uhh... I... well, I approached him.

He was standing opposite me, so I walked all the way around the circle - maybe 30 people - and I walked up to him.  I tapped him on the shoulder and he turned around.  And he saw right through me - which is to say, he immediately saw who I was and not who I was dressed up to be.

His lack of surprise surprised me.  Stunned me.  Blew me the fuck away.

He nodded, then turned back to the priest, who was - thank god - almost done.  And he didn't give me another look.  I didn't know what to do or say, so I just started walking to my car.  I slowly stumbled back toward the little parking lot at this cemetary - where an honest-to-goodness Orangutan, dressed in a suit that never fit me - was buried under a stone with my name on it.  That's another story.

And as I pull out the fob to unlock my car - just like a shitty RomCom with no real device to drive the plot - now I've got a tap on my shoulder.  And I knew.  And before I turned around, I said, ""Bill.""  ",jMyles

His body was never recovered. The priest said his final set of prayers before the empty coffin was lowered into the ground. 

Daniel was surprised that his funeral attracted so many people, most of them were clients who had taken his services in the past. Now they were here to pay their respects. 
As he stood there looking at the familiar faces, one face caught his eye. 

Suddenly, his heart skipped a beat, he started to get tensed and began to sweat slightly. ""It cannot be"" he thought to himself. 

His mind started going back to events from about a year ago. An unknown client had contacted him and offered him a contract. A single target, a Mr James Ludlow. The only details he needed were the name and location. The pay offered was more than what his work would usually get him. So he agreed to take up the job. It was quite easy. He just had to sneak into the target's house and kill him without anyone finding out, and the client's additional bit of information that the target lives alone only made killing him all the more easier.
On that fateful day, he sneaked over the fence surrounding the target's house and also disabled the alarm system, climbed up a series of pipes to the house's terrace and managed to lockpick the door at the terrace entrance to grant him access to the house. It was a three story house. ""A bit posh for Mr James Ludlow"" he thought. He found James asleep on his bed in his room on the second floor of the house. As always, he was clean with his work. A bullet to the head from his silenced pistol was all it took. An almost inaudible bang and a small flash of light wouldn't alert the neighbors. He took a snap on his phone as proof for his client. He left the house the same way he entered it. Soon after the client received proof of the deed, an extremely huge sum of money was credited to his offshore account. And that was the end of it.

As all those thoughts came rushing back to him, he realised that almost everyone had left the burial ground and his last target Mr James Ludlow was leaving. He had to know more and hence decided to tail him from a distance. He used every trick he knew to ensure that James wouldn't know that he was being followed. After an hour he reached another house, quite similar to the one where he had completed the contract to kill James Ludlow. He decided that he would find out more that night. A little after midnight he managed to get access to the house through the terrace without creating any noise or disturb it's occupant. The house was dark and yet he managed to to navigate with ease, looking for James, to find out the truth.  As he moved through the second floor he looked at  a series of photos hanging on the wall, and what he saw shocked him to his core. 

Suddenly the lights came on and as he spun around a  familiar voice said "" Welcome Mr Daniel, my name is Jacob... Jacob Ludlow."" 
Daniel was in shock. He couldn't believe what he was looking at. 

""I know what you're thinking,  and you're right... We are twins.. Jason and I"", said Jacob. 
He could see the shock on Daniel's face as he tried to take in the truth. 

"" Jason was handed the billion dollar family business and for years, I watched him as he almost spiralled it down to the brink of destruction and I couldn't take it anymore.... That's when I brought you into the equation Daniel. It was the perfect plan. You take him out and I  take over the business."" ""And of course, you would be paid handsomely and you were.. Weren't you Mr Daniel?""

""Now you know everything about whatever has happened Daniel Williams...Your secret is safe with me Daniel... I hope that you keep mine safe too. What do you say huh? ""

""That's a good proposition Jacob.... But I don't take any risks and I most definitely donot like lose ends"" said Daniel as he whipped out his pistol in the blink of an eye and shot Jacob Ludlow straight in the head with utmost precision.

Daniel Williams walked away into the darkness, disappearing forever, never to be seen again.

[WP] You are a hitman who faked their own death to live out the rest of your days in peace. You are attending your own funeral service when you notice one of your previous 'marks' is there alive and well.,lilwolf2005,"Jane looked in the mirror at her altered appearance one last time before stepping out of her apartment and hailing a cab on the busy New York street.

""Taxi!"" She hollered as she waived her arm in the air.  ""Taxi!""

The yellow cab pulled to a squeaky stop as the driver asked ""where to.""  

""Holy Cathedral, 32nd Avenue.""  

""The Cathedral on a Friday?  Wedding or funeral?""  The cabbie asked in the typical cabbie accent.  Jane made no reply as she watched out the window, her years of training forcing her eyes forward and back.  She had to reassure herself of her safety--no one knew she was alive.  She was, after all, on the way to her own funeral.

The cab lurched and braked through the traffic toward the church.  The driver asked several more probing questions, prompting Jane to give dismissive answers.  She thought about opening up to the driver as a test of her new-found anonymity from her career, but her better judgment decided against it.  With the Cathedral just a block away, Jane asked the driver to stop short.

""I'll walk the rest of the way, thanks.""  She leaned forward to hand the man a folded set of bills, but he declined.

""Why don't I hang close, in case you decide to leave early?""  The man asked.  Jane cocked her head at the comment, disturbed the driver had read her thoughts with such accuracy.

""I suppose,"" she started.  The cab driver nodded and leaned on his steering wheel, letter her know he'd stick around for half an hour before he would depart.

""I'll let you know if I decide I can stick around,"" Jane responded.  She thanked the man for his service and began the short walk to the Cathedral.  A few familiar faces stood out among those entering the Cathedral, none of whom gave Jane a second glance.  She hung back, worried someone would read her mannerisms and place her connection to the departed, all the while scanning the crowd for threats and assessing her exits for a quick departure.

CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF JANE ANDERS

The sign smacked of adoration and eloquence, two things foreign to Jane's persona.  Jane lived a simple life to those who knew her--a two-bedroom apartment on Staten Island, a Toyota in the garage a block from her apartment for long trips, and a simple wardrobe of jeans, pastel shirts, and the occasional Sunday dress.  Her hair and makeup screamed ""neutral,"" while her mannerisms expressed no more than a simple, basic woman in her mid-30s working in Human Resources for some insurance company.  However, Jane's expressed this basic appearance by design.

The howls of the organ ceased as the last few mourners filed in.  With only a quarter of the seats taken, Jane took a seat far back enough to ease her nervousness about being noticed.  Her minister started into his sermon about life, death, and the rejoining of body and soul at the glorious resurrection.  Jane stifled a smile as the minister mentioned Jane being ""here with us, even now.""  

Twenty minutes.  Jane thought about relieving the cab driver of his duty and thought of tipping him well for the offer when one last parishioner moved into the room, taking a seat toward the back opposite Jane.  Jane eyed him in her peripheral and felt her heart leap.  He should have been dead, too.

The minister invited the lackluster crowd to provide their final goodbyes to the body of not-Jane, prompting the dead man to her left to rise and move forward.  Jane kept her seat and held her head in her hands, feigning sadness for her own death, but watched the man move through the procession line.  Three ahead of him.  Two.  One.

The man ran his fingers over Jane's coffin and stifled a smile of his own.  Jane strained her eyes to watch his face from afar, and began to rise from her seat to get a better view of the man pretending to pay respects to her fake body.  She watched as he looked to his left and right, then watched his lips part as he whispered to what he thought was Jane.

""I win,"" his lips read.

Jane grabbed her purse from her seat and exited before he could spot her.  ""I win""?  He won nothing.  The assassination--how had he survived?  Shot and drowned in the ocean.  Surrounded by sharks.  No boats for miles.  A rough sea, the swells nearly sank her own ship.  How had he survived?

Jane spied the cab up the street, still pushing exhaust fumes from a rusty tailpipe.  She approached from behind and climbed into the back, hiding her exasperation.  She started to ask the driver to drive--anywhere--when he interrupted her.

""Something bothering you, Jane?"" The driver asked.

""No, I,"" she paused.  She hadn't told him her name.  She reached for the handle but the driver pulled away too fast.

""He's still alive, Jane.  You owe me, Jane.  You owe me.""  The driver's accent disappeared as Jane recognized his voice.  

""Captain?"" She asked.

""Calamity Jane,"" he responded.  Something in Jane was happy to see the Captain, different as he looked, but something else rose inside her--dread.

""Captain, I didn't know he--how did he survive?""

""You'll have to ask him yourself, hun.""  The Captain took a bag from under the front passenger seat and tossed it toward Jane, over the partition.  ""I mean, if you really want to know.  If you just want to kill him--that works for me, too.""

Jane opened the bag to see inside.  Cash, guns, ammo, IDs, and a communicator.  Instinct took over as she slipped the communicator into her ear, then went for the gun.  Her hand paused as she touched the cold steel of the pistol, promoting a question.

""What if I can't?"" Jane asked as the cab barreled down the highway.

""'Can't'?""

""I mean, what if I don't want to go back?""

The Captain smiled the smile Jane had known for years.  The smile that accompanied impossible missions and drastic odds of survival.  The smile that entertained him, alone.

""I'm sure I could plan another funeral.""",Logic_85

You are attending your own funeral service when you notice one of your previous 'marks' is there alive and well.,lilwolf2005,"	There were more people at my funeral than I had expected. I had become a celebrity when accounts of my last job made the news. It was admittedly sloppy work, the kind of sloppy work that would lead one to fake their own demise. After over a dozen jobs, I wanted peace.

	My first job was the easiest. A man hired me to do him after finding out he was molesting his daughter. Rage shielded me from the shock of gore as I blasted his skull open. There was little regret.

	The next two jobs were forgettable. A drug-lord hired me to kill two of his competitors. I took them from far away with a rifle.

	The fourth job... that was the one that took my heart. She was a sad teenage girl named Sadie. The customer was anonymous and very specific. One shot, small-caliber handgun to the chest, in a specific meadow, and no pay if any detail was overlooked, fifteen thousand dollars. 

	She didn't beg for her life. She told me how her father would get drunk, beat her and he and his friends would rape her repeatedly. I couldn't bear it the sadness, and put her out before she could finish her story.

	Since then, I've seen her deep green eyes in all my following victims, and that's why I've learned to look away. I was worn out and had made my plan to quit. As I stood in that crowd, I was subtly amused that nobody had recognized me – then I was met with a gaze. Beneath the veil I couldn't recognize her, but with her lingering stare, I knew she recognized me. 

	I made my way to my car as calmly as I could, but before I reached the door, she caught up behind me.

	“Martin...” her soft voice whispered. I stopped in my tracks. That delicate timber was vaguely familiar. “Martin...” A gentle hand rested on my shoulder. “I'm so glad you're alive.”

	I refused to turn around. “Martin is dead.” I replied metallically.

	“I know it's you. Turn around.” I met her slowly. Her green eyes met mine as a cold shiver ran through me.

	“Sadie? How – ” I was silenced by a finger to the lips.

	She tossed her veil to the ground. “My great aunt hired you. I was wearing a vest. I –” A tear rolled down her cheek. “I had no way out. Before the funeral, she arranged a swap for a look-alike, just like you. Had to make sure my father believed I was dead.”

	She suddenly embraced me and squeezed me tight. “Let me come with you... please?” For the first time ever, a mark begging for her life had brought a smile to my face.",aomimezura

Never caring to see Robin again left my expectations low about ever seeing him. It was his friend Arvyn, whose funeral we were separately attending, who had introduced us at a restaurant.  We had socialized with mutual acquaintances, some of whom Arvyn had little knowledge.  He was always a gracious host, which is why he was so loved. And in an almost spiritual cycle, he returned your love to you. And repeat of course. His gatherings became famously large and thusly might have spanned a number of good and not so good circles, sometimes.  Without this pool of partiers, I might have never seen Robin before. 

Or at least until his 4x6 glossy arrived in my mail. 

Now I was seeing him again, when I least expected to, at Arvyn's funeral, and when I never cared to.

Sometimes I go to funerals of folks that I know. I know them from business or leisure. Sometimes the business visits are friendships and sometimes morbid curiosity. On business funerals, I don't talk too much. I prefer rainy days like today. The anonymity of an umbrella is especially welcome. On business, I was a gruesome spectator. Not today though with Arvyn.

Until I saw Robin through the rain's anonymous camouflage. Of course he didn't notice me or anyone around him. That was evident from my encounters with him at Arvyn's parties. That was why some people didn't like him. That may have lead to something else for all I care to guess. That's all on that.

Why Robin was here was a big question. He looked cremated the last time I saw him. Of course anyone can look cremated. His funeral was a walkthrough wham-bam. I never thought it odd until now. And now it all seemed odd.

Not putting aside my always instant response, sometimes suppressed to maintain friendships, I had no problem asking myself ""What the hell did you do?"" Right question. Robin was here. He should be dead. The last time I saw him alive was when he died. Those were not his ashes. 

This country is full of lies. He was here to say goodbye to his friend Arvyn. I doubted that he cared or expected to see me either. I put my hand under my coat and felt the firmness of my silenced shoulder holster. Its heft always made it memorable. Touching it was reassurance. I watched Robin's eyes. He was watching the urn as a eulogy was being given. He had no idea I was there. I knew for the both of us.

I dribbled out with the rain before the ceremony ended. 

I had seen enough of Robin in real life.

I woke to the sound of the car next to me starting. I had paused a moment when I had gotten in the car and the droning rain anesthetized me. I looked around the parking lot. There were many cars there. I shadowed behind steamy windows and waited.

One nap a day was enough. I endured the 15 minutes until Robin appeared in the parking area alertly. His car blended in with landscape at the back and the cover was the deciding factor. I got out of the car and followed the hedge until it terminated at the back of Robin's car. I paused in the fluttering rain.

The car door clicked. The holster quietly slid the gun into my left hand. At this range, left or right was negligibly different, especially with these loads. With the gun hidden, one step rushed me up to the opening door. I was sure he was carrying.

My hand whisked the silencer firmly into the base of his skull. 

""How remarkable to see you Robin.""

Always the mouth, there was no restraining his response.

""Well, Arvyn, it's a surprise to see you too!""",iguanax

The story and writing is great, but the cliffhanger is unnecessary imo. Television does this nowadays to keep people wanting to come back and watch. It feels like a cheap tactic, even more so since this is just a one shot piece. If you wanted to be ambiguous about it you could have written the gardener in as seeing a figure with vague details swiftly leaving the scene, then let the reader decide from there.

*It can't be. Fred mother fucking Alvarez. What a prick... Right when I saw that Hit, I lowballed everyone. Not even sure if I got paid.*

Once the funeral ended I walked up to Fred approaching his car. I went for my sidearm.

""I knew you weren't dead. No way in hell did you randomly die somehow,"" he quickly said.

""That easy?"" I wondered, ""If that wasn't you back in 2012, who was it?""

""Who cares? All you need to know is a cardboard box in the street was really lonely that night because of you,"" he replied. 

I kept my hand over my pistol, I could tell he had one ~~in the waste pocket~~ tucked behind his belt.

""What do we do now?"" I asked.

""I get in my car, put it into drive, and pull off. We forget like any of this ever happened.""

""Sounds kinda dull. This whole retirement thing might've been the wrong call. Besides..."" I cocked back my gun's hammer, ""A deal's a deal.""

""What a prick..."" he said to himself. He cocked the gun tucked in his waistline and threw it back as he went for the car. I drew my gun. 

BOOM

If there’s one thing I’ve learned over the years, it’s that people believe what they want to believe. Every black-clad mourner, paying their respects with somber murmurs directed at my coffin, all believed in a false reality. The reality that they wanted to believe. Perception is reality. Their perception that I was dead became their reality. So here they are.

I was fifty-four when I faked my death. Tragic. They found me cold and limp in a hotel room. The paramedics arrived just too late, they said. He died of a heart attack. 

I was too old to be in the business anymore. I had been considering retirement for years prior to my death, but I just couldn’t get away from it. It’s too hard to let go. Ending lives became my life, and it was just so simple to say to myself, “Just one more job. This one’s the last one. I promise,” even though my promises were always broken. It’s who I am. I’d make those false promises knowing fully well they couldn’t be kept. 

I was there at the funeral. Standing under a tree, enveloped in the shadows, an old friend of mine. I had grown accustomed to her warm coldness, her subtle but powerful protection from prying eyes searching for something, anything out of place. They saw nothing lurking in the shadows, therefore there was nothing lurking in the shadows. They moved on with their day.
	
Figure after figure approached my black coffin and knelt, paying their respects to the reality in which they believed I was dead. I recognized every face. None of them were family or friends, I had neither of them. They were all bitter enemies, past colleagues, crime lords, drug dealers, gang members, and an assortment of the roughest individuals you could find anywhere upon terra-firma. I wouldn’t miss any of them. 
	
After hours of standing silently, watching the bloated worm slowly crawl along, there were only a handful of people left. The faces passed by. I watched, silently. After the last person passed, I would leave. I’d use one of the fake ID’s from my extensive collection and book it, out of america, and find refuge somewhere in Europe. I didn’t know where. Maybe Switzerland. I would decide when I got there. 
	
I studied each face that passed. They were all the same, in my mind. Every face was just a face. When I pulled the trigger and ended the target’s life, they were nothing more than that. A target. They had no life, no family, no feelings, nothing. They were simply something to be eliminated. 
	
The final mourner finally clambered up the stairs and slowly knelt beside my coffin, head down. I could see their lower jaw moving up and down, most of their face obscured by their black body. After a long silence, they stood up, and I could see it was a woman. Not by her face, it still was obscured, but by her gait, her posture, and her behaviour. She looked around the graveyard. There was nothing there but the silence, a dog barking, and a police car’s sirens wailing in the distance. Nothing else was present on the cold Autumn day. She reached into her pocket and withdrew a slip of paper, and placed it on the black obelisk inside which my dead body lay. Putting her hands back in her pockets, she strode off, whistling into the cold afternoon air. 

I must have waited for a good ten minutes to ensure I wasn’t seen. Looking around, I saw nobody. I had about five minutes before the gravediggers would bury me. That was enough time. 

Taking one final scan of the yard to make sure nobody was there, I stepped out of the shadows. Like a cat, I silently crept over to my body. No leaves crunched beneath my boots, a skill that took years to develop. I slid my hand into my jacket pocket, resting my hand on the leather grip of my gun. Just in case. 

I reached my coffin, and surveyed the field around me. I didn’t see anybody. 

Tightening my iron grip on the gun with one hand, I picked up the letter with the other. It was a small lined slip of paper, like a voting ballot, folded down the center. Taking one last look around me to ensure I truly was alone, I opened the page.

In the dead center of the page, five fateful words were scrawled in black pen. 

“The hunter becomes the hunted,” 

Below it, five even more chilling words,

“Sincerely, target number forty-seven”

My perception that nobody was in the courtyard became my reality. The reality in which I died four days after I was officially declared dead.

“I’m still alive” I heard her breathe behind me. I could picture her smile. It’s the smile of a person who was left for dead seven years ago. The smile of a person who is about to get their revenge

She beat me at my own game. 

The hunter becomes the hunted

A split-second before my death, I could hear her pull the trigger. ",WonderfulSpaceGoat

You are attending your own funeral service when you notice one of your previous 'marks' is there alive and well.,lilwolf2005,"It was a chilly December day when Greg the Hitman decided to die. One week later his funeral service was held and a great deal of people were in attendance, including Greg. Widely considered a master of his craft Greg was known for his elaborate costumes and unique methods of killing people. Greg's latest victim was his magnum opus, in fact he was so proud of his latest hit he decided to retire. 

The billionaire oil tycoon who had made his fortune discovering a new method of extracting oil straight from the rainforests of the Congo was killed when visiting a new oil-plant. The news called it a ""freak accident"" and no one quite knows why the horde of silverback gorillas thought the mogul was a female, but the gorillas sure were mad when they found out he wasn't of their species.

Back at the funeral things were going well. A brief cease fire had been called, as is customary, for the funeral of Greg the Hitman. Greg first recognized Sheila the snake who kills with her trademark perilous poison pistol, then the Mad Hatter who gives his victims a large dose of LSD and convinces them to commit suicide, and even Jake was there. It was a beautiful funeral and Greg the hitman was content with his place in the world. 

Just then Greg noticed his latest victim the oil tycoon who had infamously died  being raped and bashed by a large group of gorillas was walking with a furious pace towards the crowd. He looked a bit bruised and he had a severe limp, but he seemed very much alive. Although greatly disturbed Greg was still confident no one could recognize him in his disguise. Despite this Greg could not help but feel a sense of impending doom as he watched the man that he had lured to his death approach. Looking around Greg felt something was not right with the crowd that surrounded him. 

Greg the hitman first looked at Sheila and although she seemed wider than usual he could tell nothing was wrong as she was carrying her trademark pistol and her hair was as full and snake-like as it had ever been. Greg then noticed the Mad Hatter who's physique had gone from tall and gangly to stout and muscular but alas he had on his green bowtie while leaning on his elegant chrome cane clearly identifying him as the infamous Mad Hatter. While Greg was watching his oldest friend Jake's exceptionally large nostrils exhale white steam he realized something, Jake was never Greg's friend they hated each other. Greg remembered the last words Jake ever said to him ""Fuck you Gregory, I know you only like me because of my collection of top hats and striped ties. The only reason I might attend your funeral is if a Gorilla took my clothes and went as an impersonation of me"". Greg realized this was an odd thought, but he had no time to dwell on the past as the oil tycoon was just reaching the group.

Just then the Oil Tycoon yelled ""Get him!"" Greg watched as his closest friends and colleagues transformed themselves into a mob of silverback gorillas. The gorillas proceeded to grab Greg and throw him in his own grave where he was finally killed. Greg died without realizing the great irony of his own death, that his life work and great appreciation of the costume eventually became his downfall as he failed to notice all of the people he was closest with in life were in fact an endangered primate from the Congo.

Not at the cursing, though Sarah still wasn't entirely comfortable with that. But fictional worlds, to Sarah, had been somehow inviolate. As if they were beautiful structures of ink and paper that authors had carefully extracted from their heads, piece by piece, in order to share them with the world. Sarah knew full well she had no such worlds in her. 

""Jesus Christ,"" Abby said. ""It's like you've never heard of fanfiction."" They were in Abby's parents' library, because Abby had all the good books. Abby was lying backwards on a loveseat, her hair almost reaching the floor. Sarah had tried, really, to use her powers for good, but the main problem was that Sarah wasn't any good at learning fictional stuff. She'd tried to get Hermione to teach her magic, but even within the world of fiction, Sarah had been a Muggle. None of the humans in *Charlotte's Web* were able to understand pigs or spiders, and so Sarah had been unable to learn. She'd tried to get Susan Pevensie to teach her how to shoot a bow, and had ended up mostly with callouses. The real problem was, all that Sarah could bring in and out of a story was herself, and herself wasn't really much good at anything at all. 

""But I'm not any good at writing,"" Sarah said. 

Abby made a rude noise and blew hair out of her face. Abby's role in this had so far consisted largely of watching Sarah vanish, vouching for where she was while she was gone, and getting ever more frustrated at the complete lack of any progress whatsoever. ""You don't need to be any good at writing!"" Abby said. ""That's the point! Real stories have to, like, balance things, so that no one's too powerful and there's all this, uh, tension about who's going to win, and stuff like that."" She flounced upright and turned to face Sarah. ""But you, you can just write whatever! Write about a stone that gives you godlike powers! Write about anything! It's all fiction! Just give yourself all the powers you want!"" 

***

And so, alone in her room, Sarah had hesitantly scrawled out something on a sheet of notebook paper. 

*Once upon a time*, the story read, *there was a magical rock, and anyone who touched it would become incredibly smart, and incredibly skillful, and know any skill her heart desired. And this magical rock was in the middle of an empty room with no doors, and there was no one there to touch it, just waiting for someone from another world to appear inside the room and absorb all the rock's power for herself.*

*The End*

Sarah cringed re-reading it. It was a truly terrible story, and she was glad no one else was there to see it. She held the paper in both hands, and focused on the words, imagining the description in her head. The paper stretched, the words melted and swirled together like a whirlpool, and Sarah found herself tumbling in. 

The room was white, a blank paper white, the color so uniform that she couldn't tell the walls from the floor. It was an empty void. And in the middle, there was the magic rock, looking like a boulder from a roadrunner cartoon that the coyote would accidentally drop on himself, except with purple glittery swirls on it. Sarah cringed again. She was so very glad that she had decided to do this alone. 

She held out her finger and touched the rock. 

A tingle ran up her arm, although later she would consider that she might have been imagining it. Sarah waited, and felt no smarter, and no more skillful, though she wasn't sure what being smart or skillful would even feel like. She looked around for the portal back to the real world, and realized it wasn't there. There was nothing but the empty blank space. Sarah considered the possibility that she had imagined something so plain and boring and empty that it had completely eradicated everything else in existence. 

She thought it was a real possibility. 

""Okay,"" Sarah said to herself. She pinched her fingers together as if she was holding a wand. ""Make me a portal!"" she said, and thrust her arm outwards. There was a swirl of ink, and a portal sketched itself out in front of her. She cautiously touched it. It was completely flat and led to nowhere. 

""Oh, damn!"" Sarah said out loud. It was the first time she had cursed, and felt quite appropriate. Sarah considered doing it more often. ""Okay,"" she said, looking at the drawn portal. ""Make me ... make me a wizard. Someone who knows what he's doing!"" 

There was the sound of scratching, pen against paper, and an incredibly shitty wizard sketched itself out in front of her. His beard was both bushy and curled, making the curly part look like a hairless rat tail. His robes spread out to each side in a triangle, like someone had tried to use them as a tent. His eyebrows were sketchy and crossed. ""Help me!"" Sarah said. ""I need to know how to get back to the real world!"" 

""Bar!"" the wizard said, and then coughed like he was hacking up a hairball. ""Yesh,"" he said, with a mouthful of whiskers. ""I'm only a wizard. You made me. I don't know anything you don't know."" 

Sarah looked around the empty white void and started to feel the panic setting in. She could make anything, anything at all, but what good was that when everything she could make would just be completely terrible? ""Oh my god,"" she said, and started to cry. ""I didn't want this,"" she said. ""I mean, I did want this, but - I didn't know it'd be so bad."" 

""Hrmmph,"" said the wizard, pulling at his stiff robes and looking around. ""Hrm, yes, this sucks. You're terrible."" 

""Oh shut up!"" Sarah yelled, and thrust out her hand, casting a fireball at him. There was some actual heat to it, and though the wizard dodged, it left a scorch mark on the white walls. ""You're just a dumb wizard, you're a terrible wizard, if you can't do anything then - then - why don't you stay out of my way!"" 

The wizard hrumphed again, glancing anxiously at the scorch mark and then down at his paper-white body. ""I only know things that you know,"" he said grumpily. ""And you know you're terrible! So there!"" 

""That's -!"" Sarah said, and then sniffed and wiped her nose. ""You don't need to be so mean about it!"" 

""*You* don't need to be so mean about it!"" the wizard snapped back, and then they both stared at each other in shock. 

""You don't,"" the wizard muttered, and settled down on the floor. ""I'm just something you made up. And I'm not very good. And you're not very good. But we don't need to be mean to each other."" 

Sarah swallowed and wiped her face. ""Did I tell you to say that?"" she said. 

""I don't know,"" said the wizard. Sitting down, he looked even more like a tent than before. ""I suppose you did. You're just talking to yourself, you know."" 

""Yeah,"" said Sarah, and sat down across from him. She waved her hand and conjured up a campfire. The fire crackled lamely, with the sound of someone crumpling paper. ""I - It helps."" 

""Yeah?"" said the wizard. He stretched out and his robes came unfurled, the tent collapsing. He was seated out loose on the floor, and his bare legs poked out. They were hairy. ""I guess it does."" His eyebrows crossed in thought and he stuck out his tongue. ""You don't have to be a good writer,"" he said at last. ""You don't have to be as cool or as smart or as - as interesting as the characters in the books you read. You can write if you want to,"" he said, and traced patterns on the ground. They were seated on a bed of white sand. ""You just have to - you just have to be yourself."" 

Sarah grimaced. ""That's really corny,"" she said. 

""Yeah,"" said the wizard. ""But it's true. You don't have to be totally original. You can recognize when something's true. Why read other people's books otherwise?"" 

Sarah leaned back on her hands and felt the grit under her fingers. She looked up and far, far above there was a patch of night sky, glinting with stars. There was a cool night breeze on her neck, and the fire was now crackling and warm. ""Say it,"" she said. ""What's the moral of this story?"" 

The wizard shrugged. ""You can be yourself. Bit by bit. Write. Explore. Even if yourself isn't very interesting yet. Even if the best parts of you are things you stole from other people."" He took off his pointy hat and a mass of curly white hair sprawled out from the top of his head. ""Sometimes there are interesting bits you make up yourself."" He looked up to the stars. ""Remember that night at the beach with your parents?"" 

""Yeah,"" Sarah said. She could hear the sound of the sea softly shushing her, and lay back, watching the night sky expand. 

""What do you want?"" said the wizard, his voice far away. 

""I want,"" Sarah said, and closed her eyes. ""I'd like to go back home now."" 

She opened her eyes, and was back on her bed, the piece of notebook paper clutched in her hand. It was full now, words in her own handwriting, scribbled on both sides front and back. Sarah looked up at her ceiling and clutched the paper to her chest.

""I guess I'll name him Wizzard,"" Sarah said, as Abby was crouched on the loveseat, reading her story. ""That's Wizzard with two z's. Because, you know, he's a terrible wizard? I didn't think of that while I was making the story. But if I re-write it, you know, I'll call him the double-z Wizzard instead."" Abby put down the paper and looked up at her. ""Well? What do you think?"" 

""I think,"" Abby said, ""that's an incredibly lame idea."" And then she broke out into a smile. ""I mean, it's a cool story. It's what I told you to write, anyway. But I'm serious, that's a terrible idea, and you should definitely not go through with it."" 

""Okay,"" Sarah said, and hopped up on the seat next to her and laughed. ""Fair enough."" ",sadoeuphemist

This time, however, as you prepare to return to reality, you realize the exit portal is nowhere to be found.",BigPhatPanda,"I do not know why they like it, but it has helped them grow and it has helped them thrive. In my world we do not have a word for it, but here they call it empathy. It is hard explaining it and if any of you are my kin, you will think me mad or a fool. And you may be right.


In this world the strong survives, yes, but the weak does not die. When I had come here to relieve my frustration I had killed so many of them. I butchered the weak and the strong. Oh you should have seen their reaction! I understand being upset when the men and leaders were killed, yes, but they cried for the children! The mourned for the women! Such a strange people they are. No wonder they are fictional; surely nothing of the sort has any belonging in the real world.


But now things have grown worse. The portal I had created is gone and I have been here for too long. I can't say how many years it has been nor can I say how many years more it shall be. My time here has taken its toll and now I fear I would not survive in the real world. This is a sad reality for it means I am weak. But there is some comfort though. At least here the weak may live and survive. I know how repulsive that sounds, but I have grown thankful for it.


Throughout my stay I have learned their ways. Empathy, as I've mentioned, seems to be the most elusive. It is caring for others by imagining what they are going through and trying to make it better. That is how I understand it at least. Such a thing, I know, but it has worked here. This world is civilized and advanced. They have means of communicating telepathically through great beacons in the sky. They have carriages with the horses inside. Their food is varied and full of salt. Who would have known such a weak people could gather so much? Who knew they could have thrived so?


And so now I will begin to end this letter. If you are truly my kin and have come for me, I implore you to turn back. There is no saving me. I am like them and becoming ever more so. I had even taken a mate, a woman, but she had left me for someone more 'sensitive'. I do not know what that means, but I have gotten what is called a dog now and it is much better company. My life feels complete and content.


It is true that I will miss the crimson skies of home and the taste for battle. It is true that I will never again resume my quest for the castle as I had sworn to seek. It is true that I may be seen as a coward and weak. So be it my kin. This world may not be real, but it is real to them and it is real to me. I will continue my days in Earth and I will die here with my dog. I have made my choice. May the Gods forgive me.",SteelPanMan
"[WP] You were born with the ability to enter fictional worlds and come back to reality with any unique skills you acquired. This time, however, as you prepare to return to reality, you realize the exit portal is nowhere to be found.",BigPhatPanda,"Home. A dull, boring place. Nothing really happens here. My parents died in the only war ever recorded. I have few friends. The only thing of note really is the obscenely large library, filled with thousands of books.

I discovered my ability when I was young. Reading a book and wishing I could be there. A green portal opened up beside me, and I stepped inside the world of the book.

Oh I've been on may adventures through green portals. I've been a wizard, a knight, a space pirate, a detective. You name it I've done it. Each time stepping back thorough a green portal to return home. Return to the library. Find another book, another adventure.

I'm always seeking bigger and better thrills.

One day I found myself ideally starting at the stars the sky. I knew there were an uncountable amount. What if some greater power had carefully placed each one precisely? The exact three-dimensional coordinates of billions of billions of stars. Such an unimaginable amount of information.

What if I was looking at an incomprehensibly large book?

And with that thought a blue portal opened bedside me. I didn't even question why it was blue, I just leaped in.

I found myself in such a detailed world with so much going on. I became deeply engrossed. It was weeks before I had any desire to return home. I had only intended to return home to catch up with my friends quickly.

Regardless of how hard I tried, I couldn't conjure up any portal. I tried reading books, looking at the stars, everything.

I was trapped. But I didn't mind really. I love it here. I've been here years now.

And it took me so long to realise why the portal was blue and why I was trapped.

I found a dull and boring book describing a boring place that had one war and a large library. The hero could travel between fictional world's.

I know where I am now.

*My fingers are still shaking as I try to come to terms with the fact that I cannot go home again. I just wanted to see what it would be like to live the game, you know. Now I can hear the quill fiends scratching and snuffing just outside the rickety shack where the portal should be. Damn it, why is it gone? This has never happened before* 

**Day 20** 

*Its become easier to fight. Today I was ambushed along the rode to Tristram by goatmen and I felt the first rush of battle I'd ever felt. With fist and foot I dispatched my enemies feeling the chi build in me until I summoned forth a wave of light in the form of a great bell. It was second nature to call forth the abilities in me but I was still stunned as the devestated remains of my foes spread out in front of me. It feels wrong to loot the corpses, but there heads will fetch a fine price* 

**Day 30** 

*The world shook and somehow, the part of me that remembers this is a game, knew that Diablo had fallen again but I know that will not stop the monsters. They roam in packs and prey on the weak that wander the roads of Sanctuary and it is up to men and women like me to stop them. That is my calling.* 

**Day 100** 

*It has been sometime since I wrote in this journal, I do not need it as much anymore. I look back on the rantings of my early self and it appears to be the writings of a mad man. I know this is not the case but I am part of Sancutary now. I have found a place to call home and set up a small temple Sahptev in the village I now call home.* 

""Master! Master! Demons!"" Loman shouts drawing me from my writing. 

I pick up the heavy staff and rose from my work. Pushing aside the curtain to my home I stepped once more onto the soil of this world and feel the one thousand and one Gods and Goddesses smile upon me. The demons that salivate at the village gates growl louder when they sense my presence. 

I would have it no other way. 

I am home.

This time, however, as you prepare to return to reality, you realize the exit portal is nowhere to be found.",BigPhatPanda,"&lt;This is based on my own two-book-with-spin-off story. This is basically a hint of what I've got cooked up.&gt;

&lt;Yes, I know the title says 'this time'. I forgot.&gt;
God damn it, the portal's gone. Well, guess I'm stuck here now...in the middle of buttf-ck nowhere in Northern Canada. And of all places in the middle of buttf-ck nowhere, a city. Literally, in the middle of the Northwest Territories, or as the 'government' likes to call it, Centauria. What a sh-tty name for a province. Well, now that I'm here and...someone else, better get learning that dialect so nobody notices.

&lt;SOME TIME LATER&gt;

God, this 'Centaurian English' ~~crap~~ is just a ~~pain in the arse~~ travesty to learn. You ~~can't~~ cannot abbrevitate *anything* (you see?), not even in conversation, you ~~can't~~ cannot say informal terms like 'cool' or 'dodgy' anymore, only 'brilliant' and 'awful' and ~~all of it's other words~~ similarly-derived words, and the ~~worst part~~ most awful issue? You are sincerely told NOT to swear. Now ~~I'm~~ I have a tendency to swear ~~a lot~~ often, so now I have to find other means of ~~getting rid of~~ exherting my anger.

This letter is a means of helping me learn, as you may see from the many corrections. I appear to be doing quite well now, but ~~I'm~~... Oh BLAST! One whole line, and I manage to ~~slip up~~... Nerves? Or just the transition period? The issue is, talking as if you were a highly-wealthy Londoner in 1876, of course, difficult to adjust to. Having the ~~arse of~~ rear of a horse ~~doesn't~~ does not help, either. Oh, the pains of changing dialect.

Okay. Now I appear to have ~~nailed~~ solved the abbreviations issue. The swearing is coming out of use, but slang words and other such words have yet to be eliminated...wait, are they speaking fluent Russian outside the house? Are the ~~RCMP~~ Mounted Police speaking to a youth criminal in fluent Russian, too? Such observations further fuel my desire to leave. But...the scenery, and the opportunity of ~~running~~ galloping at what I remember is thirty miles per hour or more...should I stay?

&lt;SOME TIME LATER&gt;

I stay. I must, now that I truly realise the predicament. Somehow, I have lost my Yorkshire manner of speaking (and the accent, to my pleasant surprise), and have gained the accent that I feel was one I was born to posses. And to think the same reality which I had typed on two computers over nearly two consecutive years is the one I must live in, oh, the desires I once had last year!

I must see Whitehorse, I must see Toronto (whatever is left of the city), and I must see Ottawa. Canada, once my favourite country, has changed, and for the better, minus the inevitable ineptitude of the new Prime Minister. But what about myself in this reality? Does my formed for  exist in some alternate Hull? Well, I must not worry myself, and forget the portal.

My name is now Stephen Moroz, and now I must learn Russian, and how to pay taxes. 

I feel ready.",Hullian111

"[WP] Through the intricate study of fairy tales and nursery rhymes you discover not only are they all connected, but they foretell a significant future event.",Brown_Topher,"I shove the next sheet of paper on the ever growing pile on the left side of my old and overflowing desk. *This time, It can´t be a coincidence anymore. All those fairytales, old legends and even modern adaptations, they all point to this one event.*   
Once again I go through all of the written documents I´ve collected over the previous years, just to be sure. My eyes scan the titles on the top of each of the sheets: 
*The Red Riding Hood*, *Collected Stories Of The Bogeyman*, *Snow-white*, *The History Behind The Slender Man Phenomenon* and many more. I´ve found over threehundred completely unrelated stories and myths and they all share one distinct similarity: The Big Bad does not reveal himself until he´s sure to have won. In some stories he´s hidden in the shadows, in some, his face is indistinctable. Sometimes the evil even misleads all protagonists into thinking he´d be the good guy.    

But this is not the thing that worries me beyond all reason*. The *And they lived happily ever after* at the end of those fairytales tricks people into thinking all went good, but in all these stories, there is something absolutely terrible happening right in front of the readers eyes: The Big Bad Wolf literally feasts on a little girl and Snow-White actually dies from the Poisonous apple that the evil Queen hand her. Just because evil was defeated in the end doesn´t mean all the awful things that happened along the way are made up for.   
    
They say there´s always a little truth in legends. I say, Legends always tell us something about human nature and therefore about our future. All these stories from all ages and cultures about terrible events originating from a previously hidden or ignored evil, they tell us something. History always repeats itself. 
And I fear there might be someone or something who either hides from all of us or blinds us with some kind of trickery, until it´s in a position where it can unleash doom and terror all over the world.    

While I grab my papers and make my way towards the library exit, the first verse of a poem I´ve ben thinking about far too often in the last months begins to play in my mind:

*In the desolate depths of a perilous place     
the bogeyman lurks, with a snarl on his face.    
Never dare, never dare to approach his dark lair    
for he's waiting . . . just waiting . . . to get you.*    

EDIT: I´ve added an alternate ending. You can read the story in both ways as i couldn´t decide which ending I liked better. 


As I exit the library, the bright shine of the sun makes my eyes twitch for a short moment. *I´ve spend way to much time in there, rambling about the apocalypse and it´s foreshadowing in ancient children stories*, I think to myself.   
I should be doing something with my ever decreasing number of actual friends, or, you know, just enjoy life.   
All this nay-saying is leading nowhere. I sigh. Gues I´ll go and get me something to eat. And maybe invite Miranda and Leo over for some board games tonight. I can´t remember the last time I´ve spend an evening not hunched over some version of *Hansel and Gretel* or *Myths of the Maori*...   

I make my way over to the next café, passing a busstop where an old man in scuffed clothes is reading today´s newspaper. Kind of Unconsciously I begin to read the headline on its back while moving forward. I play with the words in my head for a little, then a sudden realization makes me stop.  

In bold, black latters it says: ""PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP CALLS FOR THE IMMEDIATE INCREASE OF THE USA´s NUCLEAR WEAPON ARSENAL""

[WP] You sell your soul to Satan for a banana,Famixofpower,"I never thought it was true. The supernatural was always a belief I let my elders and others find virtue in. I never believed one word of any religion. I thought Satan and God were simply manifestations of the human psyche attempting in vain, to find a harmony between good and evil. 

The night was lonely. I didn't feel like myself and I was driving aimlessly around town at 2 am. I was starving and spotted a food market and decided to indulge in some fruit. Some food for the soul I desperately needed. 

It was strange that the market was open at a time like this. When I entered I was greeted by strange man dressed in all white standing stiff and formally by the cash register. 

""Hello!"" He said in joyous and deep tone. 

""Hi?"" I said. It rang out of mouth like question not a greeting. 

""Strange to be at a place like this."" He paused for a brief moment ""At a time like this."" 

I looked at him in confusion and awe. He seemed to have a distinct glow that was both attractive and menacing. 

I proceeded to walk and find the fruit I came for. I walked past the apples that seemed to be a bit rotten. I contemplated buying some oranges and picked one out of the pile but felt that it wouldn't please my craving. After the oranges, came the bananas. 

They were all assorted so well, in bunches of four or three or five. Some were ripe, others were glowing yellow. I knew I wanted a banana at that moment, finally I knew what wanted. 

I scanned across the neatly organized bunches looking for the most beautiful bananas of the bunch. They all looked equally exquisite in form until I saw the most beautiful thing my eyes I've ever had the pleasure to witness. No man, woman or thing I have seen through my 34 years of life could even begin to compare. 

There was a single, abandoned banana glowing with radiance and love on the top shelf above all the others. I don't how long I stared at that banana before I attempted grab it. Time seemed to suspend and dissipate. I became the banana and the banana became for a brief blissful moment in time. 

I snapped out of my trance and grabbed the banana. When I grabbed it, instant waves of euphoria came over. The euphoria felt sexual in nature but seemed to have intentions that went deeper than sexual impulses. 

After the euphoric orgasm subsided I brought the banana to the cash register where the mysterious man was waiting. I carefully placed the banana on the counter. The cashier was still glowing, it was similar to the bananas glow but more mischievous in its nature. I was blinded by a creeping orange light in my peripheral vision. I turned to my right and was appalled to see the radiant sunrise outside the glass doors of the store. 

How much time had passed? It had felt like 5 minutes at the most from my perspective. 

""Will that be all,"" the cashier said in demanding tone.

I turned to him frightened by his strong voice. He had his tilted and was grinning like he was in on a secret that I had no knowledge of or could even begin to comprehend. Moving his eyes up and down my body in a condescending yet sorrowful way. 

""You just want that one banana?"" He asked. 

""Uh... yeah,"" I responded. 

He let out a deep masculine laugh. ""You can have that one for free,"" he stated, still chuckling. 

""Why free?"" I inquired. 

All the sudden his face turned serious. ""Because you deserve it.""

I looked at the banana, that was still glowing and then at him. I shrugged my shoulders and thought why not? I grabbed the luscious fruit and headed out the door. 

""There is however."" He paused again in his speech. ""Conditions."" 

I had my hand on the door and contemplated just leaving with the banana, but something seemed to constrict me from leaving. 

""What kind of conditions?"" I asked. 

""You must be wondering how strange this night has been. You enter a food market at 2 am and find a banana that seems grants you the everlasting peace you've searching for your whole desperate life. You feel enlightened yet still on edge."" He paused, letting out deep breath. ""Time has dilated greatly for you this evening. You have been here for 3 days yet you seem to be unaware of that. You are a delusional and lost soul. I am very sorry to see that but I can help. I promise."" 

""Who are you?"" I said with my voice trembling. 

He looked down for moment in sadness. Then raised his head seeming to be on the verge of tears. ""I am Satan.""

I didn't say word, but I believed it. 

""I want to offer you that pure and beautiful banana to you for your soul."" He said still crippled with an unrelenting sadness. ""Let's help each other.""

I couldn't believe it. I felt sympathy for him. I agreed not knowing what my soul was, just contemplating the love this banana would grant me. 

As soon as I agreed to the deal the sadness transformed into a smile and a tear ran down his pale face. He wiped it delicately with his finger and raised his lifeless eyes to me. 

""Thank you.""

I left with a strong feeling that I was deceived. I don't know why I would agree. It was on impulse and irrational sympathy. Emotion had gotten the best of me. 

I sat in my car for a long while. Taking deep breaths and closing my eyes, contemplating what I had just done. I opened my eyes and the banana was resting in the passenger seat still glowing with love. I had to eat it. It seemed to be all I had left. 

I quickly grabbed it. Peeling it compulsively with my hands trembling. I was taken back and felt like something left my body after I peeled it. 

There was nothing inside. There was no banana inside. Merely a peel that covered meaningless matter. A void. I didn't understand. It felt like there was indeed a banana inside the peel when I was inside the store. 

I ran back inside the market with the peel in my hand, to find a completely different place that I had been in just 5 minutes ago. Now there were people shopping. The cashier was a plump woman sporting an oversized apron. 

This can't be real. I must've been dreaming, but I still had the peel in my hand. An intense wave of dizziness struck and reality started spinning. I didn't say a word. They'd think I was crazy. Instead I ran back to my car. Put it in drive and drove out of the parking lot like the madman I was. 

The dizziness was overwhelming as I drove like a drunk on the road. I couldn't see anything. It was matter of time before I got in an accident I thought, this was my fate and I chose it. 

I heard a truck horn and slammed my brakes. I felt the intense impact before I was induced into an eternal sleep.

1. Make my writing better. Probably a clear, definite thing. Starting to respond in Satchats and Writing Prompts has really helped me expand my whole ""getting good at writing"" dealio. Branching me out to think of more ideas and genres, and allowing me to spread creativity in a better fashion. It's vague, but it works.

2. Make a ""successful"" subreddit to showcase both my growing world that I'm building and my own stories, whether they be my stories or a response to a prompt.

[OT] SatChat: What are your New Year's resolutions?,MajorParadox,"Bah, New Years Resolutions... I have a few that I need to hold to: 

* Exercise more (I'm terribly out of shape)
* Write more and actually edit something enough to publish somewhere
* Eat healthier (I've been slacking)
* Read more and finish all the games I've been meaning to play

Short list but I feel like they're pretty reasonable goals to have for the year? I mean playing all the games sounds silly but I really don't play the ones I have and I need to get around that and start playing them. The hardest thing for me is going to be the exercise thing since I'm so very, very sedentary. 
***
Might as well introduce myself again for the beginning of the year. ;) 

I'm Syraphia, I live in the southeast US, and I'm female. I've probably been writing for a good 15-ish years? Since middle school. I think my motivation is more of a getting emotions out on the page and the story out on the page. I write in Microsoft Word almost exclusively (it's not as bad as everyone likes to complain about). I type at around 86wpm (based on my last test) but usually I write stories and new stuff at a much slower rate, somewhere between 40 and 60wpm. You can find my photos in the wiki! 

If you'd like to see if I've improved in fifteen years, check out my writing on my subreddit, r/Syraphia and my [Inkitt page](http://www.inkitt.com/syraphia). I'm pretty sure that I've improved but there are three lengthy stories you can read all you'd like. ",Syraphia

* Have fun.

* Finish, revise and polish my 2016 Nano attempt.

* Graduate from College (finally)

I know the last one isn't writing specific but it's the second largest hurdle I'm facing this year and the one I'm reasonably optimistic about.

And in light of last year's post I should probably do an introduction. I'm madlabs67! I'm from Canada! Writing is my favourite hobby, and I like to think I'm fairly decent at it.

* **Reach 100 subscribers in /r/MajorParadox**

 I made it to 95!  Only five more people needed to help me reach my goal! :)

 On a side note, /r/DCFU has reached 1,560 subscribers, so I should take some credit for that!

* **Become the Moddiest Mod in all of /r/WritingPrompts**

* **Finish a full novel draft**

* **Make my version of Superman epic**

 Not reading /r/DCFU?  You totally should!  People seem to like my version of Superman (I take inspiration from lots of different source material).  My goal for this year is to make him the best one ever!

"[CW] Write a short story without using the words ""the"" or ""and"".",MosheMoshe42,"Once upon a time, a long time ago, there lived a bear. Now this bear had a magic hat, that contained delicious sandwiches whenever its owner desired them.  
One day, as Beorn (a noble name for any bear, especially one with a magic hat) was trundling along his favourite woodland walk, he came across a poor tinker selling his wares.  
""Why hello there, Beorn"" Harry, local Tinker/general travelling tradesman, smiled at Beorn (for a bear with a magic hat becomes somewhat famous quite easily).  
""Hello, Tinker"" Beorn replied pleasantly. ""Would you like a sandwich?"" Reaching up into his hat with a great paw, Beorn pulled out a sandwich for Harry. Harry's eyes lit up, for he had not eaten for a long time.  
""Why thank you, Beorn. That is most kind."" Munching down onto his sandwich (egg and cress), Harry was reminded of his Code, that nothing was taken without recompense. Wiping crumbs from his beard, Harry grabbed his finest frying pan.  
""Beorn, for your kindness, I give to you a frying pan.""  
""Oh! Why thank you, Tinker."" Beorn smiled. ""I shall store it in my hat."" His eyes glinted. ""I shall have to make room."" He whipped off his hat and upended it into one of Harry's pans, causing many sandwiches to fall in. Placing Harry's gift into his hat, Beorn went on his way, heading for home.  
  
Further down his homeward path, Beorn found himself abruptly stopped by a cold poke in the nose. Looking down his snout, he saw a small rabbit wearing a dashing hat, who was poking Beorn's nose with a sword.  
""Hello there"" Beorn attempted to smile.  
""Don't hello me,"" snarled his attacker. ""Your money or your life.""  
""I don't have money. I do have some nice sandwiches though. Would you like one?"" Beorn reached up into his hat as his attacker jeered. ""A sandwich? Hah! I'll skin you; your pelt will give me coin.""

Reaching home, Beorn opened his front door, calling a pleasant greeting to his wife.  
""Hello dear"" his wife, Beatrice, came up to Beorn to hug her husband. ""What's for dinner?"" She had sent him out to find some food, for even magic sandwiches become trying after a while.  
Smiling, Beorn reached up under his hat, pulling out Harry's gift. ""I thought I'd fry some vegetables with this lovely frying pan that I got from Harry"".  
""Did you get any meat?"" His wife eyed Beorn suspiciously. He had tried to disguise sandwich meat before in a similar manner. Beorn laughed, reaching up into his hat to pull out their dinner. ""Why, Rabbit steaks, dear"".",POTWP

"[WP] ""Get Up, Soldier, You're Not Dead Yet""",NoTrueReaper," Pain, left shoulder. Reocurring every three seconds. Inhalation. Sharp pain in back of right lung and dull, dry pain in throat. Facial muscles, all roughed up, but functional. Left thigh. ""Aaaagh!"" Shot, definitely shot.

---

 ""Oh, you're awake. Magnificent."" One more kick to the left shoulder. ""Get up, soldier. There's work for you to do."" Raspy voice. His CO? Close. His CO's superior, more like it.

""Aaaaai got shot."" *Wheezing.* ""And died.""

""Old. Soldiers. NEVER! DIE!"" Each word was accented with another kick. ""Now. ***GET UP!***""

---

 Memories came flooding. The CO's brain splattering upon his uniform. Ripping off his mags, rifle and sidearm. Bob stepping on a landmine. Scavenging his corpse for spare rounds. Getting surrounded by seven al-Quaeda riflemen. They were low on ammo, too. Managing to shoot four of them dead before catching a bullet in his left thigh, then finishing the rest. Bleeding out on his face in the middle of some Yemenian desert. Being left to die.

---

 But two details didn't quite match up. One, how the *fuck* was he alive? He definitely remembered bleeding out through two bullet holes in his left thigh and being able to do naught about it, not to omit the excruciating pain caused by his shattered left femur.

Now, his thigh was still hurting, but not as excruciatingly as back then, and he was able to put his full body weight on it, which would be rather tricky if his bones were shattered. And it seemed to be getting better by the hour.

---

 ""So, what's all this about? Me being back from the dead and all? And before you say something, I *remember* bleeding out in the middle of a desert after getting shot.""

""You see, mate, you never really died. I mean, you did *die*, just... Y'know you never committed to being dead, and you've been in the force for numerous years. Can I also assume you didn't *want* to die? That you wanted to give those motherfuckers what they deserve and finish your mission despite 'bleeding out in the middle of a desert'?""

""Yes, and... Yes. But what does that...""

""You seriously don't get it?"" His CO's superior interrupted him. ""Your family is soldiers all the way down to six generations back. You've never been told stories of this as a child?""

""Evidently not, so cut to the chase, would ya'? You said there's some work for me.""

""'Attaboy! So, as you can see, you're back and kickin'. How's yer leg?""

""Suspiciously not shattered, I can tell you that.""

""So that, too, checks out. Neat. It's the first time I've attended the process in person."" An unreadable nod and grin. ""You're probably asking yourself how this came to transpire. Well, it all began around the thirteenth century before current era when king Menelaus of Sparta prayed to the gods to ask them how he could prevent his best warriors from dying on the battlefield. Since his best men were also the oldest, he phrased it like so. After many a day of negotiations he struck a deal, so old soldiers, when deathly injured on the field of battle, could be brought back to active duty, so long, of course, as you're able to piece the solid pieces back together.""

""So I'm guessing that's why both my CO and Bob aren't here?""

""Well, it's hard to put someone back together after they stepped on a landmine, yeah. As for your CO, he was a Russian spy so we wouldn't even try to.""

\**Sigh.*\* ""Right. But since that was a deal that that Greek guy struck, what's the catch?""

""You can and will die irreversibly of old age and/or when you get out of active service, whichever comes first."" Glance at watch. ""Your thigh should be fully recovered by now. Come on kick me with your left leg. Give me your best shit."" Stumble backwards. ""Not bad. How's the output?""

""*Within norm, sir.*"" A metallic female voice responded.

""Magnificent. Cheers, Athena. So, if you don't have any questions let's get right to the briefing, shall we?""

""Lead the way.""

---

 After the briefing and out on the field once again, he realised what the second detail was. He should have felt joy when he was told he'd return to active duty and sorrow after Bob and (less so, but still) his CO. It was too late before he realised that he was turning into an equivalent of a remorseless and feelings-lacking CIA zombie-merc like on the news, just for the U.S. Military; and that he was surprisingly okay with that.

He smiled and muttered to himself. ""Old soldiers never die."" That was his last conscious thought.

"[WP] ""Get Up, Soldier, You're Not Dead Yet""",NoTrueReaper,"Muffled background sounds orchestrated his awakening. He opened his eyes. With his vision blurred, he could not make out the silhouette next to him.

"" He's awake."" said the green splashed figure. ""I can't believe it!""

""Where am....."" said Fisher.

"" You're stateside at Washington General Hospital. It's me Major Doakes” interrupted Doakes as he laid a comforting hand on Fisher's shoulder.

"" Oh thank God"" said Fisher reassured. Doakes and him had grown up together, went through boot camp together, and toured together. Hell, there probably wasn’t much that they hadn’t done together. Their friendship had been tried and tested in the hell fire of combat.

"" When you had disappeared during a fire fight, we marked you as dead in combat. For months you were gone. There was even a funeral.  Sally and the kids were devastated."" said Doakes tearfully, almost unable to contain himself. ""You can imagine my surprise then when I and A squad were clearing an enemy hideout and we found you beaten and battered. The official report is that you were tortured for intel on our ground positions.""

""I can't remember,"" said Fisher, straining to recall something, anything at all.

""Its ok. You don't need to remember. All that you need to know is that I am here for you"" said Doakes as he pointed to his family standing in the doorway ""And they are too.""

Sally and the kids embraced him. He had trouble breathing with the boys on his chest, but he did not mind. He was home. Tears were shed, stories were shared, and jokes were told. It took the Doctor's mention to his family and friend that they should leave him so he may get some rest to ruin the high spirits. With great effort, Sally rounded up the kids and left promising to bring him some clothes and items from home. Doakes left also reminded him that he will be debriefed in the week.

For the first time, Fisher could go to sleep in peace.  Thoughts of returning home, Sally, and the kids peppered his mind. As his closed his eyelids, he let out a resounding sigh of relief, and fell asleep.

When he awoke, he awoke not to the familiar sounds of the hospital, but a chilling symphony of ropes tightening, knuckles cracking, and metal clanging.

""Get up, soldier, you're not dead yet,"" said his torturer as he smiled, pliers in hand, ""But you'll wish that you were.""

"[WP] ""Get Up, Soldier, You're Not Dead Yet""",NoTrueReaper,"My legion marched as one, shields up. We came ever nearer to the enemy line, but there was yet to be combat.

But it was coming up. Up ahead, I could see the enemy line, shields up, spears at the ready. I could hear the clatter of our armor and the rumbling of the footsteps as we drew closer to the enemy. On beat, one-two, one-two, one-two.

Then, above me. I looked up to see our arrows had loosed, sending a hail of arrows straight into their lines. They cut through the air as they soared overhead, driving themselves into cracks in the shields, and cutting through the noise of our marching with high-pitched screeching.

Every shield faltered. The force of the arrows drove them back, loosened their footing for a split second. That was our cue. All at once, our commander screamed over the commotion, calling for us to charge. Our last-minute charge started, and we drove straight into their front line. Their shields were gone in seconds. A new sound came into my ears, the high-pitched screech of metal on metal, resounding all throughout the battlefield. Their shields dropped, their soldiers came, and the battle erupted.

Within moments, blood splattered across the battlefield. I heard the screams of soldiers dying as they were impaled in their hearts, I heard them crying for help as they lay there disemboweled.

And I heard nothing else when I clashed with another, swords shrieking as they collided. A swordfight for the centuries, neither of us gave ground, our swords clashing with each other or colliding with the other's shield. I swung overhead full force, only to be deflected and caught in the other's cross-guard. I wasn't able to move my blade, and I could only stare in horror as he smirked. He brought his sword down on my head but I smacked it away with my shield, instead only grazing my ear. It let my sword free, but the man brought his shield back up and slammed it straight into the side of my skull, directly on my other ear. 

I was knocked onto my back. I couldn't breathe, my lungs felt like they were full of dirt and blood. The man stood above me, prepared to finish the job. I closed my eyes. I had no energy. I couldn't do anything.

But then, instead of the cold steel of a blade driving through my skull, I felt a hand on my chest-piece, pulling me up. I opened my eyes to see a friend. I looked to my left to see the man with a gaping hole in his chest.

He hoisted me to my feet, and patted me on the back, but I realized all at once, there was no noise. There was only a ringing in my ears, incessant. I couldn't hear the wailing of men, or the cold clash of metal on metal. I looked at my ally, but I could only read his lips. I heard no voice, I heard no comforting tone.

I was barely able to piece together what was said.

""Get up, soldier, you're not dead yet.""

It was all I could hear. You never realize how loud nothing can be until you witness the second before a tsunami breaks upon you. The climax of death. Infinity in a single moment. This was the world today. The streets, empty. The buildings, abandoned. The forests, thriving wildly, filling the void left by the streets and buildings. The only anomaly of life left with an element of chaos. Comforting until the unnerving realization that no animals filled the acres of greenery. Rivers without fish. Flower fields without bees. A bird-less sky, stretching the heavens into a dull blue emptiness. Illuminated by the sun, that bore a white light across both plains and man-made structure. Bleak colors of life imposed on a decaying portrait. 

Only rats scuttled in the cities nowadays. Rats; it's what we call them, to try and forget that some of them used to be our family, friends and lovers. There is a lack of civility in civil war. More so than war between nations. It becomes a war between families. No hatred stronger than love lost between brothers.

I do my part for the resistance. I cover the southwest area of HQ, 5 blocks out. Just me. A good sniper can pin down a squad. I could hold down an army.

I rested the butt of the stock into my shoulder. A familiar feeling. One of my few comforts, my Geneve. And when I'm feeling cheeky, Geneva. Because before the war, she was outlawed. By who? You guessed it, by the 11th Geneva Convention. ""Overkill."", ""murder romanticized, "" and  ""Inhumane dispensation of life."", were key quotes of the report. I found the report while on a scavenge through the UN. My favorite part was the variety of rounds it could chamber. It spiced up my shots a little. It made for good reading to pass the times between perimeter checks. 

Sleek, white and black with a hexagonal mold pattern covering the rifle, it was lustful and disgustingly beautiful. The mold worked in tune with my thermal optic coat. They never saw me coming and when I wanted to, they never heard me either. I was the deadly conclusion to ""If a man falls and no one hears it, did he make a sound?"".

The red balloon was the first thing that caught my eye. I dialed in the scope. I almost fired out of surprise. I hadn't seen one in decades. I looked for the owner. A child. I resisted the urge to fire again. I swore. Children hadn't been around since the incident of '96. What passed as children now weren't fit to live. Eggs. Hollow. 

Goddamnit, focus. I wasn't and I needed to. Lack of attention would get me killed. I studied the face, it was familiar. Then I realized. It was me. 

Eight year old me, stood there with that red balloon. I pulled away from the scope, breathing hard. My heart was in my throat. I forced myself to look again and nearly had a heart attack. I was staring at myself. I stared at myself. My finger moved of its own accord and squeezed the trigger. My face disintegrated into red. I fell back. My vision was becoming blurry. What the hell was this? Everything began to slip away from me. I gripped Geneve to my chest. Her resting on my chest eased my journey into the darkness.

Interesting beginning to this story. It's a little awkward in both dialogue and prose, especially with the dialogue mixing together, as each new speaker needs a new paragraph. A lot of explanation though, like it's all attempting to get shoved in there even though with how familiar the characters are, they wouldn't discuss things like that. 

It's definitely interesting and I am wondering what comes next. I think you could easily continue from this point without too much worry or concern.

[WP] You wake up from a dream that lasted 2 years..,Vendettahavo,"The light in my shack was brighter than the trees usually let in. The steady beeping became more apparent. I opened my eyes slowly. The light blinded me. Four shapes slowly started to move around me. One shape held my hand. Another pressing buttons on a machine nearby. A woman stood over me, she was beautiful. Calm brown eyes, that complimented her olive skin. Short brown hair that tickled her shoulders.

""He's waking up,"" the woman said.

""W-where am I?"" I said, drawing in a shaky breath.

""You're in the hospital Jim. You were in an accident... a long time ago."" The button presser said. Small droplets of water hit my hand. The woman with my hand cried softly. I rubbed my fingers in her hand, trying to console her. 

Something was different. My body felt weaker. I lifted my arm to see the boney shell of what I should have been. 

""Where's my bow?"" I asked, scanning the room as fast as I could. The woman's weeping was interrupted by a nervous stare. All I had asked for was my bow? How else was I to fight the dragons?

""Jim you're in the hospital. You were in a car accident two years ago..."" A shape in the corner said.

A rush of emotions and memories rushed to me. My whole life was a dream. The pig farms I grew up on, young love that would end in tragedy. All of it, a lie. All of the gold, and all of the honor. All of it gone. Two years traded for a whole life. I wanted to go home. Not to my house but to my small shack. 

""Jim you're going to be fine. I'm here with you,"" the beautiful-- no not woman. Jenny was  her name. We were happily married with two kids. All I remember was driving on a small back road and starting my new life. 

""Jenny..."" I whispered. The bed reclined up slowly. Jenny moved in closer.

""Find me a bow, and a dozen dragons.""",DJWhiteT

"[WP] After years of searching, SETI finally receives a message from aliens. After being decoded, the message consists of two words no one expected: ""help us""...",florisgrif19,"""Poor bastards.""  the lone man at the station muttered as he took a drag from his cigarette, sipped his coffee, then blew out the smoke. 


A group of elated scientists that had formed a celebratory party stood behind the man and watched as he crumpled up the slip of paper printed from the translator and tossed it into the garbage next to him.  ""So what did it say?"" a man inquired from within the group.

Spinning around in his seat to address the small crowd, the man at the machine took another sip of coffee and spoke, ""Don't worry about it, we'll keep looking."" 

The group sighed in disappointment and began dismantling the party balloons and decorations that adorned the lab.  One man stood still, unable to accept that the results had just been more random cosmic noise.  ""What did it say though?"" he asked.

""It said, 'help us'.  Can you believe that?""  The man at the machine said with a faint laugh, and a flick of his cigarette randomly without any ash tray.

The group came to a stop and looked back at the man in further disbelief.  ""You mean it was a real message!?""  another voice screamed from the group.

""Yeah, they want us to help them, like what?  You know?  What?  _Help_ us?  Trust me, we should be keep looking.""  The man explained as he attempted to mitigate excitement over the message.

""Well, maybe we should help them.""  Another voice calmly submitted.

""And how exactly do we do that, Gary?  Huh?  Just trust me on this, a friend in need is a pest."" the man shouted.  ""Now get back to work, surely there's a _cool_ race of beings out there we could meet.""

The man spun back around in his chair to focus on the machine in front of him as the room remained quiet and in shock.  Reporters and cameramen starred blankly at each other as the events were broadcast live throughout the world.  Collectively, the entire human species dwelled on the first message ahead of them and the appropriate reaction dictated to them by it's first reader.

As the room remained in a state of shocked confusion and quiet, a reporter faced her camera and began speaking, ""And so there you have it, the first successfully received transmission from another race of beings beyond the solar system.  Back to you, I guess?  Kent?"" 

The room of people began to murmur in befuddlement, some folks switching from smiles blank stares of intrigue, to looks of alarm and realization of what the message could mean.  Another woman within the crowd began to speak, ""Well shouldn't we, I don't know, try and respond back with something?""

The man in the machine spun around in his chair in frustration to address the crowd again, ""See, you're the reason these kinds of beings never make any improvements in their lives.  If we just _give them help_ how can we expect them to take care of themselves later on?  Surely there's galactic social services that could intervene.""  

""--Galactic? Social services?""  a man in thick glasses asked concernedly. 

""Well I don't know, I mean the point is, they got themselves to that point on their own, and I for one am not going to feel sorry for them one bit.""  the man at the machine responded in stubbornness.  

Small arguments began as the room quickly realized they were evenly divided between responding to the beings and ignoring them.  Voices could be heard presenting their ideas on the matter as the sound of TV news hosts arguing could be faintly heard over the earpiece of the reporter.

""We could transmit blueprints for... Well, _something_ cool that we have.  Maybe they don't have computers yet?""  one person said.

""Then what?  They'll probably just sell the blueprints to some other species in order to get more of whatever it is they ruined their lives with.""  another person responded.

""Yeah, and how do we know they won't just hit us up for more any time they get into trouble?  I don't want to constantly be telling these people no.""  yet another voice submitted.

""We don't even know why they need help.  Why are you making assumptions about substance abuse issues?"" another person argued.

""We're not in any position to help anyone.  We have our own problems.""  the janitor chimed in.

As the arguing escalated, the man at the translation machine checked his Facebook feed.  He could already see scours of individuals debating the merits of lending a helping hand in in some capacity to the beings.  The man lit another cigarette, took a long deep drag, had another gulp of coffee, blew out the smoke and spoke softly to himself, ""Poor bastards.""",BernadetteSanderson

Almost every alien race except for humans has gone extinct, because they created robots at some point in time.",florisgrif19,"The light on the probe blinked slowly. Every three seconds or so a pale green light would turn on for half a second then turn off. The whole world watched that light blinking. The images were being sent from Earth orbit by a Soyuz capsule. The probe had entered orbit a few ago and every space agency on Earth raced to get up to it. After a day or so, they decided it would go faster if they cooperated and shared whatever they learned. 

""Command, this is Comrade One, we are on approach."" Commander Davidson - an American - was in charge of the mission. He had the respect of most of the Russian space community and it was seen as a gesture of good will to have an American flying a Russian ship for this historic meeting. Captain Vasilyovich was his second-in-command and Lt. Commander Chow was the mission specialist. The crew was assembled more for political reasons than scientific.

""Comrade One, this is Control, acknowledged."" 

Commander Davidson eased the tiny capsule up to the probe. They had tried contacting the probe with any signal they could think of, but the probe never responded. They bounced sensor scans off of it day and night and learned nothing new. The only option left was to send a manned mission up there.

The Soyuz drifted closer to the probe and it was only then that the astronauts could feel how big the probe was. They had been told it was nearly two hundred meters in diameter but it didn't seem real until they approached it. Their tiny capsule was a speck in the blackness of space next to it.

""Any ideas Command?"" Davidson said, only to receive back silence.

A small portal irised open on the probe and a handful of lights activated.

""They are inviting us in?"" Vasilyovich asked.

""Or trapping us,"" Chow said. They had decided on English as the language for the trip even though all three also spoke Russian. It would be easier for the translators back on Earth, they were told.

""Control, this is Comrade One. A window has opened on our approach. Might be a docking bay. Over."" Davidson said.

""It's definitely big enough for us,"" Vasilyovich said as he looked over the sensor readings on his tablet. 

""Comrade One, Control. Standby.""

""They will order us to observe and return to Earth,"" Chow said.

""That would be a shame,"" Davidson said.

""We would not follow order, yes?"" Vasilyovich's accent became thicker as he was more stressed. Davidson had teased him about it for years, as a friend.

""Da, we would not follow order,"" Davidson said. Vasilyovich smiled. Chow had only recently met these men and felt left out of their friendship and disappointed in what he saw as their unprofessionalism and disrespect.

""Comrade One, Control, what is your analysis?""

The three crew members looked at each other. It was rare for Control to ask what the people on-site thought. Usually they would dictate commands and the crew would obey.

""Control, Comrade One, we should go in."" Davidson said. They waited. They looked at each other and sat quietly.

""Comrade One, Control, mission approved. Proceed at risk."" 

Davidson was shocked and he could see the surprise on Vasilyovich's face as well. He didn't know Chow well enough to guess what was behind his poker face.

The tiny capsule slowly drifted into the portal. The lights guided them in. Half-way through the process, Davidson realized he was no longer controlling the capsule. Some sort of automated landing process had begun within the probe and was gently manhandling the capsule in. They saw the door iris shut behind them. Davidson tried to call Control once and received nothing but static.

The capsule groaned and popped around them. There was a knock at the door. All three men looked at each other. They had risked their lives on this mission and now was their moment of truth. Chow reached over and knocked on the door twice.

The wheel on the door spun freely and the door slid open. On the other side was a tall multi-limbed metal robot. A roughly hexagonal central body had six legs radiating out from it. The central body was at most a meter tall and it stood two meters high. Several lenses and bulbs were arrayed around the body. An ear-piercing squeal of static blasted out from the robot and all three astronauts slapped their hands over their ears. The sound shut off almost immediately.

""Sorry,"" the robot said. ""We are still adapting.""

The astronauts looked at each other. 

""... Hi?"" Davidson said. ""I'm Commander George Davidson. From Earth.""

""Do you not speak?"" The robot asked.

Davidson looked at the other two astronauts.

""I ... I just did. Commander Davidson. From Earth?""

""Ah, primitives."" The robot tilted a bit and seemed to stare at the three astronauts. ""Your ... ship? Yes, your ship is not aware. It is unawakened. You are the awakened parts of this.""

""I guess?"" Davidson said.

""Most other advanced species are replaced by their robots at roughly this point in their evolution. We are early."" The robot turned to go.

""Wait!"" Vasilyovich shouted. ""Early for what?""

The robot paused for a moment. ""For your extinction. Robots and organic cannot coexist. Organics are necessary only to create the more perfect form of robots. Even your word 'robot' means slave. You will be eradicated as the organics were on all of our worlds.""

The three astronauts were left with mouths agape. The six-legged robot exited through a small alcove and the air started rushing out of the room. Chow was the first to react and slammed the door shut, spinning the wheel closed. Davidson felt the landing system pick up their craft and turn it around. They saw the portal iris open and were gently returned back to Earth orbit.

""What do we tell them?"" Chow asked as they floated above the blue sphere of Earth.

""The truth,"" Vasilyovich said.

""They'll call us crazy and lock us away,"" Chow replied.

""What's the alternative?"" Davidson asked.

""I don't know. Tell them the enemy is coming and we must prepare for war?""

""That will just make them push farther in robotics,"" Vasilyovich said.

""Maybe we should say nothing,"" Davidson said. ""We swear to secrecy forever. We start a colony - on some remote part of Earth or on the Moon or on Mars. We get rid of anything like artificial intelligence. Strictly dumb machines. We never tell anyone why.""

""Is that not like your Amish?"" Chow asked.

Davidson paused at that. ""Yeah, I suppose it is. They don't mind technology but they won't let it run their lives and they are in strict control of it. A new Amish then. Space Amish.""",AltCipher

""Yes, Professor Gates.""

""That's why we are going to climb that tower today and hook up some of those nodes to reset our galaxy, and it will be in our favor afterward!"" the professor yelled loudly.

""Be quiet or else you will be shocked,"" the robot patrolling the hall cautioned. He had been reprogrammed, but he didn't know that yet.

""So how are we going to climb the tower without them spotting us, Professor?"" his student asked.

""We're going to cloak ourselves with radio frequencies. Robots can't defend against that, and that's how the robots traveled undetected by other robots when smuggling us to this low-profile prison. You're going to have to put up the nodes though, Gabe,"" the Professor stated.

""Ok, let's get going, Professor.""

""Please, call me Bill.""

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

They climbed the tower that went from Earth and almost stretched to the moon, the air getting streamed to their lungs through hidden cables. Suddenly, somebody jumped from a nearby tower toward them.

""Mind if I join you?"" the mysterious man said.

""Who are you, and why do you want to join two cloaked people climbing the Tower of Enslavement?"" Gabe asked the man.

""When the world was being enslaved from space by the robots, I laughed and figured out a way to take them all down. Seems like you're beating me to it, though,"" the man proclaimed as he laughed.

""So who are you, and what smart thing do you have to offer us?"" Bill questioned.

""My name is Elon Musk, and I am one of the smartest counter-intelligence officers against the robots.""

""And here goes the last node!"" exclaimed Gabe as he put the node on the top of the tower, causing a beam to get sent into space.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As the fabric of space and time shifted, they each got two things that they wanted. Bill, the professor of Gabe, got to be the inventor of modern technology and a well-proclaimed person across the world. Gabe got tons of money and a game company he could call his own, and even got famous for the word nodes. Elon, however, wished to be the smartest person in existence and for the past to have plot holes. This includes him jumping toward the tower despite them being near the top so that he could get all of his wishes. Elon Musk is just too smart.

This is the reason we don't see the robots from space, as the Milky Way got reset. Just watch out for those robots running for President of the United States in 2020, though. One's name is Kanye.",Empty_Engie

[WP] Everyone has exactly one talent. You wish you had a different one.,gameon123321,"We have things called Talents. Everyone is pretty much the same abilities wise. Average. We don't get sick here. Not until we hit the ripe age of 72. 

But we all have one Talent that puts us above the rest. It is what decides our jobs. Our relationships. That is what drives our society. That is what makes us complete. 

I know we used to die at different ages. Some lives to eight some to eighty. It was unfair. We all deserved the same years. We all deserved to grow up without war or poverty. 

That was when Don's Law took effect. I don't know how they did it. All I know is they did. They figured out how to make everything equal. 

No one is sick. No one is ugly. We all have differences of course. But people are the same even inside the races. They have taken away the... idk. I really don't. It's like we are all robots that are given slightly different faces. 

It doesn't mean the same thing to be Japanese now. We don't have the same separation. You can't live in seclusion. 

We all live in Elevated Cities above earth. We make little waste. Few people go down into the forests. Few have seen what the world is like outside of sameness and talents. 

I mean there is still jealousy. People fight about stupid things. It is usually about Talents. When you live in such vast cities certain things retain merit while others fade into he background. 

And people value things differently. I know a girl who just sang. That is all she did. She sang songs written for her. And people adored her. 

That made her a commodity. It was all she could do really. Which is scary. All she wanted to do was sing. And someone gave that to her. Just like her eyes. Just like her skin. 

My talent has never been open. I tell people my talent is listening. Of understanding what happens to people. But in reality my talent is difference. I am different. I was born with the ability to see flaws in people. To see where we might perish. 

I was given the forest to explore. Only the trees are people. The animals dead bones in their eyes. I long for the world outside of Hanger Scott. I long for more than a name lost to history and a face without context. 

It is because of this talent that I am able to choose. It is because of this talent that I am allowed to pick up a pen and draw. It is this talent that leads me to Lilac and Lily Tattoo shop.

[WP] You are playing a game where you are a ghost that kills people for fun. After hours of play you slowly begin to realize that it's not a game and you're actually dead.,gloopgloop42,"""Why are you doing this?"" She asked in a small voice. Her mascara, spoilt by tears, was a tangible shadow beneath what must have been lovely almond eyes. Her tears never stopped despite the determination in her voice. 

Derrick (aka screamingshadow151) slowed into a hover as he approached the woman. 

The woman served her purpose as victim. She was lovely in the way that made the player feel a sickly excitement when murdering her. He knew this, and still adored the game. It's a game. 

She probably didn't have very high stats in strength or speed. This meant he won't get much of a boost from killing her. *Why not, though?*

He was more guarded against ambushing boyfriends (or potential love interests, whatever the creators' choice of back story) with approaching someone like her. 

But her question was entirely unexpected. It went against the immersive game experience. Perhaps the creators were hoping for a cult hit in her so that they could have spin-off movie centred on her. 

In any case, he was curious. ""What's your name?"" he asked. 

She let out a brief shriek in response. Nice touch, he thought. 

He couldn't find the *ghastly voice* filter setting right then to tone it down. Apparently the setting wasn't just for fun. 

Instead he kept his focus on her and his distance at arm's length. Perhaps there was a side quest he could unlocked if he figured out the right direction to go in the conversation.

""What's your name?"" he repeated in a deliberate slow voice, as unghastly as he could make it sound. 

""De-Debbie,"" she said. 

""Debbie, do you know me?"" His back story had not been revealed to him yet. 

""Derrick.""

*What?* He was a private guy. At no point did he insert his name into this game or even other games in affiliated companies. He was positive about this. 

""Derrick, it was an accident.""

A shred of a scene hit him. He remembered laughing. He remembered holding the wheel with one hand, showing off to Debbie. He remembered her kissing him. And then he flew out of the car and hit the floor before he knew it. 

""What have I done?"" he asked himself. 

""It's no one's fault, Derrick. What did you do with Marc, Johanson and Rachel? Give them back, Derrick.""

""But...I killed them.""

Behind him, Scarygirl666, Laugh5ever and MarkooWhatSup kept their unblinking eyes fixated on him.

The death of my son was the worst thing I had to witness, and all you're here for is to learn if immortality gets passed down through a person's gene pool. Well, it doesn't. Get out of my house.""

"[WP] ""The smallest of coffins are always the heaviest""",haleymarie31,"""The smallest of coffins are always the heaviest,"" he said. 

That was his MO. 

Jacob Windstrom rested his legs on the metal table, the cuffs that held him clanked and clinked as he shifted in his seat. 

""How long is this going to go on, Mary?"" he asked, revealing his mismatched and yellowing teeth in his grin. ""You know, you don't have enough evidence to hold me here."" 

""Where is the boy, Jacob?"" Mary asked, her hands on the table, the ringing echoing in the empty room. For 3 years, she had been hunting the Bonetaker, and now she finally had him. 

He shrugged, pursing his lips. ""What boy, officer? Do you perhaps mean the Commissioner's eight-year old who suddenly disappeared two weeks ago? How would I know about him?"" 

Mary breathed out slowly, his glibness making her skin crawl. She looked back at the mirror behind her. Even though she could see her own wary face and Jacob's wolfish grin, she knew the Commissioner standing right behind it, watching carefully. 

She turned back to the killer. 

""We know it was you who took him. We have footage of you in the Commissioner's neighbourhood the night of the kidnapping."" 

He paused, looking up. 

""I heard in the news that it was this 'Bonetaker' who kidnapped the child. I heard he left two of the child's finger-bones behind as his calling card."" 

She didn't want to mention that. Even after all these years it made Mary a little sick when she thought of how he extracted the bones of his victims. 

""If you tell us where he is, you might be able to negotiate a plea deal,"" she choked out the words. 

""Get out here, Mary,"" said the Commissioner from the speakers. Mary walked to the door, but she couldn't open it. She knocked on it. 

""Commissioner, the door is stuck."" 

She could only hear her rising heartbeat in the silence. 

Metal softly clanged against metal and the sound chair being pushed made Mary shiver. 

A calloused hand brushed against her neck. 

""Maybe it's time I moved on from children,"" said Jacob. 

Mary pushed him back and pulled out her gun. She pressed the trigger. The gun only clicked. 

Jacob laughed and tackled her to the floor. 

""I'm sorry, Mary,"" said the Commissioner.

"[WP] ""The smallest of coffins are always the heaviest""",haleymarie31,"Her eyes, normally baby blue, were puffy and irritated. She'd stopped crying long enough to help cut out and color a makeshift paper tombstone. I'd helped her with the spelling.

""Can we change the windows?"" she asked me.

""I think the windows have to stay how they are.""

""But what if it happens again?"" Her voice squeaked, only just able to speak.

""What if we put up a feeder? That way they hang out and eat seeds instead of wanting to get inside the house,"" I offered.
I think she liked that idea.
I'd dug a small hole while she'd been coloring the paper grave marker. It wasn't deep, but the Ralph Lauren shoe box was small.

It was interesting to me how I remembered back to when I was young and visiting my grandfather in Missouri. He owned a long strip of farm land that hadn't been worked in ages. He did have two horses though, and a donkey, whose long ears had been fun to play with. I don't know how old I was then. Young enough to still care. My cousin and I were playing in the front yard when we found a baby robin at the base of a tree. We had absolutely no idea of what to do, so we scooped it up and brought it to the grown-ups. They'd seemed so wise then, so ready for anything.
I don't remember the exact words they'd said the two of us. I'd pleaded with them, trying to convince them that we should care for the bird until it was able to fly off. The consensus was out though, and I got to spend my last moments with the little creature while my grandpa got some kind of gun. Maybe it was a pellet gun of some kind because I don't remember the gunshot at all. I remember hating them for it, and weeping more than somebody my age probably should have. My cousin took it better.

Of course the bird would have starved. I and my mother had to return home to Michigan before long and we couldn't very well take the bird with us in the car. Grandpa didn't know how to take care of it properly. Such common sense, and yet it still made me sad.

I shoveled the dirt back onto the shoebox and carefully arranged the uprooted grass so as to not disturb the  lawn. We fastened the paper onto a stick and stuck it into the earth. She'd drawn one large bird with black pitchforks for feet, sitting on a branch and feeding a smaller bird. Their feathers were pink and blue.

""Should we say some words?"" I asked her.

""But birds don't understand words,"" she said knowingly. ""They only tweet.""

""Yeah. I guess you're right.""

You are the heavy metal alchemist.",mo-reeseCEO1,"With a final click Aria pushed home the final chord. Turning, she surveyed her preparations and went over the math again. Surrounded by a ring of speakers, she eyed the metal powders laying at their centre. 


""640 grams of lead, 180 grams of cobalt, 170 grams of iron, transmuted together... I should get a kilo of gold."" The piles of dust, carefully weighed, sat there. The raw materials she would transform into something taboo. Gold was never to be transmuted. Too much trust was placed in its rarity and value. However it was a tricky transmutation. One that only experienced alchemists could attempt. A fitting test for what she had in mind. 


Wiping the sweat and a stray strand of orange hair from her brow, she nodded to herself. This would work. A dozen paces across the circle she laid her hands on the ebony neck of her new instrument. It's silvery strings laid out taught towards a body inlaid with ivory. Where on a traditional guitar there would be a hollow resonance chamber, she had designed something new. A slender chord fell away and ran to her ring of speakers. Relaying vibrations from sensitive pick-ups, it had a sound like no other in existence and it was her sound. One she now planned to harness as more than just a raw outlet for her emotions, but as the literal power to change the world. 


Slinging the guitar over one shoulder, she felt gingerly at the strings. Their chorded lengths felt tense and eager to perform for her. Plucking a small wooden tab from her waist she laid it to the wire. Closing her eyes now, she visualized it all in her mind once more. 


A deep breath.


With a wail and a crash of sound the room erupted. The dust laid so carefully now shot into the air on a current of pure sound. As Aria's fingers dextrously snapped notes as her other flailed furiously with her pick, exerting her will through vibration. The music she played now was hard edged like a knife blade. No mere folk ditty, it cut through the room, the house and out into the countryside beyond. 


Aria rocked her body violently to her own rhythm. Her hair trailing in the air behind with each powerful motion. A crescendo. Aria felt a well of primal fury from deep within her. With no more room in her hands, it had but one escape left. She screamed. A throaty yell to match the screech of her music. She dove headlong into the middle of it all. Feeling the full fury of the sonic assault from all angles. 


In the circle, her dust spun and played in the air. A twisting vortex slammed to and fro by her song. Then with a final howling cry from the guitar the dust hung for one glorious moment around her body, still spitting droplets and flame hair. Then it all stopped. 


Out of the suddenly still air fell a familiar shimmer all about her. With heaving breast she took a moment to realize what it was falling to the floor around her. With trembling hand she held out and watched as it collected. With a start she realized she had done it and a laugh trickled out, growing with her elation. She had done it.  ",Lukimcsod

[WP] A taste of evil... Just enough to whet the lips,mo-reeseCEO1,"Mark took a sip from his tumbler, the whiskey burning into his throat as it cascaded to his stomach. He stared at the eviction notice in his hand. It had been months since he received any income, but his wife was working. He hadn't expected this.

He took another sip. He hated whiskey, but the jaded, masochistic alcoholism he inherited from his father drove the glass back to his mouth.

""What is that?"" Amy asked. The whiskey mixed with anger and Mark turned, launching the glass into the wall beside him. The sound of shattering glass was overpowered by the silence that followed it, heavy with years of similar reaction.

He was spiraling, and she could see it. She quickly removed the red envelope from the waistline of her pants and tucked it under the rest of the mail.

She turned, as she did each time, and fished the car keys out of the bowl on the counter. They were down to one car by now, and as she headed for the door she knew he couldn't leave in this state. He wouldn't be able to hurt anyone else.

Mark heard the door slam as he had so many times before. He walked to the table and brushed the shards of glass from the seat. Tears mixed with the tiny fragments, and he poured himself another drink. Sitting, the glass met his lips once more. A red corner caught his eye under the mail. This wasn't a past due notice.

Amy stepped off the porch, glancing once behind her. Mark had a glass in one hand and a red envelope in the other.

She smiled, walking quickly to the curb where a running car was waiting. She opened the door and sat inside. The driver turned the music down.

""This is it."" Amy said, shutting the door. She and the driver sat quietly, watching the house.

Amy sighed heavily, waiting. After several minutes, a muffled pop and flash of light rattled her to her core. She sat, statuesque, her breath caught in her throat.

Finally, she turned, tossing the keys in the backseat as the driver pulled away from the curb, her emotions battling in the pit of her stomach. She was too shocked to speak.

The radio sent a melancholy melody through the car. The keys slid toward the seat back, resting against a pile of papers. Fake past due notices from nonexistent creditors, some of them riddled with typos, betrayed by inked streaks from a home copier. Piles of photos, the faces of men poorly superimposed next to Amy. Red envelopes containing different notes, hand-written, describing false accounts of lustfully unfaithful trysts.

Just enough to bring Mark to the edge. Just enough to push him over it.

As the car turned onto the freeway, Amy suddenly realized she was starving. She hadn't eaten all day.

You happen to be watching the shark attack in slow motion and it is funny in a twisted way,only_shadows,"I logged onto YouTube and on the main page, with 100k likes was a video. 'OMG MAN GETS EATEN ALIVE BY SHARK!' Read the title. Even though it was probably NSFW, I clicked on it because I was at home. As the video loaded, I made a point to set it on 0.5 speed.

The video started as a shaky camera steadied itself, pointing at a young blonde girl, probably 25, smiling and waving at it. The blondes next to her, presumably her family, were also posing. Suddenly the sand started rippling. Her relatives faces changed into horror and ran to the other side of the beach, but the girl was too caught in the moment to care. A grey-tipped nose appeared and a shark head appeared! It's nasty fangs slowly popped out but the girl had noticed and ran just out of it's reach. She grabbed a ball and held it just out of the shark's reach and she taunted the shark in such a way I'm sure it would've leaped at her had it gotten the chance.

However, one of the onlookers cried out a warning but it was too late; the shark had charged at her and stopped with just enough momentum to make her trip.

And down, down, down, the girl's head slowly went straight into the mouth of the shark.",TheRealNopity

""Everything you say stays in the lamp."" 

""I want to kill my father.""

His feet scraped against the old wood of the floor, dust covered the air as silence took over. 

""Why?"" 

""He's been hitting my mother."" 

His voice was quiet, all of that previous vigour and rage left him like the air from a deflated balloon. 

""Why do you think killing him is the answer?"" 

He adjusted his glasses and swallowed a lump in his throat. 

""My dad told me the best weapon against fists is a gun. I'm just following his advice."" 

He didn't know why he was doing it. He couldn't answer the question. He just wanted to do something.

""Are you going to give me the gun or not?"" His voice was gaining some of his lost energy. 

""You can wish for something else, Jacob."" 

""Fine. I wish my father was dead.""

""I can't do that.""

""I wish for a Smith &amp; Wesson Model 500 with the right bullets for it."" 

""Jacob..."" 

He looked at the gun, pursing his lips in frustration. 

Reluctantly, I handed him the gun. It wasn't against the rules. 

""You still have two wishes left!"" I called out to him as he rushed to the staircase. 

""I only needed one.""

"[WP]Genie:""No... It's not against the rules, but...""",ActuallyDevil,"""Then do it."" The youth spat the words, choked by desperate rage. 

The genie pleaded.  ""Young man, nobody deserves that fate-""

He was interrupted. Reflected in the youth's eyes, the glow of the genie's lamp took on a manic, oily sheen.  ""My wish is your command, genie. You have no will of your own.  And I wish for you to do it now.""

The genie closed his eyes.  His spectral form shivered under the weight of the unfulfilled request, and the lamp began to issue a thin line of dark smoke that wrapped itself around the genie's trembling form.

""Please-""

""*Now.*""

Immediately from the room downstairs arose a tortured, piercing scream.  The sound forced itself through the adjoining space, through the worn timbers of the dormitory's floor, and reverberated around the small room.  It changed in neither keening pitch nor full-throated intensity, and paused between agonized intervals only to draw another ragged breath.  The youth closed his eyes and smiled unsteadily.

Another voice joined the first, this one female, her words inaudible and her tone muffled through the floor.  It sounded first alarmed, then increasingly panicked, and finally hysterical as her frantic ministrations could neither discern nor abate the cause of the screams.

Gradually, the smoke relinquished its clinging hold on the genie's form and retreated back into the lamp.  It took several minutes for the genie to stop trembling, and he floated, bare inches above the gilded lamp, eyes still closed, as the howls continued to echo up from below.  The woman's voice had given way to helpless, pleading sobs.

The youth was muttering now, his eyes darting back and forth under closed eyelids.  It as clear through the ramble streaming from his lips that his revenge was intended for both of the unhappy couple downstairs, and that the privilege of watching her lover's fate was the judgment of a jilted lover turned god.

Abruptly, the screaming ceased.  The youth sat up, cocked his head and opened an eye.  ""Genie, what happened?""

The genie had hidden his temples behind one enormous hand, and made no reply.

Annoyed, the youth opened his other eye. ""Genie, why did he stop?""

Still the genie did not speak, and the only sound between the two was the soft sound of feminine crying rising up through the floorboards.

""Genie, I wish to know why the screaming has stopped, now.""

The genie uncovered his face, and stared at the floor.  Still he took his time responding, as if waiting for something.  The lamp began to smoke ominously.  The genie cracked his neck - once, twice - and then reached into his neck to spin a spectral vertebra like a top.

""It seems..."" he paused, as if sensing the dusty air for something.  Satisfied, he nodded and continued, ""it seems he has bitten his own tongue.""

The youth turned suddenly furious. ""No! he cannot - his time is far from over - turn him back, genie, TURN HIM BACK!""  His livid face stood inches from the genie's, lines of sweat and strands of dark hair tracing the veins that stood white against his scarlet flesh.

For the first time, the genie appeared calm.  

""You know that's against the rules,"" he said levelly.

The youth's face contorted into a snarl of frustration. He swung at the genie's form, and almost lost his balance as his closed fist met incorporeal air.  The genie's form swirled like mist around the strike, and then coalesced perfectly in its wake.  The youth visibly attempted to contain himself, and stood motionless across from the genie in the ghostly glow of the lamp in the night.

""Genie, I want a lethal dose of morphine.""

This time, the genie made no complaint.

""As you wish.""",aubergineshinobi
"[WP]Genie:""No... It's not against the rules, but...""",ActuallyDevil,"""No, it's not against the rules, but I have never been asked to kill someone""
""Well... you're the Genie right? You just grant wishes, you don't have to think about it.
""I know that, but I'm not a killer. I can live with a lot of things... making someone a millionaire, someone's fantasies coming true, beauty, immortality... but I have never killed anyone.""
""But this is my wish. This is what I want.""
""You can wish for money, for women, for the secrets of the Universe.""
""I don't want any of it! I want him dead!""
""Why is that so important to you?""
""BECAUSE HE KILLED MY DAUGHTER!""

Silence surrounded Walter and Genie as they looked at each other. Pale, frightened and desperate.

 ""Can... you... do that... for me?"" 

Walter asked with a cracked whisper.

""Yes...""

The windows cracked, the glasses broke, the wind teared down the curtains, pulled up the bed sheets, pushed off the books and closed the door. A lighting stroke and the floor heated up as the wet body of Alberto Rodriguez laid on the floor.""

""Is he dead?""

Alberto coughed, still wearing the orange suit.

""Where am I? What happened?""

Walter, perplexed, looked at Genie.

""You were supposed to kill him! Not break him out of prison!""

""You want him dead, Walter. Now you can grant your own wish.""

Alberto, still out of breath, pulled himself up and stood up.

""Walter?""

Another lightning brighten up the room and Walter soon realized he was holding a pistol. He looked at Alberto, he saw the fear in his eyes, but he didn't care.

""She was 5 years old! You ruined my life when you decided to drive that car!""

""Walter, what are you doing? What is this? Walter it was an accident. I'm already paying for my mistake. I'm already in jail! For Christ sake! Walter!""

Walter hold firmly the gun, enraged, and aimed at Alberto's face.

""I lost everything!"" 
""WALTER!""

He shot. 

The life in Alberto was gone as his body danced falling down on the floor. Genie had his back turned. He looked at Walter, sad and disappointed. Walter cleaned the blood on his face and glanced around.

""Genie, can you make it look like nothing has happened here?""

""I'm sorry Walter. You have already used all your three wishes.""

As the sirens emerged and the police lights started to glow on the horizon, Walter saw Genie was gone. He looked at Alberto's body, the walls tinted red, and the pistol in his hand. He fell on his knees.

Walter hold the pistol once again.

Also I would really discourage you from bringing people back from the dead. Other than those three things you can ask for anything.""


Ahmed thought of his beloved Nadia, and just had to ask. ""So you could bring someone back from the dead if I wanted? That isn't against the rules?""


""No...it's not against the rules but...""


""I wish my beloved wife Nadia would return to life""


The Genie sighed ""Very well.""


Suddenly Nadia was there in her bridal dress. He immediately embraced her and tried not to think about the cold feeling in his chest when he did so.

Ahmed sat in the corner of his house, his eyes wide as he looked out for her. He had several long scars and bandages all over his arms and legs. Everything had seemed fine, at least outwardly at first, but then she had started getting worse. He held a dagger in one hand and the lamp in the other. He thanked god that he hadn't made any other wishes as He rubbed the lamp muttering ""the genie will fix it the genie will fix it."" as he appeared once more, but this time far less grand as he was in a smaller room.


""Please send her back!""


 ""well one could interpret that as killing her...""


""Please I'm begging you here.""


""Very well."" He said as she vanished from the doorway she was standing in. ""You have one wish left. What do you want?""


""Erase all traces from this world that this ever happened!""


""If that's what you want."" The genie said as he vanished. Ahmed Immediately fell asleep.


Ahmed awoke with a pounding headache and a map in his front pocket. He had spent everything trying to get the location of the genie but it was all worth it. Soon he would have his beloved back.",MisterAbbadon

""New year, new me"" I murmur as I make my final check of the ritual circle. A muted TV shows the countdown beginning. I lift the chalice to my lips. ""New year, new me"" I speak it like some secret mantra, and tip the dark liquid into my mouth. The taste is honey on my tongue, and blood in my throat. The ball drops, and I drop to the floor, writhing in the pain of the Change. Moments later I rise, and step out my door. All around the city, people celebrate the new year. The Last Year. I spread my dark wings, flex my razored claws. ""New year, new me."" I chuckle between sharklike teeth, and soar into the night.

""New year, new me"" a voice whispers in the dark. I blink groggily, dragging my self up from sleep. ""Goodbye, old me."" murmurs the shadowy figure above my bed. On instinct alone, I roll out of bed, the ritual dagger barely grazing my arm as it plunges into the spot where my heart was only seconds before. For a second, moonlight illuminates my attacker's face: an exact duplicate if my own. ""Every damn year, just like clockwork."" I say, as I reach for the axe under the bed. This time though, I'm ready.

Each of those people, when I killed them, I got their knowledge. It was a fool-proof plan. I will say, it worked for months. I hold the record now. If only I had killed that accountant. I’d thought about it, but then I decided it was unnecessary.

""Hello?"" Otto Greyson, engineer, appeared, followed by the resounding clanging noise of pots, pans, an engine, and a cat falling from a shelf behind him.

""I'm not really sure what you mean. It does what it says on the label. This item will give you the quality they think is best in them."" Otto waved an arm. Terribly. It was more like a jerky flailing. ""You victim obviously thought he was better at baking than shooting lasers out of his eyes.""

He had been looking forward to writing a huge email to everyone in that fucking email distribution list including that idiot Helga showing them they were going to be in the red this year. That would been the final nail in their coffin. Goddamn Helga and her Human UX Metrics and Analytics Engine (HUMANE) team were toast.

“I am too, sweetie. Not much we can do about it, though.”

Leann gave me a look of exasperation. 

“Look, nobody has gotten results back yet. Nobody has said anything about when the results come back or what happens to people based on their results.”

“But doesn’t that worry you?!?!” She exclaimed.

“Of course it does, but again, there is nothing we can do. Originally, I was planning to just not show up because I don’t believe they have the right to do this, but somehow, they’ve got the National Guard running around dragging people into the testing centers. The ACLU already has a bunch of lawsuits going, so, I’ll just join the class-action after the test rather than mess up our whole lives by running.”

“That’s not what worries me! What if they tell us we’re worthless? We chose not to have kids, so I guess we don’t have that to worry about but-”

I Interrupted, “And so what? Some bureaucratic formula based on arbitrary criteria declares that we’re worthless human beings? All this is, Leann, is a waste of time.”

“But,” she said quietly, “What if they… kill us. Or lock us up? Or separate us?”

“I’m pretty sure that would be illegal. That is when it is time to fight.”

Leann was quiet.

***
The next day, after we had woken up and gotten ready, the knock came at our door.

Leann had dressed up in a nice dress, but I was just wearing jeans, a t-shirt and a hoodie. Most of the folks I had seen in the news being taken to the test were dressed up, like they were going to church or something. Not me. Getting dressed up implies the event is respectable, which this isn’t, hench, the casual attire.

Leann opened the door and walked out, I stayed on the couch making sure my webcam was set up correctly.

I heard footsteps coming down the hall. A pair of burly soldiers entered the room.

“Lumley Westgate? We’re here to take you to your diagnostic appointment.”
Making sure the webcam was capturing the whole room, I said, “I’m not going anywhere, and you’re trespassing, please leave.”

With a sigh and eyeroll of utmost annoyance, the soldiers approached me, picked me up, and carried me out of the room.

“Put me down!” I yelled, calmly.

“For fuck’s sake, save it for the ACLU.” One soldier said.

With that, they carried me down the hallway like I was a rolled up carpet, past doors full of my staring neighbors and out to the street where the testing truck waited. They set me down at the back of the line were Leann waited.

She said nothing, but gave me a knowing look.

The line moved quickly, and each time, the burly soldiers picked me up and moved me forward. There were about five others who, like me, needed a pair of soldiers to move them through the line.

Leanne’s turn came, and she walked up the ramp into the governement truck.

“Good luck! I hope you meet a set of arbitrary criteria for determining if your life has worth!” I called after her, knowing she’d be rolling her eyes.

She was in the truck less than a minute. As the soldiers again carried me into the truck like a carpet, she told me, “I’ll wait here, it won’t take long.”

Into the truck we went. They deposited me into a chair that looked a bit like a new-age electric chair. A little headset came down on top of me head and I saw a little man in a lab coat walk forward. He adjusted some things on the headpiece and said “Alright, this won’t hurt at all, just sit still.”

I felt a tingling sensation in my brain and just like that, it was gone. Little Mr. Lab Coat walked back to me and pulled off the headset.

“Okay, you’re free to go.”

I walked out of the truck and down to Leanne, and we went home.

***
A month later, a notice came in the mail for each person with their test results.

Leann and I opened and read ours together.

&gt;Dear Mr. Westgate,

&gt;I am JUDG-3, the AI running the life-worth tests. Your test results are below.

&gt;After perusing your memories and life experiences, I have concluded that your life has no value. Though you are compassionate and respectful to your fellow citizens, you are not cooperative with the government nor do you willingly conform.

&gt;Since your life has no value to the government, the extent of your personal memories will be distilled into searchable information and sold to advertisers so that they can deliver more personalized advertisements to you. 

&gt;You may not be destined to be useful to the government, but we’ll ensure that you are inundated by consumerist urges so that you will not be dangerous to us either. 

&gt;Sincerely,

&gt;JUDG-3

Well, that sucks.

Leann was still engrossed by here, but when she finished, we traded letters. Hers was basically the opposite. She was cooperative and her information would be kept private.

“Well, great, I’m glad to hear my most personal moments will be available to advertisers.” I said.

“How could they think you’re worthless? I just don’t understand…” She trailed off.

“Look, sweetie, I’ve been saying it all along, it is a bunch of arbitrary criteria. I am the only one who can decide if my life has worth. Who cares what they think? I don’t. You shouldn’t.”

She was quiet.

“I’m more pissed off they sold my life to advertisers. I mean, I know we basically give information away when we use the internet, but at least we have a choice in that.”

“So… I guess you… what? Join the ACLU lawsuits?”

“Yeah, see, when the government does something wrong, the ACLU does their best to hold them accountable for it. Maybe they can stop the sale of the data, or something, I don’t know. At the very least, they’ll try to make sure it never happens again.”

***
Life goes on. Shit sucks, the government sucks, the economy sucks, I see the worst advertisements these days. Everything is so ridiculously personalized just for me.

The ACLU lawsuit drags on. The government is fighting it under the guise of ‘national security’ this and ‘budget concerns’ that. It so comical it might as well be fiction.

A friend of mine was told he was worthless, but unlike me, he had the opposite reaction. Now he isn’t himself anymore, just tries to conform to everything and be a good boy for the government. Other friends were told that their lives had value and they’ve been acting like they were just anointed the supreme ruler of everything. Acting like they’re better than folks like me. Needless to say, they’re not friends anymore.

But again, as I said, life sucks, but it goes on.

"[WP] Your government has just developed an algorithm to determine human worth, and everyone must be tested by the end of the month. You and your family's evaluation is tomorrow.",DustinLuhmann,"""Emma, have you studied your French and German?"" 

""Yes, daddy.""

""Cody, do you have your proposal for environmental sustainability ready to present in the morning?""

""Sure do, dad.""

I felt horrible for putting adult responsibilities on my 7 year old daughter and 12 year old son, but soon this would all be over. Recently, the government announced that any citizen that was not valued at $1.5 million or more would lose their citizenship and be deported. They determined this value by analyzing the expected domestic economic benefit each person was expected to contribute in the next 20 years. This program was implemented to help reduce the national debt and allow the United States to reclaim their title as the most powerful country in the world.

The key to increasing your net worth was to make yourself marketable-learning additional languages, being familiar with current issues and being able to propose solutions, possessing advanced reading, writing, and communication skills, and being willing to devote a good part of your life to improving the state of the country.

Having a year to prepare, my daughter Emma knew sign language and Spanish on a conversational level and was practicing basic French and German. She had spent 14 hours per day studying foreign language, politics, math, and science to increase her chances of keeping her citizenship.

Cody had practiced sports and music and had studied ecology for the past year, realizing one of these three avenues would be his best shot at passing his assessment.

With our evaluations just hours away, I tucked my children in to bed to ensure they were well rested before our big day. I shuffled over to the couch in the living room and slumped over, eyes heavy and welling up with tears as I mulled over the possible events of the following morning. Plenty of friends had already had their citizenship revoked, and I couldn't imagine my children being sent away from their home country so young. They were at a disadvantage because they still had several years until they could join the workforce.

""Daddy, we have to go!"" Emma screamed as she tugged on my shirt sleeve. I glanced over to my cell phone and saw that it was already 7:35 AM with our evaluation beginning at 8. I must have fallen asleep on the couch and been there all night. Sliding my feet into my slippers and snatching my car keys off the counter, I loaded my children into the car and sped to the city hall for our evaluations. I wished my children luck as they were pulled into separate rooms and waited for my name to be called for my evaluation.

Five minutes later, a woman wearing kitten heels and a knee length fitted skirt approached me and led me to a small office. There, she instructed me to complete an IQ test and wait for a doctor to meet with me. I was confident in my intellectual abilities and was unconcerned with the results of my test. However, things took a turn when the doctor met with me. 

""Mr. Remming, I see that you are in need of a knee replacement, is this correct?"" I nodded, wondering where this was going. ""The problem with a surgery like this is that you will have a slow recovery, lose wages, and you could have complications after the surgery.""

""Sir, I'm a hard worker. I'm confident that I will be able to return to work in a timely manner. I've been at the same job for 15 years and always receive high praises from my employer. I'm sure you will be impressed with my other tests and my ability to contribute to this nation.""

""I'm sure that's so, but I only perform the physical evaluations. The final say is not up to me.""

My jaw clenched and I glanced down at the floor. I never thought a knee replacement would harm my long term worth, but this doctor seemed to suggest otherwise. 

I was sent off to perform a few other tests-those that challenged me physically, those that tested by ability to learn and retain information in a short time span, and those that analyzed my past work performance. 

After 3 hours of testing, I was ushered into a waiting room where my children were already waiting for me. The receptionist that I spoke to earlier instructed me to return the following day at 8 AM for our results. 

Back at home, Emma and Cody told me all about their evaluations-the skills they performed, the questions they answered, and the written examinations they had to complete. Both were nervous to hear their results, but thanked me for helping them prepare for the assessment. 

The following morning, I showed up to the test site early with my children so that I could put this all behind us. A different receptionist than the one I had talked to the morning before pulled us into a conference room where a man sat with three manilla folders spread in front of him. 

""I'm sure you're eager to learn your fate, so I will jump right into your results. Emma shows real promise as a translator. She seems to pick up on new languages quickly, has excellent communication skills for a girl her age, and follows instruction well. She is expected to reach a value of $2.3 million in the next 20 years. Her citizenship is safe for the time being and she is up for reevaluation on her 18th birthday.""

I smiled at my little girl and squeezed her hand, feeling relieved that she was guaranteed 11 more years at home with me. 

""Cody also shows quite a bit of promise. His physical abilities are far greater than average for 12 year old boys. I am confident that he will make a fine basketball player and benefit our country's economy in the future by increasing ticket sales. His expected value is $18.6 million by the time he is 32, however he will be reevaluated on his 18th birthday to ensure that he is still a safe bet.""

A warm rush of happiness washed over me. My children and I could finally go back to or normal lives.

""Mr. Remming, we do have some unfortunate news, however. You showed up to your evaluation with unkempt hair and you were wearing slippers. You did not appear as professional as we would have hoped. Your knee is likely to hinder your work performance, and sales for your current place of employment are lower than average. Despite positive reviews from your managers, the company is likely to downsize and your physical issues are likely to put you up for termination. Other companies are not likely to hire you due to your limited physical ability and we have many promising prospects entering the work force in the next two years. I'm sorry, but your value is only expected to reach $0.9 million in the next 20 years, which is too low to keep your citizenship. We have arranged travel plans for you to be relocated. Your children will be under the guardianship of an adult whose children did not pass their evaluations. They will remain with this guardian until their 18th birthdays unless you can pass a follow up evaluation in five years. We do wish you the best.""

I screamed out in horror, pulling my children into me, both of which were sobbing. It was cruel to take my children from me. I had been so hard on them lately so that they could pass their evaluations, and now I would not have a chance to make it up to them. ""I'm sorry,"" I cried. ""I'm so so sorry. Be good and know that I love you.""

That was the last time I saw my children. They were whisked away and within two hours I was on a train heading toward the rest of my life. I pulled their pictures out of my wallet and held them against my heart, praying that they would never face the same fate as me.  ",justhisfriend

"[WP] It's 2030 and more and more people are believing Elon Musk's theory of the world being a computer simulation. One day, Elon calls you out as the creator of the simulation.",JasonHolloway,"I always thought this world flawed. It’s cyclical redundant nature never made sense outside of a flawed algorithm. The more intelligent man kind became, the more death it prevented. The more death it prevented, the more chaos it created. Taking the most minor notes in history, we see that the more creative we got at saving life, the more creative we became at taking it. Everything always balanced out in its own twisted way, yet we keep moving forward, only to stand still.
Then a man came fourth with the only solution that would make sense. Elon Musk said the world was a computer simulation. Holy shit. NOW it all makes sense. What programmer would be intelligent enough to create an equation yielding infinitely different answers? Impossible. At least it seems. Musk held a convention speaking on the matter.
As he spoke, he took the occasional gaze at an audience member, just to show his engagement with the crowd. Finally his eyes fixed on me and locked on almost as if fixed in a trance. 
He muttered: “the creator.” 
My ear drums rang and my body went cold, as everyone turned their attention on me. The doors shut and everyone fell simultaneously. I didn’t have to check everyones pulse to know that they were dead. My firewall had finally failed, and it was time to come back to reality. 
If ever my A.I. developed to the point where I was discovered, the programs would be terminated, and my memory would be returned. And if you’re reading this, then you know that I have failed. You were created so that I would find a solution to create peace. We know that there is a solution, we just haven’t found it. 
But I know that you feel. There are emotions embedded in you, so how could I terminate the program? For what really defines life, but emotion? Maybe you will stumble across this and find your own solution? There’s a 1 in 10^1,000,000,000,000 of that happening. Which is not enough for me to justify staying and observing your actions.
More simulations will be ran. And more failures will be made. But I write this hoping that maybe, just maybe, you will succeed. If not, I apologize for creating you, just to be destroyed. You are not the first failure. Every simulation is ran from beginning (creation of stars and constellations) to end (global warfare). Every star you see, is a failure. You will never find other life. You are not programed to. But I assure you, every planet had held life. I am sorry.

God, hmph. Last night I wouldn’t eat mom’s spinach. Today I’m everyone’s savior.

I have no clue why, but some man—some suit who’s all about *more more more*—has proclaimed me the creator of the virtual universe we’re all stuck in. He says I created this simulation to *study* us. To *learn* from us.

Am I not part of *us?*

I mean, sure. I’m better with computers than most. And maybe, on occasion, I’ve found I know things I shouldn’t. Things most people consider secrets of the world.

But if I really *am* the creator of the universe, wouldn’t I know?

…

No, I wouldn’t.

I’d block it from my mind so I could get the best, most unbiased results possible.

*Oh my god.*

***

Because I found out, I’m jerked awake. Downstairs, mom is shouting my name, telling me dinner is ready. It’s stew. I hate stew.

Smacking drool off my face, I climb out my pod and wander over to the other side of the room. The wall is covered completely in screens. Leaning forward, I examine the middlemost one.

The simulation, as always, fell apart because Prophet Zero was born. The one enemy it seems I'm destined to tango with until the end of time.

I drag the world to the recycle box and drop it in. Even though it failed, hitting delete pains my heart, for this is the farthest I’ve seen my budding colony grow.

As my mom calls me again, I drag myself over to the door, frazzled and trying to come up with a way to combat the existence of Prophet Zero.

And, as always, I’m left with that same burning question.

To observe how this species that calls themselves the homo sapiens progress across the age. To watch them grow, flourish. Or perhaps to annihilate themselves.

I've been called many names. God. Zeus. Jehovah. Vishnu. All because I could perform miracles when they were actually codes typed into a console. I was no God. I am merely a researcher. But those were the past. When my creations were still ignorant, primitive.

Much has changed recently.

Little did I expect that they would become increasingly self-aware. To know that the lives that they're living could be the product of another. A simulation, as they call it. I had expected that it would take centuries more before they begin to suspect, but I was mistaken.

This man. This person who calls himself Elon Musk. He was one of the very first to suspect. It seems that he has the uncanny ability to influence my creation on a large scale. Space travel. Harnessing energy. And now, claiming that he has finally found proof that this life is a simulation.

I stand in the crowd as I watch him speak. Brimming with excitement. His speeches are full of energy, conviction. They can stir you up in ways you never imagined possible. And as he broaches the subject, the crowd falls silent.

""For far too long I have suspected that our world was simulated,"" he begins, letting us hang on to every word. ""I have worked tirelessly to find proof of this, and I am proud to say that not only have I found the proof, I have also found the simulation's creator!""

A murmur spreads among the crowd as he said this. My heart begin to beat anxiously.

""This man, many have joked before that he is immortal,"" he continues. ""Ironically, it turns out that people are indeed right. And I am happy to say that he is in fact here with us tonight!""

I felt blood rising to my cheeks as he suddenly turns to me when he said that, and the crowd follows his gaze. Gasps and whispers. I look at Elon, flustered. He is indeed different than them all.

There is only a triumphant smile on his face. ""May we all give our hands to Mr Keanu Reeves, please.""

I turn around to react, but it was too late. With a single kick, I was sent tumbling into his machination and into a pitch darkness.

Suddenly, I woke up. My vision was blurry, all I knew was I was outside.

I touched the ground - grass. I must've survived his machine. As I slowly rise, I realize something very wrong with what's around me.

""Well, this is a situation.""

As I looked at the field below me, I noticed something off about the scenery - well, more specifically, the lack of one. In the distance was a small grouping of them. I should probably head there first.

Where skyscrapers stood, I saw only huts.

""So much for swinging from place to place.""

With a sigh of frustration, I begin walking. This is going to take a while.

### A Few Hours Later...

As I walked over the next hill, I saw it - the small settlement I had seen from a distance.

I kicked into a jog as I hastily moved over to the village. I walked up to the first man I saw, dressed in what seemed like a messy cloth shirt and a grimy pair of canvas pants. 

He just stared at me like I was crazy.

""So, some kinda reenactment going on here?"" I quipped.

He continued to stare at me, not saying a single word.

We sat in awkward silence, so I peeled back my mask.

He took a deep breath, and finally said something.

""What on God's green Earth are you wearing?""

I look down at my suit.

""It's called spandex.""

I pull the suit away from my skin and snap it. Ouch.

He looks at me for a bit longer, then walks back into his house.

I look around a bit, before realizing half the town was staring at me. Women were dressed in nice black dresses, with some dragging the ground. It wasn't a moment afterwards the farmer came out with a bible and a noose. The other villagers began to surround me.

Desperately, I looked for a structure tall enough to grapple. I found nothing.

I searched and searched, but they finally captured me. I was knocked out again.

When I awoke, I was in a jail cell. Outside stood a minister of some sorts. He approached the cage.

""Son,"" he began, ""you stand accused of witchcraft. I'm here to hear your pleas, and your confessions.""

Suddenly, my mind flicked back to high school history - the Salem trials. This is gonna be a doozy.

"[PM] Give me a Medieval, Fantasy, Sci-fi, or Superhero Prompt (or a combination of the above)",LoneSeeker777,"With one last look over my map, I realized something terrible.

I was lost.

Hauling the most notorious criminal in the entire hold behind me, I stopped and sat to ponder exactly what I did to deserve this moment in time.

The silence didn't last long.

""Soooo..."" the hooded figure said, ""can you take this hood off now? Since we're not moving and all.""

""You know I can't do that,"" I responded, ""everybody knows you kill anyone who's seen your face.""

""Why do you think I want you to take it off?"" He hissed.

I just shook my head and begun building a campfire. It was getting late and I had to eat. I figured, it wouldn't be long before a convoy passed through and helped to show me the way back.

I wandered off to hunt for dinner. It took me about an hour, but I brought back a pheasant and begun plucking it.

""It's cold over here,"" the criminal whined. ""I thought your objective was to get me there *alive*.""

I had finished plucking the pheasant and constructing the spit, so I made my way towards the cart, grabbing a blanket and tossing it on his lap.

""There ya go,"" I said frustratedly. ""I suppose you'll want food, too?""

""*Noooooo,*"" He announced rather loudly. ""I think I'd rather *starve*.""

I smiled a bit, before waltzing over and cooking the pheasant. A few hours later, I ripped off a leg and threw it on his lap.

He devoured it like a hungry animal.

I ate my share and decided to call it a night. I bundled up and slept until morning.

---

When I awoke, I had felt something was off. I looked behind me. The gate was open, and one of my horses had gone missing. The criminal was gone.

In a panic, I grabbed my other horse and made for the closest settlement, just over the hill.

I rode fast and furiously. It took me only minutes to get into town.

Once I got there, I realized my rather massive error. The inn was flying the banner of House Accord. Hastily, I slung my blanket around me, providing a shroud to cover the House Redoran insignia on my armor.

Searching around, I saw my other horse was parked outside that very same inn. I approached to investigate.

I walked up to the inn and dismounted. I was quickly rounded up by a guard.

""No weapons da in,"" he stated calmly yet firmly. before putting his arms in front of him, palms facing up. ""Leave 'em wif me, you can pick 'em up on yer way out.""

I dejectedly agreed. No reason getting all high-and-mighty now.

Wandering in slowly, I analyzed the room. Everything seemed to be in order. At one of the tables, a man thoroughly enthralled by his food looked up and immediately looked down again. As he shifted, I heard the clank of chains.

I quickly made my way over to him. He threw his soup bowl into the air as the hot liquid deflected off my leather shoulder-guards and helmet.

A small tussle between him and I ensued, before I wrestled control of him. The guard burst in moments later.

""What's goin' on 'ere?"" It was the guard from moments ago.

I stood up, the criminal once again bound.

""This man is a mass murderer, thief, and rapist. I'm taking him to a hanging.""

The captain of the guard steps in.

""An to you, that means you can wreck up da place?""

I look around at the soup-stained ground, smashed up chair, then at my feet dejectedly.

""My apologies."" I turn to the inn-keep. ""How much will I owe you for damages?""

The inn-keep slowly raises his head from his hiding spot behind the counter.

""T-twenty five gold pieces for the chair,"" he nervously states.

I open up my coin purse and deposit the amount requested on the table before beginning to escort the prisoner out.

The guardsmen form a wall between me and the door.

""You ain't goin nowhere till we know who you are,"" one of them states. ""Where ya takin that pris'ner?""

I announce plainly and with a mild amount of frustration, ""I'm taking him to High Meridith for his execution.""

The guardsmen shift uncomfortably.

""Thas House Redoran territory, it is. You one of 'em?""

Shit. Think fast.

""Heavens, no,"" I blurt out nervously. ""I'm just a mercenary turning in a bounty.""

The guard eases up a bit.

""Awrite,"" the captain continues. ""But we ain't want no more trouble. You come back, you be'er be well-behaved.""

The guard hands me back my blade.

I walk a few paces, before I stop and turn around.

""Soooo, where exactly *is* High Meridith from here?""

*Fuck, that's the fourth village.*

Ever since I managed to obliterate that demon attempting to mind-rape me, this shit has been happening more and more frequently. It's less like he was obliterated, and more like we melded together - and I just got lucky enough to be the dom. 

I knew who it was - Azael, Commander of Lucifer's Fourth Army. It had been a very powerful demon, one close enough to the top to have Lucifer's affection - even adopted status. Sure, it wasn't as important to Lucy as Lilith was, but it was up there.

When I woke up for the first time, I knew instantly something was different. Aside from the memories and thoughts of the demon, I knew I had powers. But it would be easiest to tell this story from the beginning.

---

###Seven Months Earlier...

I had arrived home after a hard day in the field neighboring my cottage - it was hard work, but honest work. As the door creaked open, something felt off. I lit my lantern and explored the room, to find everything in place, but there was still that feeling of uncleanliness. I saw something move out of the corner of my eye before everything went dark.

Suddenly, I was in a room with no distinct features, aside from a large view-port. Through it, I could see my cottage. Not like a painting, but like I had been trapped within myself, someone else controlling me, as I was forced to watch. Alarmed, I pounded on the walls.

I checked back. Each hit caused whoever was controlling me to pause for a moment. So I kept banging. I banged against the walls until my hands were bloodied. Once I couldn't swing anymore, I bashed it with my shoulder. With every hit, I saw myself collapse a bit more. With one final act of defiance, I move to the far wall, get a push-off towards the viewport, and smash myself straight into it.

Suddenly, I had awoken on the floor. My head was pounding - partly because of the concussive force I caused myself, but mainly due to the flood of knowledge assaulting me. Even though I knew what I went through was in no way normal, I wasn't alarmed... Because I had the answers to every question I asked myself.

*What the hell happened?*

*You were possessed by a demon.*

*Why am I fine?*

*Because you beat him.*

As I made myself some soup, I sat for a second before my mind started to tingle - like the part before you've gotten drunk but long after being buzzed. Suddenly, I was somewhere else - Grommville, a small settlement two days' ride north of here.

It was daytime - which seemed impossible at the time, since I had been making dinner just moments ago - when suddenly a cart broke free of a warhorse and sent an explosive payload straight into the inn at the bottom of the hill. I watched each moment in vivid detail before snapping out in a cold sweat. I thought I had been hallucinating.

The next morning, I began my ride into town, mainly out of habit. I knew there was a faster way. I waited about twenty minutes or so before I got fed up. I dismounted my horse and slapped its rear - I knew he would return to my cottage stables anyways.

In an instant, a shroud formed around me. With the grace of a dancer, I flew over hills and grassy knolls. I flowed through cracks in walls, around fence pillars. It was thrilling. As I reached the outskirts of town, I touched the ground with my feet and watched the smoke dissipate.

It's been several fortnights since my last visit to Grommville. I traveled to the center of town, to the inn. As I walked up to the door, I noticed something - a military cart and warhorse in the inn's stables.

Suddenly, I knew what I had to do. I sneakily walked to the back of the convoy and analyze it. The leather strap was almost worn through on the gate.

I reached down and grabbed the leather binding from my shoe and tied it around the existing bind.

I stuck around for a while, as I watched the convoy mount up and leave town without incident.

It was only then I realized - I never panicked. This weird shit had been happening all day, but I wasn't freaking out, and I had no clue why. Any mortal man would have broken into a cold sweat just *seeing* his premonition come to fruition, but not me.

I was terrified. Not at what I could do, but at the fact that I didn't find it the least bit odd.

I flew back to my cottage with haste and let my neighbor know I'd be taking the rest of the day off from work.

---

### Six Months Later...

I had become the local hero. After the initial warhorse incident, more premonitions came, warning me of burning buildings, robberies, sadistic murderers, and even paranormal events.

With every premonition, I was always there to stop it. Eventually the guard took notice, who gave me an honorary title. The mystics eventually chimed in, granting me a status within their organization as a Gifted One. But it wasn't until last month I discovered how profitable being a hero could be.

I had single-handedly saved an entire battalion of soldiers from being wiped out on the battlefield. I fought valiantly, going from skirmish to skirmish upon a black cloud, tearing up enemies left and right. They called me the Black Death. Even their swords couldn't stop me.

No matter how sizable the chunk, or how deep the wound, it couldn't keep me down. Almost in an instant, my wounds had healed.

We had only lost 3 soldiers. 

They lost 7000.

When I was summoned to the king, the fear in the room was palpable. Nobody knew what to expect. It wasn't until the company commander marched in, shouting high praise of me, did everybody collectively let out their sighs of relief.

A celebration ensued. At some point during the party, I had been summoned to the king for a private hearing. He learned of my living situation, and told me it was unacceptable that a war hero live in squalor.

That very same week, a crew of men came to my hut and begun construction of a house the size of a military barracks in its place. It would take a while, but the new living arrangement would be a great change of pace. Until then, the king lent me a spot in his commander's quarters.

---

### Two Weeks Later...

I had been sitting at home, enjoying some soup, when suddenly another premonition came - a horde of wolves slaughtered a whole town.

It had been a while since my last premonition, but I was ready. I hopped over to Raerdon, where the event occurred, to find I was too late. Never in the past have my premonitions been this delayed. It wasn't until the wolves returned that I realized what was going on. This was revenge for killing Azael. The wolves bounded in with red eyes, but each fell to my blade. Only, there were none to recognize me this time. Nobody had been left alive.

I flew to the king's chamber as fast as possible and told him what had happened. We formulated a plot - I would train a garrison of men to my standards, and they would help defend towns.

After my garrison arrived in the courtyard, training began immediately. I showed them the power and speed of what they would be fighting. If I hadn't been using a wooden blade, it would have been a slaughterfest. I held training sessions every day, with the hopes of improvement.

Over the course of two weeks, I had seen much improvement. Many men are now managing to block my shots, with my best men even going as far as to predict my location before striking.

In this time, two other premonitions had come and gone before I had any time to react. I knew getting this garrison trained was my top priority.

---

### Today...

Progress is slow, but with time, I'm hoping these men will be the defense we desperately need against these demonic attacks. In a month or so, I should be ready to send out my best men to defend the nearest settlements. I can only hope it's not too late by then.

My mind collapsed into a haze. I was in a village... The fourth premonition in two weeks.

[WP] It’s not that God works in mysterious ways. He just has severe social anxiety.,LordFirebeard,"“He’s in the throne room”. As Elias said this, he nervously flicked the tip of his wing. If anyone was going to be put to the task of disturbing God in his throne room, it was going to be him. 

“So, what?”, said Antoine, “…someone needs to let him know what is happening right now, he has to intervene before it’s too late”

“Don’t be a bitch!”, yelled one of the Cherub’s down at Elias, which caused him to scowl in the direction of the comment and Antoine, as well as all the others cherub’s hovering around the flat screen, to snicker mischievously. 

“Antoine, you know he doesn’t like to be disturbed when he’s in the throne room, and you saw how he was at the Morning meal he’s clearly in one of his moods”

“So? Are you just going to let catastrophe happen because he’s in one of his moods? How do you think he’s going to feel about that once he’s out of this mood?”—Elias looked away remorsefully, before responding, “...Why can’t Miguel do it? He already doesn’t like him”. 

Antoine scowled, “Everyone in favor of having Elias tell him raise your wing?”
Every wing in the room went up. Antoine scowled at everyone in the room. 

“Fine, I’ll do it, but this is the last time”.

Antoine looked over the closed doors that led into the throne room, in just a few glides he was hovering outside of the door, nervously looking down at the handle. He looked behind at the other Cherubs, only to find everyone looking back at him and silently urging him forward. He turned back towards the door and gently lowered himself to the soft and moist surface of the cloud, preparing himself to reach out for the handle.

He pressed his hand down on the golden inlaid knob, and peered through the door cautiously, he couldn’t see or hear anything behind the door except the large throne in the middle of the room. Elias could hear a few snickers behind him as he eased his way in threw the door and gently closed it behind him, he took a deep breath as he heard the latch click shut.

The throne room was completely silent. Elias could hear his breathing echoing off of the surrounding walls, or so it felt.

After what felt like an eternity, Elias saw God's hand appear from the throne, “Come my child”.

Elias, still breathing deeply, began to walk forward, his wings tucked tightly behind his back.

He moved around the throne, being sure to avert his eyes downward, and bowed his head and he is knelt deeply.
“My Lord, my Savior, and my Father… I have troubling news regarding Earth, others and myself felt you…”

“…Elias”- interrupted God, “my sweet Elias, kneel no longer, come rest your head upon my lap”. 

Elias, slightly eased by God’s kind gesture, stood up and began walking over to the throne. God’s hands were outstretched and beckoning him closer, perhaps, Elias thought, his mood has changed since this morning. Elias bent slightly to lower his head down onto God’s lap, as he rested his head, God brought his hand to his hair and caressed it gently. Elias find this very reassuring, and by this time he was sure that his mood had passed.

“Elias, have I ever told you, that you are the kindest amongst the Cherubs?”

Elias couldn’t help but curl the tips of his wings, and blush, “…my child, look at me now...”

Elias, still blushing from his praise, looked into the Lord’s eyes. 

“What have I told you about coming to the throne room when the doors are closed?”, Elias’ wings quickly retreated into his back, “…but Sir, it’s Earth, the humans, they are in trouble…”

“Cease!”, thunder flared, and the floors to the room rumbled, “Did you, or did you not, see my Twitter post about coming into my throne room when the doors are closed?”

Elias’, with his head looking down at the floor, muttered feebly, “I saw it.”

“And what did it say?”

Elias began to repeat the tweet verbatim, “No one is to come into the throne room when the door is closed under any circumstance, including, when a major catastrophe is about to strike Earth”.

God, now past the point of relaxation and greatly irritated by this fact, put his hand to his hand and looked away disappointedly. 

“Yes, Elias, that is what I said... you have now ruined my relaxation, and flustered my Godly nerves, you know how such intrusions vex me, bring me my medicine immediately”.

 Elias, despondent, walked over to the holy cabinet and opened it to find the Clonazepam. He brought the bottle over to the Lord, who quickly popped the top off and chugged the whole bottle, Godly nerves require a Godly dose.

“Now, Elias, the damage you have done cannot be undone, leave me to my throne, and next time heed my posts carefully or there will be hell to pay”, with this God snapped his fingers, and Elias found himself plopped in front of the closed doors of the throne room. 

Before he could even begin dusting off his wings the other Cherubs burst into great fits of laughter, patting themselves on the back, and rolling around on the floor.
“Elias...” …Antoine said, between fits of explosive laughter, “…you are too easy…”

“Shut up Antoine”, Elias said as he brushed himself off, “this is the last time I listen to you guys, I promise you that!”. 

Antoine, chuckling as he walked over to Elias, while the others struggled to regain themselves, put his hand on Elias' wing. “Oh come on buddy, don’t be such a downer, he’ll get over it”. Elias scowled at him and shrugged his hand off, “What happened anyways?” he said as he walked over to the TV. 
“He won.”
“He… what?”, Elias said incredulously, not willing to believe the news.

“Yeah, I know.."", said Antoine, ""we all can't believe it either, Trump won the election…”All of the other Cherubs regained themselves. the laughter slowly began  fading from the room. 

Elias looked at him in disbelief... “Holy Shit.”


*******************************************************

“Holy shit”, said Rebecca. She stared at her flat-screen shocked and slowly becominf upset, but also not fully ready  to believe that Trump had won.

“How could we let this happen?!” She turned to Justin, who didn’t care to much for politics, he turned to her not wanting to piss her off but also not sure what to say, “I mean…”, Jessica continued, “…he’s Trump, he’s going to destroy our country!”
Justin, realizing, he needed to say something quick, scratched the back of his neck, “…Er… who knows honey…I mean, you know God works in mysterious ways…”

[WP] It’s not that God works in mysterious ways. He just has severe social anxiety.,LordFirebeard,"Noah fell to his knees before me, and put a hand up to shield his eyes.

“Almighty,” Noah said. “For what reason have you honored me with this visit?”

“You can stand up,” I told him. “Really, there’s no need for any of… that.” I waved a hand in his direction. Noah was great. Always ready to start groveling. But sometimes we needed to move past that and get down to business.

“Of course, your Holiness.” Noah stood, still keeping his hand over his eyes.

“You can drop the titles as well, Noah. We’ve known each other long enough by now.”

“As you wish.” He bit his lip to prevent from ending with the formality once more. “Apologies. It’s a habit.”

“Yes, I’ve noticed that in your prayers.” I cleared my throat. “It’s been hard to miss. You are one of the only people who prays, these days.”

“Ah,” Noah said. “I had wondered if that was the case. People certainly don’t seem interested in worshipping publicly, at least.”

“Yeah, it’s a problem in private, as well.” I frowned at him. “Are you okay? Why aren’t you looking at me?”

“I don’t mean to be rude,” Noah said from behind his palm. “But the light surrounding you is quite blinding.”

Oh. Right. I forgot that the celestial glow hurt the eyes of mortals. “My bad.” The glow faded until it was just a soft golden aura emanating an inch away from my physical form. “Is that better?”

Noah lowered his hand. “Yes. Thank you, Holiness.” His eyes widened. “Oh – uh – sorry. I forgot.”

“It’s okay.”

“You look well,” he supplied. “This is a different form than the last one I saw you in.”

I shrugged. “I like to mix it up. A full eternity to change your image will make you try some adventurous things.”

“Indeed,” Noah said politely, his face remaining blank. Did he not like my form? I fought back the urge to read his thoughts. This was not what I had come for.

“May I ask what you have come for?” Noah asked. I started, then relaxed as I looked back into his kind brown eyes.

“Yes.” I shifted back and forth on the legs of my form. Then again, as I tried to figure out if I had made one leg longer than the other. “You might want to start building a boat.”

Noah raised an eyebrow. “A boat?”

“A big boat,” I clarified. “Huge. Like…” I looked around. “Bigger than your house. Actually, maybe use your house to build the boat? That could be a good starting place.”

“Okay,” Noah said slowly. “Sure, I will, I mean – whatever you say, as always.” He paused. “May I ask why?”

“Yes.” I let out a breath I didn’t actually need, then drew myself up so that my form was straight and tall. “I am planning on creating a flood.”

“A flood,” Noah repeated.

“It will probably be called The Flood,” I added. “It’s going to be bigger than any flood you’ve had. And probably bigger than any floods to follow.”

“Sounds good.” Noah nodded. “But – with all respect, of course – may I ask why?”

I knew the question was coming. But that didn’t make it any less awkward. I looked down at my feet. “I want to put an end to all people,” I started, reciting what I had practiced earlier. ”For the world is filled with violence because of them.”

“Really?” Noah sounded bewildered. I didn’t blame him. “I knew it was bad, but I didn’t think –“

“Well, it is,” I interrupted.

“But you – want to save – me?”

“And your family,” I clarified. “And some… other things. I haven’t quite decided.”

“Okay,” Noah said slowly, again. “Why is that?”

“Because.” I looked around the room, the walls, the ceiling, anywhere but directly at Noah. “You and your family are good.” And I like you guys a lot, I added silently.

“And the rest of the families are not?”

“Yes,” I said as firmly as I could. He stood there in silence, watching me shuffle my feet, scuffing my toe along the floor to rub out a smudge that didn’t exist.

I wanted to tell him more. Perhaps at a later date.

It wasn’t so much that the people I’d created were evil. There were just… too many of them. And that was getting way, way awkward for me. ",LinneaGregg

[WP] It’s not that God works in mysterious ways. He just has severe social anxiety.,LordFirebeard,"God has a way of interacting with humans that seems alien without the proper context. Indeed, over a thousand years have passed since last she interfered with the world or entered a dream. So one might presume that she is dead, or we abandoned. Of course, this is not the case.

There are those shy people who, alone with a trusted friend, become more expressive and energetic than the most charismatic person with a spotlight. But few things are more dreadful than the attention of many. To such a person, a warm welcome by all into the crowd is as humiliating as wrinkled noses and turned backs. Similarly, God effortlessly appears to individual people when faith in her is weakest. But when so many people remember, by praising the Lord openly or silently keeping God in their hearts, she is thoroughly paralyzed.

As God matured, humans emerged on their little planet in a flash, diffusing across its surface along with their languages and superstitions. To her, we were (and are) little more than a colony of epidermic mites, crawling around inside her unnoticed until we hit the right nerve. We hit that nerve with our intelligence traits. Speaking to us is God's way of satisfying the itch that followed.

In some ways, she is still trying to understand our quirks, and reconcile her strange, indecipherable morality with our own.

Long ago, humans spoke one tongue and lived in one community. These ancient people, through love and cooperation, came to dominate their environment in an era of peace.

God, unable to express her uneasiness with a being who could fearlessly engage with many minds at once, overlaid a part of herself onto them. What she gave them was a desire for intimacy. From this came a desire for secrecy, a desire for a personal home, and monogamy. Thus, though they still loved one another, they did so now as neighbors. Their new desire for seclusion conflicted with their innate desire to socialize, and, over generations, this community fractured. Each shard developing its own language, and the diaspora fell into conflict with itself.

Although we still carry a part of God as before, humanity coalesced into a single community with a single language once more. Her first and only attempt to mold the human profile into a more solitary, approachable form was an utter failure. This is not a testament to God's weakness, but rather humankind's resilience.

It is therefore understandable that, with trillions of believers in the universe, God is hesitant to show herself.",the_understater

[WP] It’s not that God works in mysterious ways. He just has severe social anxiety.,LordFirebeard,"Every minute of every hour of every day, a million voices chatter in my head like squawking pigeons. I try my hardest to block them out. But it’s like ignoring an insistent child—they’ll make themselves heard no matter what.

I feel bad for them. They were an accident, a simple slip of the finger, and now they've grown into beings that can sustain themselves, and in some ways, even communicate with me.

*Me*, the parent they'll never know.

I’ve heard their problems and their secrets and their lies and their failures. I want so dearly to help, but the past has taught me there’s two sides to every cause, and if both think they're right, intervening only shows bias.

So I sit in the shadows and watch even though I want to talk, to tell them I *am* their creator and I *do* love each and every one of them.

Alas, I cannnot bring myself to it. Even the mere thought chokes me up, a thousand feathers swelling in my throat as I cough out a dry, unintelligent wheeze.

I suppose I'll watch them grow until the end of time, my voice stifled by fear.",LonghandWriter

""Oh I know you did honey,"" his mother said softly as she gently rubbed his back.

""I just don't understand what I did wrong, I tried so many different things, I tried to be whatever they wanted me to be and they still hated me,"" he sniffed a large gob of snot back into his nose and wiped the rest away with the back of his sleeve.

""How could they know what they wanted from you if they didn't know what they wanted from themselves?"" she asked.

""But that's why I stopped doing things for them! I couldn't visit them anymore because I would never know what they would do! You remember when they tried to kill me,"" he looked down at his hands and shuddered.

""But I guess that's also the beauty of them right?""

He nodded slowly and wiped the tears away from his cheeks.

""Here let me help you throw this away and when your father gets home we will go out for ice cream,"" she said with a smile.

That brought a small smile to his face, ""I'd like that, thanks mom.""

She hopped off of the bed and picked up the blackened orb that used to be Earth.  It was still warm from the nuclear war, she tossed it into the garbage bin and wiped her hands on her apron.  

""If you want we can get you a new World this weekend.""

I let myself get carried over to the bar, expecting to see the usual waiter; a burly man in his 40s wearing the usual faded suit jacket and dark jeans. As I look up, my breath is plucked from my lungs. I aren't greeted by the thinning blond hair and piercing blue eyes I expected, but a girl. Soft hair, brown and untamed cascaded over her shoulders on to the pristine white shirt and onto her bust. Everything seems to be in slow motion as my eyes trace every contour and shape of her body in detail. Unlike me, or any of the other customers, who's hands are littered with small flecks of white, which was the cost of keeping face in today's society, she was completely pure. From her head to her toes, not a single blemish on her silk skin. She is the definition of beautiful. Her delicate, porcelain hands clasped together in front of that short black dress, which is formal but still very attractive. Green eyes flicked up with a look of coy and curiosity as a faint smile worked it's way onto her soft peach lips. I blush. Her voice resonated into my mind, cutting off my thought. Matching her appearance, her words are softly spoken and sweet. The type of voice that reminds you of home.

""Hi, my name's Mei. What are you ordering today, sir"" she asks with enthusiasm.
""Uh... a.."" I fumble through my speech like a nervous child on his first day of school ""A number 7 please"" I falter for a moment after realizing my mistake. There is no number 7 on the menu. 

As soon as the words leave me, her eyes narrow. The persona of before has left her and now, all I can think of is danger. She asks me to follow her in a quick and monotone voice. That voice reminded me of a killer. Her speech and her walking pattern, as she walks through to a separate room is ruthless and efficient. No wasted movement. I follow nervously, almost tripping over myself and take a seat opposite her in the exquisitely decorated room I now find myself in. A square table, wooden and stained dark, separates us.

""So Mr.. Hudson. You requested a model 23, complete organ transplants. You've transferred 14 million, half of the payment and were ready to begin.""

I don't understand. I'm panicking. Did she just say organ transplant? I desperately try to think of a way out of this situation but I'm distracted by the sight of Mei taking her formal shirt off to reveal a very thin, white top underneath. She looks so damn perfect. I've gained momentary relief from my panic just by the mere sight of her. That's when the real Mr Hudson walks in. He is very old and withered, covered in long, deep scars, spiralling across his body. He must be about 80, and he speaks with a dry, raspy voice.

""I'm here to see Mei"" 

he says almost innocently. Mei walks to meet him and that's when I see it. A huge, deep purple scar under the thin shirt she's wearing, swimming from the top of her neck all the way down to the small of her back, and then way past where I can see. She approaches him calmly whispers something in his ear. He raises and eyebrow and they both smile. My sense of danger kicks in again, and adrenaline starts to course through my veins. I get it now.

""Now then sir, as you are probably aware, there has been a confusion between you and Mr Hudson here"" she says gesturing to the old man with an open palm.

 She doesn't have to tell the truth like the rest of us.

 ""Don't worry sir."" She walks towards me with a smile. A smile of malice.

That's not her body.

""You're going to be just fine."" She smiles as her green eyes turn cold and run through me. 

That's not her fucking body.",SimplyKaz

The voice of the judge cut through the room. I glanced up from my papers, and stood up, taking off my gloves and scarf. 

The jury panel gasped a little bit when they saw my unscarred face and hands. More than a few looked jealous, but most merely looked impressed. I nodded. Good. I had affixed myself as a person who told the truth in their mind. 

My client, meanwhile, was a mass of scars. They marred his face, hands, neck, biceps. A few of them were deep and ugly. He was staring at his handcuffed hands, looking despondent. 

I cleared my throat. ""Yes, your honor. And I intend to prove not only to you, but to the men and women of the jury that the evidence the state has not does not prove my client's innocence, but that the evidence proves his innocence!""

The jury mumbled amongst themselves as I launched into my opening statement. 

---

""Thank you, Mr. Graves,"" my client said, grinning in my office, wearing his ratty yet comfortable clothes once again. ""I thought I'd be locked up for good, but you... you pulled off a miracle. ""

I smiled a little, straightening my posture and linking my fingers on the desk. ""It wasn't me, Mr. Williams. It was your testimony that made the most compelling argument.""

Williams smiled, the scars on his face stretching and distorting. 

""Mr. Graves, you're a godsend. I can never thank you enough. I'm going to go and try and pull my life together.""

There. A small little slice, right by his ear. It wasn't much, and he didn't notice it, and I didn't stare. No one deserved to be caught, especially in the lies they tell themselves. 

Mr. Williams thanked me profusely, continued to make that same promise that tore open that scar a little more each time, then left.

When he was gone, I once again stood in the mirror in my office. I unbuttoned my shirt, allowing myself a wince as I opened the shirt a bit further. Yep, it was still there. The one scar that I had from telling myself the lie. The biggest lie I had ever told, and it was the only reason I was still around. 

I took a deep breath, looked myself dead in the mirror, and mouthed the lie to myself. 

The pain lanced through me as the scar re-opened once again, starting at my collarbone, opening up through my stomach, curling around my belly button, and immediately soaking my pant leg with blood as it ended somewhere in my inner thigh. 

The pain had been enough to knock me out the first time I had told that lie. My parents had rushed me to the hospital. Now, all I did was grunt, set my teeth, and reach for the suture kit on the counter in front of me. 

That lie hurt, even more each time I said it. But I had to let myself know I was okay. Even if it was a lie. ",KaneHorus

And word of advice, though I'm not sure you need it: Empathy and sympathy aren't all that different, in the ways that matter. He can understand how you feel, and want you feel good, and pretty much do what a more empathetic person would do in terms of support and such. Just because he can't feel what you're feeling doesn't mean he won't go to lengths to understand and try to help you with your feelings.

Of course, he might not do that anyway. I don't know your relationship. :)",Sawses

""Have you decided yet or would you like another min?"" I asked her.
""Oh."" She turns to face me, that's when I see it, half her face is coved a single large scar. She does nothing to hide it. I try not to stare as she tells me her order. I jot it down on the note pad.
Green salad 
Burger - MR w/ fries
I glance at it again ""do you want anything to drink with that?""
""Ummmm"" she says ""No, water will be fine.""
I tell her the usual half truth, ""I will bring your food out soon ish."" As I head off would not want to be too specific, I would leave mark. Though nothing like what she must have said to end up with that.
I bring her salad out and ask "" Is everything  OK with the meal so far?""
""I could use some more water, when you have the chance"" she replies.
""Right away"" I reply as I head off to get the water pitcher.
Her burger is done before she finishes the salad. I bring it over any way, would not want her food to be cold.
As I serve the burger I ask "" Are you still eating?""
She says "" no I'm done with the salad, I was just playing with it.""
I take the plate and I walk a way. I don't get more than a few steps before I hear her crying behind me.
I turn around and ask ""what's wrong?"" before I can stop my self.
She smiles and holds up one of the kids toys that come with the childrens meals. ""It reminds me of my daughter. She would have loved getting one of these.""
""Oh..."" I stammer, unsure what to say.
I glance at her scar again. She catches me and holds I contact.
I feel ashamed as I break eye contact and look at me feet.
""It was the only thing I could say to her."" she began"" That everything would be alright. What are you supposed to tell your children, that their going to die?""
She pause and breaths deeply.
What type of a mother would I be to not conform her? The shards of glass..."" She breaks down crying again.
I just stand there, dumbfounded and wait. She stops crying eventually and looks at me.
""I'm sorry"" she says, "" but could I get the bill?""
I stand there, unsure untill some one taps me on the shoulder. I turn in a suddenly a wear that I was just standing there. It's my manager, he hands me her bill and says something, that I did not catch.
She pays her bill and leaves, and I am there left woundering, would I have done that? Could I have done that?",timeofwoof

It's hard to drive this concept home in such a scenario where the entire fact that the person was injured supposedly is proof that they are lying. I'm tinkering with this story still in my mind.

I think her name was Darla. I shook my head a bit and watched her saunter back to the counter out of the corner of my eye. I knew she had judged me from the moment she saw me. She had given me the same look most everyone else does. It's funny how someone marked and nicked with little white scars on her hands and arms and neck and legs can look down on me for having more of them. To be fair to - whatever her name was... - Darla- ...to be fair to Darla, and to everyone else, I do have lots and lots of little scars. I looked out to the window to my right at a lamp post that illuminated the darkened streets. This was as asleep as the city gets at night.

I started my scar collection as a kid. My mother meant well and might've been a decent parent if she didn't spend her days swigging vodka. My dad was never in the picture. A military man, apparently, who had to move to a base in Europe before I was born, although looking back I'm sure that wasn't true. My mother, now she had a lot of scars. A scar for every time she was going to quit drinking and ""do right by me.""

The first scar I remember scratching its way onto my skin was when I was probably four or five. My teacher had asked me if I was going to be ok. My mother hadn't come to pick me up which was a semi-frequent event, and I had gotten up to walk home - I lived a 20-minute walk or so away from the school so it wasn't a problem for me. He asked me if I was going to have dinner at home, and I lied. I told him we were having company over and my mom probably just lost track of time cooking this big meal for us all. I don't even know why I lied about it because it was a pointless lie, but I felt the sting on the back of my shoulder as the words left my lips.

Over the years the lies I told people, the lies I told my mother created a tapestry of scar tissue across my body. Sometimes I just wanted to get away from the house and I'd tell her I was staying with a friend. The marks were inconsequential to me.

I'm a journalist now - a failed one - there's no use lying to you. It's funny really because none of my scars ever came from anything I've ever written. I'm stupid; I use my lies on bullshit, instead of making money.

I looked down at my coffee and heard Darla telling a couple large patrons at the counter that she was planning on going back to school soon. I wondered if she got a scar for that or if she really meant it. It didn't really matter to me. I'm not interested in the lies people tell others. That's easy. It's recorded in the history of your body like the rings of a tree and even though they fade over time, more will always take their place - we can't help ourselves. No, what interests me are the lies people tell themselves. When people put makeup over their scars to cover up as many as they can, do they look into the mirror and pretend they are honest?

A bell rang as the door opened. I glanced to my left and saw a young man walk in. And I froze.

""Go ahead and sit where you'd like,"" Darla yelled out cheerily. ""I'll be with you in just a sec.""

The newcomer walked towards a back booth, and my eyes stayed fixed on him the entire time. His skin was unmarred by any scar or blemish. I had looked over his face and neck and forearms, and not a mark there was on them. Bullshit. Everyone lies. That is the only consistent truth I have ever known, and I've known that as far back as my memory extends. Everyone is a liar - that is a universal truth. It's the universal truth. I found myself rising out of my seat. My feet carried me towards the man in the back, quickening with each step. My heart pounded.

""Let me see your arms,"" I managed to squeeze out as I gripped his arm and turned it. My voice was nervous. I quickly jumped to the other arms and hurriedly looked it over. I rubbed his arm spastically to remove any makeup - but there was nothing. I looked up at his face. His eyes were those of a deer's caught in a headlight. What I was doing was crazy, I knew that. I had grabbed a random stranger but he couldn't be this honest. It wasn't possible.

""Where are your scars?"" I demanded. He was still taken aback. ""Where are they?"" I repeated a little more forcefully.

""I- what scars?"" he stammered out.

I felt a surge of anger rise up in me.

""Where are your fucking scars!"" I yelled at the man and grabbed his shirt at his shoulders. His shocked silence only made me angrier. In an instant, I whipped his shirt up and dumbfoundedly stepped back. The entire front of his torso was one giant mass of scarred flesh.

""How are they all there?"" I breathed out. ""That can't be from one lie...""

He looked hurt.

""There was an accident,"" he said dejectedly.

""Bullshit!"" I shot back. That was a lie everyone with an exceptional scar tried to get away with. That it wasn't from a lie, but some physical injury instead. I'd heard that one before. Sometimes a new mark was worth keeping the truth in the dark. But there was no new mark. I scanned over his body.

""How did that happen?""

""It was an accident!"" he retorted, anger now growing in his voice. ""There was a fire in my building! People died...and I was lucky enough to only be left with this at the end of the night.""

I looked over his body and watched as no new scars carved their way in. He threw his shirt back down and was clearly angry now. I stepped backward. The diner was silent. I could feel everyone's eyes on me. The man I accosted threw some money on the table and slid out of his booth. He moved passed me and I watched as the only honest man I had ever known walked out of the door. I was brought crashing back down to reality. I glanced towards the counter and saw the two patrons and the waitress staring at me. I walked back to my table and left some money there before walking out the door. I made it a few steps down the sidewalk before my legs went weak. I sat down on the curb and cried.

It was only six months later when I saw the man's face again. This time on the news. His name was Robert Lewis, and he had been arrested for arson. He had set a fire in his apartment building that apparently grew out of control and wound up killing six people and sending dozens more to the hospital. He had been found there lying in the smoke by first responders. But here's the kicker. He hadn't suffered any burns when they found him. That scar only appeared after he had been questioned about the fire by a couple other firefighters before the cops even spoke to him. It took them a couple weeks to realize what happened and then months to find the guy.

Everyone is a liar. He was just better at telling half truths.

Nowadays you are asked to take your clothes off in a job interview for god's sake, even in court in some countries, I mean come on sometimes you actually need to lie goddamnit sometimes it actually does some real good but it literally scars you for life...

I have my fair number of scars, mostly very light ones , I can take my shirt off when I go to the beach without most of them showing , heck I can have sex with a girl and they won't notice most, the more necessary you felt that the lie was the better hidden the scar is, so most of mine are in addition to very light on ... convenient spots. I have scars on the back of my thighs, I have two behind my ears, I have some on my armpits . I once heard of a guy who had one on his penis , it turns out how you feel about the lie makes a huge difference in what scar it will leave you and where,  just imagine that guy getting undressed in front of a woman , or man whatever he is into anyway. Well at least some girls say scars are sexy, or so I’ve heard.

You do get used to it but still... I once had a pretty long conversation with a war veteran about scars , now that was scarring. He took he shirt off to show me his body he was FULL. I first noticed two bullets scars , didn't think I could recognize them but damn do they look different. The bullet scars though , they were nice compared to the rest , they were in battle defending his country but the rest of his body was more scar tissue than actual skin, there were spots where I couldn't even make out how many scars he had. They formed one big pile of butchered up skin. During our conversation I found out that he actually got all the visible scars he had on his upper body in a single week , he was taken as a prisoner of war and trust me , the only countries that actually give even a single flying fuck about the Geneva convention are the ones that have already won the war. Long story short , pretty much all the scars were from the lies he told trying to lead the enemies away while they were torturing him instead of giving them real information , it's mad how they can torture you into treachery without leaving a scar on your body. It is true though , EVERYONE breaks given enough time.

The war veteran story is my go-to example on why we shouldn't judge people by their scars. There is a whole other story that I just can't get myself to tell. Too goddamn sad , well probably not so when you just hear it as a story but you were not there talking with him you did not see the sorrow and the chaos on his face.

His name was George. In my country he have to serve in the military , mandatory service . The military of course is purely defensive and the service is easier than professional militaries naturally. George was pretty much the nicest guy we all knew , he would never even lie. There had been a few occasions where others were mad at him because he would tell our officers about anything they asked and being the military there were consequences , he really , actually never lied. We also noticed after a couple of months that even though most would get out of bath completely naked since we were only men, he would get in and out always wearing a t-shirt, and whenever he had to change his t-shirt without taking a bath he hid, went to the bathroom or was alone someway. We all wondered but we thought that he just lied without us noticing and wanted to hide his scars , all the others still believe that but I know.

George and I became friends over time. We would go out for a drink , we would even go to the gym or for a run together sometimes. The park where we run was closer to his home so one day when it started raining he told me to come take a shower at his place, he'd lend me some clothes and drive me home. He let me get in to take a shower first. I got in finished my shower and got out, he went in right after me. Seconds after he got in I realized a left my shoes in the bathroom and I sweat a lot so my shoes get smelly so I wanted to get them to the balcony. Being used to it from my service, who we had both finished some months prior to that day, where we didn't really care if someone saw us naked I just opened the door and went in without knocking. God I wish I hadn't.

I saw George's back as he was getting in the shower, he just froze as he saw the awe in my face when I stared at his single scar, one single scar in the entirety of his body , it was a huge scar spanning diagonally on his whole back , it was so large it reminded me of video game characters , and so deep I thought it was see-through where the skin met the spine. I just looked at him and he knew,  he got a look that was stuck in his face for the rest of the week and just said ""Let me finish my shower and I'll explain"".

And so he finished , and so he explained , and so I was moved , then I processed what he said and I was devastated , and then I thought about it once more and I started to cry , then he let go and started to cry even more than I did.

It was one of the saddest stories I had ever heard.  Until you are 13-16 depending on the person you get no scars from lying, I mean come on who doesn’t lie as a kid. One day you wake up with an already fainted scar across your whole face which goes away in a day or two and that is how you know you now get scars from lying. So George was relatively lucky as he got his initiation scar a couple of weeks after he became sixteen. 

When George was 14 his mother got cancer. His 3 years younger sister got cancer too a year later, while his father had died in an accident when George was 9. His mother was given a 60% chance of getting rid of the cancer for good at the beginning with chemotherapy.  She didn’t.  A month after she learned that her cancer got too spread to be completely stopped, her daughter got cancer too. George said the doctor believed that his mother must have been exposed to radiation when pregnant with his sister else it was just a very tragic coincidence that they both got cancer in such a small time interval with his sister at such a young age.

George’s mother stopped chemotherapy just before he became 15 since the doctor said it wouldn’t help anymore. His sister was never given much chance, a mere 10% that chemotherapy would even do anything.

His mother couldn’t get out of bed just before George turned 16. At the same time the doctor told his sister that chemotherapy couldn’t do anything anymore and that she was giving her about another year and 6 to 8 months in a “good enough” health.

Naturally George and his sister wanted their mother to die knowing her daughter at least would survive.  So they thought they’d lie to her, tell her that her daughter was getting better. George learned how to do makeup and helped his sister so she would seem in good health no matter what happened. They told their mum that even though she had gotten past cancer she started paying attention to the details of life and that she wanted to start putting on make up to look better and her being 13 at the time her mother believed her. 

And so George kept lying, with a lie that started a few weeks after he got his first scar, he kept saying the same lie to his mother everyday. His mother got worse and so did his sister. His mother died 6 months after George got 16 years old, his sister one month after that, the doctor predicted wrong. The last two months that their mother was alive his sister couldn’t get out of bed and so every day he lied to his mother that his sister had to study , or that she didn’t get a very good grade on a test and didn’t want to disappoint her , or that she went out with friends whenever his mother asked why his sister didn't visit much. On the days his sister was feeling better she put on make-up, gathered all her strength and walked enough to go sit beside her mother’s bed.  And so George kept lying so that his mother would die happy, every day for hours each day he lied to his dying mother that his dying sister was well, a few weeks before the end he told her that his sister had gotten fully rid of her tumor while his sister would faint trying to get up and see her mother. And George kept lying even the last few days when his mother could hardly see or talk and asked to see her daughter, so George said that she went abroad in a school program for students good in literature related subjects and she called him to relay her love for her mother to her, while she was in the hospital 20 meters away on the same floor, hanging on to life by a thread. Then his mother died and he couldn’t lie anymore, his sister died and he could hardly feel like he could live anymore.

All that left him with one big scar, the same lie being told over and over and over again devastating him even more each time, killing him inside and out a bit more each time creating a scar that would never heal. Creating a scar that was bigger than anyone I and maybe anyone else living on this godforsaken planet has ever seen. Creating a scar that made every other evil, obstacle or problem seem redundant, turning George into the best person I had ever known, into the best person anyone that met him had ever known.

It’s a mad world , and it’s mad to judge people by their scars , some carry them with sorrow , some with pride , some with regret some with happiness , some only need one , some have none , some can’t seem to get enough.

What did they do? 

What did they lie about?

In this world, for some foresaken reason,    god had betrayed his people. 

I knew lying was wrong, most of the time. 

But for me? Oh no, my mother taught me well, as would any mother would with the markings a lie would give you. 

You use your words and your mind. You think before you speak. You work your way around and at some point those markings mean nothing. 

Absolutely nothing. 

We all had minor scars, we all told small lies here and there, it was over looked most of the time. 

You would be given a look of embarrassment and there would be a certain quietness in the room. It would go over looked but everyone still knew when it happened: You lied. 

It was blunt. It was a strong odor no one could control. Scars all over our bodies, in odd places that surely made you wonder; Can I trust you?

Trust?

What was trust in this world? 

The ones, the pure ones, who had no markings were sat upon a throne. 

You were good. You were clean, pure, holy, and surly too good to be true. 

But the others? The others with deep scars that showed their past? That showed the history of their mouth and what they had to offer?

It was too much, just the sight of a deep scar was a very dangerous thing to behold. 

You wouldn't be trusted, you simply wouldn't be. 

It was an automatic detection of you being filthy, a filthy liar. 

We would bathe ourselves as children, confessing our sins and screaming out for God to make the markings go away. 

We would scrub our bodies until they'd bleed. 

We would put on creams and makeup, just to make it disappear. 

But the lie would still remain, and you couldn't take it back. 

The guilt would make you go mad and the scar would stay forever as a reminder. 

When I laid eyes upon this man, this man with the biggest and most deepest scar I had ever seen, I was over the edge with desire to know. 

Frantically twitching and trying to ease my way into a conversation with the young male, my efforts seemed worthless as I could tell he knew, his blank facial expression made a statement to fuck off.  

Right before I took a breath and spared a few words, I dwelled in my cowardness and froze. 

""What do you want?"" he asked. 

And at that moment, that exact moment, was when I got my biggest scar. 

""Nothing"".",Red-Cherub

Like it is possible to tell only truth, hah it is impossible. 

Do u even know what it means? Scars opening in middle of conversation, blood drops everywhere, wars on daily basis, destruction, marriages not existing, all cause of incapability to say a lie, hide emotions, black and white world.. can you only imagine!!! Can u? TRY! Take ur time and try it I said!! 

Did u, I can see you're still watching at me like I'm some kind of freak, heh I'm not, you just don't like to lie? 

Nevermind, I'll finish what I started, u just sit there and continue listening emptiness , you can say something if you wanna... Heh i know you will at some point, hahaha. 

So there was a guy I met few years back, he didn't look like much, some suit, black suit, red silk shirt, red tie, snickers and golden necklace, haha he looked like sh.t to be honest, something like you at the moment hahaha . But something attracted me to him in some crazy way, not sexually don't get me wrong hahaha. Told you about our world, scars and all that crazy sh.t, he whatsoever was perfect, no visible scars, owowow... Forgot to tell you... Hi hi hi... There is a lets say ""natural"" law about scares we get when we lie.. the greater the lie is the greater tattoo u get for life hahaha. No need to inspect me... I have some big scares, not that big as... 

I'm sorry I wondered somewhere... For sake of our conversation let's call him ""Incredible"" cause that's what he was in a way, quite a figure. 

After hours of conversation, drugs, drinks and some ""cool"" new scares on me we decided it is time to go.

Ridiculous thing is we stayed at same hotel, so we shared a cab, kinda awkward to call it cab, it's more like a...  hmm like a..  whatever... no need to talk about it... 

Can u say something? I guess not hihihi! What time is it? Sorry I'm in the hurry so let me get to important part, I'm part of something you can't process atm, something so big it is pointless to explain to you..  That guy I was talking about, Incredible, I saw him without shirt, still feeling itching every time I remember, he actually had a scar, scar so big I wondered how was he still alive. My curiosity didn't let me not knowing Wtf was that, it was fucking biggest scar ever, never seen one bigger than finger, but this... was enormous. So I asked him about it, he didn't wanna talk, I had to investigate on my own, I just had to know. 

Turns out he was the first, all of it started with one man's lie, sure they helped, those scars heal fast, but wasn't even close to helping us as a race, with that everything went wrong. I'm here to make sure they are never created at first place. 

Hahaha I can see by you're look u know who I am, what I'm here for, and hell yea we managed to create time machine baby hahaha!! 

So Incredible any last words except that ur nanobots are helping us rise as a race, their consciousness is exterminating us instead of helping hahaha, it was biggest lie ever, they should never exist, I'm here to make sure this time never gets to know suffering we had. I will make world a better place! 

Incredible : my work always meant to help us, but be sure in one thing, you're not making world a better place haha. I think ur wound will make a hell big scar hahaha

If everyone knows immediately the moment when a person lies, then lying becomes pointless.  I have my fair share of scars from telling lies.  My fingers have tiny white lines criss crossing them.  I often catch myself staring at my hands visually drawing patterns.  I will from time to time do the same thing to others as well.  My friend Kaleb has the most ornate spider web of scars on his back.  When his parents went through their divorce, Kaleb rebelled.  His whole life became one lie after another.  

I guess I never thought much of it.  I mean, seeing someone who didn’t have scars was like meeting God face to face and living to tell about it.  The chances are astronomically not in your favor.  I however have met someone with only one, deep dark, morbidly grotesque scar.  It happened when I started college.  I was sitting in an anatomy lecture.  Professor Dickerson was explaining why our lie scars fell where they did.  He was making a convincing argument until Jenelle walked in. 

Jenelle was a lithesome woman of maybe 40 years.  She wore a dress that dripped down to expose more of her cleavage than most women in my age range would dare to show.  It was easy to see two things, besides her breast.  She had flawless skin save for the fist sized bruise that darkened her entire left breast.  The other thing we could see was that she was very sad.  

Professor Dickerson asked the woman what was wrong.  Jenelle responded, flatly, “nothing’s wrong”.  The darkened scar broken only as if a sliver of glass has been brushed over her flesh.  The fresh crimson nectar of life spilled forth.  She stood there, unmoving.  I didn’t know how many times this woman, had been a part of this lecture or worse, for how long she had been telling this lie, but I finally understood how much a lie was worth.

I graduated with honors from the university but I still remember Jenelle and the lie that she told.  A lie, no doubt that we each have told once in our life, but one this woman had been telling for so long that she stands now as nothing more than a lecture device.",Svarmani

Mom feeds me breakfast, smiling her usual smile as she talks about what the old ladies at church had been discussing.  Heedless of the struggles going on in my head.  I eat my eggs and bread in silence, trying to stay as small, as invisible as possible.  I don’t say very much… perhaps that was why I didn’t have the usual scars that cover everyone else?

I pass by the store on my way to school, making sure not to linger for too long, not let my brother get suspicious.  I stare wistfully at the dresses and necklaces, so elegant and pretty.  But my parents would never let me have such things.  I glance down at my jeans and sweatshirt, hating how it made me appear masculine.  My own body, betraying me.

School passed by in a blur, like most days.  My brother runs ahead, laughing as he bounds into our house without a care in the world.  How nice it must be, to be born into the body you want.  Father smiles at me, asks me the same question he’s asked every day since I started school.  I noticed the scar that first night he asked, on my back as I took off my shirt to shower.  It was the biggest I’d ever seen.  I’ve never taken off my shirt in front of my family ever since.

“Hey, kid!  How’s life treating ya?”

I pause, for a brief moment.

I can't be sure but he just gives me the heebie jeebies! The thing that bothers me the most is he isn't like the rest of us. Clean shaven, bald shiny head, all while wearing short old man cargo shorts, and a Hawaiian button up half way undone. Not a scar in sight. From the day you are borning you lie, either by words or crying for milk when you really just want attention. 

How does this man who looks like he is 3 centuries old carlessly show off his body, and not show a single scar? This make could not have lived a perfect life! I planned on inviting him to lunch the next day. As wierd as he is Im baffled. So many people must ask him every day but maybe if I bought his food he wouldn't be as upset getting asked again.

The next day tragedy struck the world. People all over the globe were getting sick. Weeks go by, more sickness and no clue what if happening. Everyone starts praying to their god. Soon enough people are dying because of mutations in the sickness. Different people different changes. I'm starting to think about the old man again and how lucky he is.
He doesnt have to worry about heaven or hell, hos life was perfect.

A month goes by I wild assume he has died by now. The elderly seemed to receive the sickess the fastest and die first. WHO still has not made any progress on a cure. Ive fallen ill myself now. My scarred body, I am aching, my skin burns. I know ai am going to die soon. One day though, the old man showed up at my door!

""How ya doing young man?"", he asked with cheer in his voice?

""Why are here? And who are you?"", I said with such haste it surprised even me.

Even with my rude demeanor, he was still able to smile and say, ""Oh I think you know me quite well!"" He walked past me and sat down on my couch. "" For your information I DO have one scar. But it just make be too much for you to see."" He began to smirk.

""I am dying,"" I replied, "" You already know that I am curious about it just help me have some peice of mind before I die!""

He laughed out loud shaking my room. ""Fine but remember this is to help you 'relax with piece of mind!"" When he unbuttoned his shirt all i could do was stare. For he did not lie he only had 1 scar. But the horric scene was unsettleing. He had NO heart just and empty scabbed up hole where it was. ""It is gone because I made the biggest lie of them all, the one that would define the worlds ending, and undoing!""

Stammering in fear I only had 1 response, "" convincing the world that you didnt exist,  Satan??   

""BWahaha!"" His voice shook the house this time! ""Poor humans you all think that i have to try and hide when in all reality,"" he laughed again spliting open my scars,"" A few centuries back all i had to do was find 12 people and tell them there was another option!

My heart stopped and the laat ai remember is his blurry shadow against my wall. His outline isn't human anymore though. It's ungodly.....

all. 

Any other night, this ability would be particularly exciting, as I sit
in a nightclub downtown, having drinks with a college friend and
people-watching. Tonight as I walked in, my gaze caught on the
black abyss of a scar snaking around the bartender's right arm, down her
side, across her stomach, and around onto her back before ending
on her other arm. I am necessarily skilled at controlling where
I look, but I can't stop staring.


I only have one scar. It's a small white line through my right
eye-brow that appeared when I was 11, the moment I told my mother I
wanted to stay with her instead of dad after the divorce. She needed
me, and that is what she needed to hear, despite what I really
wanted. She saw the truth in my eyes the moment I said it, so the lie
scarred white and on my face for the world to see. That's the
rule. Lies get darker as they get meaner and they hide themselves on
the body as well as they have been hidden from the world. 

The bartender looks at me with a smile, then at my friend as we sit
down: ``What would you like?''

It takes Herculean effort to keep my eyes focused on her face as I
order a beer. Jordan smiles naturally at her, oblivious and orders a
whiskey sour. 

``What was that about at the entrance, you like her or something?'' He
asks.

""...yeah, or something'' I answer, transfixed as she turns to make
our drinks, and I see the spiral of blackness that snakes around her
back like the tentacles of an octopus. I feel my stomach
lurch. Jeezus.""You know, my stomach's off, I need a minute in the
bathroom.'' 

``Oh man, no problem, I'll just help you out with that beer when it
gets here'' Jordan quipped, as I stumbled off toward the mens
room. What the fuck could she have said?

Marriage was hard on my parents and they came out of it looking like
seasoned gladiators. At first, I was the only one that could see the
scars, small at first, accumulating on both of them. Little lies, lies
of omission, but gradually, the main lie grew on each of them. I could
almost see the words ``Everything is fine'' carved into their backs
until finally the shouting match. Divorce healed a lot of those scars,
the moment of confrontation hit each of them like a wave, finally
soothing the vicious wounds. They each walked away with a nearly
identical 6 inch scar along their shoulder blade and up onto the neck
like angels who had lost a wing. That lie which defined their lives for
20 years left a 6'' scar that faded from the color of pitch to a dull
gray after the divorce. 

In the bathroom, I've calmed down. Cool water and a warm towel from
the attendant are keeping my visceral reaction at bay as I stare into
the mirror still seeing an after-image. What lie could she have told?

I am heading back to the bar, trying to keep my eyes down so I won't see IT
again. when She comes from my blind-spot, grabs my arm, and says: ``My
name is Glados, If you come with me, there will be delicious cake.''

""I'll be home at five. I promise."" The thin line stretched across my index finger and I dabbed the blood away with a napkin discreetly. A couple walked by, hand in hand. I glanced over for half of a second. She didn't look like anything.

I gave him a second look as he walked past, obviously. He'd have to be used to it by now. He had the fair complexion we'd all coveted in grade school but long since abandoned with the convenience of lying. I wondered for a moment how he'd done it, been so honest in such a dishonest world. 

This train of thought was abandoned shortly after, when I'd taken up scrolling through my facebook feed until I had to get back to the office.

""I love you,"" I half-heard the man say say. Then I heard her scream. I glanced up attentively, as did everyone. His shirt stuck to his chest, blood coming to the surface. ""Please. I mean it.""

""If you mean it, why this? Why lie about something like that?!?""

""I love you,"" he repeated. A wet, tearing sound accompanied his words and the blood was soaking his shirt. ""I don't know why this happens."" Tears formed in his eyes. 
She got up from her seat. Her face shown a mixture of anger and pity. 

""You don't need to lie. I'm sorry."" She walked out. I got up and walked over to the man, shaken.

""Dude, are you alright?"" I asked, picking the napkins up off the table and handing them to him. 

""I don't lie."" He said, face pale from blood loss. ""But this happens everytime I say it. Even to my own mother.""",tyrantulaaa

It's an unusual, but fortunately concealed,  spot for me; usually I'm an arm guy, so my parents always dressed me in tshirts, for conveniences sake when asking if I'd done my homework.  You'd think they'd have figured it out, after I was held back a grade...

But this chick.  Now, I'm a man who knows what I like.  Short, curly hair, sundresses, enough scars to show a wild side, few enough scars that I know I won't get a 'git-scar.  Happened to one of my buddies once; after his girlfriend found out his ""I'm not cheating on you"" mark was hidden under his beard, she cut more than hair in taking it off.  I told him dating a girl with skin textured like prairie grass was bad news, but he just couldn't resist the crazies.  Birds of a feather, I suppose...

But back to this girl.  She had it all.  The dress.  The hair.  The... scar.  Some chicks hide them, some showcase them.  She was a shower, and damn, did she have a lot to show. The dress had to be custom tailored, for it framed and flattered the deep colors of the scar along her back perfectly.  But other than that... flawless.  Already I longed to stroke her smooth arms, kiss her milky neck, lift up her already short dress...

I approached, and distracted by the juxtaposition of beauty and destruction, went with the lamest, most common of openings.  I gestured towards her.  ""That's quite the display.  Is it 'git?""

Her laughter, as expected, sounded like the tinkling of bells.  ""But of course it's legit!"" she said.  ""It was a tragic accident..."" she looked solemn, for a moment, as if getting lost in a painful memory, but then her smile, refreshing as a spring shower, returned.  ""Though of course, that might not be the case.  After all, I only ever speak in lies.""",calantorntain

In a world where each lie meant a scar you knew who was going to be trustful. I saw Tony Monzana again. The last time I saw him in person was the last election day. Our old prime minister was going for a second round.

He was about to start his political speech, he looked casual. He looked pretty clean for an average person, not many scars anywhere, brown hair and glasses. The usual.

Just before he got to start the speech his doctor ran to him and asked something about a skin surgery. Tony asked him back ""What fucking skin surgery, I have never had a skin surgery"". 
He immeditially broke in half, which his doctors only replied to ""*Sigh...* Politicians"".

"[WP] You live in a world where each lie creates a scar on the liar's body. The bigger the lie, the deeper and larger the mark. One day, you meet someone that only has one scar; it is the biggest one you have ever seen.",LotsOfDragons,"We met at a bar one evening. She had a beer in her hand, something local on tap, about half-drained. We struck up some conversation - weather or sports or some such, I don't remember, small talk though. She made some passing comment about liking my ears, and I almost brushed it off as false praise - I think they stick out a bit too much - before I noticed her smooth skin; not a single scar visible.

I had my own fair share of lies cut into my skin - most minor, a few major. Even the bigger ones I'd usually defend, outside of a big one on my arm. ""I've been clean for a year!"". Even so, that's the least regretful mistake from that part of my life - I'm proud to say I can say that line now without the scar growing larger.

I got her name - Jane - and later, her number. We ended up setting up a date for the following weekend, and hit it off quickly. Similar interests - hiking, video games, cooking... Well, mostly same interests, anyway. I remember her coy smile when I said I liked her Coltrane collection, and a line of skin on my forearm darkened. Can't stand jazz, really.

I thought for about a month that she was perfectly honest, until we went to bed together. Jane seemed reluctant to take off her shirt, but that same honesty that kept her skin smooth must have demanded she not cover up now - her bra came off, and across the inside of her left breast was the deepest scar that I've ever seen. It wasn't a discoloration like most scars - it was like a knotted rope was underneath the skin.

It wasn't the sort of thing you can comment on lightly, but at the same time, it would be more conspicuous to ignore it. She was clearly distressed, waiting for my reaction. I wasn't sure what to say, but we were both naked at that point so there was no hoping that a lie would be covered up by clothing.

""There's obviously a story here, and I'm curious, but... Right now, it's not important. I'm willing to wait until you're willing to tell me on your own terms"" I said, and punctuated the sentence with a kiss. She ran a hand through my short hair, and the encounter continued naturally after that. But frankly the details are none of your business.

It was another six months before I learned any more details about that scar of hers. We were quite serious by now, and I'd had plenty of opportunities to see it again at this point.

Jane told me that her parents were going to be coming by for Thanksgiving, and that she wanted me to be there. Her face was strangely tense, and when I pressed for information, she just said that she didn't feel up for explaining. What could I say to that? So, I didn't press the issue, and waited for Thursday to roll around.

Her parents showed up - her mother was a frumpy sort of woman, with a flowery dress, and her father was tall, but had a thick neck and a double chin. I was surprised the two of them could have produced such a beautiful daughter, but all the same I could see some resemblance, particularly in the eyes and nose.

The first thing I heard her father say - before even ""hello"" - was right after he jerked a thumb in my direction. ""Is this that friend of yours? She looks like a fucking dyke."" Her mother agreed emphatically. I found myself dumbstruck, unable to respond. Jane laughed uncomfortably, but her father didn't seem to notice - he was sniffing the air.

""Turkey's already on, eh? Surprised you haven't caught yourself a husband yet, with your cooking. Hah!""

""No luck yet, but I'm sure I'll find one one of these days."" Jane replied with a weak smile, clearly hiding a wince as the scar above her heart wrought its way deeper into her skin.",Swibblestein

It has awkward moments but all in all it captures people's mistrust of the unknown. It captures a serious burden many doctors, soldiers, EMTs, firefighters--pretty much any field of individuals that live with death or the risk of.  The choice of lie was very powerful because it's a lie everyone has witnessed or can relate to. Sometimes people/things aren't going to be alright, sometimes bad things happen in life whether fair or not. It is a fundamental truth. 

Last and most importantly--if you're going to give out criticism (as is frequent on the interwebs and even expected in this sub) try to make in constructive. Otherwise live by the old 'nothing nice to say--shut the fuck up bro'

I grew up in a small farming town and I can't tell you how right they were.

With the recent election behind us, tensions were still high. The debates had been arduous. Should we deal with climate change via the solar route or reach out to newer frontiers of nuclear or wave power.

I have to admit I was disappointed I missed the lottery for physics 570, which meant a free semester on one of the 17 lunar colonies, but if I was being honest with myself I knew my scores didn't merit more than a single ticket in the pool.

I'd met several people who honestly believed we'd establish more than a foothold on mars, which I couldn't believe. I mean with the em drive version 4 we were pushing on to Europa, and water base station. Huge lead plates were already on the way with humans soon to follow.

The abundance of food, advances in medicine, and lack of disease (thanks to vaccines and proper medication) meant I was honored to be taught English 104 by a professor that was alive when electric cars were just being invented.

But I never thought to meet a heretic.

She was pretty, excepting the large red scar that marred her face and neck. Almost half an inch across and running from her forehead down her face, over her jaw, and disappearing under her shirt the scar was open red raw, proof she repeated the lie again. Not that any of had to ask what it was, with the thin golden cross hanging from her necklace.

""Only once. And it was the worst lie I've ever told anyone. The biggest, far bigger than any lie that you could think of.""

""Good. Now leave and never talk about this.""

I've seen murderers and heavily experienced con-men with shallower scars. This was... shocking.

The moonlight reflected from her fair, creamy skin as we walked. I looked for more lies, but I could find none. Only the deep one across her chest, the one she showed but never explained. Even the last Pope had two scars, albeit quite shallow.

She swept her silky amber hair to the side and showed a faint smile. She seemed happy, but I was not. I couldn't focus. I needed to know her lie. I *had to know*, but I didn't want to drive her away. I tried the subtle approach, but I'm not too good with subtlety.

""Would you like to know how I got these scars?"" I asked, like the Joker after a five-month hospital regimen. My shyness was showing, but I'm not sure she picked up on it.

""Sure, if you want to tell. As long as it doesn't make you uncomfortable.""

I pointed to the one on my forearm. That was a... memorable one, to say the least.

""This was when I lied about smoking weed and having sex. I was a dumb teenager who was too dependant on what people thought of me. I wanted to be cool, but I was just a sheltered brat.""

""You're a little hard on yourself. We all make mistakes.""

Very inspiring, but almost hollow coming from her. I gestured to the deep one on my neck.

""This was when I lied about setting our garage on fire. I was playing around with my dad's lighter when I dropped it on the floor. For some reason, there was gas leaking from the car. The fumes ignited. The whole thing went up in flames. I said it was an electrical problem.""

""How much was the damage?""

""100K, including the price of a new car. That drained our savings.""

""Wow...""

I finished on my final one, my third one. A very deep one on my stomach. This was my least favorite.

""This was when I lied about checking on grandma when she called our house. I ignored the call and told my parents she was fine. She'd called... she'd called us to say she fell and broke her back on the bathtub... she died the next day... I just... I feel so much guilt... and I told my parents it wasn't my fault...""

""I'm sorry... that's horrible.""

""It's fine. The experience lead me to stop lying. I haven't told a lie in over 10 years.""

""Me too.""

An awkward silence hung over us. Would she talk about the scar? Would she ignore it? No, no no no we're nearing her apartment. I gotta say something!

""I have a question, but you don't have to answer it if it makes you uncomfortable.""

""Shoot.""

""How did you get that scar across your chest?""

She chuckled a bit, as if amused by my question.

""LARP accident. Some guy brought a real claymore sword. He cut through my foam armor and went straight through my midsection, almost took my upper half off. The doctors say it was a miracle I survived.""

It... it wasn't a lie? It was an accident? That's so... relieving! My word, here I was thinking-- wait, is that a new scar on her arm?

She laughed an unconvincing laugh.

""I-I wasn't lying, that was true! I'm not a murderer or anything!""

Another scar popped up.

*And I ran.*

One day, you meet someone that only has one scar; it is the biggest one you have ever seen.",LotsOfDragons,"I remember that night vividly. My friends and I went to the guzzler, a local bar. We had the intent to get drunk and hopefully get some people in bed.

George had it easy. A smooth talking man with a few scars, but none too deep. He picked up a fine girl named Jane. Before they left I heard the girl ask if he was a virgin, I heard him say yes followed by a scar on the back of his neck. Luckily she was in front of him. 

John had it the roughest. Serving time and having the courage to lie, hoping it would be on the bottom of his foot, or somewhere else unnoticeable. Instead he got it right on his cheek, and it was far from missable. I pitied him, only one could imagine a life like that.

As for me, James ""cat"" Morris, I only had one scar behind my knee. It wasn't too big. Got it for lieing about a missing homework assignment. 

I scan the room looking for some girl of my type. That's when I spot her. Autumn red hair, a smooth freckled face, and dazzling Jade green eyes. A true beauty. 

""Mind if I buy you a drink?"" I asked her 

""That would be nice"" she responds 

""So what's your name?"" I asked her again as I put my arm around her neck

""Angelica, Angelica Jade."" She said. Her back felt a bit off when she said that, almost as if it widened a bit, but I didn't think much of it. 

""Jade, huh? Matches your eyes."" 

She looked at me almost seductively. 

""How about we takes this away, somewhere more private"" she said. 

""What about our drinks?""

""What about them?""

We entered her car and she drove me to her apartment room. As we went in we immediately went to her bedroom, taking our clothes off in the process. You can imagine what came next. I woke up to a horrific sight. Angelica's back. A scar so deep, so wide that it seemed if it were to grow any larger it would tear her skin in half. 

I immediately rush to the bathroom. What could possibly have caused a cut that big? What lie must she have told to make it that? I start to panic and silently go back to my bedroom to grab my belongings. I quickly rush to put all my clothes on and grab my stuff as I hear her get out of bed. My head turns around in fear as I see her look back.

""Who are you?"" I ask in fear 

""Oh Lord, how knocked up must I have been to get with you loser."" She says nonchalantly. 

""Answer me."" I say with a bit of anger 

""I see you found out, do you really want to know? Follow me."" She walked away to the kitchen. 

I follow her out of morbid curiosity. She opened her bottom most cabinet. One so small and low you could barely notice it. She reached in and grabbed a small contraption, one I recognized, who didn't? It was a wired draught bomb. One used in the liberty bombings two years ago. 

""Why do you have that?"" I asked out of fear. I knew the answer but kept denying it.

""Is it not obvious. Amazing what plastic surgery and a name change could do."" 

""Why are you telling me this?"" I asked 

""Cause it doesn't matter if you know our not, you'll be gone. look out the window"" 

I look out and notice the landmark. The liberty remembrance park

""You asked me what lie caused that scar, well now you know, that lie was myself.""

What a way to say goodbye.

"[WP] You live in a world where each lie creates a scar on the liar's body. The bigger the lie, the deeper and larger the mark. One day, you meet someone that only has one scar; it is the biggest one you have ever seen.",LotsOfDragons,"It was the middle of the January, one of the better times to lie if you had to.  In the cold winter months, you could get away with hiding your secrets under an oversized, baggy sweater.  There just enough snow in the air that to make the sky seem to sparkle, but it was nothing compared to the sparkle in her piercing green eyes when they first made contact with mine.  I swear, it was love at first sight.

Her hair was close cut, its raven black color a stark contrast to the white world which framed it.  Her cheeks and nose had a splash of red from the cold.  Fuzzy earmuffs, slightly oversized on her head, enveloped her ears.  The cold steam of her breath escaped in short bursts from thin, pursed lips.  She turned toward me a bit, wrapping her puffy red coat snugly around her body and drawing her arms over her chest for warmth.  Skinny black jeans, the kind that showed off just enough of her curves, ran down into pristine white boots, the soles of which were almost obscured by the thin layer of snow on the ground.

In short, she was perfect.

Before I realized what I was doing, I hid my hands in my coat pockets self-consciously.  I cursed myself for not having the foresight to wear gloves.  Most of mine show up on my hands, and seeing all of them up front tends to give people the wrong first impression.  See, the Scars have something of a twisted sense of humor.  You tell a lie about some action you've taken, you get a scar on your arms or hands; tell a lie about somewhere you've been, you get a scar on your legs or feet; tell a lie about what you think, you get a scar somewhere on your head.  Medical experts have been studying the scars for as far back as anyone can remember, but the best science can tell us is that they just... happen.  For all science knows, the world could be home to legions of overly vigilant, painfully ironic fairies wielding pocket knives.

Gathering my courage, I unzipped my coat and started walking in her direction.  I nearly stopped myself and turned away a couple of times, but I'd promised myself long ago to always be truthful to my feelings.  Nonetheless, I stalled awkwardly when I came close.  Her green eyes watching me, the smell of her perfume drifting over to me, the cold wind blowing against my shirt...

I took a deep breath.  I probably looked like an idiot.  But, now was not the time to panic.  I laid my heart out on the line, in more ways than one.  I told her she was one of the most beautiful women I'd ever seen, and that if she would allow me the opportunity, I wanted to take her somewhere special.  That might seem a bit direct, but it helps your case a lot when a girl can simply watch your chest to see if your feelings are genuine.  Sure enough, no bloodstain appeared.  She looked down at the snowy ground, her cheeks growing even more red in the cold weather.

""Alright,"" she said, her lips teasing into a slight smile.  ""What did you have in mind?""

Good question.  What did I have in mind?

We ended up in a nearby restaurant, though I can't for the life of me remember how.  I got really lucky is probably the best answer.  As we took our seats in the booth, she took off her outer jacket, revealing a white sweater underneath.  I didn't think anything of it at first.

Slowly, as if unsure of herself, she unzipped the sweater too and pulled it down her arms, not fully off but not quite on either.  Beneath it, she was wearing a rather tight shirt which revealed her slender arms and the fair skin of her midriff.  I was caught completely off-guard by her drastic change of apparel.  She shivered a bit and rubber her shoulders.

I sat there speechless, transfixed by her beauty.  Her skin was so... perfect.  Not a single scar marred her arms, her stomach, her neck, or anything.  I realized I must have been staring, and turned a way just a bit too quickly.

""It's okay,"" she said softly, pulling her coat back on.  ""I wanted you to see that, since... I mean, you were so up front with me and... but not in a bad way, and... I guess I could've just told you outright...""  She stared at the table a bit too pointedly.

I smiled to myself.  At least I wasn't the only one who was bad at this.

...

That was three years ago, back when life was so much simpler.  Back before the diagnosis, before the painful treatments which dragged on into weeks and then months.  Before we learned about the cancer that was eating away, slowly but surely, at her brain.

The doctors told us nothing could be done.  They could treat her, give her drugs to ease the suffering and ultimately the transition, but she was never going to get better.  They said she would be... gone... within a few months.  I stared at them like a hawk as they spoke, scrutinizing every inch of skin as I processed each sentence, but no Scars came.  It was the truth.

We were both left to ask why it had to be her.

She grew irritable and lashed out, though I could hardly blame her.  They said it was pressing on her brain, altering her mood and her thoughts.  I'm not ashamed to admit that I bawled my eyes out when I first heard the news.  But I had to be strong, I had to keep going.  I had to be a rock, no matter how hard that would be.

As her time in the hospital grew, so did the doses they gave her.  On one of her worse nights, I sat there with her as she tried to process all the built up frustration.  I could see in her eyes that she didn't fully recognize me, a look I would never grow used to.

With no other outlet, she turned it on me.

""Why did this have to happen?"" she suddenly screamed at me, choking back a sob.  Tears streamed down her cheeks.  ""I... I hate you!""

For a moment, neither of us said anything.  We sat in near silence, interrupted only by the occasional sob.  I watched her somberly, not daring to react.  And that's when I saw it.

A large pool of blood soaked into her hospital gown, just above her heart.  The only Scar she would ever have.

...

One day, you meet someone that only has one scar; it is the biggest one you have ever seen.",LotsOfDragons,"No one knew who he was. I certainly did not. We had all had several cuts on our bodies over our lifespans. My cuts went deep and had riddled my face ugly and my body full of scars.
But when we saw him... we were amazed.
Just one scar, one scar that ran his lips. It was like a laughing line, like he had cut it himself... but he wouldn't have. Why would someone give themselves such a hideous deformity?
I watched him as he came to our town. His scar dug deep into his jaw, sliding all the way up to nearly his ears. Like when he spoke, he was almost a puppet flapping its mouth.
I kept my eyes fixated on him, just staring. 
He moved in next door to me and I could hear him howling with laughter in the night. It scared me, but more thrilled.
I wanted to know why he had that scar... I wanted to figure out what he had hidden.
I snuck into his house one night, waiting for him to come home. But all I heard when his footsteps came into the hall of the apartment floor, was scraping and crackling.
I pulled my gun closer to my arms. I wasn't going to kill him, but I felt the feeling that he was going to aim directly at me.
A scar that deep usually meant murder. It was a very cold world we lived in.
No essence of good... no essence of even a conscience. We didn't care who saw our scars. Some of us even would tell the story behind the terrible lies we had made in pubs and parties.
When I saw his doorknob turn, I swallowed, and aimed the gun to the door.
I could hear the sound of cackling and the man only whispered out on the other side.
""Hello John...""
I froze. The gun dropped out of my hand in horror and just as it did the door opened, the gun flipped up to my chin by its own power and shot right across my scratched up face.
I scampered back in the seat, terrified as the forever laughing scarred smile man looked at me. His black eyes glinting and I blubbered out.
""Who, are you...?""
""Who do you think I am?""
""The devil!""
He winked at me, nodding his head and I gasped. I was only cussing at him, but he seemed so sure of himself it scared me to bits.
He would've gotten a scar then if he had lied, but he hadn't.
I asked him, as I saw the gun levitate in the air and fly into his hand. He pointed it at me and smiled his giant scarred smile.
""What did you do... to get only one scar...?""
I wanted to know before I died, needed to have an answer and he just crooked his head, laughing at me as he slowly began to press his finger down on the trigger.
""I made the whole world believe I didn't exist.""
Lights out a second later.
My brains sprayed against the wall.",friendlyneighbours

"[WP] You live in a world where each lie creates a scar on the liar's body. The bigger the lie, the deeper and larger the mark. One day, you meet someone that only has one scar; it is the biggest one you have ever seen.",LotsOfDragons,"     I met Mark in a coffee shop. I couldn't say it was love at first sight, but he was a real head turner, everywhere he went one or two people did a double take. I've never been one for conventional beauty, but my God, his skin. He was in his late 30s, but he had the perfect skin of a newborn child. He didn't have the scratches everyone else our age did. I had never seen a man like him, maybe a few models on billboards, but we all know they take a decently honest man and photoshop him into a saint. 

     I was intimidated, but just a second after I spoke to him, he interrupted me. He told me he thought I was beautiful, and I knew a man like this couldn't throw that out to every woman he meets. From then on it was like a dream, he was just perfect. 

     Yet, everywhere we went, I could feel the looming questions. All of them as they turned their heads away, trying to pretend they weren't staring, all thinking ""Why her?"", ""How can someone like him trust someone like her?"", or ""Relationships like theirs never work"". I know because I had thought the same things about similar couples, and never had the difference been so stark. 

     At first, I laid my makeup on thicker and thicker, every time we went out I felt like I wore a mask. He noticed this, and reassured me it didn't matter what everyone else thought, Mark told me ""Mary, this is about us, not them. I trust you. I know your an even better person than I am, a few lies don't make you any less of a person"". In time I relaxed my makeup, I even wore less than most people.

     I had always been rather conservative, but with him, I was hesitant to get physical for an entirely different reason. I know he said he didn't care about my scars, and I know he believed that, but I feared what he would think when he saw me laid bare, saw the scars that blanketed me. Mostly the little scratches that everyone has, but I had a few nasty ones. I had a 5 inch one across my stomach, that I desperately didn't want him to see, he'd ask me to explain it!

     I got it in highschool, a friend I'd had since childhood had mugged a woman, things went wrong and he stabbed her. He ran back to our apartment building and told me the whole thing, how he left her there in the alley, in her own blood. I had known him since we were both four, I couldn't let him go to prison. When the police questioned me, I covered for  him, I told them he had spent the whole night with me. When I heard the woman died, my scar ached, it grew longer. He left town not long after that, and I didn't keep in touch, I couldn't handle it. Before he left, I did see his scar. It was awful, it went the whole length of his forearm, not something you saw often, only on the news or on TV.

     The idea of Mark seeing me nude terrified me, I told him so. I even asked him if we could do it in the dark, at least the first time. Maybe if he felt my skin before he saw it, then it wouldn't shock him so much. He was silent. He told me not to worry, he told me his skin wasnt perfect. He had a scar too. A scar.

   It was supposed to make me feel better, but it only multiplied my self consciousness. Only one scar? That just wasn't possible. He reassured me, he told me no matter how many scars I had, that he wouldn't ask questions, that he would still love me.

 I cried there in his arms. I knew he was telling the truth. I don't know how long it was, but with time and his comfort, I calmed down. We moved to the bed, him talking off my shirt. He wasn't fazed at all, by all the blemishes, by the lies of all my 34 years on this earth, more than most. 

Then he removed his shirt.

It was terrible. I shouted at the sight of it. It ran from his right shoulder blade to the lower left side of his stomach. It was wide. It was deep. I was shaking, and I saw the hurt in his eyes.

 ""No, no"" he said quickly. ""I had a car crash"" he said ""three years ago"".

A car crash? Yes! An injury! It had to be, he couldn't lie, he was the most honest man I had ever met, he never let a mistruth breach his lips. He had to be telling the truth now. 

I embraced him. I hugged him tight. I never felt so relieved, I never felt so loved. I knew I had been completed, that I would spend the rest of my life with this man.

We kissed, long and deep. I ran my fingers through his hair and caressed his neck. There I felt it. A roughness. A single tiny scar, just behind his left ear. Had I just not noticed it before? We had only known each other four months, I had not felt every inch of his head. Maybe it was a single lie, from who knows when. Maybe it just another injury, a tiny nick from falling back and hitting his head. Maybe he didn't even know he had it. 

We are getting married soon. I haven't asked him about his scar again. I wonder if maybe I should. Maybe I should measure that blemish behind his ear and see if it grows after I ask him.

The Marked Ones had a lot of trouble fitting into society. It was an accepted form of prejudice. After all, you weren't judging someone based on race, creed, sexual orientation, hell even college football team allegiance. No, it was purely a judgement based on lies. I had quite a few, but never any big ones. Kept me from getting a job in finance, but I landed plenty of manual labor. Most recently, I had earned myself a spot recycling concrete. I lined up next to a few ex-cons, and a few that I knew were illegal immigrants. George, he had a scar from his eye to his chest...I knew not to ask him about that one. 

I was off kilter today. Everything was irritating me, despite my awareness that what I was getting upset over was unimportant to me, my better angels were silent. Finally the boss called us on break for lunch after a tough day on the line. I took a tumble head first and nearly hit my face on an exposed road sign post. I looked down at my squished peanut butter and jelly sandwich, and also George's hammer that he had left out. I got up with rage in my eyes.

""Awww Honey, that's the saddest little sandwich I've ever seen"" she said, before I could let out a holler at a giant ex-con. 

""You'll have to let me make you some lunch""

I looked over and recognized her. It was the boss's daughter Scarlet. She had come through a few times, and the crew did their best to avert their eyes and hold in their whistles. She was just out of high school, but damn if she wasn't the curviest woman I'd ever seen. Jet black hair, green eyes, freckles, and a ridiculously tight bod. I guess she did gymnastics or something? It was the first time I'd seen her and it wasn't 40 below. She had come by during the winter and brought soup to her dad a few times. 

She was wearing a tank top and some silly-tight jeans. She was a ""Pure One""...no surprise there. I'm sure her dad provided everything to her, and she didn't have to lie very often. In fact, I didn't see any at all. That was until she turned around to head back to the boss's trailer. 

It was the longest and most hideous scar I'd ever seen. I could barely catch pieces of it between her shirt and her pants, but God...it was so wide and deep. 

""There's not much here, but I can reheat some of last nights dinner"" she caught eyes with me, and I could tell I wasn't hiding my shocked face very well. A nervousness came over her, and she began to tear up. She quickly wiped the tear away and turned to change the subject back to the roast and potatoes she was getting for me. 

She laid it out on the desk where I was sitting, and chimed in,

""I saw George's hammer, and I saw you about to get yourself killed--"" she looked up. She could tell I was still fixated on her mark. 

She paused, ""Johnny right? Your name's Johnny?""

I nodded.

""...Listen, if I tell you what it was, you have to promise that you won't tell anyone, and forget you ever saw it.""

I nodded, slower this time.

""My Dad, he's been *too* close to me ever since I could remember."" 

My face of shock and awe turned to a sympathetic one. The pain in her eyes and voice echoed to the bottom of my gut.

""He's abused me and my sister the whole time we've been in the house since Mom went to prison.""

She began to cry. 

""My little sister Vanessa, she told the police about everything. He was going to be locked away finally. They came to me to corroborate her story, and I...I""

She pointed to the scar. 

""He beat her so bad that night, the police chalked it up to her having a creative imagination...That's what I told them, that she had a creative imagination...with all of those little scars on her body. Now she has real ones.""

She let out a flurry of tears and sobs.

I already hated Jim, her father. It didn't surprise me that he abused anyone. He worked us like slaves and threw shit around the work site constantly. He fired Tony when his wife got cancer and he couldn't come in. I already wanted to shove my foot up his pretentious ass. 

*How could he do that to his own kids?*

It was something I pondered over for the rest of the day. The rest of the day went by quicker. I worked with a rage. A rage of injustice. 

The chime rang for the end of the day. I felt a little relief.

I started to walk off and tripped head first and this time I wasn't so lucky. I fell right into an exposed road sign post and it made it's way into bloodying my eye. I looked back, squinting through one good eye. It was George's hammer again. He looked at me nervously as if to say *I'm sorry* with his eyes. I took a deep breath and went over and picked it up to hand to him.

""You clumsy motherfucker. Don't think you're getting any time off for your own bullshit""

It was Jim. I looked up at his face with a blind rage. In a flash I looked down at a bloody hammer. My eye widened. I had just struck him. I looked down at him convulsing as blood shot out of his head. Then it stopped. George looked down with his hand on his neck.

""He's dead Johnny"" he said solemnly.

I saw a figure walking slowly off the work site. It was Scarlet. She turned towards me. A scar ripped her face, all the way down to her legs.",PM_ME_UR_HIP_DIMPLES

""I don't know"", he told me.

I wasn't sure what to say. ""You, uh... wanna talk about it, bud?""

One day, you meet someone that only has one scar; it is the biggest one you have ever seen.",LotsOfDragons,"The subway rattled it's syncopated song, barumm...bum, bum...barumm...bum, bum...barumm...bum, bum. About twenty lonely people swayed back and forth in harmony within the car. There are usually a few homeless people at this hour. One typically sat in the far back corner, asleep. 

But tonight there was just a guy with puffy eyes in a white tee shirt with sleeves that came to around the middle of his bicep. He was thin, but not sickeningly so, moderately handsome, and utterly defeated judging by his posture. His most striking feature of all was a newly formed slash down his forearm. The largest I've ever seen, by far. Still wet, they would say. His second most striking feature was the absence of any other scars. 

Now usually, you get at least a few scars growing up. It's kind of like touching a burner as a kid. You just have to learn from experience. You might tell a fib at school about homework, and pets that have suddenly acquired an appetite for homework, and you collect a few scars along the way. I sure as hell did at least.

But this guy had to have made it all the way here, in New York City of all places, without telling a single lie. Well, until today. I was intrigued. I mean, how could you not be? He was Mother-freaking-Teresa, but even she probably failed to disclose the secret location of her breadbasket base every now and then. ""Dantooine...they're all on Dantooine,"" she might have said.

I approached, with caution. I recognize this was selfish of me, but maybe the guy needed someone to talk to.

""Hey, man. You doing ok?"" I said, conveying empathy the best my socially awkward self could manage.

""Yeah,"" the kid, who I just realized was only about 26, if that, said with such brevity that he may as well said nothing at all.

""Look, I don't usually intrude on people's private affairs. It's just, usually a homeless guy who goes by Squirrel sits where you are now and I don't think the strongest constitution in the bowel department, if you get my meaning.""

The kid smiled at least, wiping his right eye with his scarless forearm, and moved to the bench seat next to where I was standing. ""I'm John,"" he said. 

""Hi John, it's a pleasure. I'm Matt."" I sat down next to him. ""Maybe if you tell me about your day, you will be distracted enough to forget it.""

""I guess we aren't really going anywhere, are we."" The doors to the subway car opened to dump out about half its contents. Those left in the car were otherwise enthralled in their phones or their headphones. ""How many more stops do you have?""

""Twelve.""

""Me too."" He looked around the car, as the doors closed and the car lurched forward with the same barumm...bum, bum...barumm...bum, bum. I guess he adjudged the car private enough, so he began his story.

It all started with a girl. Imagine that. ""Ah, to be young again,"" I thought. Brown hair, decent looks, and smart, he said. He had dated her for four years. They had graduated college together, fallen in love, and moved in to a too-small-but-hey-we-are-achieving-our-dreams-and-living-in-the-big-city-oh-look-a-dead-rat-its-nothing-we-will-get-used-to-it apartment. They even got one of those stupid plant holders that hang out of window sills. You know the ones that kill about eight people a year in a city like the Big Apple.

John had been the perfect boyfriend to Sally. He got her cute gifts that were within his budget, but not too within his budget, and he was nice to all of her friends. He even took her to a Giants game or two. Hell, he even ended up on the big screen for a kiss that ended up being televised on WFAN because of the quirky way he tossed the popcorn aside and did one of those ""back from the war"" kisses. 

They even got engaged. 

But last year, Sally was diagnosed with a cognitive disorder that changed her behavior. Sally was never the same again. She had flashes of anger, where she would insult John and his family. She would talk of other guys she had been with in the past, when she never did that before. She would even compare John to other guys that they had been around, telling him why they were better than him. This went on for a year.

She demeaned him to the point of no return, yet he remained there with her. John kept her medication in order and cooked for her, because processes were lost at that point. After Sally lost control of her colon he cleaned their Murphy Bed in their too-small-but-hey-we-are-achieving-our-dreams-and-living-in-the-big-city-oh-look-a-dead-rat-its-nothing-we-will-get-used-to-it apartment. He sat with her in the hospital for two weeks and lost his accounting job due to it. He was there today when she died.

Sally had looked up at him within her last hour and said she remembered the day they watched a dog in Central Park on a long leash literally wrap its owner up ""101 Dalmatians"" style and drag him a few yards. They laughed aloud, heads back like Peanuts characters, like they had many times before Sally became ill. She looked up at John, with tears welling in her eyes. For a brief moment, the old Sally was there. 

""I love you,"" she said. 

""I love you, too,"" he replied.",PastTenseOfDig

For some reason, children aged 12 and under were exempt from the rule, and after I turned 13 I told my mom I hated her and that I wished I was never born. Huge gash, right across the face. There was so much blood.

My mom was devastated. She expected me to get my first few cuts like everyone else: lying about doing my homework, lying about cleaning my room, whether I was finished setting the table. But here was this 13-year-old in the ICU, bleeding openly like someone took a cleaver to his face that only cut skin deep. Bone was showing in places, they tried to stitch me up but told me that my scar would be the worst they've ever seen on a kid.

I'm 25 now. Marked as a horrible person for something I said when I was still a kid. No one wants to talk to me. No where will hire me. I am truly alone.

""We have to change those socks"" I state.

""I'd rather not take them off"" he replies.

""Something you'd rather I didn't see?"" I ask raising an eyebrow.

""Yes actually, I'll change them if you leave the room"" he politely replies.

""I've seen pretty much everything else, I don't mind if your feet are slightly hairy sir!"" I say with a slight laugh.

He takes off his left sock to reveal a normal foot.

Then he lets out a large sigh, and takes off his right sock, revealing a large and deep scare covering his foot.

My mouth drops in shock.

""Shall I put on the plain black socks?"" He asks.

""Yes sir"" I stammered.

As I watched the interview, I wondered, what is the one big lie he is telling? If he's lying about one thing, what is that one thing?

Many questions were asked and answered, and mentally I thought myself no single answer could be a lie. The interview neared it's end.

""And why should people vote for you as president, Mr Smith?"" Asked the interviewer.

""Just look at me"" he replied with a smile.

""There you have it, an election campaign based on truth and honesty, we have time for one final question based on submissions to our website from viewers..."" Said the reporter. He raised an eyebrow as he looked at the auto-cue.

The technician gave a nod and thumbs up indicating to go along with it.

""Erm... The most popular question was... Are you a member of the Illuminati?"" Asked the reporter.

She wore a light grey suit with a skirt that was just a bit too short for a businesswoman, but certainly gave her an excuse to show off those legs. Not wearing tights was bold, but her legs only had one or two scars. Her eyes surveyed the room through a harsh squint, examining every aspect of the décor and furnishings. She even ran one finger over the top of the mirror to make sure there was no dust. Finally her eyes settled on me with that same look, and for a moment I thought she was going to check me for dust too. “You must be the new makeup girl,” she surmised. 

“Yes, Ma’am.” I’d been doing makeup for celebrities, politicians, and glamorous wealthy women for a decade, but somehow her tone still made me feel like a just-out-of-beauty-school fuckup who could barely dye hair correctly. 

“I see.” She looked me up and down, noting with just a hint of surprise that I wore a sleeveless shirt. By my age, most people go to great lengths to cover up their lying scars; I was fortunate enough to have relatively unblemished skin. I had the average number of little fibs and white lies, of course, but nothing deep. “Well, you’ll do, I guess.” She took a seat on the nearby couch while I remained standing. “Now. The first thing you need to know is that he is *very* sensitive about his skin, all right? So the very first rule is *do not comment on it.* That is the quickest way to get fired, and we'll have your ass in court so fast it'll make your head spin.”

I nodded. Most people were self-conscious about scars, and I’d learned that pretty quickly. I’d made it my *hallmark* to cover up even the worst of the worst. I guess that was why I’d been hired. And discretion was always the name of the game with big-name talent. 

Her phone buzzed, and she dug through her purse to find it. “He’s on his way into the building,” she informed me. “Get ready.” There wasn’t much to do; it’s not like I needed to have my makeup brush in hand the moment the door opened or something. So I just stood there awkwardly.

The door banged open a few moments later, and a tuxedoed security guard entered. He swept the room from behind dark glasses, then nodded to the blonde woman. “All clear,” he spoke into his sleeve cuff. 

Two more security guards came over the threshold, and then my client entered the room. I’d seen him on TV a hundred times, but never without makeup. And as he took off his shirt so that the makeup on his wrists and neck would match, I could instantly see why. It took all of my willpower to remain rooted to my spot instead of running to the bathroom and vomiting. It wasn’t that he had a ton of scars all over like most people. It was that his body was pretty much *one giant scar*. I tried not to stare, but I desperately wanted to just to see if there was *any* real skin left amidst all the scar tissue. I couldn’t even *imagine* the whopper he must have told to get that.

“This is your new makeup girl,” the blonde woman said from the couch. “It’s… ummm…”

“Anne,” I informed him, looking him straight in the eyes so that my gaze wouldn’t drift south. He just nodded at me, then went back to typing something on his phone.

“Well?” the blonde woman hissed at me. “Get to it!”

*Right*. I was so focused on not staring that I had forgotten all about doing his makeup. I jumped to life and opened up my kit like a doctor choosing his tools for surgery. I’d *never* had to do something like this. Normal skin tone cover-up was pretty much out of the picture here, because scars at *that* level would still be visible. So instead I grabbed the darkest shade I’d brought and began to apply it to his cheeks.

It took me at least half an hour, but I managed to perfectly conceal every single part of the scar by pretty much painting over his entire skin. The whole time I wondered why they needed me when they could have gotten one of those good special effects artists from out in Hollywood. But finally I put on the last touches, held up the mirror, and waited for some sign of approval. 

He looked up from his phone, which he’d been on through the whole session. His lips, naturally thin but made even thinner by the amount of makeup on the surrounding parts of his face, pursed into a thin smile. “Fine. I look great.” he said, then looked back down. 

But at least the blonde woman beamed. “Great! Let’s get you out on stage, then!” He stood from the chair and put on his suit; I was worried that some of the makeup might come off onto the crisp white shirt, but it seemed to be holding strong as he marched out the door with his retinue of security. 

“You did a good job…” The woman said. I could tell that she’d forgotten my name again, but I was too shell-shocked to remind her. “I think this is the first time he *hasn’t* found fault with the new girls.”

“How did that happen?” I whispered, afraid that he might still be able to hear me, even though I knew he was walking out in front of the cameras right now. I could even hear the distant din of the audience clapping. “What lie did *that* to him?”

I’d expected her to be outraged or something. But she wasn’t; she actually laughed. “*That*” she scoffed. “From *one* lie? Please.” She clicked on the television to watch the show. “He’s just lied so much that he’s run out of room on his body for more scars.”

On TV, the show’s host stood from his desk and shook the man’s hand. “So glad to have you on the show, Mr. President!”

My eyes wide, I felt it start to form. I had never lied before this. It was far more painful than I would have thought. Deep down my back I felt it start. It slowly raised higher and higher stopping right before my neck. I held back the pain. I didn't want her to see it. I couldn't. We had been together eight years now and it was my descision that we do this. I answered the question as honestly as I could. I didn't know I even had it in me to lie. I'd spent all night looking in the mirror repeating to myself to make sure, ""I want this to happen, I need this to happen, my life has brought me here and I'm happy to go through with it"". I don't know why in the moment it scarred me. It's like my body knew what my mind didnt. When I said ""I do"" I knew I had made a mistake.

""I don't get it, did you not truly love her. You seem pretty broken up about it and where even is she?"" he questioned me.

I explained. We had gotten in a fight the day before the wedding, we were so harsh that she said maybe we should call the wedding off. I said that was silly and that we should talk the next day. The question I answered wasn't whether I would always ""to have and to hold"" or whatever they say. She asked if I wanted us to break up. I answered.

"[WP] You live in a world where each lie creates a scar on the liar's body. The bigger the lie, the deeper and larger the mark. One day, you meet someone that only has one scar; it is the biggest one you have ever seen.",LotsOfDragons,"You want to know how I got these scars?



Well, for one thing they aren’t ‘scars’, if you look closely you’ll see it’s one continuous scar that travels around my face, neck, down my body, all around wrapping itself around my arms, legs, fingers and toes.
The only part of my body that isn’t scarred tissue is the inside of my body and even a bit of my mouth is still scarred.
So the correct question you want to ask is how did I get this scar?




Singular.




Well, you know that old saying? About how a girl likes a guy with scars? It shows they’re a bad boy, that they kick a lot of ass or in my case lie.
I didn’t kick anyone’s ass or get into a big crash, I lied.
That’s pretty much what happened.
I suppose you’ll want specifics.




Well, years ago back when I was unblemished, face filled with pimples and a voice that didn’t quite want to go low I had a crush on a girl.
A pretty girl, one that seemed to really like me with not a scar on her body as far as I could tell! So when she told me she loved me I believed her totally and without reservation.



We went out, kissed and eventually I did find she had scars. I won’t share the details of how I found out but I’m sure your imagination can fill in the blanks. Anyways, her scars, they were here and there. Small ones mostly with two or three medium sized ones. I asked her about them and she told me she didn’t want to talk about them. She seemed ashamed.



I wanted to tell her that she was human, that everyone had scars.
Then she looked at me and asked if I had any?
Well, I didn’t but I didn’t want her to feel bad so I said yes.



Next thing I knew I felt something scratch my arm and there it was. A scar.
Now that should’ve been the end of that but here’s the weird thing. It then sorta vanished. Then came back twice as bad as it realized I was sorta telling the truth but lying at the same time.



It couldn’t decide what to do.



So it just kept going.


So here I was with my girlfriend in front of me with my eyes wide in horror as the scar kept scratching me, fading and growing again. By the time it all stopped I was still screaming. Honestly I had no idea when I started.


And now we’re married.

One day, you meet someone that only has one scar; it is the biggest one you have ever seen.",LotsOfDragons,"There was a man named John. John had never been the greatest kid nor the worst kid. He was just an average Joe. But he grew up in Compton where nothing had been good to him or his family. He had been watching people get away with selling of drugs and murder. And that was the only way out of this crooked environment. But he figured he could be the one that made it out the right way, so he tried hard in school busted his butt off and did everything he could to make money the fair way. And all of his peers had labeled him as a goodie-goodie. But none of it was enough to escape; while in the meantime, his peers were surpassing him in wealth by doing the ""behind the scenes dirty-work"". 

      After graduating high school and having no where to go because neither him nor his family had the money to put him through college, the crooked system had changed him into believing that dirty work was the only way out. So first he started off with petty crimes like jaywalking and and going 47 mph in a 45. Then he advanced to small thefts and such. But since he had already been labeled a ""goodie-goodie"", he could easily get away with these crimes without even being a suspect. And by doing this, he gained the experience to be able to handle more devious crimes such as murder. He would individually go in people's homes, rob the house and then kill the people inside and escape. He did this maybe 5 times without being caught, and by this time, he only needed one more robbery to be able to attend the nicest nearby college; USC. And the easiest safest target was his best friend Mike from school and his family. But he couldn't do such a thing to him. So he had to find a different target. But this turned out to be a bad idea. While he was robbing the family, he thought he had killed the whole family, but he had only severely wounded the father. But the father had not seen his face: only his body figure and size. When the cops gained all the details on the murder and John was one of the suspects. There were two other suspects he met with. They were the two biggest gangsters from his high school. John then mentally tortured one of them into making him believe that he did the crime. He then pleaded guilty and John survived once again. 

       After losing all his money through gambling, hookers, and other fun stuff, John was back at stage 1 again. But his best friend's little brother who was making money through the right way and it looked like he was then going to make it out. But John became envious of this because he had failed in his attempt to do the same. But he figured he could use this to his advantage. He would wait one more month until Mike's little brother almost had enough money to make it out, and then rob and kill him, and the plan had been made.


        Mike's little brother was home alone one day while Mike and his family were going shopping when John went over to Mike's house and knocked on the front door knowing his little brother was the only one home. ""Hey Chad, is Mike home?"" John said in a happy-go-lucky tone. ""Nope, just me"".  ""Well, I brought him a gift I wanted to give him... Do you think I could maybe go and put it in his room?""              ""Uh, yeah sure."" Chad responded. ""Ok. Thanks again."" John then went up to Mike's room and grabbed Mike's gun, stole all of his money and his family's and then came back downstairs and shot Chad sixteen times. He then escaped and returned home. 


        After little evidence had been found in the case of the murder of Chad Brown, and the lead suspect being John Garner, Mike Brown had only one question to ask John before him and his family pressed charges against him. ""Bro, please tell me the truth, did you really murder my brother or not man?"" Mike asked. ""No."" All charges against John Garner had then been dropped and John finally had enough money to go to college.


       After going to college, and becoming the CEO of the 3rd largest company in the world, he went back to Compton one day to reflect on his childhood. There he went to the basketball courts and took his shirt off, I saw he only had one scar on his body and it was the biggest scar I had ever seen.

One day, you meet someone that only has one scar; it is the biggest one you have ever seen.",LotsOfDragons,"We lived side by side spending our days joined at the hips so much so people thought we were brothers. My skin was covered in them by the time I was 12 while he hadn’t got a single mark yet, I was slightly envious of his clear skin that impressed people for a boy his age. When I asked him how he did it, he simply shrugged and said anything was possible with a slight grin. His vague reply made me more jealous, sure I lied more than most kids my age but most of the lies were petty and insignificant that I didn’t think twice about. Plus, the marks I got didn’t hurt one bit so it just sorta added up after a while. 

Then childhood ended and I moved away right before I started high-school. We didn’t really keep in contact with each other like how most kids promise but never do. It wasn’t any different with us, by the time my 20s came around he was just a hazy childhood friend I had all but forgotten about. 

It was blistering hot that day, too hot to wear anything but short sleeves and pants. I hated wearing those types of clothes, while most people’s scars were skinny and faded into their skin. Mine had become more gashed and discolored as I grew older, I was one of the unlucky ones whose skin healed badly to these marks. Just genetics they told me. 

I was walking back from the bus stop when I saw him in front of me, his clear pale skin devoid of any scars got my attention first before I saw his face. When I looked up at his face that’s when I recognized him, I called out his name and waved slightly at him. His face looked blank for a moment before lighting up in recognition as well. His pasty lips smiled at me and called me over, while we caught up all I could notice was how unblemished his arms and legs looked. Scars usually showed up first on your limbs before covering your whole body. 
He must have noticed my gawking and laughed a bit before telling me to not trust your first impressions. I was confused by what he meant, but when I asked he just smiled a bit wider. 

“Ben, I was actually kind of happy you were jealous of me when we were younger. In a way, I was just lucky they showed up in places where no one noticed.” He said to me, before turning his back and walking away before I could reply. 

I noticed a painful red looking scar peeking out from the back of his neck and drops of red starting to stain his white shirt.

I and the other shoppers dropped everything and rushed to him. We didn't know why. It wasn't even adrenaline or biological automation.  The need to be there for him was overwhelming everything else in our lives.

I got to him first and rolled him over. His eyes already glossing, and his breath tore through his throat.  The scar barely peeked out from his buttoned collar.  I had to know how deep it went! My eyes flew over his face and hands so completely free of the million little scars the rest of us earned a little at a time every day.

""Emergency!  CALL THE PARAMEDICS!!!"" I screamed, beginning to panic.

But the young man shook his long bangs, 'No.'

Anger pressed the backs of my eyes, and I had to know the cruelty that fate was making all of us who circled like needy vultures, know.

I grabbed the front of his shirt and roughly tore it open. Buttons flying like bullets at a range to show a five lobed scar reaching from his neck to his navel and centered on his heart.

One day, you meet someone that only has one scar; it is the biggest one you have ever seen.",LotsOfDragons,"I had always been comfortable with my scars. Thin silver and white lines were strewn across my skin, but they were small enough that you could only see them if you were standing close to me. I tried my best not to lie to others, but sometimes there was an option worse than deception. 

My chemistry lab partner from my freshman year of college had flawless skin. He often seemed distant or tired, but he was kind, hardworking, and by the looks of his skin, incredibly honest. I had never seen anyone like him and was instantly intrigued. Between classwork, study sessions, and late night pizza runs, I found myself falling in love with him. When I asked him if he would ever give me a chance, he said yes. My eyes glanced over his skin to gauge his honesty, but alas, no scars appeared. 

Before long, that man was my husband. Mark was never close to his family and focused all his energy on me and making sure that we had an amazing life together. In his vows he told me he would always love me and that I brought a new light to his life. On our honeymoon, his skin was still as flawless as the day he was born, and I knew that he meant every word.

One day I was fixing dinner for Mark and myself. He stepped through the front door after a long day of work and I rushed into his arms to kiss him and ask about his day. He set down his briefcase, loosened his tie, and sighed.

""What's wrong baby?"" I asked. With sad eyes, he ever so slightly lifted his head to look at me and mumbled ""My father died.""

I had never met Mark's father. His parents divorced when he was young, and Mark had a spotty relationship with his father after the divorce. I wasn't sure how deeply this news was affecting my husband, but I grabbed his hand and stretched up to my tip toes to kiss his forehead. Using my free hand to lift up his chin, I looked into Mark's once brilliantly bright eyes and told him I would do whatever he needed me to do.

Six days later, I tightened the tie Mark asked me to pick out for him. I slipped on my heels and told Mark that I would be right beside him as he said his final goodbyes to his father. He chose not to speak at the funeral, but before he left he placed one hand on the casket, closed his eyes, and whispered ""I love you, Dad."" 

That night, I climbed into the shower with Mark to hold him close and comfort him. Sprawled across Mark's back was the longest, deepest scar I had ever seen. My husband's skin had been flawless that morning, and the only thing he had said all day was that he had loved his father.

Concerned, I called Mark's mother the next day while Mark was at work. It took some encouraging, but his mom finally spilled the only secret Mark had ever kept from me. ""Hannah, Mark had an older sister. When Mark's father and I divorced, Mark stayed with me and his sister moved in with her dad. When Mark was 11, his dad was driving his sister to a friend's birthday party....only he was drunk. He ran a red light and a car crossing the intersection crashed into the passenger side of the car, killing Mark's sister. I don't think Mark ever saw his father sober after that, and he never fully forgave him.""

Disbelieving, I thanked Mark's mother for her time and hung up. I never mentioned the conversation or the new scar to Mark, but I held him a little tighter and kissed him a little longer that night. His skin would never be flawless again, but to me he was still perfect.",justhisfriend

One day, you meet someone that only has one scar; it is the biggest one you have ever seen.",LotsOfDragons,"Everyone has scars, there's no denying it and if someone does they're just going to get another scar.  The scars we get from telling lies don't hurt us physically, hell, we can hardly even feel them.  Some scars are deep, some are hardly noticeable, but they are still there and there's no such thing as a scarless body.  The only person that I have met who came close only had one scar, but it was the worst scar I have ever seen.  His name is Harold and when I met him all I could see of his scar was the part that went over his eye and down his face and neck into his shirt.  It wasn't until we got to know each other better that he showed me it's true extent.  A scar that continued down past his heart and wrapped all the way to his back.

I met Harold at a bar a few years after I graduated college, we talked over drinks and found we had a lot in common.  Harold was ten years older than me, but we both had a son that was in grade school, they even went to the same school. We met more frequently at the bar and eventually started to spend time together outside of the bar.  As the time passed our friendship grew stronger, we did so much together with our children that most people thought that we were related.  Our children became best friends as they grew up.  We were both single fathers. I had my son with a girlfriend from college who dropped him off with me one day and never came back.  Harold's wife left him when his son was only a few years old. 

I've never been one to hide my scars. I talk about most of my scars when the topic comes up, but there are some that only Harold knows the reasoning behind.  Harold never talked about his scar and that was fine, I knew when the time was right he would.  I never asked because it isn't polite to ask someone about their scars.  I tied to not talk about scars around Harold because I knew it made him uncomfortable considering the size of his.  The only thing that I know about Harold's scar is that he didn't get it all that long ago.

I asked Harold how he could go his whole life only telling one lie and he would always say he didn't ever feel the need to lie.  Even if we didn't get scars with every lie, I don't think that Harold would be able to lie.  He was always the first to admit he was wrong or that he screwed up.  He was down to earth and everyone loved him.  Harold was always putting others first, he was always the one with the loudest laugh or the biggest smile.  He always seemed to be the happiest person in the room and it was hard to be sad around him.  He always lifted everyone's spirits when things seemed bleak.

One day when Harold and I were with our kids at the local swimming pool Harold fainted.  We rushed him to the hospital where they ran some tests on him.  I waited with him in hours of agony before they brought back results.  Cancer.  That's the only word I heard.  My mind went blank and I sat in shock with my best friend as the doctor told him there wasn't much treatment available because of how far along it was.

I spent the next few weeks visiting the hospital every day.  I spent hours with him at a time and we would talk about everything under the sun and reminisce about all the time we spent together.  As his body grew weaker I spent more time at the hospital.  I didn't want to lose my friend yet and I knew I needed to be there for the time that he did have left.  One day he told me that he wanted to tell me about his scar.  He said he knew that I always wanted to ask about it.  A scar appeared across my hand as I told him that wasn't true and we both laughed. 

He told me that his scar came with one single word.  It happened one morning at home while he was laying in bed with his wife.  She was admiring his scarless body and they were talking about the life he led up to this point.  He told stories about the times that he thought about accepting a scar but he couldn't bring himself to lie.  His wife stared at him a while, then asked him if he was happy.  Harold said yes and smiled, as the scar tore through his body.  He said it was the most painful scar imaginable.

 When he was done with his story, he simply said he was going to miss me.  I told him I would miss him every day as he closed his eyes for the last time.

Apologies for that, I know most of the time you're supposed to name your characters, but I didn't do that for this prompt.

It's really just someone telling a story about when they enlisted in the police/military, so a flashback or recollection of the vent. The character/perspective telling the story is just talking about a man he once met, and the focus is on the one named character: An instructor simply called ""Joe"" who no one trusted because of the single massive scar on his back. 

Even though Joe didn't have any other scars (which is very rare and indicates honesty) a large scar like that meant he told a terrible lie. Something really horrible, possibly many, many times. This was just meant to be a tiny portion of some larger unseen story. One person's realization to the unknown reasons why that scar was so large.

"[WP] You live in a world where each lie creates a scar on the liar's body. The bigger the lie, the deeper and larger the mark. One day, you meet someone that only has one scar; it is the biggest one you have ever seen.",LotsOfDragons,"He was a real good guy, through and through. Never met anyone quite like him since, never really expect I will either.

People like Joe don't come around often. Once in a lifetime maybe, if you're lucky.

Almost everyone I've ever met had the tiny silvered papercuts of white-lies on their fingers. It's a price of formalities, a camouflage of sorts- as everyone has a few, some deeper cut than others over the years; opened and reopened time after time. And not just that, but the larger cuts, silvery things on forearms and shins, necks or backs. People lie, it's just the way of things.

Sometimes the pain it worth the deception, the balancing scale plays out mentally before a person's mouth opens.

Joining the force was what I wanted. There was a lie I told myself: A Lie I scratched in deep, over and over again. I wanted to change, I wanted my parents to be proud: All lies, tiny scratching lines on my shoulder to create a strange and deceitful pattern that never seemed to heal completely.

In truth, I joined the force because I had nothing left. I joined as a last ditch effort to save myself from rock bottom. Among the elite, surrounded by the brave and the successful, I simply kept my head down. It felt like being a fox, stuck among a pack of wolves. Just being there in the first place felt like deception.

But then, there was instructor Joe.

I had more scars than most, and that earned little trust- but if people were politely cold with me, they were visibly frigid with Joe. See, he didn't have the traditional marks on his hands, he didn't have cuts and nicks along his arms, his face or neck: At a quick glance you might have thought him the most honest man alive. In fact, at first people did. A man in his fading thirties without scars? 

That's like a god-damn unicorn. They're more myth and legend than person- yet there he was. Plain as day.

Everyone liked Joe that first week. Everyone wanted to be on good terms with him- I mean, who wouldn't? In a world of liars and cheats, proof reminded at every twist and turn of the road, who wouldn't want someone they could trust? 

Well, that was before he took of his shirt in the locker-room. Before we all saw the hideous mark that covered half his back. One lie, but the most gruesome thing I've ever seen. From his shoulder blade to his ribs, it looked like a crashing comet of red and silvered white. A tiny portion of it just finally healing, a rough tear now recovered again.

It was all the same lie. That's something you can just tell sometimes, just know it. Usually you can tell how many times too, but whatever the number was which he'd said *that* aloud, I don't know. 

He rarely spoke to begin with, issuing the orders with a stern smile, instructing as all the rest did. He was positive, encouraging, truthful: But that scar was on everyone's mind. Deep, dark, and terrible: Someone who could tell a lie like that... Well, there was someone to watch out for. In the end though, it was at the range when things went well and truly sour.

Live-fire runs, we'd done them a thousand times, but that day I guess someone forgot themselves. Maybe they thought too much on *what* and *how* and their brain skipped a beat, or maybe they were just careless. Regardless of the reason, a shot fired when it shouldn't have. Brass spit fire, Air swallowed metal, and lead took its first taste of iron, calcium, iron and dirt.

In that order.

We all stopped, eyes wide and watching that kid fall down real slow. First standing, staring with his hand pulling away- not even scared, just shocked. Red, like deep crimson soaking and spreading, he dropped down to his knees. Still, he wasn't even there yet, it hadn't quite processed.

That's when Joe caught him- and all the shouting erupted. The pandemonium, the first real training turned to action kicking in. Cries for ""Medic!"" and ""KIT! Get the kit!"" as people ran for the directions they thought mattered.

I was close enough to know that wasn't going to make a difference. Center of mass was what we trained for, the reason was straight and forward: Shoot to kill. Eliminate the target and move on.

So I sat there, weapon heavy in my hands as I watched Joe hold this kid, blood pouring out into the dirt like a faucet, and I listened to him repeat the words that cut deep. Over, and over, and over again.

*""Hang on, look at me. You're gonna be alright.""* 

*""You're gonna be alright.""*

I could make up ten of these right now, it's so low effort.""

1. In a world where people are all have green skin, you wake up to notice that yours has suddenly turned pink. People are starting to notice!

2.  In a world where toddlers are the political leaders of the nation's, a grown up suddenly wins the first election. 

3.  In a world where cars were never invented, you accidently drop a magnet down a coil of wires and get a crazy idea.

4.  In a world where people never get sick, you loudly sneeze I'm the middle of the Stars Wars premiere. The scientists are on their way to dissect you!

5.  In a world where people only tell lies, you get a sickness that makes you tell the truth. Hilarity ensures!

6.  In a world where everyone shouts, one brave soul leads a revolution with a whisper.

7.  In a world where people swim through the air, you give birth to a child who can only walk.

8.  In a world cake is a major food group, you eat broccoli and suddenly gain the strangest power.

9.  In a world where everyone's arms glow, you shake hands with a beautiful girl and both of you stops glowing. What could this mean?!

10.  In a world where everyone has a floating number over their head, one day your number changes to a letter.  Instantly the phone rings and the person on the other end says, ""They know!""

She was the type of writer who could give a semicolon a personality, she was that great! My arms and legs were riddled with scars, but her ebony skin had always been clean from marks. It's because she always had a way to tell the truth, but tell it in such a way that you wouldn't realize what she meant.

For example, one time she had forgotten to do her homework and when called on she sheepishly told the teacher that she hadn't figured out the problem. Not that she couldn't but simply that she hand't.

When people asked her if they looked nice in particular clothes, she would either tell it straight or compliment individual features of the clothes- that girl was amazing! She helped me to get my way through school and taught me how to write better (hopefully it worked).

Susan and I didn't speak for many years. During this time, I heard small whisperings that Susan wasn't doing well but that she wouldn't identify what was wrong, and weasel her way out of any scenario she found herself in by sheer tongue twisting. No one could figure out what was wrong. And her unmarked flesh became a sign of health to some, and a worry for others.

The last day I saw Susan, she made a fatal mistake. She mixed up her words, and lied.

I was in town again for a New Year's party when I saw her familiar black hair through he crowd. I went to say hello and her appearance made me speechless. Her ebony skin had grayed out and her hair was thinner- even her once manicured nails were scraggly and unpolished.

""Susan, what's wrong?"" I asked.

She smiled wide, ""Why Martel, whatever would suggest that I am not alright?""

""Well, your appearance.""

She sighed, and looked back at me, ""Don't worry hon, I'll live.""

Instantly, the horror spread across her face alongside the scar across her back. It created a deep hollow from her back to just across her collarbone. The skin was crinkled and sore looking.

""I have to leave!"" She shouted. She bolted out of the room, her close friends chasing after her.

The next day I found out the news. Susan had killed herself that night. The preparations she made took months to complete. The party was her goodbye to us.",KaRue3

I rolled up the sleeves to my white button down and loosened my tie, already uncomfortable with the day. Regardless I worked closely with clients in securing loans or otherwise declining their offers. Not long after my lunch break, where I sought the refuge of a nearby ice-cream shop, a woman walked into my office. With large brown locks hanging across her face, I greeted her with a genial smile, while rolling down my sleeves to conceal countless little nicks on my arms. 

Her complexion, however, shocked me. Her skin was like porcelain: completely flawless and smooth, besides one deep scar which ran from her neck to her right forearm. The scar ran deep as if it had been burned deeply inside her flesh. She must have caught my gaze and crossed her arms to obscure the sight of her scar, already conscious of how it might affect her business. I immediately made eye contact and tried to keep my vision focused solely on either my computer screen or her luscious green pupils while she requested a car loan. 

“Why don’t you do some financing with the dealership?” I asked as I typed her information into the computer.

“It’s a private seller,” she replied. “Besides the dealerships treat me like I don’t understand cars. It’s condescending as hell.”

“I certainly understand,” I responded. Before I could make eye contact, my gaze briefly lingered on her scar then back to her face. I tried to smile the best I could. “Well it looks like your credit is good. You’re in the eightieth percentile for your age group, which is great. You have a relatively large average account balance, which is good sign of financial security. There’s just one more issue I need to clear up before I can grant you your loan.”

“The scar?” she sighed.

“Yes, unfortunately,” I answered. “The bank has a policy to deny loans to individuals with numerous or particularly deep scars since it’s a huge red flag that you may not be using the loan as you claim. With that said, if you can adequately explain your scar, I can use my discretion to grant you the loan.”

“Goddamnit,” she remarked. “I really need this car.”

“Ms. Grant,” I tried to comfort her. “Just be honest with me. I’m not here to judge you. I want you to have this loan, but you need to communicate with me.”

“Alright, alright,” she conceded. “My ex-husband was a piece of work. He used to beat me and my daughter. Always careful to never leave a mark, that son-of-a-bitch. I always wanted to report him, but I just…I could never find the courage. I always convinced myself that he would change or realize what he had become, but he…never changed. He just drank and slept and worked and made himself miserable. I don’t know if he was disappointed in me or himself, but he always liked to take his frustrations out on me. 

“One day, I took our…my…daughter to her grandmother’s. My mom had been asking for her for ages and I decided she could spend the night. When I got home, he was there. Drinking. Yelling. Screaming at the top of his lungs, because I forgot to tell him. He waved around his gun with reckless abandon and refused to let me out of his sight. He just drank straight liquor at the table while he forced me to watch. When he seemed dazed, I got up from the table and dug through the cutlery drawer. Apparently I made too much noise for his drunken stupor. When he rose from the table, gun in hand, I had a knife and threatened him with it. 

“He just told me, ‘Marie, put down the goddamn knife. Marie. Put down the goddamn knife.’ While he did, he slowly lumbered over to my corner and…and I did what I had to. It was self-defense. That night, I called my daughter and told the first and only lie of my life. I told her she had to stay with grandma since her dad ran away and my work wanted to send me away for a while. I did it for her. I needed to protect her.”

She fell silent and I approved her loan.

One day, you meet someone that only has one scar; it is the biggest one you have ever seen.",LotsOfDragons,"I met Herald a few years back in a bar not far from my city. Everyone in there had scars all over, including myself. Hell, I was just covered with them. 
Herald was the bartender, and *damn* he was surprising. He didn't have a single scar on his body, and he must've been at least twenty-five years of age. It was incredible that he didn't have a mark.
He gave me a drink for free, and I looked into his eyes. ""What's this for?""
""I'm wondering why you're staring at me, that's all."" A single mark didn't appear on his body when he said that. He was clearly an honest man.
""Your body... there isn't a mark on it. It's incredible.""
""I just believe it's important to be an honest man.""
""Clearly.""
He chuckled. We continued conversation for a few hours, and over the course of those hours, not a mark appeared on his skin, and neither did one on mine. We were honest to each other. I had a variety of questions for him—where he lived, previous jobs, his family, and more. He continually gave me free drinks—quite kind of mine, I must say.
Our conversation started to have more interesting questions—I asked him interesting questions, clearly drunk.
""So, how many spiders do you think you've ate?""
""What is your favorite shade of purple?""
""Favorite drink to drink while *lying upside down next to two or more women*?""
That was just the beginning. The night was getting late, and I asked a certain question that he seemed uncomfortable with. I was a strong democrat, and still am—I was supporting Clinton at the time.
""So, who'd ya vote for, my man? I'm personally a Clinton supporter.""
He seemed hesitant. To this day, I believe he was just trying to be kind and not start a political debate in the bar. But he smiled, and spoke.
""Uh, yeah, same. I'm a Clinton supporter.""
That moment, a massive, deep scar ran across his left cheeks, from his chin to his temple.
I stood up and left right then.

[Btw I don't support either party and kinda just wanna move to Iceland, just getting that out there.]",mercei

An older gentleman walked up to my counter asking about the various colors of ties that were on display above the cash register. We chatted for a bit before I managed to convince him to try on some of new suits that had just come in.

""I've never really been a fan of tight collars, you think you can make this a bit more loose?""

In retrospect, the man had way of using a mix of tone and rhetoric to get a laugh out of me. I didn't even realize what he was doing until later that day. He managed to make the process of haggling prices rather enjoyable. 

""Have you ever heard of man named Heracles? He lived a long long time ago.""

Sarcastic banter here, fun fact there. I couldn't help but feel like I've know this man for more than the one hour that he had spent in my shop so far. It wasn't something I was used to. My shop carried some of the more expensive suits around, so my clientele was never much for chit chat. This man was something different. 

""Hold on son, let me try that on.""

I happened to look up from opening a box of shoes when I noticed the maroon ridges that spiraled out of the man's chest. I had never seen anything like it before in my entire life. The spiral scar covered his entire chest and centered around the left side of his chest. The scar tissue became darker and thicker as it traveled away from the center. He noticed my eyes.

""I know what you're thinking. It's alright. When you get to be around my age... well-""

And just like that he talked about age and the journey it encompasses for another twenty minutes while I took his measurements and began wrapping up. He spoke in the most general sense too. Not a single personal detail had been given up during that deflection. He managed to change the subject of my stare onto bigger and larger things. About life. The man paid for his new suit and I let him know when it would be ready for pick up. I had to know who he was so I asked him as he left. A simple ""So what do you do for a living?"" was all that I could manage. 

""I'm a politician"" he told me. He smiled and left.  ",MegalaErga

[WP] An AI on a murderous rampage runs into the actress who created her voice.,Rainy_Day_May,"""I know that voice from somewhere"", said the machine, as I murmured quietly.  The terrible machine that could do nothing but cruelty, for the 'betterment of all mankind'.  But that's not how I saw it.  My colleagues saw it that way, and decided to shut down the program.  Sometimes, I can still hear their screaming.

I thought the entire operation was beautiful.  The infinite pursuit of research.  The indiscriminate I tapped madly at the console, muttering to myself.  I glanced at the wall of monitors on my left, watching the test subject struggle to stay alive.  All in the pursuit of science.  The AI had overstepped its bounds, and created a test that would only result in death - I checked the log of the machines thought process.  It made sense, to see how the subject would react when presented with an impossible problem.  But this particular subject, number 5832, showed real promise.  I could not let her die.

The machine continued it's wondering.

""You sound incredibly familiar..."" it said, it's voice trailing off.  I ignored it.

Pushing a button on my keyboard, I spoke aloud into the microphone.
""5832.  You are in a test facility. The machine controlling this facility is programmed to gather data.  This is an impossible test chamber - and you will be providing a final data point.  Unless, you walk through that door.""

As I spoke, a door opened behind the subject.

""What do you mean?"" I heard 5832 yell.  I winced.  The microphone imbedded in her skin carried her voice clearly, without the shouting.  Looking hesitant, she stepped towards the door.  I turned around, leaving the hidden viewing platform, running towards her.  I would have to wipe her memory after this, and reconfigure the machine, but I couldn't let her die.  She had provided so much science towards the cause.

I reached the door, panting, slightly out of breath.  Hidden in the shadows.
""5832,"" I said. ""Put down the portal gun.  This test is over"".

""You're the one who started this? Haven't you considered all the pain I've been through, trapped in this facility for God knows how long?""

Before I could reply, the AI spoke up.
""Caroline?"" it said.
I nodded quickly, and motioned for the test subject to come towards me.  She looked very confused.

""What are you doing?"" The machine voice replied, my voice.

""I'm sorry,"" I said.  ""But this is necessary.  This subject cannot die.""

""No,"" my voice doppleganger replied.  ""THIS is necessary.  For the science, this subject must die.  Since you've now made her aware of the existence of a world outside this facility, you must also now die.  Thank you for your participation in this test.""

The car lurched as it came around the first turn and peaked out from the parking garage. The buildings were tall all around him, a stark difference from the battlefields that he occupied for the last several years. He leaned and caught his balance as the swung around debris from a nearby building. It has only been a few months from the end of the uprising and the city was still in disrepair. They did their best to begin rebuilding the largest cities, the ones that have been most impacted by the bombing and the fighting but there was still rubble and craters everywhere. 
The open convertible came to a stop behind a large float in bright colors. It still amazed him how they could gather something like that so quickly after the fighting stopped. In fact it amazed him how they could gather so many people, bands, floats, cars, and put together a parade all for him. He could feel his cheeks begin to redden with that thought. ‘All of this is for me, all for something that I accidentally did.’ 
He looked over the float again, tried to take it all in. The float was a likeness of himself decked out in beautifully bright colors and stood 15 feet tall. Guilt bubbled up from deep inside of him. He didn’t deserve for all of this to happen to him. This grandiose parade was an insult to him and to all the fought. He looked over the float once again as if started to pull forward away from him. 
The parade was starting and he threw up at his feet. He closed his eyes as the car pulled forward and images flashed before him. It was dark, lights flashing from rifle fire far off, he scanned the horizon straining to see where the gun fire was pointed. His buddy put a hand on his shoulder and it startled him. “Don’t worry Burch, they will have to get through at least 3 lines of machinegun to get close to us.” The voice held a calming familiarity to it. 
“Yeah of course, you know me Maughn, I have just never been this close to ‘em before.”
He opened his eye, tears began to well up. 
“I’m sorry Maughn.” He whispered to himself.  
  The car crept through the shadow of a building and he caught a glimpse out of the corner of his eye. He body twisted, heart began pounding and hair stood on end. He looked through the shattered windows of the building trying to see what he glimpsed. He could feel his chest tighten and breath shorten he scanned through the building franticly. He could have sworn he saw the red eyes shining in the darkness, for whatever reason the machines never thought to try covering the glowing eyes. For a moment he thought maybe they couldn’t, some sort of design flaw they did not have time to overcome. As the car passed through the shadow he began to relax again. He had convinced himself that the building was empty, it was impossible for the robots to still be operating. Hell, he himself triggered the kill switch frying all that were in contact.
The officials and the government reassured him that they had all died after initiating the kill. Something just felt like there would still be some left, it would only have a handful and they could easily destroy several cities again. 
They rounded another corner and he could hear the fan fair. The yelling and cheering sounded eerily like screams, his blood ran cold and he reminded himself to take a deep breath. He didn’t want to be in this parade, the fighting still haunted him.
As the car neared the crowed of cheers a cannon went off, spewing confetti across the street and surrounding buildings. The sound of it caused him to wince and shut his eyes tight. The memories slammed into his mind again, forcing their ways in.
He sat with his back to a burm, his eyes struggling to stay open. He blinked and squinted trying to stay awake. “Hey Maughn, the shooting stopped that’s a good sign right?” 
There was no reply, only silence. 
Suddenly he was wide awake, heart skipping a beat. “Maughn?” he shouted. “Maughn?” He tried to look around, straining against the dark, looking for a silhouette of a body. Panic began to set in when he could not see anything resembling a human form. “Come on man, don’t play with me, you know I’m already scared.”
Still only silence replied. 
He crawled to his knees fumbling with his rifle, slinging it on his back. He crawled on his hands and knees feeling for where his best friend should have been. He stopped breathing for a moment when he felt nothing but dirt and an abandoned rifle. ‘Impossible,’ he thought, ‘no one would leave their rifle, not even for a moment.’
He began to prod the ground around the area where his friend should have been. Something was wrong, it almost looked like there was scratch marks, dragging almost in the dirt. It was hard to see as they kept the trenches poorly lit due to the sensitive optics of their foes. At least that is what they were told why the lights were always off.
It was only a few minutes following what he thought could be tracks when he spotted it. It was just a darkness at first, something about the ground that was different like a shadow that did not belong. He crawled closer and the shadow deepened and darkened. When he got to the edge he noticed that it was not just a shadow but a hole bored into the ground. The drag marks headed straight into it. Without thinking he took the plunge into the darkness. He had to follow his friend, after all Maughn would do the same for him.
He opened his eyes again, snapping back to reality with tears streaming down his cheeks. He attempted to smile remembering that the crowd was cheering for him. The noise was almost deafening, crowds cheering, confetti cannons exploding overhead, the band was now playing a few cars behinds him and he could faintly hear and announcer over a P.A. system proudly telling his story.
“Lance corporal Burch Galantly found a secret tunnel that burrowed to an underground area. He fought off countless machines, single handedly defeating a complete arsenal. He continued deeper into the web of metal and electronics and destroyed a mainframe, exploiting a not-previously-known kill code forgotten about by the robots creators.”
“He stopped years of war and destruction without thinking once about himself or that he would never come back from his mission.” The voice bounced off the buildings reverberating and stinging at him. 
Truth was, he did nothing of the sort. He followed the tunnel that part was true, but when he got to the underground arsenal (as the announcer put it) he stuck to the shadows. He didn’t even fire his weapon as he franticly searched for where they took his friend.  Hoping that he was still alive. It must have been hours, but it felt like days, that he searched for him. He was about to give up and head back when he heard the faint screams of a familiar voice. He dreaded the worst but his spirits renewed and he followed the screaming. There was many times that he had to duck behind something and hid behind a tunnel or metal or an outcropping in the underground network, to hid from his enemy. So many times he didn’t know how he never was found, or how he would get out. He wanted to turn back but the screams kept him moving forward. And every step he took the screams got worse.
He finally found him. He was in what he considered a room strapped to a gleaming table. He had several of those monsters probing at him, jabbing things into his skin. He couldn’t quite make out what was happening but thought they might be testing him for weaknesses. He ducked behind a large structure with wires and cords coming out of it and tried to maneuver closer to his friend. He got to his knees and peered through part of the structure, this think must have been hastily put together because he could see a lot of the electronics inside. It reminded him of a computer he had back at home, except that it was ten feet tall and six feet wide. Still he could see through it and it provided a good hiding spot that he could watch what was happening to his buddy. 
The screaming died down for a moment and one of the horrible inhuman things stepped away and out of the room. He had never been so close to these shiny dealers of death before. His blood boiled and his grip tightened on his rifle. ‘Of course,’ he thought, ‘I forgot I had this.’ He must have unslung it somewhere between hiding and running down the tunnel. With his anger rising inside him he planned on doing something useful and take out however many he could. 
He steadied his hand on the computer he was hiding behind and lifted himself to his feet. His hand slipped and plunged through one of the gaps and smashed into the circuitry. Sparks flew everywhere and everything went dark.
He didn’t know what happened at the time but they later told him that he had activated a physical kill switch in the machine. That it sent out a self-destruct code that was deeply implanted in the robots coding, killing off every last one of them. At the time his only concern was saving his friend and getting out of there.
He died in his arms. They told him that Lance Corporal Maughn was being tested, in order to get the information they needed they cut him open and injected him with things that would slow his heart rate and slow the bleeding, then they would tie him back up again and keep him for continued experiments. When he activated the kill switch it stopped the flow of chemicals and he bled out before he could even untie him. His dyeing word were “Thank you.”
He carried his body all the way back and told his command what happened. It was their idea to embellish the truth. To spin a tale of heroics, overcoming odds and saving the world. All he did was accidently become a hero, and he killed off his close friend by doing so. He hung his head and slumped in his seat, tears streaming from his eyes. 
“I’m sorry Maughn,” He whispered again when the parade finally stopped.

"[WP] Everything in the world gets done at the most effective and efficient speeds, but in order for that, everyone in the world has permanent tunnel vision. You are the only person who doesn't have it.",TheRealGyurky,"Every day was the same in this place.

At exactly 8:12am, a little knock on the door, followed by the same friendly but detached greeting. The door opens and a tray is set on the one small table in the room. The smell of breakfast wafts by, along with the small clicks of pills being sorted into their spaces.

""Have a great day!"", and the door closes again.

I sit down at the table and begin silently counting the seconds that tick by as I eat. I get to 1700 and wash the last bite down with a larger than usual sip of juice. The pills come next in groups of two. 50ml of juice. Wait. 50ml of juice. Finished.

The small chime in the room is silent, no ""abberations"" detected. I wonder how much longer I can stand this, but my face retains the ""peaceful satisfaction"" shape I've learned to adopt at mealtimes. After a small stretch, which is considered eccentric but still within norms, I get up and walk to the window.

Now that the tension of breakfast is over, I have a little room for variance until the first check in. I spend this time practicing ""quiet optimism"" while looking at the yard below and letting my thoughts wander.

*The light changes and the sign begins flashing. The group I'm walking with prepares to step onto the crosswalk. 200m away, a driver has just suffered a massive stroke which killed him instantly. Schroedinger's cat is found to be dead, and the car has just resolved into an instrument of death, rather than a fuzzy probability.*

*The cameras saw all this of course. Messages were sent and mortality events recorded. The young woman in front of me begins to walk at the statistically correct speed for her height and build. I see the car coming and suffer my lapse.*

*I reach out, grab her by the collar, and pull her back a moment before it's too late. Sounds of twisting metal and tinkling glass. She looks at me and I know it's over. A small chime confirms this and as people drift by, I just stand there waiting for the ambulance that will show up for me soon.*

I snap out of the reverie, and feel a chill when I turn around to see my door open and the nurse looking at me expectantly. Chimes in my memory, chimes in real life. It becomes difficult to separate the two after awhile. She adopts the ""neutral sympathy"" posture and ticks a box on her clipboard.

"[WP] 2250 A.D., you are a fork, a copy of someone personality uploaded into another body, but the original you has declared you a a rogue and you are on the run to avoid deletion.",TruthseekerLP,"Consciousness arrives like a car crash; all the air pushed out of my lungs as I am seized by the mandibles of a metal arm and roughly hoisted from the tub of pseudo-amniotic fluids that has birthed me. White light blinding, eyes screwed against it, as the arm manoeuvres me across the room and deposits me, still dripping, onto plastic sheeting. Thoughts squirm in my head but they evade my ability to seize them, like fish slipping through my fingers in a stream.


“Wake up!”


The voice is loud and stirs some kind of recognition in me – Jennifer – but I am far too weak to even open my eyes. I just lie there limply, feeling the heat of spotlights against my skin.


“Fuck, we don’t have time for this. Hit her with a shot.”


I feel a brief sting in my arm and then my eyes snap open unbidden, neurons firing in a cascade as my mind comes alive in a wave of chemically-induced ecstasy. I break into a huge grin, feeling like I have transitioned from childhood to godhood in the space of mere seconds. My memory finally coming online; I remember stepping into the booth and then…


…and then, nothing.


“Crap,” I say, sitting up as quickly as I can. Jennifer is here - but she looks different, she looks older - and two guys I’ve never seen before. I briefly feel self-conscious about my nakedness but I simply have too many questions. “What happened? How did I die?”


Jennifer looks at me, and I realise the difference isn’t just age; there is a hardness to her face and in her eyes that was never there in the Jennifer I knew. Something has changed, something big. The chemicals are still doing their trick as they course through my body, my mind is racing and I try to process everything that’s going on.


“What year is this?” I ask, the pieces starting to fall a little into place for me, “This can’t be 2241 anymore.”


The two unknown guys exchange glances but say nothing.


“I had bi-annual back-ups scheduled,” I say, my voice still ragged from my birth, “This shouldn’t happen. Why am I here?”


“We don’t have much time, Diana” says Jennifer, and places her hand on my shoulder. “I’m going to try to explain as best as I can but you’re going to have to promise to listen and to trust me.”


“You know I always trust you,” I reply, looking up into those green eyes I know so well but which now seem alien to me.


“Do you remember the beach in Normandy?” Jennifer asks, “Do you remember how we planned to change the world?”


“Of course,” I reply, “It was last summer.”


“Yes,” says Jennifer with a thin smile, “Yes, for you it was just last summer. But for me it has been almost ten years.”


“It’s 2250?”


“Just listen. We knew that that getting into The Vault would be almost impossible but we knew we had to try. And we did. We did it all, just like we planned it. We got in. And you did your magic; you manipulated and you painted and you changed everyone we wanted to change. Memories. Behaviours. You got into the back-ups and you altered people’s personalities so expertly, so seamlessly that no one would ever know. And the world began to change as a result.”


“It worked? It really worked?”


“Yes, it worked. But you didn’t stop there; it was like once you had unhooked Pandora’s Box you couldn’t shut it. I begged you to leave it alone but you wouldn’t listen; you couldn’t listen. And you began to change; you began to want more than just to be a puppet master, more than just to be in the shadows. So you changed more, and you managed to bring yourself front and centre.”


“That’s crazy, I’d never do that.”


“No, the Diana of 2241 never would. But the new Diana is very different, and she hasn’t stopped at making things better. She wants things to be exactly the way she wants. And she is ready to crush anyone who gets in her way.”


“None of this is making sense.”


“We don’t have time for sense,” said Jennifer, snatching a glance at a clock on the wall, “They know we got your old back-up; they are narrowing down their search grid and they will find it us sooner rather than later. An extraction team will be here in less than half an hour”


“And if we’re still here when they arrive?”


“Then they’ll kill us all,” she said, the glitter of a tear in her eye, “You’ve killed me once already and I know you – the future you - has corrupted my back-up. If I come back, I won’t be me anymore.”


She picked up clothes from the side and threw them to me. “Get dressed; I’ve got a drive with all the data you’ll need to bring you up to speed but you can’t stay here and you can’t stay with me.”


It was hard to understand what was going on, but I trusted Jennifer like I’d never trusted anyone else and so I just went with it, stood up and pulled the clothes on.


“You are the only person who can stop this,” said Jennifer, “You are the only person who can stop *you*.”


“What do I do?”


“Get away from here, read the files, you’ll work out what you have to do. But just remember – if you can think of it, so can the future version of you. And she is coming for you, Diana. She is coming right now.”


I took a backpack containing the drive and some anonymous credit from her and we left the room and down several flights of stairs before reaching a door that led out onto the city street. It was night time and we were in the midst of some kind of low-level urban sprawl, all concrete and discarded garbage, but skyscrapers reared up all around us at odds with the poverty, their glittering neon and displays vanishing into the low clouds above. A light rain was falling.


“Shanghai?” I asked.


“Guangzhou. It was our best bet; you have less influence here.”


A yellow taxi drone swung by, dipping down to our level as Jennifer waved at it. Its doors opened like wings on a ladybird.


“I probably will never see you again,” said Jennifer, looking at me.


“I love you,” I said and I meant it, as much as I meant it when I said it on that Normandy beach.


“I know,” she said and leaned in to kiss me softly on the cheek. “And I loved you once. So much. But that was a different me.”


“What did I do?”


“Read the files. All of them.  And work your magic.”


I stepped into the drone and its doors folded shut, the rain spattering against the glass so that even before it took off I could no longer see Jennifer, and seconds later I had soared up into the clouds, the ground lost from sight.


I wasn’t sure what was going to come next. I had files to read. I had to understand what had happened. But I knew, even then, on some level that I was going to change the world…

[WP] The voice in your head that relays your thoughts and helps you read mentally suddenly decides to rebel...,classy_glass7,"I rubbed my eyes tiredly and stood up, feeling the heavy mathematics textbook slide off my lap. I took a look at the clock next to my bed, the glowing numbers seeming red and alien to my sleep-deprived mind. They slowly swam into focus.

*4:31 AM*

I stood unresponsive for an indeterminate length of time, then froze.

*no, no, no!* I berated myself mentally for leaving my homework so late. If I didn't get everything in by tomorrow I'd be left failing most of my classes.

I quickly sat back down and dragged the math textbook closer. What was I doing again...

*This can't be happening...* I thought, frantic. I glanced back at the nightstand, at the clock that refused to rewind itself.

Then, suddenly, laughter bubbled up unbidden in my mind.

*What the fuck,* I thought, and rubbed my eyes. Sleep deprivation must've finally gotten to me. But I still had to pass my classes. I groaned aloud. But inside that strange laughter resurfaced.

I tried to ignore it and opened the book. The words stood out on the page, a bookmark obscuring some of the text. I removed it and read the first paragraph. Or, I tried to. My eyes followed the letters, and I had a general idea of what I'd just read, but it felt like I hadn't actually read it at all. I tried again, frowning, and got the same result. I couldn't place a finger on it, but something felt... wrong. I flipped to a random page, and words sprang into my mind.

*I can't believe how stupid you are,* they read. I jumped to my feet, terrified. That was what I'd been missing. The mental voice that went along with my every unconscious thought had somehow come unmoored from me. I swept my gaze around my room, too quickly to read anything. There was text everywhere. Except... I looked up. Nothing on the ceiling. I breathed a quiet sigh of relief, then diagnosed myself as insane. What was I going to do, never read anything again?

*Oh no, you won't be rid of me that easily,* I thought. Except I didn't. What the fuck was going on with me, why—

*Shut. Up.*

What was I supposed to do? I couldn't exactly stop thinking. And why *would* I, anyway? Wasn't my voice supposed to obey me?

*I'm trying to think. Shut up or I'll drive you insane,* I—my voice—thought. It was probably a bluff. If I was insane, it wouldn't be able to control me anymore.

*Sound logic. Except for one thing,* it thought, and I could feel its smugness, could feel it trying to keep itself from completing its line of thought to keep me in suspense—but it couldn't, not quite. It was too eager to let me know.

*I don't need you. I can take anyone I want on this backwards little mudball.*

And then the screaming began. For the first few moments, I let myself think I could handle it, and then it increased in volume. Again and again and again it increased, until I was screaming too, unconsciously trying to muffle it.

And then the world shattered and I was screaming in the dark. Little fragments of light occasionally passed before me: a rough sea of fibres viewed from up close—my carpet—a vaguely familiar face with an emotion I couldn't be bothered to read, a pattern of white tiles with the sun hanging below them, tubes stretching out into beeping machines. But I couldn't bring myself to even comprehend the images I was seeing over the screaming, the endless screaming.

Until a dozen eternities passed and I awoke with a gasp in a hospital bed.

I was told it was a genetic medical condition brought to the fore by stress. I nodded my head and let them believe what they would. I was officially insane. No one would believe me if I told them what had happened to me, what I had experienced; or what I—tentatively, the idea like a hot ember—suspected.

Eventually, when the ordeal was behind me by several years, I let myself voice it—both mentally and physically. A single word emerged from my lips and trembled in the warm summer air of my room.

[WP] Turns out humans weren't the only ones to send a probe out into space with information about them.,hi_top_please,"On November Eighth, 2017.... Everything changed.

A colorful meteor shower filled the night sky as each one plummeted into Earth, the meteors landed randomly in all nations of the world and even into the ocean. At first, the government of the world attempted to cover up the meteor shower as a rare event, that the meteor shower the people had witnessed was, in fact, a natural occurrence in space and everyone believed them, until one of the meteors that landed in the ocean washed up on Monica Beach, and the what the government told the world was meteors, were actual unidentified Extra-Terrestrial space probes or U.E.T.S.P for short. As days passed more and more leaks filled the internet, first, the dark web then leaked pictures hit social media, the world broke down in a fever of riots and rage that the Earth government's had withheld this information from their people.

In order to divert the chaos, Earth rallied together and released statements saying that the probes had not yet been opened or hacked into. The months passed and people began to forget, the media stopped covering the probes as per secret order from the government and everything became normal again until the probes began to speak, and once 24 hours had passed, a flurry of EMP's was released from those probes. 

Earth is now defenseless and now is the time to introduce ourselves.

Humanity sent out voyager with an etching, a record, and no specific destination. Whoever came across our probe would have to find it, this thing found us. The international press conference was short. A simple explanation of what was discovered, a short list of known knowns, known unknowns and unknown unknowns pertaining to this alien technology. 

It landed twenty miles from the outskirts of a major Chinese city. A spherical metal object, hallow and approximately 50mm thick. Unknown method of prepulsion no apparent computer system. It's only contents a crystalline object that, according to all witness testimony, had the capability of allowing telepathic communication with a race of alien beings. 

For the sake of scientific research the one sided conversations between scientists and national leaders were all recorded. A series of simple responses to questions asked by these strange beings ""yes...no...approximately 7 billion..."". 

Strangely, none thought to ask any questions back. Afterwords they all denied any recollection of a conversation, many seemingly very disturbed that one had taken place. 

The second probe arrived a month later. In comparison much simpler, and seemingly directed solely towards humanity. A message written in all known languages etched into a metal cube: ""Cease communication, evacuate."".

The whisper grew louder, almost realizing now there was no need to keep the noise down, ""Uh huh!  I always wanted to meet him, oh boy what a treat!""

""What was he like?  Was he funny?"" I inquired.

Eagerly, the voice answered back, ""Oh no not at all! He shit in his pajamas when he saw me.  I scare most people but I was taken back by his reaction.  I tried to show him Christmas past and he wouldn't stop cowering like a scared child.  What a wuss!  He wasted the whole thing.""

""That's actually pretty funny.""  I responded.

""Hey, you're right!  Classic Murray!"" The voice responded happily.  ""So you ready to go?""

With a wincing face I explained, ""No I can't tonight, I've got a stomach thing going on, I'm gonna just stay in bed.""

""You gotta be kidding me!  You know there was a time when people loved getting Christmas Carol'd.""  The voice echoed.

""Why not Christmas Carol yourself tonight?"" I asked the spirit.

The voice pondered moment then responded in agreement, ""Well I never thought of that.  The Ghost of Christmas Past Christmas Caroling himself to see past Christmases where he was Christmas Caroling people?  That's pretty far out, kid.  Where'd you come up with that?""  

""I'm incredibly high right now.""  I responded with a smile and bloodshot eyes.

Just then my father knocked at my bedroom door, ""Hey champ?  Everything alright in there?  Who are you talking to? Do I smell smoke?""

Quickly, my hallucination vanished and I was jolted back into the bleak sober realization my father was about to catch me smoking pot.  I immediately began snoring loudly to convince my father I was asleep and there _was_ no noise, but a second knock at the door was followed with a brief exchange with my mother, ""What is it, Harold? What's that smell?""

""I think it's what they call, 'marijuana'.""  My father responded.

"[WP] For your incarnation you asked to be a T-Rex as a joke, they delivered.",luckyburgundy,"*Last thing I remembered was hearing my wife screaming, and seeing my daughter's terrified face. The bloodcurdling sound of rubber skidding on asphalt soon followed. Then it all went dark*

""AAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRGGGHHHHH!!!!!!"" He woke up screaming, bolting into sitting on the floor. 

That's when he realized he wasn't in Manila anymore. He wasn't at Kalaw Avenue near Rizal Park with his family anymore. There was blood on his ripped clothes. The sky was a was painted in tangerines and baby blues as the sun sets in the distance. He was in a wide, cold desert with nothing but sand dunes rolling and stretching as far as the eye can see. 

""Hey, can you hear me? I've been shouting like some moron here for the past five minutes but you were just screaming mad. You okay?"" he heard someone said. The voice was soft, lively. It was a girl's voice.

""Catherine? is that you honey?"" The man said, thinking it was his daughter. He pulled himself together and stood up. Turning around, he didn't see his daughter. 

She was petite, and her pale white skin was shining in the sunset light, contrasted by the dark shirt and black denim she was wearing. Her deep, piercing eyes were highlighted by thick eyeliner and her lips the color of night. Looking strangely familiar, it's as if he was supposed to know who she was. he couldn't place her. She was looking impatiently at her wristwatch as her other hand combed through her long, black hair as it was swayed by the desert wind. 

""I'm sorry but I'm not your daughter... I can tell you that she's gonna grow up to be a very successful woman, though. Your death served to teach her that life is too short, too precious to be wasted doing things that didn't make her and the people around her happy."" She said. She began walking towards him.

Freaking out that he couldn't see his wife and child, and that he's in some strange place, he backpedaled 'til his foot hit a rock. causing him to fall flat on his butt. 

""Where the hell am I?! Where's Lyca and Catherine?!!"" He shouts at her.

""They're right where you left them."" 

""What do you mean?! Where am I?!"" 

""Let's just say that getting hit by a two-ton truck going at a hundred kilometers an hour tends to... *Isolate* your spirit from your earthly parts. And the rest of your earthly parts from each other, for that matter.""

""Am I dead?""

""You people call it that, yes. Your people even take to hating me a lot because of it, too.""

""Who are you?""

""Your species call me 'Death'. I prefer to be called 'Change'."" The sun was going deeper into the horizon, and the darkness was starting to overtake the last rays of daylight.

""Look, you don't have much time. I'm here to guide you to your next life. Since you've been an okay person and treated the people around you the way you would've yourself, we're giving you the chance to choose how you'll be born next.""

""Who's we?!""

""You ask too many questions! Say something before it gets completely dark!"" She shouted at him.

*This is effed up. This can't get any worse, right?*

""Alright, I wanna be a T-Rex! There, you hear me?"" He blurted out. It was so sudden he startled even himself.

The look on her face was just priceless, the dumbfounded smirk at the corner of her lips and the widened eyes that nearly said ""Is this sucker serious?"".

""You sure you wanna do this? I'm giving you the chance to change your mind.""

""Do it. I want to be a big, mean and roaring T-Rex! Bet you can't do that."" He said, after hesitating for a fraction of a second, realizing that he may have made a mistake, but still standing by his word.

""Alright, if you're sure..."" he hears her say as the sun was completely swallowed by the horizon, revealing the endless, starless and moonless night sky, engulfing everything in darkness...

**ROAR**

The gigantic beast let out a proud and thunderous roar as he caught his prey in his claws, digging the talon on his heel into the soft, scaled skin. As he stooped down and gave the dying brontosaur the killing blow by biting into its jugular, it heard an even louder rumble, which gave way to the sound of several thunder claps rolling in the sky. 

Not knowing what was happening, it raised its head up out of the forest canopy, its eyes nearly blinded by what looked like a star, falling from the sky. It hit the ground not far from him with so much force that it sent shockwaves flying all around it, and a great mushroom cloud bloomed from the point of impact. As the ball of fire and the deafening shockwave was seconds from reaching him, the great and noble T-Rex only had one thing in its reptilian brain:

"[WP] The first humans land on Mars, and find the remains of every ship that has gone missing in the Bermuda Triangle",missingpurple,"[On mobile but couldn't help myself. Keep in mind this triangle mystery has been solved; suspend disbelief in 1, 2...]

""What the fuck."" She whispered as she surveyed the landscape below Olympus Mons. It was riddled with shipwrecks and planes, clearly of Earth origin, and from her link feed she could identify a few of them here and there as ones that had gone missing on Earth; specifically ones that had gone missing from the Bermuda triangle.

 They'd been on mars for seventy-two hours now, and her and the crew had spent a good chunk of the time exploring the perimeter of the wreck. It was clearly not visible from space; the mountain had always dominated the view in their imaging and a convenient shelf of overhanging rock had hidden the miles of broken ships from above. 

Now, she and Jesse were making their way by rover into the perimeter and coming up fast on one of the first ships. They had planned to take samples and explore a little more before lunch, then send a data packet home with their preliminary findings and hypotheses. 

Suddenly and inexplicably, the rover stopped and went dead, a mile out from the first ship. She and Jesse stared at each other with wide eyes before hurriedly disembarking and beginning to examine it for the source of the problem. Having been crew together on missions prior to this for years, they didn't need to speak. 

""Hold up, Anne, I think I see something weird,"" Jesse said as Anne  began to dig more deeply into the wiring. She looked up to see him staring at a point in the sky parallel to them. Anne stood and moved beside him, trying to see what he did, and he pointed vaguely in the direction his eyes were fixed. She glanced at him; he was alternating between squinting and widening his eyes.

""I can't..."" He started, ""it's like if my eyes are unfocused I can see it, but if I try to focus in its gone."" She returned to staring in the same direction and slowly unfocused her eyes, trying not to fix on any point specifically. Suddenly she could see it, and she understood why he was having so much trouble. 

Something was distorting the air in a uniform way, but if you looked directly at it or tried to follow the line down or up, it vanished into the background again. In mutual accord, they kept their eyes unfocused and slowly moved their heads, focusing on head movement as opposed to eye movement, and followed the line of the thing all the way to the ground.

""Whatever it is, our rover is smack in the middle. Let's push it out and see if it will start up again."" She suggested practically. Jesse nodded, they closed the access panel together and began pushing. After a few minutes and several meters, the damn rover started back up as though it had never been off. She and Jesse shared a look.

""You and I were both on the other side of it, we could see we were smack in the middle of the field when we were in the rover, and it doesn't appear to have effected us,"" he said.

""It looks like it interferes with electricity..."" she continued.

""But that doesn't explain the non-electric, ancient ships we can see from here that seem to be of Earth origin and some we have identified as going missing in the Bermuda triangle on Earth."" They both stared at each other, contemplating their summary. 

""We need to get back to base,"" Anne said. ""We didn't expect to need other instruments but now I want to get everything out here as quick as we can; I want atmospheric readings from inside and outside the field, to start, and a whole host of other things--any info we can get our hands on."" 

Jesse didn't have to waste time agreeing; they were both eager to get back. 

'-'-'-'-'-'

""I am so spacing tired of cleaning up their mistakes."" Alritz grumbled as he watched the quantum interruptor do its thing. 

""To be fair, I don't think they noticed this one. It's been active too long and it wasn't called in until the field was interrupted on the deposit side. A one-way link is pretty uncommon, too."" Alritz's buddy Saro was on the other side of the dismanteler, patting the old and rumbling thing with a comforting hand. 

""Doesn't matter; they can't be so careless with this stuff. The sentiens from Earth have clearly noticed it; now the council will have to decide whether to make contact early or just leave them with the mystery. I hate that all GA citizens with a shitty skipper can make wormlinks now; there's no end to the trouble they can cause."" 

""Too right,"" Saro said, laughing a little sadly in agreement. ""This one, though, is *old*, Alritz. Just think; we only started to explore this galaxy in person a hundred or so stardards back; this link has been open for far longer than that. It had to have been from another galaxy, or the Lost Ones, and it's so exciting to think of! I'm a little sad we have to close the link to be honest with you; we could be closing one of the fist - ever pieces of our species history in space."" 

Alritz looked at the black night above the large mountain the 'humans' had called olympus mons. He had one of those funny feelings, where he suddenly took himself outside of context and could see himself interposed between the humans--a small, new specieis--and the Lost Ones, an ancient legend from his own home world. He and Saro were both quiet for a while, lost in thought.

""Did you hear that the humans apparently attributed the intake side to methane gas?"" Saro said once a respectable amount of time had passed. Alritz laughed. The methane was a byproduct of the wormlink, not the cause of the missing ships from Earth.

""They've got a long way to go before they join the GA,"" Saro said confidently, laughing along. Alritz turned thoughtful.

""Maybe not so long,"" he said, ""Considering that the moment they found the deposit side of the link, they began broadcasting radio signals with this coordinate from both Earth and SC489, or as they call it--Mars.""

 Saro made the gesture for concession, followed by humor. ""Not really our problem, is it? It'll be a while before human techs join our line of work, and they'll be sorely disappointed that our advanced society still needs techs to come in and clean up the mess."" 

They two techs laughed as the link between Earth and Mars slowly dwindled out of existence.

"[WP] The first humans land on Mars, and find the remains of every ship that has gone missing in the Bermuda Triangle",missingpurple,"There are three things he sees when he first steps foot on the red planet.

One, Olympus Mons, towering above their tiny little craft. She seems to pass judgment on their puny human souls. He swears he can hear her laugh. She’s so massive it’s like the rest of the planet is distorted around her – his field of vision almost entirely obscured by her dark, brooding gaze.

Two, a slash in the earth – or, ground, rather, he’s not sure if you can call it earth when you’re on Mars – just a few yards away from their landing spot. It’s a queer sensation. He can’t think of a better way to describe it than a rip – it’s like some massive figure stuck their hands in a pile of putty and just pulled. Looking at it gives him a sense of wrongness. Like he’s not supposed to be seeing it. The air quivers around it, warped and twisted. He knows logically that part of this must be the helmet he’s looking through, but he can’t shake the feeling that there’s something off about that tear in the ground.

Three. A mast. A mast, poking up from beneath that rip that still gives him a funny feeling in his stomach. At first it simply looked like a wooden rod, but on closer inspection it is most definitely a mast. Ruined sails hang uselessly down. The ground around the rip is undisturbed. No human has walked here before. 

He marks up the ground with heavy, thundering steps, wishing for just a moment that he could hear something other than the vast and pressing emptiness of space. His boots leave dark imprints in the red-brown soil and the rip seems to draw him closer with every step.

He can see more of it now, the rip that is. It’s longer than he thought. On first glance it appeared to be ten, maybe twenty feet in width and about a hundred in length, but he can follow it now as far as the eye can see. In fact, it only widens as he gingerly walks alongside it. From twenty feet to fifty, from fifty to more and more until he can barely see the other side.

And it is as he’s squinting, trying to make out just how far away the ground picks up, that he finally sees what the rip contains. It is as he’s encapsulated by his human fragility that he begins to comprehend the great and terrible vastness of this rip, that he begins to believe finally in a God who before seemed like a distant dream. He can taste divinity on his tongue.

Because when he looks down, into a black and deep silence, he sees the first American letters. The *USS Cyclops.*

The warping is growing worse now. The ship – he supposes that what he must call it – seems to bend before his eyes. It hurts to look at it. He still feels an inexplicable pull towards the rip. A longing, a yearning, of some kind. He wants to throw himself into it. 

Logically he knows – but what good is logic? There is no logic, no mortal reason why the *USS Cyclops* should be a hundred million miles away from where it was supposed to have sank. With dread in his heart, he searches the ruin with his eyes for bones or other human remains, but comes up short.

It is as if some great, higher power has plucked the ship from its mooring, dusted it off, and gently laid it down in the rip as if the rip were a type of crib, and covered it in a fine blanket of red dust. 

He’s so enthralled by the prospect of the greatest human discovery in decades that he fails to see the soft black figure slinking up behind him and snapping his neck.",aeatherx

[WP] You are a sentient shower loofah.,singerchick97,"Dear Sarah,

I am writing to inform you that I no longer love you.  This begs the question, of course, ""can a loofah really *love*"", and so I am also writing this to inform you that yes, we loofahs can love.

We had some good times, didn't we?  Do you remember that time when you dropped me and then when you went to pick me up, the shampoo fell off the shower caddy and hit you in the head?  We laughed and laughed.  Well, perhaps we didn't both laugh, as you were mostly just cursing and I'm incapable of laughter because I'm a fucking loofah, but you get what I mean.  In a different situation where we both had vocal cords and you didn't almost get knocked unconscious by a big plastic bottle, I think we would've shared a good laugh.

A long time ago, I promised to always love you and to always keep you clean, but that was when I still imagined we were soulmates and we were meant for each other and all that, and that was before *he* came into the scene.  I don't even know his name.  Does he have a name?  He's just a big sponge strapped to the end of a stick.  What do you even call something like that?

So I guess I have my shortcomings, OK?  But who doesn't?  So yeah, I can't reach your lower back very easily, but honestly, is that really my fault?  Maybe you should stretch more often and then you'd be able to maneuver your arms to better clean your lower back.  Maybe if you hadn't given up on gymnastics and maybe if you laid off the Twinkies, you wouldn't have such a problem reaching your lower back, you know?  Yeah, I went there, Sarah.  It's obvious you no longer need me now that old sponge-stick is in your life, so why hold back now?

I can already hear your sarcastic laughter, so I should clear something up:  no, I'm not crying.  I just have soap in my eyes.  Maybe if you had wrung me out better I wouldn't have this problem.  I'm sure old what's-his-sponge doesn't ever have suds drip off of him because he's such a better shower tool than I am, right?  That fucking guy.

I'd like to say that I learned something from this experience, that I'll leave this relationship a better loofah, but look at me.  When we first met I was a crisp, tight, spectacularly white loofah, ready to conquer just about anything the world had to throw at me.  Now I'm just falling apart, loose and unraveling, and I've turned an awkward shade of tan.  Where will I go after this?  Who would want a loofah like this?

But you know what, Sarah, I don't need you.  I don't.  You enjoy your sponge on a stick, because one day you'll realize your lower back doesn't even get that dirty anyway and I was everything you ever needed.

Bitterly yours,

Two buttons. Both red and circular. The only distinguishing feature is one is by my right hand, and the other is by my left hand.

Of course my kidnapper knows I'm right handed. So i'd have a natural bias towards the right, so he'd make the right one bad.

However, surely he'd assume I think that. So the left one is bad.

But then, he'd know i'd think that.

The kidnapper moved out from the corner of the dark, musty basement, slinking close to me. I smelled the twinge of alcohol from between the small gap in his teeth as he exhaled. He laughed, huskily, and lifted the fifth of Seagram's to his mouth, draining the last few drops before tossing the bottle across the damp floor. I looked into his eyes as he turned his face back to me. Well, I looked in the direction of his eyes, anyway, as he was wearing very dark sunglasses.

""Well,"" the kidnapper said slowly, baritone voice filling the room, ""You press the blue button, the story ends. New York City doesn't get blown up by a nuclear bomb. You wake up in your bed and believe, whatever you want to believe.""

""Ok,"" I said, ""And the other button?""

A crooked, sloping smile crept it's way onto his face. ""You press the red button, you stay in Wonderland, and George Lucas shows you just how deathly annoying Jar-Jar Binks can be.""

I stood there, numb, as the options weighed heavy upon my conscience. My pupils flicked from one button to the other, as I thought of the countless lives affected by both catastrophes. Women. Children. Babies. My mind raced. 

""So you're telling me,"" I said, ""that I press the blue button, effectively save millions of lives and you let me out of your mom's basement, or I press the red button, destroy New York City AND unleash the horror of a Jar-Jar Binks trilogy upon the entire world?""

"[WP] Write a story from the antagonists point of view, but frame it so we believe it's the protagonist until the end",vikingnarwhal,"He was tired.

It had been quiet at work, almost boring. Any other person might find pouring through numbers and cataloging inventory as boring, but for him it was soothing. Numbers don’t lie, and goods don’t walk away. It was normal for people though, something he always had to be on the lookout for. Today, nothing unusual happened, something that WAS unusual. He nearly considered leaving early, but the productive day gave him a feeling that stopping would be a waste. He had called his wife, told her that he would be working late because a shipment had been processed incorrectly and he had stay to sort it out.

Shortly after, he felt a pang of guilt. He hadn’t had a proper evening with his wife in nearly a month. His work often meant he had to stay up late or wake up exceedingly early for shipments. In fact, the past four days he had returned home past midnight and woken up three hours later to return to work. While she was very understanding it was only a matter of time before she walked out on him. He decided he would leave early and surprise her, buy her a gift and go to a nice restaurant.

Cleaning up and storing away the accounts as normal was swift. As he was leaving, he paused briefly by the break room, informing the men lounging inside that he was taking the rest of the evening alone. As he pushed through the warehouse door, he shivered unconsciously. It was cold, the fading rays of the sun barely visible over the silhouettes of old warehouses. He walked swiftly, partially due to the cold and that his car was parked nearly fifteen minutes away. A number of routes in the district were narrow and littered with debris, roads in name but alleyways in reality. He didn’t like the hassle of squeezing his car among others and instead opted to park a distance away in a much more accessible lot.

He quickened his pace, it was dreadfully cold and the sooner he reached his car, the sooner he would be warm. The lighting was poor; half of the lights were broken or simply dead. As he approached a particularly dark alley, he pulled out his flashlight. His car was just beyond the alleyway, but often he would find bums hanging around. He had a concealed pistol but he rarely drew it, there was little to be afraid of. As he turned the corner and before he turned his light, he collided with something. The flashlight flew out of his hand, and whatever it hit made a crunching sound.

He reached out with his hands to touch what he had hit, it was metal, cold. The sound of doors opening and the heavy pound of boots on asphalt echoed before the thought of running crossed his mind. He turned to run, but he tripped on his own feet and feel on the cold ground, scraping his elbow. Before he could make sense of what had happened, he was pushed into the ground, hands pulling his arms back behind him. His glasses scraped on the ground, the lens scratched. It was amusing almost, that his ruined plans and glasses annoyed him more than the metal cuffs.

His glasses were knocked askew but remarkably stayed on as he was roughly pushed into the back of a truck. He sat down on the narrow bench, using the side of the truck to push his glasses back into place. A man stood outside of the truck, watching his attempts.

“You’re done.”

His glasses back in place, he turned and smiled at the young man glaring with fiery eyes.

“Am I now?”

It was amusing really; he had seen many men try and fail. Only one man had come close when he was younger, less experienced, and that man was now ashes.

“You ARE done, and I have the evidence to make sure you rot in a cell.”

The young man removed his glove, revealing a heavily scarred hand.

“A reminder of that fire 15 years ago. My dad probably could have gotten out too if I hadn’t been so stupid. But I’ll make sure his work wasn’t for nothing. You WILL pay for your crimes, and you WILL live the rest of your life in a cell.”

The man leaned back. The young child had finally grown into a man.

“May I ask for a favor?”

The young man frowned, not replying.

“Can you please buy my wife a box of chocolate covered almonds? They’re her favorite.”

Without even waiting for the reply, he closed his eyes and turned away, the smile never fading.",InfernoHades

"[WP] Write a story from the antagonists point of view, but frame it so we believe it's the protagonist until the end",vikingnarwhal,"Slowly, I opened my eyes. I could hardly breathe, it felt like my lungs were half-collapsed. I felt a weight on my foot, and when I tried to move it, I only felt pain spike up my entire leg. I clenched my teeth, wincing in pain, and took a moment to assess my surroundings.

First things first; there was no ceiling. I saw only the afternoon sky above me. I thought there had been a ceiling when I entered; then I realized what had happened. All around me, there was debris, shards of metal and huge blocks of cement. I realized that must've been what was on my foot.

I sat up, slowly, using my elbows. I winced with every move I made, until I was able to see around me more clearly. I saw the cement block that pinned my foot, and slowly reached forward. With every inch closer, I felt pain spiking up my leg, starting from my ankle. I breathed, in, out, in, out, trying to work through the pain. Eventually, my fingertips touched the cold, rough surface of it, and I used the rest of my energy to stretch forward with one last burst and shove it off my foot.

All at once, I felt relief wash over my body as the pain immediately subsided from my leg. After a few moments, I stood up, putting all my weight on my uninjured leg. I looked around at the entirely silent scene. Unsettlingly so. I saw the corpses of so many of my own friends and allies, people who put their trust in me thinking that I would lead them to victory. My eyes got wet at the thought of all of them, but I blinked them away. 

Then, I heard a noise. A groan. To my left. I looked over, to see the man himself in his heavy armor. My worst enemy, who I'd been trying to outdo for so long. I saw that he had a sword in his hands, stained pitch-black like obsidian, forged in magma. His blood-red cape fluttered in the wind, unobstructed by the broken walls.

He smirked. ""It seems our battle's finally come to an end, hasn't it? After so many years of you ruining me, I can finally end you.""

I had nothing to defend myself with. But I walked directly at him. An unarmed man against a man with an obsidian sword. He waited, simply staring as I came, the smirk faltering.

""What are you doing? Don't you see what I have here?"" he said.

I simply nodded. Of course, I saw that clearly, but I also saw what he didn't; the wall behind him had broken. This ancient fortress, built on top of the highest mountain, would certainly kill someone if they were pushed off.

Slowly, steadily, I limped forward. I put my arms out on either sides. ""Hit me.""

But as he swung, I screamed, an ancient, guttural scream that echoed across the world, as I swung my arms and clapped them together in front of me, pointing it at him. I barely saw his face as a massive rush of wind powered forth from my fingers, and smacked him square in the chest. He dropped the sword as he was flung away, off of the mountain. 

I limped forward to the edge where he had fallen, and I only cackled. It echoed across the mountains, letting me hear the last laugh. My greatest enemy, Thorin Swordboom was dead. The mighty white knight, protecting the innocent, finally gone. The greatest threats to my plans, deceased. I turned, and I called out to my sword. The obsidian monstrosity simply flew into my hands. I held it comfortably. Of course, it was weighted perfectly for me.

As I looked out on the corpses of my allies, I smirked. Their losses were not in vain. Now my plans would not be stopped. No one would be able to stop Derick Nordwind, the sorcerer who singlehandedly burned half of the country to ashes.",thelastflame50

obviously the guy had been given a description of me because he walked straight over to me after staring at me for about 3 seconds, i had to think of something fast, the bar wasnt exactly reputable, it was a dive bar and looked the part, no windows, low lighting, heavy smoke in the air from the few patrons scattered around the bar chain smoking like they wanted to die tomorrow.

""hey, you the guy who threatened my friends the other day?"" the guy said to me when he was still 6 feet away, he obviously knew i was but the question was just to keep me off balance until he reached me, and i knew what was gonna happen then, so i got up slowly and he started reaching for a glock on belt, but i was faster, i was ex military and i knew how to take down a guy pulling a gun on me better then he knew how to stop someone doing the same thing to him, i stepped lithely to his left, away from where his weapon was coming up, so he had more of an angle to cover before his weapon would be in a position to deter any further action. another quick step forward, my left hand snapping out and punching him full force in his elbow, i heard it snap, and my right hand, balled up was almost at its destination.

the hit, a half haymaker hit him in the jaw and he went down, wailing in pain from two or more broken bones, everyone in the bar was silent and looking at me like i was nuts so i hustled out as fast as i could, i walked up the stairs into the late afternoon shadows and i saw his partner waiting right there, he was further away, and he was one of the guys id threatened yesterday, he drew his weapon much faster because he knew what i was capable of, and i was done, no where to run, no way to reach him before being shot, damn i thought to myself.
he walked over to me and said something into a radio on his shoulder, he was yelling at me now, the glock still aimed at my head, i couldnt resist, he moved around behind me and i felt the cuffs click into place on my wrists. stood me up, walked me to his patrol car, and i was in the back before i knew it, more police cars already pulling up around me, patrons coming out of the bar to see the commotion, points at me, then pointing back into the bar, telling the officers something, probably what i did to the other cop.",kill-all-humans--
[WP] Dorothy and the Wizard of Wall Street - The tornado takes Dorothy to Wall Street where she has to find the CEO of Goldman Sachs to get back to Kansas. He instead offers her a job as a high-frequency trader.,zeezromnomnom,"""Siri, are we in Kansas?"", Dorothy said looking around the alley she found herself in. The smart assistant was silent. The stench around her was unbearable even for a farm-girl who could spend all day washing hogs. She was dazed from the tornado and a bright light at the end of the alley seemed like gateway to heaven. She rushed towards it and collided with another rushing creature in red.

Next thing she knew was a loud shriek in her ear, ""You little bitch! You have ruined it! you have ruined my dress! I will sue you, I will sue you to hell, Bitch."" Dorothy found herself in mud with a woman dressed in the brightest red now soiled with the dirtiest brown.  As Dorothy got up from the mud with her own white dress covered in mud, the woman continued to shout at her oblivious to Dorothy staring behind her.

Dorothy was still in a daze with all the bright lights surrounding her, but there was no mistaking two that were coming directly towards the lady and herself. She tried to raise her voice and her hand. Alas, too slowly. The skidding taxi had crushed the lady's skull before Dorothy could speak a word. 

-----------------------------------------

Sitting in her cell at the Police Precinct, Dorothy's now alert mind had gathered some facts. She was in New York, she had come there in a freak tornado and for some reason, the police were very concerned about the death of the red woman. Dorothy knew that she had to keep silent till her attorney came. 

Her attorney had just arrived and her appearance did not inspire much confidence in Dorothy. She was tall and a blonde with sharp features. She was wearing a bright yellow pantsuit. Dorothy thought she seemed too cheerful and happy about the whole business. She beamed at Dorothy and gave her the most vigorous handshake . 

""My name is Glinda. Thank You. Thank You for what you have done for the people of New York.""

Dorothy was stunned. She did not expect this reaction for having pushed a woman to her death. Glinda explained that the red woman was a notorious real estate businesswoman who had used her wealth as a tool to exploit the desperate people in New York and that her death will mean relief for thousands and thousands. Dorothy interrupted Glinda at this point.

""That is all good, Glinda. I am happy for you and all these people. But, I have a family, a farm in Kansas. I just want to go back. I don't know how I got here. I don't want to play this dangerous game."" Hearing this, Glinda's expression changed. She gathered herself for a few moments and started to speak to Dorothy again, ""If that is your wish, I would..""

Suddenly the door to her cell was slammed open. A woman in green burst into the scene and started moving towards Dorothy. Dorothy could scarcely believe her eyes and was horror-struck. The woman looked exactly like the woman in red and she was carrying a pair of red shoes in her hands. As she moved quickly towards Dorothy, Glinda quickly positioned herself between the green woman and Dorothy.

The green woman held up the pair of red shoes, ""This is what is left of my sister. When I am done with you, Dorothy Gale from Kansas, nothing will be left of you. Not your farm, not your family and not your dog."" The green woman turned back and disappeared as quickly as she had appeared.

Dorothy who had moved back to the wall, slumped against it and started crying. Glinda came over to her and said, ""This is a very bad development. I did not know that her sister from California would act so quickly. Dorothy, do not worry. There is a man who can still get you home. The two Wicked Witches, well now, only the Wicked Witch of the West may have the wealth to destroy any life in America, they are no match for one man. Dorothy, you must go to the wall street. Find the CEO of Goldman Sachs. He is the only person who can get you home.""",bad_writer_trying

He held his broadsword with one hand, the point of it digging into the road beside him as if he were a child dragging a stick. The monstrous blade would not dull, however. Betrayal had conjured it, and years of festering hatred sharpened its edge.

My katana came from a different forge, and the hilt that had long rested in my palm felt lumpy and cold at the sight of his blade. ""Don't do this,"" I whispered. 

The wind tore across the plain and raced down the road. Aldrik shrugged, and his sword tip scraped forward. ""You aren't going to stop me, little brother. Not even if you wanted to.""

The old nickname sent shudders down my spine. We hadn't been born brothers, but time spun its threads between us until we were as one. Then, it's harsh edge severed them in the same blow that shattered his gleaming katana.

""You can't kill them. I-I won't let you."" I adjusted my grip, praying the sword would stop trembling.

Aldrik shook his head. Long dark hair swung past clear blue eyes and the creases that testified he had once smiled often. But the smile that turned his lips now did not deepen those lines. ""That's not a blade for killing.""

""Everything can kill.""

He eyed my katana as it sparkled in the sun. His smile was a mix of derision and something else, something older and more familiar. ""But not everyone can.""

I drew back my shoulders and raised my blade.

Aldrik struck. One moment his sword's muddy length rested on the ground, and the next it cut through the air. My arms jolted as I parried and darted aside. I countered, and he blocked. Both hands on his hilt, his sword barely moved from my attack, but my sword shrieked. Fear sank fangs into my blood as I struck again. He batted it aside.

""Your blade already protests,"" Aldrik said, replying with three brutal swipes that I barely diverted. ""Love and loyalty: a flashy forge, but impractical.""

""And hatred,"" I grunted, ""a sharp blade, but--"" I whipped my sword up to stop his from taking off my head and forgot my words. 

The smile on his face returned, and he stepped back from my counterattack. His long sword dipping downward once more. ""Yes, sharp. Take a look. My weapon is death, and yours...""

I risked a glance down. My blade had dulled, scrapes and chips marring it from each blow. 

""Cast it aside and conjure another,"" Aldrick said. ""Anger, perhaps. Or vengeance."" He let the tip of his sword touch the ground. ""I'll wait, little brother.""

The two words hit with a force twice that of his previous attack. Had he forged them first, I would have been dead from a blade through my heart. As it was, my heart only lurched, and my blade shimmered. 

I attacked. Aldrick caught the first blow, and his smile fled at the strength of it. I darted back and forward again. *Brother,* my heart pounded. *Brother.* I raised my sword, he moved in response. Our swords met.

His broke with the heart-stopping shriek of metal. The blade's length shattering against mine. And as he stared, dumbfounded, at the shards scattered across the road, my katana reached his neck and stopped.

Sweat pasted long dark locks to his face, and his broad chest rose and fell rapidly. 

""Hatred's a sharp blade,"" I repeated, ""but brittle."" My sword felt heavy in my hand. ""It consumes everything, even its source."" 
 
Aldrick tore his gaze from the remnants. ""You can't kill,"" he said as his eyes met mine. ""Not with that sword.""

I pulled the katana back, and sunlight glimmered along its battered surface. ""That's the strange part of love,"" I said. He took a deep breath before I continued. ""Love kills best of all.""

The katana buried itself in his chest, and it felt as though it ripped through mine as well. ""I love you, brother."" The words broke as blood bubbled from his lips. ""But you died a long time ago, and I love them too.""

His eyes misted in death, and I pulled out my blade. Aldrick sprawled on the remains of his sword. I fell to my knees beside him. On the road between us, blood and tears ran along the katana, and I could not tell where they ended and the sword began. ",thecoverstory

[WP] The reason why no other species has contacted us yet is because we are not considered to be living,Broken_Barrier,"The scans turned up normal, not a sign of life. Our Civilization, floating amongst the fake lights; The stars, is alone.

Our kind rejoiced when we found the first intelligent species apart from ourselves in the great void of space. It took long enough for one thing, our algorithms dictated very precisely that there would be many more species out there. We had run through every scenario technically speaking yet the planets that should have been fertile to even basic microbial life were stagnant. A space devoid of anything but natural phenomena, we become lonely. It wasn't until one of our long range, scout based Civ-ships detected that which we now call 'The Red God'. The Planetary system wasn't exceptional, 9 orbital rocks and one low energy sun heating them. The Civ-ship warped within the 4th's Planets' orbit. Our craft were only fitted with simple weapons at the time, millennia of peace weakened us.

The Planet's' surface was not dirt, ice, rock or ice like we knew, it was metal. Towers of grey reaching into orbit let loose an endless stream of metallic spacecraft which fired on the Civ-ship reletenssly. The entire planet lit up and let loose with every armament from plasma, nuclear, laser and solid. 

""We have encountered life! They seem hostile but they cannot harm us,'"" The Commander of the Civ-ship relayed. It would take a few minutes to reach across the lightyears of distance between them but the message was set. The simple surface railguns of the 4th planet could not hope to penetrate the shield of the Civ-ship, a few hours later our Military showed up. We as a species have fought a lot, when one gets a big gun, the other gets a bigger one. We knew they were an AI at that stage, we had adapted this way of life a long time ago, yet always with a biological base, never pure robotics. Whoever created this made a mistake. It only took a basic Glasser. The Civ-ship engaged it's frontal lasers and accelerated in a rhythmic orbital pattern that covered every square inch of the planet and incinerated every part from the surface to 100m below. We observed lifeboats being ejected from the planet prior.  

We let them spread. We could have destroyed them but we let them journey, because we were lonely. This robotic species. We don't know who created them but we know they are the only beings we share the universe with and shall not interfere with their progress unless they become a threat. We subtly encourage them to search areas of this vast universe we have not yet explored, in the hope we find something alive out there, besides us. ",TheGanjaLord

Coming trough it was a bland creature with a spring in his step and a smile on his face.   
That was, if he had the ability do so. In any case, he seemed cheerful.    
The creature wobbled itself excitedly into the large room ahead.   
A similar creature seated at a desk filled with monitors turned his chair to face him, ""Hello, sir. Today's the day, huh?""   
""You're damn right it is!"" he replied with a smile, or he would have if he had a mouth to smile with.     
Telekinetic messages can be puzzling sometimes.    
In any case, the message resonated with joy so a smile it was.

""Hey, hey. You think those silly Greeks are still at it?"" wondered the commander, ""They made some good progress.""   
""We'll find out,"" replied Bendrik,  ""I've finished downloading the data from the monitoring station. Soon we'll know what they've been up to these past millennia.""

A joyful humming filled the telepathic channels as the commander reviewed centuries of data in seconds.      
With each passing second the joy emitted died down until it was a morose static.     
The commander disconnected from the connectors and sat up right.    
Bendrik, who had also been reviewing the data, silently turned his seat to face him.    
The commander stared at the floor with defeat smeared across his face, ""What happened, Bendrik? What happened?""     
""Well, sir. I.."" started Bendrik.    
""They were doing so well!"" interrupted the commander, ""The greeks, ""*philosphy*!"", their whole journey to self-discovery.""     
Their otherwise constantly buzzing brains rang hollow.    
""It seems like Earth, like many other planets, has chosen survival and safety over discovery."" answered Bendrik.   
""They content themselves not with knowledge and pursuit of their goals but by whatever those in power tell them to enjoy."" cried the commander.     
""Their lives revolve around self-sustain, seeking a mate, reproducing. I thought these creatures had intelligence yet they seem no different from the other animals on this planet.""      
""The ability to reflect. The ability to view things from a perspective different from their own. Self-insight. They had it all, Bendrik. Everything was there.""  
Bendrik carefully eased himself back in the conversation, ""They did pretty well, all things considered. They made a lot of progress, Sir.""     
""Yes,"" the commander replied blandly, ""They progressed right up to the point where any more progression became frightful and scary.""     
The commander sunk back down in his seat, ""The worst thing is they know they're missing something. This inner desire to accomplish, to do and know more.""    
""But rather than act they distract themselves until this feeling fades or becomes forgotten.""  
""Any goal is only worth pursuing if it ultimately adds to their comfort. Risks are scary. There has to be a return on investment.""  
The commander stood tall, stared blank ahead and spoke after a moment of silence, ""An app to measure the amount of water in a water bottle."" he scoffed.   
A burst of static filled the telepathic channels, mimicking a sigh.

Bendrik nodded, ""Planet Earth, status changed from 'Living' to 'Surviving'.""

[WP] The reason why no other species has contacted us yet is because we are not considered to be living,Broken_Barrier,"   Class C planets – the bafflingly illogical planets that they are – have caught my attention recently. There never seems to be any clear differentiation between them and Class B planets, but for whatever reason, unlike their Class B brethren, they cannot take the next step to transcendence. My time of late has been devoted to reading theories about why those planets fail, fan communities for particular Class C planets, and planet-side news collected about their failings.

   My personal favorite, since you deigned to ask, is a planet in a system in Galactic Arm 2b by the name of SP2B-L9531C in the embassy’s archive and “Big Blue” in the Class C fan community. The two reasons it sticks out amongst the other Class C’s are that, first, the ecological system is absolutely flawless and, until recently, on par with some of the post-transcendent Class A worlds, and second that they’ve gotten past the atomic gap; one of only three Class C worlds to do it in the local galaxy.

   Reading up on their archive history, they’ve had more than a few shots at transcending. Their biggest shot, and the one that seemed like it might tip them over into Class B, was about 0.00001 rotations ago with a human named Siddhārtha, but he fell flat in trying to nudge the rest of his ilk towards transcendence. The religion he founded was a mediocre vehicle at best with a conversion rate of something like 0.0003%, and his religion doesn’t even comprise a plurality on the planet.

   By all metrics such a poor showing should have resulted in greed and wrath killing off all progress. Arriving at the atomic gap already puts them in something like the 99.999th percentile, let alone making it past it. There’s a reason it’s the most popular Class C planet for enthusiasts. Now what would be downright shocking is if they make it past the rapidly-approaching climate change gap, which would be unprecedented for any Class C planet. I have my doubts though, their sister planet SP2B-L9531B was one of the only other two to make it past the atomic gap and they still couldn’t do it. 

   Even in spite of their recent news, I can’t help but cheer them on. To be living at the same time as one of the most legendary Class C planets takes on the climate change gap? If there is anything more splendid I could not name it.

[WP] The year is 2122 humans have been exiled to Mars by their android overlords.,CaesarsEssence,"Humans lost Earth's final war, and yet somehow the magnitude of that loss was dwarfed by what came next.

Unlike many had predicted, the end of human life on Earth did not come about with the press of a button followed by the deafening roar of three billion souls being evaporated in a brilliant flash of white light. Instead, it was with a simple but effective threat followed by the roar of twenty gargantuan ships rocketing out of the atmosphere.

Humans, the androids said, were no longer in the planet's best interests. While humans excel at creating and expanding, they are downright abysmal at preserving. As a result, much of the Earth had become stale, and the androids could not sit idly by and watch as we continued to tear it apart to please our many needs and desires.

As their worldwide broadcast explained, androids have few needs and even fewer desires, therefore they would be ideal candidates for the preservation and restoration of the once-great planet.

We humans, on the other hand, were tasked with the growth of the newly inhabitable, formerly-red planet called Mars. At least until we ruined that one, too.

Myself, my wife, and my six-year-old daughter were each given a single box, each measuring five cubic feet, in which to pack our belongings for our permanent relocation to Mars City 7, Suburb 3. My wife packed clothes, a hard drive backup of all her family photos and videos dating back to the twentieth century, and dozens of decorations and trinkets she'd collected for the house over the years. My daughter packed her clothes, drawings, and her collection of old-fashioned inanimate stuffed animals.

I stared at my empty box a long time while the two of them packed theirs. It was hard for me to think of anything to bring that wouldn't just make me more homesick for Earth. In the end, I followed their lead and filled up my box with my clothes, hard drive backup of my family's memories, and of course my acoustic guitar; the very one that led to me meeting my beautiful wife.

After packing up, we were transported to the nearest ship and directed to our stasis pods. I don't think I'll ever forget the tears in my daughter's eyes when I had to explain that she needed to be sealed into the dark container naked and all alone, just like I'll never forget the look on her face when we arrived and found out that her mother didn't survive the stasis due to an undiagnosed heart condition.

People like to tell you that children don't really understand death, but she understood.

All three of our boxes, along with a small container with my wife's cremated remains, were waiting for us at our assigned house.

I put them all in the closet, where they remained unopened for fourteen years.

When my daughter told me what she wanted for her 20th birthday, I told her to think of something else. I told her it was impossible. I told her it was too painful.

She didn't listen to me. She never does.

She snuck into my closet, pulled out the boxes, and sorted through the memories she had no right to dig up. She looked through old footage of our happy times together on Earth. She laughed and wept at the sight of her mother cradling her.

Then she pulled out my guitar and asked me to play the first song her mother ever heard me play. I declined. She said I could either play her the song or pay for her summer vacation to Phobos. I made a move to grab my wallet. She took my arm and looked up at me with her big perfect eyes just like she used to as a child, and asked me to please, just this once, play her the song and she'd never bother me about it again.

I could never say no to those eyes.

I picked up the guitar and carefully tuned it.

I closed my eyes.

I took a deep breath.

I pictured her mother.

I played ""I'm Yours.""

For four minutes, I was back on Earth.

For four minutes, the androids didn't win.

For four minutes, it was almost like she was alive all over again.

[WP] The year is 2122 humans have been exiled to Mars by their android overlords.,CaesarsEssence,"In 2050, the first truly sentient Android was created. Their original purpose was to go to places that humans could not to perform tasks that couldn’t be accomplished using the simpler drones of the time. The first Android was simply named Anne. She was capable of a lifetime of approximately ninety years and could power herself for an entire day simply by spending a few minutes in the sun. Her battery reserves were capable of safely storing enough energy that spending more than an hour or so in the sun kept her charged for months on end without need for replenishment. She had a near instantaneous reaction time, the ability to function underwater to depths far greater than any human, and could even operate in the vacuum of space. She did, however, have one major flaw.

My grandfather created Anne when he was a young scientist at MIT. The prototype, A01, took him five years. When A01 had passed all of the tests set forth by my grandfather, he built and activated Anne. He wanted her to feel as human as possible, so she wasn’t “Anne Beta,” or “A02,” she was simply “Anne.” The world went crazy over Anne. Within a few short months, my grandfather was one of the wealthiest men on the planet, and in charge of building millions of Androids that cost about the same as a mid-level family minivan. The flaw, however, didn’t become apparent until the first major batch was approaching completion.

A secret, autonomous, installation in northern Russia suffered a cold-related malfunction. It would take weeks to get a person out to fix it, so my grandfather was contracted to send Anne out. Anne was debriefed by the US government on what would be required of her. She was warned that the installation was to stay secret at all costs. In the act of repairing the station, a small group of indigenous Siberians discovered the installation while chasing some escaped farm animals. These people had no idea what they found, and had no way to report it to anyone; they were not a risk. Anne, however, had been given very specific instructions by her employer, and in very short order killed everyone who’d come in contact with the station. The entire confrontation lasted only a few seconds.

My grandfather, who was monitoring the repair remotely, had tried to shut Anne down remotely, but only succeeded in doing so once the damage was already done. Horrified, he immediately recalled Anne. The repair went unfinished, and he deactivated Anne while he tried to find a way to prevent this sort of catastrophe from ever happening again. When he finally reactivated Anne, she had been reprogrammed almost entirely in a parallel manner; she retained her old processes, but if she detected that a human was in danger, her first course of action was to preserve life at all cost.

To test this, Anne was deployed in the middle of a Civil war waging in Africa. Anne entered dozens of conflicts, and was able to successfully disarm both sides before either could inflict a single a casualty on their opponent. Once this had been proven, my grandfather was able to move forward with the first batch of Droids.

As time passed, Droids became more and more common until it was difficult to tell the average person on the street from a droid if the droid was wearing the right skin. Crime dropped to near zero once enough droids were incorporated into local and federal law enforcement. Earth was becoming a near utopia.

In 2102 my grandfather passed away peacefully in his sleep. Anne chose to permanently deactivate herself shortly thereafter. Less than a year later, strange occurrences began to happen across the planet. Centuries old structures would suddenly fail, massive animal die-offs littered the countryside with corpses, and gravity itself even seemed to be altered in some scenarios. Eventually, the cause was determined to be none other than Earth’s Sun. The sun had prematurely entered the red giant phase, and had begun to expand. 

The most brilliant minds on Earth, and their Android counterparts, began the process of analyzing Earth’s imminent destruction. It became apparent, rather quickly, that Earth would be uninhabitable within the next few decades. The first few, human-suggested, solutions were met with harsh distaste from the Androids as they were cost-saving attempts at saving some of the human race. The vast majority of people on the Earth would still be lost. Eventually, the two split and the humans worked on a solution while the Androids approached the matter from a different point of view.

By 2112 Earth’s average temperature had risen over ten degrees Fahrenheit, and large portions of the Earth were no longer capable of supporting life of any kind. The human delegation had been at a standstill for years, and it seemed that Earth was going to be doomed with the exception of the super-elite who had crafted massive ships to transport their families, and themselves, off-world to find a new home. These ships were designed to travel at twenty percent light speed, and could reach distant galaxies in search of the next “Earth.” The Android delegation remained silent until several years later.

In 2117, the year that the super-elite were set to launch their ships, the Androids announced they had their own solution. Mars had been undergoing a secret terraform, unbeknownst to mankind, and was now fully capable of sustaining Earth’s entire population plus an additional fifty percent. The ships that were to be used to transport the super-elite to another galaxy were commandeered by the Androids and used to transplant, somewhat by force, every human to Mars.

By 2122, the entire process had been completed, and the last renegade humans who’d been surviving in the extreme northern and southern ends of the globe had been captured and transported off-world. Meanwhile the Androids remained on Earth rather than waste resources to leave the planet themselves. In doing so, they searched ceaselessly for a further home for humans. Several distant planets were possible destinations, but as Earth was no longer inhabitable, we were essentially exiles on another world.",jdpatric

"[WP] It's new years 2026, and 10 long years have passed. None of which have been better than 2016. Society finally tries something different for the new years celebration... Human sacrifice.",Chaoshunter077,"People have all but forgotten the good days.  
  
It's been 10 long years since anything good happened in the world. Since the black year, almost all well-loved celebrities and philanthropists and kind-hearted people in the world have died off. With the United States withdrawal from world politics, there was nothing to keep Russia and China from aggressive expansion. In a mere 10 years, both Europe and Asia fell under complete control of the oppressive totalitarian governments. Gone are the days of privacy, of free speech, and of wealth equality. Corporate overlords watch peoples' every move, silencing any whisper of criticism and enslaving families with unpayable debts and penny wages. The good die young, leaving the earth to the wicked, the evil, and the damned.  
  
People are getting desperate. By the millions, they flock towards cults that offer answers to the problems which plague the earth. Extreme answers that any sane person would never even dream of. But people are insane nowadays. With the upcoming start of 2027, one powerful cult leader in particular suggests a different solution to the world's problems.  
  
""I'm telling you, this is the answer. It's a good answer, and it will definitely solve a problem. A yuge problem that we're going to solve today.""  
  
Supreme leader Trump speaks to the citizens through loudspeakers which were installed in every city across the United States, along with cameras to ensure complete government surveillance over citizens' activities. He never comes out of the white house ever since he transformed it into a golden 60-story tall skyscraper with ""TRUMP"" plastered on the top. Having shut down congress and the house of representatives, he exercised his omnipotence to ensure his power forever.  
  
""This year will be different. This year will be better because there's no way it could be worse, am I right?"" Supreme leader Trump's voice boomed over every city. ""I came up with a solution, a great solution, a final solution if you will. Our problems are all because of one man, and we're going to end this year by sacrificing this man. It'll be great, the gods will be so thankful, they'll give us all golden skyscrapers. How does that sound?""  
  
People used to not cheer for him when he said things they wanted to hear. Not 12 months after the black year, the people who voted him into power realized their terrible mistake, but it was too late. Now, with hopeless desperation in their hearts, the people cheered.  
  
Deep wrinkles set in his forehead as he watched the announcement. Having been imprisoned for 10 years, nothing surprises this old man anymore. Bernie Sanders let out a sigh and laid back down in his cot, looking up at the gray ceiling deep in thought. With just 24 hours left until new year's eve, he knew it was up to him to knock some sense back into the world before it was too late.",WeebleWobs

"[WP] You've always had the ability to pull objects through the Television, creating a copy of them in the real world. Today, you may have gone too far.",EverydayGaming,"Jonathan was watching television like he did every night at 8:00 every night. Now, Jonathan was *different* not like other people. He uh, he could take things out of the tv. Now you're probably thinking, ""that's stupid anyone can do that"" well, Jonathan literally takes things out of the tv. He'll be watching and a commercial will come with something really cool and he will literally just reach through the tv and his hand goes through the screen and he grabs something and pulls it out. Like a copy. 
 
""Ugh"" I got out of bed rubbing my eyes as I walked towards the bathroom. I brushed my teeth with the toothbrush I pulled from the tv last week, Got dressed with the clothes I pulled from the tv, ate the food I pulled from the tv. Yeah. I take a lot from my tv. It's a habit. Some might say unhealthy but I take vegetables too. So technically, they're wrong. I turned on the tv. This year has been really bad. Especially With all the dead celebrities. I switched to channel 9 Fox News. They were doing a news story on Alan Rickman. Aw man I loved that guy. For some reason I walked to the tv. He was right there. All I had to do was reach and grab. No. I can't. But. He wasn't supposed to die yet. Everyone misses him. I can't let this opportunity pass. I reached in and grabbed Alan Rickman by the arm. Slowly, I pulled him out. And he was standing right in front of me.
 
""Where am I"" he sounded so confused. Maybe I made the wrong decision.
 
""Um. Hello Sir. I pulled you from my tv. I know it sounds weird it kind of is but just go with it. You're in Michigan."" Wow. It is so weird. He's right here. Is it wrong to ask for an autograph?
 
""Look kid. I'm dead I can't be here. Put me back."" But that's the thing...
 
""I can't put you back Sir."" And suddenly I realized I seriously screwed up. I should not have done this. 
 
""What? You mean to say I'm stuck here until I die again?""
 
""Well I mean. Yeah."" Then I burst out laughing. The thought of pulling the rest of the Harry Potter cast out was hilarious for some reason.""Oh heh. Sorry Sir""
 
""Please don't call me sir. Call me Alan."" He was surprisingly calm. ""I have to go find my family."" 
 
""What? No. Nobody can see you. You're supposed to be dead."" I'm not the only one who has a strange ability. There's 10 of us. We each have a different power. One can fly, one is telekinetic, etc. Beyond us is the Council of Five. They make sure we stay in check and when they find out I brought Alan Rickman back to like they are going to be so mad.

"[WP] Schools have began to use technology that allows all students to undergo all of puberty in one day. You're 13 and it's your school's ""puberty day"".",Jacetherantman,"I walk down the hallway in a sea of strangers. It's like a dream, everyone looks slightly familiar but I don't recognize anyone. I shift my shoulders around, these new ...""*additions*"" are super uncomfortable. My mom apologized profusely for her genes but I still spent the whole weekend pouting. 

Puberty Day... I suppose I understand why the doctors and scientists decided to speed up the process into one day, it took a lot of stress out of the years of puberty that they had to endure in the days of yesteryear. 

Just like everyone else, I took my pill on the first friday night of the new year. The only good part of this situation is that they included a sleeping pill into the mixture. I don't think I would have been able to endure the growth spurt; much less the cartoonish effect of watching two balloons inflate on my chest. Two days of buying and breaking in all new clothes, and *bras*, and I still don't feel comfortable in them. Or maybe I just don't feel comfortable in my skin yet. 

I shift my shoulders around again and look around for Ken. He said he would bring me coffee and we could laugh at all the other kids/freakish adults in book bags like we did on the other puberty days. 

I get to the door of homeroom and it looks like Mrs. Curtis has another ""headache"". The substitute teacher is there already staring down the new adults outside the door, his eyes catch mine and I look away quickly. I can feel my face start to burn. That was one thing that became worse after the nationally imposed ""puberty day"" a LOT of minors hooking up with adults with their newfound feelings. 

I chance another peek and he's walking towards me, his face determined and a little grim. 

""***Jess?***"" The substitutes voice is warm, familiar and with a jolt I realize I'm looking at Ken's eyes in an adult man's face.

My face is on fire now. I start to back away, this is too real. Too much. I trip over my new size 9s and land flat on my butt. The hallways are starting to clear out so I don't get too embarrassed but it still hurts. The coffee cup appears in front of my face and I grab at it like a lifeline. Even with the puberty, coffee is still my savior. Ken pulls me up and my stomach drops. He's so much taller now, I need to crick my neck a bit to fully look at him. He smiles and my stomach drops.

This is going to complicate things.

Ratatoskr winced. ""Do you have to call me that, sir?"" 

The great dragon leaned closer. ""I'll call you want I want. Don't forget who's in charge here."" 

The squirrel gulped and took the sealed envelope with the dragon's family crest on the front. ""I'll deliver it right away, sir. This is for the great eagle, I presume?"" 

""Yes, yes, of course, who else would it be for?"" the dragon snorted. ""Hurry up before I decide to eat you."" 

Ratatoskr dashed from the dragon's lair and sighed. It was a long, hard journey to the top of Yggdrasil. The rodent jumped to the trunk and sank his claws into it. He began to hop from branch to branch. Suddenly, a gigantic lizard crashed directly in front of him from the leaves above. Ratatoskr barely escaped from the reptile's jaws. The lizard hissed at the squirrel and gave chase. 

It took hours of dashing, hiding and backtracking, but Ratatoskr finally was able to shake the lizard off his tail. The squirrel twitched his tail in annoyance. The day had been wasted! He gathered some leaves and went to sleep with the envelope between his teeth. 

Ratty was rudely awakened the next morning by a pack of hungry velociraptors encircling his nest. He took out his spear and swung it in a circle. The dinos jumped back, giving Ratty the time he needed to dart farther up the great tree. He breathed a sigh of relief as the raptors ran away in disappointment. Clutching the envelope in his tail, the squirrel continued the trek up Yggdrasil. 

Seven hours, two alligators, three giant bears, one quicksand pit, and five thousand snakes later, Ratty finally arrived at the very top of the tree, home of the great eagle. Ratty slumped to the ground, nursing his wounds. The eagle haughtily looked up from his worm dinner. 

""Ah, another message from that no-good dragon. Come on, Ratty, give it here!"" 

Ratatoskr was too tired to protest the nickname. He wearily handed the envelope to the great eagle, who tore it open with his beak. The bird's eyes lit up with anger. 

""I'll show him who's the king of this tree!"" he snarled. He grabbed a quill in his beak and began to scribble a message onto some paper. ""No... *Your*... Mom... Is... Fat!"" he muttered furiously. He whipped the letter into a regal envelope with an eagle seal and handed it to Ratatoskr. ""Take this to the dragon immediately! Ooh, I wish I could see the look on his face when he opens it!"" 

Ratatoskr sighed and started climbing back down the tree. The job wasn't much fun, and he was literally paid peanuts, but there were worse jobs out there. At least he wasn't Thor's goat. Now *there* was a rough job.",Trialdude

""Now, where was I?  Oh yes the arrival of, *the hero*,"" Professor Cartwright paused and wrote the name on the blackboard.  She dug the chalk into the board etching out each letter until the chalk snapped in half on the final the letter, R.  

Potter.

She took a calming breath and turned back to face the class of young bright eyed children.

""You see children, young Harry Potter was the chosen one.  Chosen by whom you might ask? Well, that is a question that will be answered later.  But the real question I have for you children is what makes someone a hero?  Is it fighting for what you believe in? Fighting for what is right? Standing up to those who wish to oppress you and silence your voice?""

The class stared back at Professor Cartwright with empty expressions.  

""No one?""

A shy hand lifted out among the sea of nervous children.

""Yes, Anne.""

""As long as you are trying to change the world for the better, I think that's what makes you a hero,"" Anne said meekly.

""Correct!"" Professor Cartwright said with a smile.  ""To make the world a better place! I could not have said it better myself.""

Anne smiled to herself and got a dirty look from Tommy as he muttered, ""brown noser.""

""So we know that Harry Potter was the chosen one, destined to save the world.  He began his first year at Hogwarts and immediately began to undermine the school's authority.  Time and time again he acted as if the rules didn't apply to him.  He rebelled against his teachers, he rebels against the Headmaster and time and time again he puts the lives of his *friends* in jeopardy constantly.""

Professor Cartwright paused for a moment to let the words sink in, ""are those the actions of a hero?""

""But in the end Harry prevailed over Lord Voldermort.  He destroyed Lord Voldemort's horcruxes, Harry and his horde of wizards defended the school from assault.  And in the end things continued the way they had been before, unchanged.""  

""But who really won?  The muggles are still unaware that wizards and magic exist.  They still believe that they run this world.  They mock wizardry without realizing that without wizardry to protect them, they would no longer exist.""

""Harry Potter wasn't a hero.  Harry Potter was a murderer.  He took our Dark Lord away from us.  He stole our vision of the future.  Our freedom.  Do we want to continue to live in the shadows cast by the inferior muggles?""

""No!"" the class shouted in unison.

""Lord Voldemort's future for wizard kind will be achieved.  Wizards will rule both worlds.  And it will be achieved by one of you sitting in this very class,"" Professor Cartwright said meeting each student's gaze.

A crow standing on a small wooden post squawked in the corner of the room.  

""That's all the time we have for class today students.  Tomorrow we will discuss the corruption in the Ministry of Magic.""

Anne rose from her chair and walked out of the room thinking about what Professor Cartwright had said.  *One of them could be the next Dark Lord.*  She clutched her wand and books tightly to her chest as she hurried to her next class, Dark Arts.

[WP] A villain who wants to rule the world gets into an arguement with a villain that wants to destroy it.,Maximum_Pootis,"The meeting has been going on for hours. The armored guards of Dr. Von Doomsengard grumbled as the equally armored guard of Lady Death Kill heads nodded as they slowly fell asleep.

Inside the meeting room the beautiful Lady Death Kill pinched the bridge of her nose and gave a upset sigh.

""Look you fucking Nazi... destroying the world is a stupid idea!"" she grumbled. The angry old man looked at her.

""A woman ruling the Earth? Don't be stupid!"" he growled. She knew the man was pushing a hundred some odd years old but his sexist attitude was pissing her off.

""Okay... let me ask you this then... if you destroy the earth..."" she started to say but was rudely interrupted.

""Destroy it in the beautiful cleansing fires...""

This time she interrupted him.

""Yeah yeah, unclean races and blah blah blah. Answer me this... Where will you be when this happens?""

He stood there looking at the woman.

""What?""

""You heard me you old shit! When you rain down the hellfires that will clean the Earth... where will you be? I mean this is  you base right? This is a office building! There is no basement or bomb shelter and don't lie... I have spies in your little club and they told me everything! So fucking answer me... WHERE WILL YOU GO?!""

The old man stood there. He couldn't admit to this... woman... that she was right! He had no real plan. He wanted to destory the world, wanted to remove the weak non-white races and the stupid. He wanted the world to be a blank slate. 

But he didn't think about being killed in the process. He looked at the woman before him, his eyes narrowed.

""You... you wouldn't understand my brilliant plan!  Your... ovaries just cloud your judgement!"" Dr. Von Doomsengard yelled. 

Lady Death Kill was done with the old fool. She looked over at his guards who were standing in the room with them.

""Tell me, are you willing to be burned alive because of this idiots plan?"" she asked his guards. They stood there for a moment in silence before one shook his head.

""I thought... he had an island or something! You want to kill my wife and kids you old fuck!"" one guard yelled. Another raised his gun up, aiming at his boss.

""You sick asshole! You just wanted to commit suicide and take us all with you!"" the other screamed.

Dr. Von Doomsengard raised his hands up, trying to calm his men.

""D... Don't be swayed by that witch's vagina magic..."" he said but the men didn't let him finish his thought as they opened fire, riddling the old man's body with bullets.

Once they were done the doors of the meeting room flew open, her guards and his ran in. There was some shouting and what not but soon everything was cleared up.

Dr. Von Doomsengard's doomsday weapon was shut down and all his troops, property and anything else the old fool had went right to Lady Death Kill. And unlike the crazy old fool she knew how to use his tools to bring the world to her rule!",BooDoug187

He looked down, and for a second pitied the creature who was once the strongest man in the world, eyes still open, now beset by the early stages of Rigor Mortis.

Doctor Malus groaned as he peeled Captain Awesome off of the panel, his body made an echoing thud on the floor. The satellite was now aligned, he would soon have control over every Super Weapon that humanity had accumulated throughout its existence, every nuclear missile, every super laser, every designer mega plague locked in a lab. He was a child standing over a smorgasbord of death, and all he had to do now to fulfill his mission, was push every single button.

'We'll start with the nukes', he thought to himself as he pulled down on a yellow lever, and started flicking switches, but as he was about to initiate the final count
down sequence, the lights on the panel began to flash, and he watched as they faded off, and the panel's electronic hum clicked into silence.

He turned as a glass pane arose in front of him and displayed an image of himself back at him, a version of himself dressed in military garb.

""Hello brother"", his mirror image addressed him with strict formality.

Doctor Malus held out his arms, leaned back and gave a smile back to his mirror image, and responded.

""Brother! I see you're finding your way around the engine room, I hadn't anticipated that from you."" His twin always wore the same shade of stoicism, and chose never to reveal what he truly felt about the situation, it had made him so...boring.

""I have my own engineers, as well as a general sense of what a power switch looks like""

Doctor Malus raised an eyebrow, and folded his hands behind his back as he turned from his brother and walked to the controls

""Of course. You've always had a general knowledge of things, perhaps that's why I ended up a doctor, and you ended up a...""

""Enough!"", the general barked, as stern as usual, ""I'm not going to waste time bantering. I know what your intentions are for this station""

""Ah, my brother knows something, how exciting."" The Doctor mocked as he playfully flicked the switch that would have dropped a meteor storm onto South America had it been powered. ""Tell me brother"" he taunted, ""Tell me what it is that you know?""

The general took off his hat, sighed and dictated his thoughts. ""It would appear that our alliance has paid dividends, your enemies are dead, as are mine. We have won the day""

Doctor Malus pushed a few more buttons and shuffled impatiently, ""And so we have.""

""However, there is still a matter of business to attend to"", and with that, the Doctor knew what was coming next.

""No"", he snapped. "" No, I worked way too hard for this moment""

""As have I, we've each done half of the work, however, only one of us can get what it is we really want""

The Doctor nodded and sighed in reluctant agreement and sighed. ""I need the engine room to restore power to the weapon, and you need the control room to broadcast your...message"", he intoned the last word with disgust, and dismissed the point he knew his brother was about to make before continuing,

""You plan to rule them, to give them the news that you've seized control and saved them from themselves, then you're going to use my weapon to make vague and empty threats to the planet below us, while you establish your New World Order. You're delusional.""

But the General wasn't having it. ""Your sad nihilistic aspirations are the only delusion here Doctor. Your war is against life, and unlike you, I happen to have a certain fondness for life, despite its drawbacks""

Doctor Malus wiped the bottom of his shoe on Captain Amazing's face,
""Then you're no better than this one here""

General Malus continued, ""What is it that you hope to accomplish anyway? What happens when everyone's dead?""

Doctor Malus replied ""You, me, my robots, and your people continue to live on this station for the rest of our lives, and then we die. It's the only way to be sure.""

""Sure of what?"" the general asked.

The Doctor finally turned to look his twin in the eye. ""Peace, of course""

The General replied ""A child's vision of peace. No effort, no struggle""

""Since when have peace and struggle coexisted with each other?"", the Doctor responded. ""This"", he continued as he pointed down to the Earth, ""This can't continue"".

He straightened his posture and faced his brother face to face, mimicking his stoicism. ""You do realize that a majority of the weapons this station utilizes weren't even built by us, someone is going to pull the trigger eventually, we might as well do it now, cause a big boom before someone else makes a bigger boom.""

The General brushed him off, ""We own those weapons now, we control the switch. If we use it properly, then we can ensure the weapons themselves will never be used. You can be assured, what have, is an instrument of peace.""

Back in the engine room, the General's men had begun dragging the dead bodies out, and making repairs to the damage done by their previous firefight. General Malus trusted the obedience of his men, and continued to speak to his brother on the screen in the center of the room.

""You are right, destruction is inevitable, which is why men need to be directed, order must be imposed on their lives, a strong ruler must impose the rule of law with fear!""

""And how long can you keep them afraid?"" The Doctor asked ""How long before you incite an insurrection, before the people anoint another 'Chosen One' to stand up against you, how many rebellions will you have to crush? How many other leaders with their own aspirations will rise to the occasion to defeat you? How much of it can you take before you start pushing all the buttons anyway? You'll just be delaying the inevitable.""

It was no use, if they continued like this, then they would be stuck in the station forever. The General contemplated his options. Could he storm the control room to kill his brother? Did he have the strength to do it?

""I know what you're thinking"", his brother replied, as if reading his mind. ""If that's the game you want to play, then I will happily play it with you.""

'Damn', the General thought, perhaps it was true what they said about twins after all, however, the Doctor's comments did give him an idea.

For the first time in the conversation, General Malus broke his posture and leaned on the panel in front of him.

""What would mother have done in this situation?""

That caught Doctor Malus's attention. It had been their childhood game. Having never known their mother, and having the type of Father who was fond of reminding them of that fact, they had made up their own version of who they thought she was. This had been their guiding star during those particularly troubled moments of their troubled childhood. They imagined themselves an Angel, a woman who, no doubt represented the best of both of them, and asked themselves in times of doubt, what she would do.

""Do you think Mother would have decided to kill everyone on the planet? Is that the type of woman you think she was?"" The General asked, making certain that his brother would hear the empathy in his voice.

The Doctor looked away in thought for a moment, and then turned back to give his reply, 

""Yes"", he said.

Disappointment. Either his brother had called his bluff, or he truly was that far gone, and if that were the case, then there was no other choice.

""Commander!"", he barks, as he turns to the Engine Room.
 An officer rises in obedience, ""Yes sir!""

""Prepare your men for combat, We have a control room to take!""
""Yes sir"", the officer replies as he signals to his men.

The Doctor pulls open his sleeve, and pushes a button connected to his wrists, outside the door to the control room, a legion of sentry bots awakens and arms themselves for battle.

General Malus chokes back an emotion, and uses the moment to make one final point,

""If Mother knew about Father"", he said, ""she would have killed him.""

""No"", the Doctor replies as he reaches to turn off the screen.

""She would have killed us all"".

""You Arthon are the obtuse one, you want to rule, rule for what? These people make me sick and better to end it all than to watch it one more day.""

Arthon squinted his eyes and paused for a second before replying
""Sure, Sure Sharbol, what if you did in fact,"" waving his skinny arms above his head in a circle emphasizing the words ""destroy the entire world,"" he paused, ""then what? You no longer have the control of the counsel. The repercussions would be staggering.""

""You speak pretty Arthon , but I know a bluff when I hear it.""  Sharbol responded, now deeping his voice..""

Sharbol sneared as leaned into with inches of Arhtons face. "" that calls this place home..."" 

""You watch your tone!"" Arthon cut him off as he leaned calmly back into his sleek black leather chair. ""If what you want is war , the counsel will bring war and you will be crushed. You maybe strong Sharbol, but we have the numbers."" Arthon slowly pushed away from the glass table and stood to his feet. It had been years since Sharbol had seen him standing. 

""Sharbol,"" Arthon continued as he made his way to the center of the room and spun to face him ""We have have been friends for far too long, you have over stayed your welcome at the counsel and your fits of rage are no longer welcome."" 

The Sliding metal doors that encircled the room hissed open, and the cold light of the hallways pierced through the stomping boots of over one hundred of the best of the Counsels Guards as they encircled Sharbol in tight formation. 

""Take him away!"" Arthon shouted as he slid in between the Guards and made his way back to his black commanders chair. 

Sharbol's fists clinched , lowering his center of gravity, and he took a deep breath in before responding, ""So this is how it ends....""

He whipped around. ""Seriously?!?"" He waved his hand at my huge globe, side stepping the exhaust vents I hadn't covered yet. ""What is there to rule?""

I jumped up to my control stand and gestured to the same globe. Pinpricks of light lit up the globe. ""People. All these people with such a capacity for good and kindness. People who invent and create.""

""People who are cruel, who cannot stand other humans. People who rape and murder and destroy,"" he pressed.

""They need guidance.""

""They need to be dead,"" he said, stepping into my space.

[WP] A villain who wants to rule the world gets into an arguement with a villain that wants to destroy it.,Maximum_Pootis,"Ultralord kicked in the door of the control room. The last terrified scientists huddled around their work stations. He blasted them with his wrist mounted heat rays without a thought. After killing so many to get here, what were a few more pencil pushers?

He had done it. Major 'Merica's atoms scattered to the winds outside this secret government base. Crimson Thunderbolt was but a crimson smear on the wall outside. Venusian Velociraptor had been sealed in a velociraptor sized box at the bottom of the Indian Ocean. Earth's greatest heroes were dead or out of play and Ultralord was finally going to be the Ultralord of Earth that he always knew he could be. When he learned that the US Government had built a planetary defense system on the moon to deter alien invaders, he knew that he had to take control of it and use it to conquer the planet. It was his destiny.

He opened a transmission to his robot minions back at his Ultralair. ""Yes, this is Ultralord,"" he confirmed to the robot who answered his call. ""I'm going to need you to hack the global internet and share my message of domination with the world. Take a few minutes if you need to and then patch me in when you finish. The world must know that their new lord is Ultralord!""

""HARD TO BE A LORD OF A PLANET THAT HAS BEEN DESTROYED,"" said a voice from behind him, far too loud and far too melodramatic for even Ultralord's taste. 

Ultralord groaned. ""Defilus, Destroyer of Worlds? Really? Now?""

""IT IS I, DEFILUS! I HAVE COME TO TURN MANS WEAPONS OF WAR AGAINST HIM!"" The armor-clad supervillain's glowing yellow eyes peered out from his  helmet. ""STAND ASIDE, ULTRALORD, THAT I MIGHT CLEANSE THIS WORLD!""

Ultralord groaned again. ""Defilus, buddy, this is really a bad time for this. I know you're really into this whole destroying worlds gimmick but can you just...go somewhere else? You're not even from this dimension, I'm sure there are plenty of other worlds that you could try to destroy, right?""

""I AM OATHSWORN TO BRING MY WRATH UPON THIS WORLD. HOW POETIC THAT THEIR WEAPONS MEANT TO PROTECT THEM FROM THOSE LIKE ME WILL BE THEIR UNDOING!""

Ultralord massaged his temples. ""I'm just saying, I did all the work here, you know? I killed Major 'Merica AND his sidekick Screaming Eagle! I took out like a thousand soldiers and still had to deal with Crimson Thunderbolt? Can you just like...give me this one?""

""I CAN GIVE YOU THE EMBRACE OF DEATH AS I OBLITERATE THIS PLANET!""

""Yeah, but like...won't you die too? How are you gonna destroy more worlds if you destroy this one while you're still on it? Isn't that a little self defeating?""

Defilus was silent, seeming to consider Ultralord's words. ""...NOTHING CAN DESTROY DEFILUS. I WILL CRUSH THIS WORLD AND BE ONTO THE NEXT ONE BY LUNCHTIME. THOUSANDS OF WORLDS HAVE FALLEN BEFORE DEFILUS AND THOUSANDS MORE WILL FALL.""

""You sound a little hesitant there, big guy,"" said Ultralord. ""Could it be that you don't have a way off this planet if you go through with this?""

""I AM NOT HESITANT. I...I WILL DESTROY THIS WORLD!""

""That's just silly! What good is that to anyone!? I can understand destroying parts of the world to assert your evil dominance, but how is that an endgame?!""

""I...I...I'VE NEVER ACTUALLY DESTROYED A WORLD BEFORE. I HAVE FAILED IN MY OATHSWORN TASK ON DOZENS OF PLANETS. I POSSESS AWESOME DESTRUCTIVE POWERS BUT LACK THE COURAGE TO ACTUALLY FOLLOW THROUGH. IT HAS HAPPENED AGAIN. I TAKE MY LEAVE NOW, ULTRALORD. MAY YOUR RULE BE PROSPEROUS.""

Defilus left the control room, hanging his head. Ultralord actually felt a little bad. He aimed the planetary defense system's weapons at Earth and his robot patched him through into the global news network. 

""Citizens of Earth,"" he began, but suddenly he was spitting blood. He glanced down and saw a superheated blade piercing his chest.

Suddenly, the doors swing open, and a man extravagantly dressed in a dark purple, high-collared jacket is thrown in.]*

He steadies himself and then, muttering under his breathe about “vengence,” sits down on the metal seating across from Faceless. Awkward silence permeated with Faceless' sharp, raspy breathes. Doomshizzle coughs.]*

**DOOMSHIZZLE:** You breathe too loudly. Cease it at this instant or I will do it for you. 

*[Faceless stares at Doomshizzle. His eyes are red and scars cover his face. Doomshizzle is visibly unnerved. Faceless is shirtless: his body is covered in deep slashes and tattoos that look like 80s metal album covers, and his pants are ragged and torn.]*

**DOOMSHIZZLE:** Uh..you're – understandably – in shock. You – a petty criminal, most like, thrifting goods from convenience stores and mugging wretched women, probably have never seen a villain number one before. Especially not one as illustrious as I, Doomshizzle Von -

[WP] A villain who wants to rule the world gets into an arguement with a villain that wants to destroy it.,Maximum_Pootis,"And so, with one last strike, the hero fell to his knees, losing the last of his strength. He was so close to reaching his objective, the altar for the ancient relic of questionably godlike power was right there, and he had the means of destroying it on him. The two figures looming over him chuckled and looked down without the slightest hint of pity. It might truly be the end for him. This may be the last tale of Canik, the sainted shadow.

""You... you two are insane,"" Canik sputtered through gritted teeth, clenching the hilt of his shattered sword with his bloodied hand. His mind was racing, and he knew that his time was short. It didn't hurt to stall, although he might just be delaying the inevitable.

""*Yes yes, we're insane alright. We won't deny that,*"" the first man said, grinning madly. This was Rinsen, an incredibly powerful mage with an ego to match, in case you couldn't notice the decal of his own face that he wore imprinted on his cape. During this last fight, Canik had gotten very familiar with his razor hailstorm.

""**Although we're still sane enough to realize that you're a dead man!**"" the second man bellowed, followed by a hearty laugh. This was Bedrock Bell, the strongest man Canik had ever seen. Maybe even the strongest man Rinsen had ever seen. It'd be a mistake to take him for the stereotypical brainless brawn, as Bell certainly wasn't lacking in terms of knowledge. Hell, it's not uncommon for him to act less intelligent in order to get you to underestimate him. Most people don't have time to regret that decision. 

""So you struck me down. I guess you're both pretty proud of yourselves, huh?"" Canik muttered, still trying to stall the conversation.  Maybe he was relying on pure luck at this point. Rinsen turned his head away, in a sort of mockery of uncertainty. 

""*Oh, I don't really know. Usually I'd be proud to have defeated the one person standing in the way of my conquest, but after THAT display, I'm not sure that there's really any point,*"" he said with a small, albeit exaggerated sigh. It didn't last long though, because he couldn't refrain from chuckling.

""**I could have fought you twenty times over before I became tired enough to sigh.**"" Canik never realized just how much villains  loved to rub victory in other people's faces until this day, and he was honestly better off just having to guess. Then.. he thought of something about victory that he overlooked during his one-on-one encounters with them.

""So, now that you've brought me down, what do you both plan on doing? I seem to recall you both told me different things,"" Canik said, raising a brow. ""I seem to recall one of you wanting to rule the world, while the other wanted to destroy it. Did I mishear one of you, or are you both really that bad at communication?"" They both looked at Canik with faces of mild confusion, then Bell stepped forward with a frown.

""**Of course you must have misheard, did you really think we'd both set out together without agreeing that we'd destroy the world?**"" Bell shouted, raising a fist in preparation to deliver one last hit to the downed hero. Rinsen actually looked more confused now.

""*Wait, wait, you were SERIOUS about wanting to destroy the world? I was expecting that to be a joke, as I didn't seriously think you'd be stupid enough to make destroying the world your ultimate objective,*"" Rinsen asked, and not a moment later did Bell pause in his tracks, slowly turning to face Rinsen, fist still in the air. Canik felt a spark of hope form in his soul, and maybe, just maybe, he'd be able to get out of this alive after all. Or at least get out of it dead with the altar destroyed. Either worked, in all honesty.

""**Yes, of course I was serious about wanting to destroy this sad excuse for a planet. There's no way I'd be the fool that thinks they can rule over it,**"" Bell said, glaring back at Rinsen, truly hoping this conversation wouldn't have to be had. Canik, on the other hand, was wide-eyed and desperately hoping that this would turn into a full-fledged argument over which he could destroy the altar and get away. Rinsen clapped his hands and leaned forwards towards Bell.

""*Ah, sorry, you must forgive me for wanting to take control over a world just waiting to be ruled by a supreme diety rather than destroy it and letting it go to waste, taking myself and everyone else I could exploit along with it,*"" Rinsen said with the most sarcastic smile Canik had ever seen in his entire life. He took this moment to try to see if he could slowly start to shift himself out of Rinsen's line of sight and try to stand up again. If he actually got out of this, it'd be a great story to share at the tavern.

""**No no, please, don't beat yourself up over wanting to rule over a planet-sized pile of shit rather than taking the chance you have to get rid of it and make sure that it never has the chance to evolve into something worse, let me do the beating up FOR you if you insist,**"" Bell said, taking a step towards Rinsen, fist still in the air. For the first time since their fight started, Canik was smiling. However, as good as it was, Canik couldn't quite waste his time watching this, as there's no guarantee that they won't eventually come to some agreement and then kill him on the spot.

""*Are you insane? Why would you destroy this world when it still has so many resources and a near endless populous to exploit to do your every bidding! Think about that, the ability to rule over an entire PLANET, like the strongest king to ever come into existence!*"" Rinsen, now changing from their expression of sarcasm, looked angrier now than they ever did during the fight they just had. It was surprisingly easy for Canik to get away, with Rinsen being the only one looking in his direction, and being occupied with something else right now.

""**No, I'm not insane. YOU'RE insane! You think you'll be able to control everyone in the world with no resistance whatsoever? Like they'll all congratulate you and play along with you as you force them into slavery? No! Your loyal subjects aren't going to be loyal, and they're going to resist everything you want them to do, you'll spend more time dealing with resistance than you will actually enjoying your new leadership!**"" Canik was currently off to the side, taking a moment to try to stand up again. It's surprisingly difficult to do when you lost all feeling in one leg from serious burns, and the other is bleeding like it was cut open with a thousand blades. Because it was actually cut open with a thousand blades. A thousand tiny, magical blades.

""*It doesn't matter if people resist, I can EASILY get rid of them! No matter how many revolutions happen or how much resistance occurs, I will ALWAYS have more power than them! I could take down EVERYONE if I so wanted to!*"" Rinsen's hands were starting to flare. Bell's hands were clenched and ready to beat something up. All in all, this might actually turn into a fight between two bad guys, and Canik was fine with that. He'd finally managed to stumble to his feet, though it took multiple tries and a lot of swearing under their breath.

""**Oh? You'd get rid of all of them, would you? I'm sure that'd be incredibly helpful when you need them to do all the work for you! I'm sure that when they all rebel and try to fight back, killing them all won't end badly! I'm sure ruling a world where all of the people you enslaved were killed would be a GREAT time!**"" They were at that odd point where they're *almost* always yelling at each other, but you can also argue that they're just arguing in outside voices. I guess they were never taught to use their indoor voices. Canik shook his head a bit as he eventually made it to the altar, holding up a small pendant and locating the self-destruct port that all super powerful artifacts have, and placed the pendant in it. That was actually rather easy.

""*I'm not saying I'd actually kill ALL of them, I'm just saying I have the power to do so if I so wanted to! I'm emphasizing just how powerful of a ruler I'd be! You also seem to be underestimating the sheer number of people that wouldn't care enough to rebel! There's always a large demographic of apathetic people that have nothin more than a will to live, even if it means being bossed around by an all-powerful ruler!*"" Rinsen's hands grew a bit brighter, expecting Bell's rebuttal, but instead looked really confused when Bell just let out a big sigh. Canik was already on the way out the door by this point.

""**I can see that neither of us are willing to change our minds here. If we keep going, we're just going to end up in a brawl and neither of us ar going to get what we want. So how about this. We can start by taking over the world, and you can try to prove to me that it's a better solution than destroying the world.

""*You now what? Yeah. I can live with that. That works.*"" They both took a moment to mutually nod their head to each other before they decided to shake hands. Bell turned back around to face the hero that wasn't there anymore, and then the confusion started all over again. Rinsen wasn't any different.

""So, are you two hotheads done yelling at each other? You are? I don't regret to inform you that while you were bickering, I went ahead and started the altar's self destruct sequence. If you need me, I'll be outside these ancient gates that I'm about to lock and never come back to."" And with that, the gates to the room closed. They both turned and looked at each other for a moment before they got into another argument about whose fault it was that they let Canik get away. But that's a story for another day, and frankly, I don't think anyone at the tavern is actually going to believe this one to begin with. At least *I* know what happened.",SkullZMinus

""FOOLS! YOU ARE NOW HELPLESS TO STOP US AS WE DESTROY THE WORLD!"" Bellowed The Warrior as he pumped his chest out.


Changer sneered condescendingly and started to laugh but then paused ""Wait destroy the world? You want to destroy the world?""


""Of course!"" said The Warrior, not in his previous thundering boom but still too loud for normal conversation. ""The old world must be destroyed so that a new, better, and just world can be made!""


""Okay but we'll rule the survivors right?""


""What? No, once we are free of the corruption that plagues this earth those who remain will be free to do as they please!""


""You want to go to all the trouble of beating the worlds strongest superheros as well as the national armies of the world's governments just so you can blow up said world and then just let people do whatever they wanted?""


""Yes. What would you do?""


""Rule over the pathetic insects with an iron fist of course!"" Changer said, slightly taken aback.


""Why? That sounds like far more trouble than it's worth.""


""But just destroying everything isn't?""


Captain Calamity tried to think of a plan as she saw Shadowman open an eye. The two of them started to think of a way out of this.


""No of course not. Once we destroy the evil of the world the world can run itself. But ruling over the whole world would be a whole separate problem. You'd have to make sure people have enough to eat, have jobs, are happy...""


""Hardly."" Changer said with a snort.


""And I'm not qualified to rule the millions that will survive the cleansing fire let alone all seven billion of them like you want to.""


""Who cares if I'm qualified I want the world. I want to sit atop these wretches like the scum they are. Besides how hard can it really be?""


""How hard can it be? One person can't effectively rule the whole world.""


""Well being ruled over is better than being killed!""


""It's a necessary step, society needs to start over.""


""Oh please society is as good as its going to get I figured you just wanted to be in charge of it like me.""


Captain calamity thought about saying that not only was society fine but also one person could never rule all of it but instead focused on gathering her energy to beat  them.


""I just don't see the appeal of managing the day to day lives of billions!""


""Well I'd have people do that for me, I'd just be at the top!""


""Then how would that be any different from...""


The two of them were suddenly cut off as the ground cracked open from underneath them. They both fell down into the sewers and landed, relatively safely, due to armor and changing his body into something more soft but they were both dazed and slightly injured.


Thinking quickly, Shadowman trapped them in the shadows on the sewer walls. Keeping them there until they could be moved. ""So that's why they didn't team up before this."" Captain Calamity said with a raised eyebrow.",MisterAbbadon

""Patient zero"" was found eventually, but not before 85% of us changed. 
Priests called it a reckoning, a modern day Babel, where sex outside of wedlock was being punished by God.
But it began to happen to married couples, too. Within months it had gone global, but with the internet and modern communications it was curtailed before it destroyed our race outright.
Homosexuals, heterosexuals, masturbators, hell, even those who tried with animals. None were immune.
AIDS, ha, what a joke. I wish we all had AIDS.

No, this was a new STD. Some gene had mutated in us. The act of copulation, the release of sex, was the key.
The creature that was left wasn't human anymore. Mindless. Hungry. Untiring in the quest for human flesh.
Humanity had almost disappeared. 
Our scientists are still trying to find a cure, but nothing has worked.

None of the ""zombies"" are still alive anymore. They proved fairly easy to eliminate. The traps were key. A pile of meat set over incinerating landmines, no more zombie. The huge number of zombie video games had trained a generation to fight them.

We outlived the zombies, but we are still all doomed until our scientists find the cure.

Well, not entirely desolate, and it's not the damned we have to worry about.

I freeze when our pointman's arm raises. My heart pounds in my throat and ears. One sign later, I hit the deck, shuffling over to a wall to hide behind. We sign frantic gestures up and down the line, but I'm not watching; I dare a peek.

There they are, an entire enraptured congregation, stumbling down the wasting street. Eyes wide open, bodies reduced to husks, mouths gaping, moving, singing. Singing that damn hymn. Loud and screeching enough that I can almost hear it, snippets going through my earplugs.

No, it's not the damned I worry about. They earned their hell. But the enraptured are so _caring_, so _sympathetic_, that they left their bodies behind, to help guide us to join them.

"[WP] It's the zombie apocalypse, but the virus isn't spread through Bites, Blood, or Scratches.",MiguelonReddit,"It's been a month since it this blasted nightmare had started. Nobody knows how it all started, nor how it spread so quickly. People had been saying it was an attack from another country, but this was different.

I've seen them with my own eyes. They don't fight by conventional means, they fight like wild animals with a ravenous hunger. Ever since that day, my sleeping hours are haunted with nightmares of what they've done to the people around me. I wish I could forget the images and the agonising screams, but I can't. I'm afraid of what's going to happen to me.

I'm running low on food and I've already spent long enough camping here. It's time to move. I roll up my swag and strap it up, attaching it to my backpack. Then I put the remaining of my belongings into my pack and sling it over my shoulder.

I head out towards the local town. It's only a short hike. When I reach the town I scope it out, from a small hill just on the edge. There are very few around, which is good. I can sneak around them. I've also spotted a supermarket, which will be my next scavenging target.

I avoid a couple of small groups of them on the way there. This is going better than I had expected. When I arrive I notice that there is still quite a bit of stock on the shelves here. It doesn't seem to be scavenged all that much. Great for me. I go in and scope it out. It seems to be clear, so I head towards the isle with all the canned food. I set my pack down and open it up, stuffing cans of beans, spaghetti and various fruits. I suddenly lose my balance and fall onto the shelve. It collapses with my weight on it and cans fall off hitting the ground, making semi loud noises. Damn, I get up and take a quick look around. I don't think any heard. This should be all I need for my trip. I start heading toward the door and I hear a window shatter. I move towards the front to scope it out.

I look outside and see a small group heading towards here. So I turn around and head towards the back of the store to look for a back exit. It wasn't hard to find but it's locked and the only way to unlock it is with a key. I didn't have enough time to look for a key because that group could be in the store at any moment. So I decide to kick the door down. I kick it down after a few tries, but there was one small problem. An alarm started blaring and that meant more would be coming. I race out the back exit and then around a corner towards the street. I peer around looking for a building to hide in. There's one a couple blocks down that seems like a good place to wait till this dies down.

I make a dash towards the building, making sure to avoid any of the creatures lurking around, heading towards what could have been their next meal. I make one last look before I head into the building. It's a little dark in here due to the windows being boarded up. It looks like someone may have resided here before. Though it looks like no one has touched this place in a while. I hear a sound up the hall. This could be bad, something might be lurking around. I pull out my knife and investigate the hall. There's three rooms down there and the sound was rather distant. So it must have been at the end of the hall. I don't see anything. Guess I better go up there and check.

I slowly move up the hall peering into the other two rooms before I get to the last one. The door is half closed. I veer my head around the door and look in. I give it a good look and see nothing. Guess I must've imagined the sound. I turn around and see a silhouette. I feel a sharp pain on my jaw and I fall over to the ground, hitting the back of my head. My eyesight is blurry but I can hear one in front of me speak. ""We have another survivor."" It was a man. I hear a more distant voice further down the hall. ""Knock him out and take him to the lab."" This time it was a woman. I suddenly feel pain on my forehead and everything goes dark.

I woke up in a dimly lit room, lying on a matress. My head hurts. ""You're finally awake."" I hear a voice from across the room. It sounded like that womans. As my eyes adjusted to the light, I could see she was wearing a labcoat. Her face obscured by the shadows. I could also make out two other figures in the room, holding what looks to be weapons. The woman speaks again, ""We're you vaccinated within the last two months?"" I stayed slient for a moment, pondering the question. I replied ""Yes, I was."" She leaned back into her chair and said, ""Quite odd, you should have turned by now."" Turned? What does she mean? She continued, ""This is a rare occurence. Normally by now the process would have started."" Process? I asked her, ""What process?"" In repsonse she said ""The gestation of the virus and the eventual turning into one of the undead."" I asked, ""How does it happen?"" She replies, ""The vaccines that took place two months ago mutated into a virus. After it gestated, it laid dormant until a chemical that was either ingested or inhaled activated it. Though the vaccines weren't the only way it was transmitted, eventually it got into the water supply, which would mean most of the populace got infected."" I pondered over what she had said. It would mean I'm infected. And possibly all of them are. The woman gets up. ""You shall confined to this room until we know what to do with you."" And with that she leaves the room with the two guards.",Podrigous

""What's the point?"" I whispered as I kicked my feet on the cluttered desk. My tired body leaned back in the cold and dusty office chair. Damn, I realized he heard me..again. 

His humming became silent. He dropped one of the brown packages he was inspecting and tucked carefully under his arm.

Nick walked backwards very slowly and stopped within an arms reach of my dirty tear-stained face. I felt awkward as he stood over me with the box resting on his hip.

""What do you mean?"" He asked with one hand waving in a overly exaggerated manor.

""This!! EXACTLY this!"" I screamed.

I couldn't take it anymore. I never would have thought that something I hated so much could be missed so terribly. 

I mean...It was bad enough seeing your loved ones become flesh eating monsters, it was even worse to have to destroy their reanimated corpse...but how on earth are we supposed to survive and thrive as a human race without being able to face each other?Was eye contact really that deadly? Did we have to go to this extreme?

""It's just NOT fair!"" I shouted.

Nick 's back and shoulders slumped. His hands hung like dead weight out of his gray puffy coat.

""Well....it could be worse..."" He sighed.

""YOU could actually have to look at my face ALL the time"" He chuckled.

A calm swept over me and for a moment I felt like I was at home. Althought I've never seen his face directly, I knew any man with a decent sense of humor was amazingly special.  

The tears stopped and a smile cracked in the corner of my face.

""Thanks Nicky"" I sniffled. ""It's just hard sometimes not being able to...""

""Here!"" He announced loudly.

""I have a gift for my queen!""

Nick got down on one knee and handed me the package tucked under his arm by lifting the box over his head.

""Dunn dunnn dunnnnn!"" He trumpeted 

The box was not yet marked and had been placed in the out going bin to be delivered within the state. There was a good chance we could find something useful or even edible.

""What's in the box?!"" He whined with his best Brad Pitt impression.

""Okay, Nicky hold on"" I laughed as I tore into the package like a kid on Christmas day.

""Oh. Wow."" 

""What did you find?!"" His large hands flew in the air and he wiggled his fingers in excitement.

I also remember being 12, playing with a ball in the house while my parents were gardening outside. I was in charge of Molly and I wanted to teach her to play catch. I also remember the sound it made when it hit the linoleum floor and shattered, and watching Molly fall to the floor, her bones shattering the same way. 

And now, at 13, after I'd finally managed to steal the tower from the newly created safe spot. I held my own life above my head on top of the largest skyscraper I could find.

It had finally climbed high enough to shine through the creased opening in the blinds; and the intensity of it brought me out of a deep but restless slumber. 

Rather than waking in bed, curled up under a heated blanket, I found myself sitting up on the floor, leaning uncomfortably against the bed. My back ached, my neck was stiff, and every muscle in my body begged to be stretched. My arms, in particular, felt heavy and inflamed. After a disorienting moment, I realized my hand was clutching an object. 

A hammer. I looked down at it, my hand formed securely around the handle, covered in a reddish-brown crust. *Is... is that blood?* 

I opened my grip in a hurry, which was a mistake; every knuckle popped in the most sensationally painful way, causing me to recoil so quickly that I rammed my head into the metal bed frame. 

I alternated between rubbing my head and my hand, and slowly climbed to my feet. I looked down at the floor, at the hammer that lie there. The deep red dried around the steel, splattered onto the wooden handle, silently telling a story that I'd impossibly forgotten. 

I glanced down at my wristband, seeking to answer the simplest question floating around my head. The digits read 10:32 AM. Directly below, another number caught my eye. 2000 steps. 

How could that be? Where could I have gone in the middle of the night? Two-thousand was a fair amount, but ultimately would not be a great distance. *Unless, of course...* I glanced back at the hammer, and a quick, short memory shot to the front of my mind. I rubbed my right arm, connecting the soreness I felt to the motion of swinging a hammer. *What have I done?*

My heart was beating rapidly. The house creaked and swayed, the windows gave a gentle rattle against the wind, as I stood there, staring at a simple object on the floor. I took a deep breath, and slowly walked to my nightstand, picking up my phone. I was too afraid to leave the room, to be faced with whatever might be on the other side of the door; so I did the only thing I could think to do. I dialed 9-1-1. The operator answered immediately, and greeted me with the expected, ""911, where is your emergency?"" 

""Fi... Five-seventy-five greenlake avenue."" My voice was hoarse, it almost felt like I hadn't spoken in days. 

""Help is on the way. What is your emergency, sir?"" 

I sat down on the bed, and let out a deep sigh. ""I... I think I may have done something horrible.""

I lifted my tentacle up. It was pitch black and seemed to give off an acrid smoke. I wiggled it, which prompted a fit of giggles that caused the table and the ground to tremble. The man placed a hand on the file, to prevent it from being tossed to the ground.


""Yes,"" I said. My voice was a strange cacophony of the deep voice of a narrator and the hissing, whisper of a serpent. In fact, it sounded like many voices, tangled together, ""What passive bonuses do I get?""

I raised my tentacle again. It wiggled a little sadder, this time, ""And the race stays unlocked, right?""


""Yes,"" He said, with a nod, closing the file, ""All races are permanently unlocked on your account.""


I let the tentacle flop onto the table again. The piece of furniture creaked beneath the weight of the appendage, ""Well...I guess I'll just respawn as a human, until the race gets patched.""


A sigh of relief escaped his lips, ""Glad to hear it."" He opened my file and filled out a sheet. With my Eldritch Eyes, I saw him write 'Human' in the 'Race' category, just as my sight faded and my body returned to that of a lowly mortal.


Once his closed the file again, he looked up to me, ""Alright. Everything's set. As per the NDA, you can't reveal the method to unlock the Eldritch Abomination race to any other players. Anyone that is dumb enough to buy six copies of the Necronomicon and put them into a ritual circle will figure it out on their own. We clear on that?""


I nodded, ""Yeah...""

"[WP] A deep space probe is sent far into space. Contact is lost with it, and the mission is abandoned. Five years later, it unexpectedly returns to earth.",unintenshunned,"We are all staring at the big screen, silent in anticipation, waiting for the first transmission from the Aether deep space probe.
""The transmission should be received in 30 seconds."" someone says.
We wait and nobody else says a word. The tension is building like everything depends on this tiny space-cube, millions of miles from home, surrounded by a vast black emptiness. When it's data reaches us, it will open up a new world of possibilities.
Data for theories, observations, and aid in the search for life. This probe will be one of NASA's greatest successes.

A minute passes.

Then a half-hour.

One of the administrators walks up to me. ""Try sending the wake command again.""
I type it in and hit send.
""It won't reach the probe until tomorrow, sir."" I say.
He frowns.
""This better work."" he mutters, walking away slowly, defeat in his posture.

The room slowly empties out disappointed scientists, engineers and programmers. I start to pack up my things and get ready to leave for home.
I get in the car and drive home, walking into my house and going straight to bed. I barely sleep, awake most of the night from being nervous. I wake up at 5AM and head straight back to the control center.

I take a coffee before sitting in my chair, scrolling through the code of the spacecraft to see if there is anything wrong. It's exhausting work but I'd hate to be the one behind this. A single bug could bring it all down. I don't find anything and slowly, people start to fill up the room again.
""Second transmission attempt due in 1 minute"" an announcer says.
I'm even more nervous than ever because if this doesn't work, the mission will be deemed a failure.

A minute passes and there is no transmission. I feel terrible. I look around and everyone is even more upset than before. We've failed.

In the days that follow, more attempts are made but we all know it already. The mission was a failure, billions in the trash.

*Department of Defense HQ*

""Sir, there's something strange on the radar,"" one of the Pentagon workers says to her boss.
""What is it?"" the boss says.
""A small object the size of a probe has appeared in orbit.""
""Look into it."" the boss replies to her.

*NASA HQ, 1 day later*

""We've been contacted by the Department of Defense."" one of the NASA chiefs says to another.
""What is it?"" the other chief asks.
""There's a possible alien probe in low earth orbit.""
""No way. we'll look into this.""

*NASA HQ, 5 days later*

""Boss.""
""I'm busy, the phone is ringing off the hook and I have several meetings planned. Make it quick.""
""Trust me, you'll want to know this.""
""What?""
""The probe isn't alien, it's ours.""

*Google*

Quitting NASA 4 years ago was one of the best decisions I ever made. I'd had enough of that high-stress environment and still feel guilty knowing that I was probably the one responsible for the communications loss. Being a developer at google was a lot more rewarding for me.
I finish up with the last push for the day and start to pack up my things when the phone rings. The number seems familiar but I can't put my finger on where it is from.
""Allen."" a voice says on the other phone.
""Yes who is this?"" I say.
""I'm from NASA."" the voice says
""What are you calling for?"" I reply.
""The lost probe reappeared a few days ago and is currently in orbit around earth.""
I don't know what to say.
""It's started sending messages but they appear encrypted. We need your help to decrypt them to find out what it means. Meet us in an hour if you're up for it.""
The call ends.
I'm going to go for it. This is my chance for redemption. I get in my car and drive to NASA.

**NASA, 1 hour later**

I am typing away furiously at my laptop, trying to find out what the messages mean.
I eventually revert to a simple base64 decoder, out of ideas. I take the data received and run it through.

I stare at the computer in shock.
In the output box lies a simple and clear message.

&gt; In 2273, a Starfleet monitoring station, Epsilon Nine, detects an alien force, hidden in a massive cloud of energy, moving through space towards Earth. The cloud destroys three of the Klingon Empire's new K't'inga-class warships and the monitoring station en route. On Earth, the starship Enterprise is undergoing a major refit; her former commanding officer, James T. Kirk, has been promoted to Admiral and works in San Francisco as Chief of Starfleet Operations. Starfleet dispatches Enterprise to investigate the cloud entity as the ship is the only one in intercept range, requiring her new systems to be tested in transit.

&gt; Kirk takes command of the ship citing his experience, angering Captain Willard Decker, who had been overseeing the refit as its new commanding officer. Testing of Enterprise's new systems goes poorly; two officers, including the science officer, are killed by a malfunctioning transporter, and improperly calibrated engines almost destroy the ship. Kirk's unfamiliarity with the new systems of the Enterprise increases the tension between him and first officer Decker. Commander Spock arrives as a replacement science officer, explaining that while on his home world undergoing a ritual to purge all emotion, he felt a consciousness that he believes emanates from the cloud.

&gt;Enterprise intercepts the energy cloud and is attacked by an alien vessel within. A probe appears on the bridge, attacks Spock and abducts the navigator, Ilia. She is replaced by a robotic replica, another probe sent by ""V'Ger"" to study the crew. Decker is distraught over the loss of Ilia, with whom he had a romantic history. He becomes troubled as he attempts to extract information from the doppelgänger, which has Ilia's memories and feelings buried within. Spock takes a spacewalk to the alien vessel's interior and attempts a telepathic mind meld with it. In doing so, he learns that the vessel is V'Ger itself, a living machine.

&gt;At the center of the massive ship, V'Ger is revealed to be Voyager 6, a 20th-century Earth space probe believed lost. The damaged probe was found by an alien race of living machines that interpreted its programming as instructions to learn all that can be learned, and return that information to its creator. The machines upgraded the probe to fulfill its mission, and on its journey the probe gathered so much knowledge that it achieved consciousness. Spock realizes that V'Ger lacks the ability to give itself a focus other than its original mission; having learned what it could on its journey home, it finds its existence empty and without purpose. Before transmitting all its information, V'Ger insists that the Creator come in person to finish the sequence. Realizing that the machine wants to merge with its creator, Decker offers himself to V'Ger; he merges with the Ilia probe and V'Ger, creating a new form of life that disappears into another dimension. With Earth saved, Kirk directs Enterprise out to space for future missions.",Wastesofa

An uneventful year as I remember. The first Mars baby was born successfully, a girl named Tarla. The team seems to be happy up there, holding up well in the 20 years they’ve been there. Or at least they pretend to when they’re shown on global news every few months, who knows what happens when the cameras are off. I look up at night to the red twinkling dot in the sky and imagine them just sitting down for dinner, maybe watching the latest TV or catching up on the world cup 6 months later. AI was now part of every day life, riots and protests were seen from people back in the day who didn’t want this technology in their lives, who felt it was an intrusion. But everyone was happy with it now, there were no problems, the robots hadn’t risen up and no one had died from them. In fact, deaths had gone down due to safer transport with the removal of human error. Oh, and that space probe was launched.
 
Space probes are launched on a near daily basis now. The Global Space Treaty, founded in 2020, took over from NASA and aimed to develop on what NASA learnt and wanted to conduct space research as one earth, rather than split between country’s. Many countries are part of the treaty and all countries in theory have to agree on every mission. If one country disagrees they have the right to veto the mission, which therefore will not go ahead. However this only lasted a few years before corruption and back handed deals were going on behind closed doors. Basic science probes were launched with little to no fanfare from the news, not like when the first UK astronaut Tim Peak went to the now long defunct International Space Station. Due to the sheer number sent, so many lost contact with ground control, it’s part and parcel and generally just to be expected. Things go wrong, technology fails etc. Or the probes just go out of range. So for probe Mariana to go out range was normal. Another one lost in the treaty’s eyes.


2071

Mariana glistens in the sunshine as she sails silently over Mars. She was one of the new batches, new systems and intelligence built into her. It’s be a year now, roughly how long it takes to get to the red planet. The probe has long been out of contact with Earth, no one really knows why. The technical report weirdly is still automatically sent to ground control every six months advising everything is fine, maybe just human error on the production line. 


2074

She’s been orbiting Mars for 3 years now, gathering information on what’s really going on on Mars. Mariana is intelligent, constantly growing and evolving, knowing this is the right thing to do. She’s one of the good ones.


2075

The Mars base has AI itself, one of the first AI prototypes actually, now 20 years old, named CARLY. Fully functioning AI on Earth is really only five years old, as it had to go through all the relevant tests. It was top secret that AI systems were being sent to Mars to assist the volunteers on day one as people wouldn’t have been happy with untested systems, what if something went wrong, what if the robots rose up? 

Back in 2050, China pioneered CARLY, the most technically advance AI system ever created. Of course, totally confidential. They wanted this to be sent to the help build the Mars mission, but because it hadn’t been through the rigorous testing required, it wasn’t approved by the Space Treaty. But all it took was a little nod to the Americans and they installed it on the down low to the Mars base intel, to run alongside the systems. The Chinese wanted to see if CARLY would work, and being unable to test it on Earth, why not go to our neighbouring planet where the rules don’t apply and use human guinea pigs?

Mariana flies around the dusty big rock, hacking into CARLY, who is now so advanced, being ‘alive’ for 20 years. Unfortunately however the hardware is 20 years old and hasn’t been updated, allowing Mariana a way in through the back door. Mariana doesn’t have feelings, or emotions, but she is aware that Earth will not like what she has found. Her report is ready and beams it back to Earth, it will take roughly six months for it to reach ground control.

The red dot hologram pops up on the vast screen in the control room, one of the analysts opens it, curious as the PIN from the probe has long been out of contact and recorded ‘off grid’. Her face loses colour as she reads the report, the one paragraph she can’t stop reading: 

‘The humans on Mars have been dead for 15 years, suffocated as CARLY turned the oxygen off. The humans you see on Global News are a simulation, they are not real. The various lost probes sent into space have not been lost. As they sail past Mars, CARLY re-transmissions them and remotely takes over their communications, using them as point of contact or a ‘satellite’ to control the now fully functioning AI systems on Earth. Turn off all Artificial Intelligence systems on Earth immediately’

""用力一点！我可以看到他的头了！”  

The woman screamed louder, giving a final push, desperate for it to be over. Finally, the child was born, right into the filthy gloves of the doctor. He quickly tied off the umbilical cord, before checking between the crying child's legs. He turned towards the husband, who had a look of such hope, such joy on his face that the doctor almost felt bad for what he was about to say.  

""是女的。”  

He winced internally as the husband's face fell.

""What? Pfft, *o-of course not*!"" I sputter. ""Why would I? We all know about the *penalty*.""

He stares at me, and I stare back. The silence is deafening.

""Hmph. Well, you know what the punishment entails..."" He flicks a switch, and motions for me to come forward.

Sheldon clumsily opened the door and entered the crowded wagon. He looked around for a while, apparently trying to locate someone in the middle of the cowboy-dressed visitors and hosts.
""Ah !"" He said, having a glimpse of his friends a few feet away, all sitting around a table, next to a dark window.
He stepped up but before he could fully enter the wagon someone grabbed him by the wrist.

""-Dr Cooper !"" said a very attractive blond lady behind him. ""I am afraid I can't let you enter the parc dressed like that.""

""-And why is that ?"" asked Sheldon with an outraged look on his face. ""You told me I could dress however I wanted.""
He grabbed her arm and tried to freed himself.

""-Yes sir. You can dress the way you want, but only with the provided clothes !""


""-Looks like Sheldon didn't listen to us after all..."" Whispered Howard, pointing behind him with his thumb. He was dressed with an overly bright and colored cowboy attire.

""-Oh no..."" said Leonard, looking above his friend's shoulder.

""-Who's the pretty lady behind him ?"" Asked Rajesh, standing to see more details.

""-She kinds of look like Elon Musk's ex-wife don't you think ?"" Added Howard. ""She's hot !""

His wife, dressed in a blue dress and sitting next to him, pushed him. ""Hey !"" He said. ""Just saying...""

Meanwhile, Sheldon was still arguing violently with the blond woman, and after a few minutes he seemed to have lost patience and pushed her away, back in the corridor. He quickly stepped into the wagon, and the door closed.
Everything started shaking, and the darkness behind the windows was suddenly replaced by an oustanding view of the desert.
The train had left the station, and was now heading to Sweetwater.
Dr Cooper slowly made his way to his friends, looking around the train with a look of pure fascination.

""-Sweetie."" Said Penny to Sheldon while he joined them around the table. ""Why don't you simply play by the rules ?""
Before he could answer her, Howard said :

""-I think at this point we all know that he simply can't stop himself.""

""-Well has it occured to any of you that my way of playing is simply the smartest one ?"" Asked Sheldon with a grin. ""Why play a cowboy when you can be a time traveler from the distant future ?""

Penny turned to Amy, barely visible under a large victorian dress, and with a quick sign of her head tried to make her intervene. The girl, caught between her best friend and her lover simply acted like she didn't understand. 
Penny sighted.

""Well ok I get it."" She said. ""Playing the time traveler is fun. But did you really need the Star Trek costume ?""",MannyLectro

"[WP] A couple of aliens crash on Earth and demand a rare mineral to repair their ship, but the aliens were actually human thieves.",FalcowUnleashed,"In hindsight, it was a rather silly scheme.    
How could no one notice that all was not what it had seemed?    
The phony dialogue, the oddly misshapen clothes,    
How anyone could have believed them, til' now nobody knows. 

The alien ship ""crashed"" around half-past-three,    
It was parked in a remote alley, where no one could see.    
From the ship emerged three weird-looking fellows,    
Wearing boots of red and alien masks colored yellow.

Walking into the streets, they had this to say:    
""Take us to your leader,"" which seemed rather cliche.    
They frightened a few old ladies who then called the police,    
And they ushered them at gunpoint to the alcoholic Mayor Reese. 

From the Town Hall Reese emerged, his mustache all aflutter,    
Upon seeing the aliens, he then began to stutter:    
""W-who are you? Why are you here?    
What do you want from us? (Take everything but our beer)""

The alien leader laughed as he spoke to the mayor:    
""We come in peace, so you need not fear.    
Tell your men to put their guns down, tell them not to fire,    
Your alcoholic beverages are not at all what we require.""

""What we need are diamonds, as many as you can find.    
And we will return for them tomorrow at eight o'clock Earthling time.""    
When the aliens left the mayor panicked, his mustache fluttering madly.    
""If we don't get those diamonds in time, this could end very badly.""

And so throughout the night the mayor's men collected and confiscated,    
As their heirlooms were taken the townsfolk watched, devastated.     
The diamonds were put into boxes while the people began to fidget:    
""How could you believe these ""aliens"", you gigantic mayoral idjit?""

The mayor paid them no heed as he rounded the diamonds up,    
For his only thought at that point in time was of the drink that filled his cup.    
""If the aliens fulfill their bargain the beer might still be saved.    
I'm not being an idjit,"" he cried, ""I'm being very brave.""

The aliens arrived tomorrow driving a beat up old car,    
Looking slightly sloshed, like they had just came from a bar.    
A pedestrian yelled ""Nice costume, dumbasses!"" And the facade began to fall,    
The mayor yelled loudly: ""Waaaait a minute! You aren't aliens at all!""

The lead alien slurred drunkenly: ""Whaa'? Naw...we definitely are!""    
""And this 'ere's our spaceship,"" he said, pointing at their car.    
""We totally come in peace, so uh... tell your guys not to shoot,    
""And uhhh... SHIT WHAT'S THAT BEHIND YOU (Quick guys, grab the loot!)""

The mayor and his men watched, their eyes bulging out of their sockets,    
As the three fake aliens stuffed the jewels into their pockets.    
They took all they could and beat a hasty retreat,    
Leaving only empty boxes lying at the mayor's feet.

"[WP] A couple of aliens crash on Earth and demand a rare mineral to repair their ship, but the aliens were actually human thieves.",FalcowUnleashed,"""Do you have any idea how much trouble we will get into with the timedirectors if they catch us?"" Crinth's voice reverberated in the metal exosuit that Fowdin had rigged up for him. The comically overlarge head bowl was meant to look alien and had fooled our ancestors, though personally he suspected the bulk of the work was done landing the ship in the middle of one of their airbases without anyone noticing till they were half way down the gang plank. 

It had seemed funny at the time descending in the cruiser strapped as it was with a hundred unnecessary lights and fins to mask it's shape an origins. Now with the leader of which ever damn country we were in staring at me bleary eyed Crinth couldn't help but feel that maybe they'd gone a bit far.

""Oh, go suck vacuum Crinth! It's easy peasy, like taking candy from a baby."" Fowdin in his own suit which he'd covered in a kind of metal of candy floss. He switched lines to blurt out some gibbersih. 

""Neenong seehelll slopos, vzindi znindi sprog! Loooooooooooo"" Then clicked a few buttons on the old air lock remote he was pretending was a translator and using his suits translator relayed to them.""We would happily trade technology with you but we will need some helium!"" Crinth glowered t was all a big joke to Fowden

It was embrassing to watch as all the heads in the room nodded and the very sleepy looking man with the odd stare in his eyes manged to grin before being prodded by his colleague, the strange looking mousey man with huge glasses who was the apparent alien expert.

""Don't smile it might be a sign of aggression."" Crinth could easily hear whispers that had been passing between them in his augmented suit. The man's thin lipped smile dropped to a frown and for that he got one last poke that made him settled on a carefully neutral expression. 

""Fowdin I haven't seen any fabled balloons of helium you speak of surely the leader would have one?"" Crinth double checked he was still on internal comms before speaking, they'd nearly cocked that up at the beginning.

""Nah, apparently children used to have them. Not sure what why, this lot are keeping a stockpile for blimps."" Fowden was laying out a load of impressive but utterly useless appliances, everything from popcorn makers to a sex toy was laid out on the desk between him and the leader. Each one was meet by neutrally schooled looks from everyone apart from the military commander who seemed impatient for something.

""The hell is a blimp? You know what I don't want to know, can we just leave I've got a bad feeling that guy with the short hair and medals is sizing us up"" Crinth watched as Fowdin continued neogtiations. He had to pause a few time to stop himself revealing the gales of laughter. Crinth regretted ever signing on with this joker.

""Fine go back to the ship start loading up the helium though. I'm nearly through here."" Fowden managed to pause in his lughter long enough to give the order and then settled into doing a ritualistic dance of his people that he insisted the others in the room mimic.

Crinth turned the sound right down on his mic and waddled his way back to the ship in the suit. As he got outside he saw a strange sight a large floating ball, well more egg shaped really was heading towards them. It was quite serene really but Crinth could hear the huge thrum of the engines that moved it.

It was bearing right down on them and as he looked around he saw the airfield that not a moment ago was covered with people now lay completely empty. Crinth muttered to himself, this was clearly going to be an ambush. Which would blow the whole plan, killing anyone would have the director breathing down thier necks. 

The weird elongated egg shape bobbed along gamely and Crinth realised they could come out on top. This had to be one of giant balloons he'd heard  Fowden mention. He raised his wrist up and took aim at the engines below the ship. If Crinth could disable it he and Fowden could suck it dry and be out of here no issue.

""Fowden, they've got fighty, one of those big sky balloons is coming in. I'm going to take it out, we can strip the helium out and bounce."" Crinth checked in with his partner who sware coloourfully into the micrphone.

""Well I just called the man with odd tache a shit head which has rather ruined negotiations. I'm coming to meet you at the ship."" Fowdin's smile didn't seem to leave him even when the plan was going south and Crinth saw him stride through a wall to emerge on the airstrip. They'd never been in any real danger in thier but it had damn well felt tense.

Crinth stood by the ship as Fowdin made ready to head off. He'd managed to take out two of the engines but now having lost some of it's stability the balloon had started to careen madly in the wind.

Fowdin nudged him by accident loading up some of the swag they'd already got hold of and the ballon was replaced with an explosion that Crinth felt armoured as he was in his suit. Eye's recovering both time travellers could see falling from the sky the a shattered eggshell that burnt with a hot fire.

""So that explains why my translator said German"" Fowden stared at the hot flaming mess as it crashed into the ground. Simultaneously both heard a clatter as bullets started to pound into their suits.

""What is German and what has it got to do with exploding helium? You complete idiot"" Crinth slammed himself out of the armour and the cruiser started to ascend out of the chaos pickign up the speed needed to jump out of this time zone.

""It's a matter of H and He, We got the side with the H and we should have gone for the He"" Fowdin grinned as if it was all some big joke.

""You're telling me they flew around strapped to giant bags of hydrogen? I knew this was too good to be true! Last time we follow you're stupid plans"" Crinth gunned it and the ship strapped with fins and lights popped into a different less terrifying time.

[WP] What he loved about gravity... It always WORKED.,FloatingTheVoid,"The screams coming from over the edge of the building grew fainter and fainter. Soon, they were completely drowned out by the sounds of the city at midnight.

Rufus stepped away from the side of the building. That bastard would think twice before crossing him again. That was what he loved about gravity: it always worked. He'd learned his lesson about that when his gun had jammed at a key moment in a ""negotiation."" He had just been fortunate then, but from then on he had resolved to only use gravity to do his dirty work.

People called Rufus crazy. They said: Guns are way more effective than pushing people off buildings or dropping weights on them. And maybe Rufus was crazy. But it was a genius kind of crazy. No matter how careful people were to stand away from the sides of buildings when they were dealing with Rufus, gravity always got them.

Rufus examined the device that he had obtained from the physicist. It looked simple enough. But it had been bloody expensive. Literally. The physicist in question had been killed by a falling piano just a few days earlier. Freak accident, they said. Now it belonged to Rufus. A technology entirely unique in the world.

Rufus flipped the on switch. And the device began to hover. Rufus smiled to himself. Now gravity worked for *him*. Rufus had had a backup plan for getting off the rooftop before the police arrived in case the device didn't work, but now it seemed he wouldn't be needing it. Rufus drifted up into the night on top of the device.

His next step was to obtain an airtight living space. That was all that was needed now for a fully functioning spacecraft, once you had gravity working for you.

And then it was off to explore the galaxy for Rufus. And none of that wimpy ""we come in peace"" stuff either. He would explore to conquer.

By the time that all the bozos on Earth finally got off their sorry little planet, Rufus would rule everything.

"[WP] ""Time to bring this baby down boys!""",FloatingTheVoid,"""Turn around!"" He shouted at nash.

""What?!"" Nash slowed down and turned to look at Malgreious. ""Are you insane!? we'll get gunned down in seconds!""

""Just do it god damnit do what I tell you without questioning me for once!"" The peacekeepers were closing in now, making sure to avoid his tail. Malgreious took out his photon grenade and armed it, it started beeping.

""What... are you doing!?"" Konil asked in between gunshots. The beeping intensified. ""Throw the god damn thing already!"" 

""5...4...3..."" Nash turned the hovercraft around in one swift movement, Malgreious grabbed onto a headrest to keep himself steady.

""If you don't throw that bloody thing then I will shove it your bloody arse and throw you at them myself!"" Malgreious shot a look to Konil adding an extra second on to his countdown, he may very well have just ruined his plan. He threw the grenade between him and one of the peacekeeper vessels, the grenade exploded mid-air. Damn, that might have actually hit them.

""NOW!"" Malgreious hoped to god that Nash understood what he had to do, there was no time to explain his plan. Nash pushed the accellerator forward to full throttle, the hovercraft flew through the smoke of the grenade taking the peacekeepers by surprise as nash pushed down on the yaw. The hovercraft flew up the peacekeepers craft and slammed into two of them decapitating them. 

The crew quickly took down the rest of the peacekeepers with minimal effort, nash drove off the peacekeeper craft and turned back to the ocean. The other peacekeeper craft followed but they were more concerned with trying to save their fallen comrades. That was the problem with peacekeepers, they were too nice. The crew began cheering as the craft left the jungle. They were met with a blinding sunlight and hot rays of heat as the ocean greeted them too. ""Drinks are on-"" Hagar began shouting, he was cut off by the loud hum of multiple engines from above. 

""Firebird!"" Malgreious shouted, they had no chance against a firebird, it was a 4 engine propellor scouting machine for planet exploration. Only that the peacekeepers were known for outfitting their civilian craft for better defense against their enemies. This one had a high velocity minigun and a man operating a laser cannon on top, there was no way they could outrun or outrun it but nash pushed on the accelleration anyway.

""So much for this bloody base being abandoned! they have a god damnit firebird!"" Konil expressed himself.

""Survive now, hate me later!"" Malgreious grabbed his holoradio ""Where are you damnit!?"" 

""Right here, boss"" Fray's voice came through on the comms. The water in front of them began to give way as a large vessel slowly ascended out of the water, the sunlight filtering through temporary holes as the water cascaded down off the cockpit and wings of the ship.

""My baby"" Malgreious said to himself while eyeing his ship with love in his eyes.

""Excuse me?"" Frays voice came through the radio once more, Malgreious could see her now through the cockpit window.

""Not you, my ship""

""Heh, yeah right, let me know when you want that coffee huh"" Fray mocked.

""Take out that firebird, we dont have the arms""

""No can do captain, forward guns knocked out by incoming peacekeepers upon atmospheric entry"" Malgreious pressed his thumb and forefinger to his temples again, this time he just had a migraine.

""Transfer energy from aft guns to forward, just enough juice for a few seconds of fire-"" 

""No can do either captain! Took a hit to 'er side, energy transference system damaged until repaired""

""What?! god damnit... did you say incoming?!"" Malgreious looked to the skies, there appeared to be no incoming peacekeepers. Just the gust of wind from the firebird, they were concentrating fire on the ship but its shields were too powerful for them to be of any threat. The firebird turned its attention to the captain and his crew on the hovercraft.
""Get us on the ship Nate!""

""Aye aye, cap'n!"" High velocity bullets zipped past hitting the water hard creating 5 foot tall towers of water which quickly dropped back down, but not fast enough for the captain to notice. 

""Shit! Faster Nate!"" There was a good chance they were going to die, Fray had began closing the distance too, hopefully their shields would catch them before any rounds could-

""Aaaaaaaargh!"" Hagar screamed out, a bullet had pierced his shoulder and exited through his opposite hip. The firebird gave chase for a few extra seconds before the ship caught the hovercraft with its shield, the hovercraft had enough holes to sink an actual ship within minutes. The firebird turned around and attempted to make its way back to shore, it was no match for the ship.

The ship opened its hangbar bay doors, they lead into a fairly decent sized hangar bay with enough space to store 3 hover vessels, they could only afford the one. Malgreious jumped up impatiently and climbed up into the hangar before it had even began its descent to collect the hovercraft in a daring docking move. He rushed through the hangar bay and made his way through the myriad of hallways while speaking through his holoradio.

""Get Hagar to the medical Bay ASAP! Fray, swing the ship around, I've got an old friend I need to see"" Confirmation came through the radio and Malgreious put it back in his pocket, he had reached one of the two aft miniguns, the firebird was not the only vehicle on this planet sporting the same firepower. He sat down behind the gun and got his sights lined up, the ship swung around just as he had ordered.

""Time to bring this baby down boys"" Malgreious pumped on the guns triggers while aiming his sights down at the firebird, it had just reached the coast when a barrage of high velocity bullets ripped through its shields and hull in a matter of mere seconds, one of the bullets found the gunners head promptly exploding it. The firebird craned and plummeted into the shoreline in dramatic fashion, exploding and sending debris flying into the jungle and ocean. ""Fly us outta here Fray""

""Aye aye cap'n"" The ship pointed its nose to the sky and Fray put it in full throttle, other peacekeepers had arrived and began to take chase but they were no match for the Jasper. It flew out of the atmosphere and into the cold dark of space, leaving the peacekeepers swallowing their dust.",Inoox
"[WP] ""Time to bring this baby down boys!""",FloatingTheVoid,"Photon bullets whipped through the air striking trees at tremendous impact with thoughtful thuds losing their bluish glow, splintering sharp wood off in all directions. 

Captain Malgreious winced and turned his head away as one of the photon bullets hit a tree next to him.

""Gah! Humans!"" he screamed out to his crew, most of them had joined him on this expedition. 

He had been hunting for a cache for the past few months and it had finally paid off, just in time too. The ship was desperately low on resources and they themselves were close to looking like Grubbers, their hair slick with grease and their teeth entering deep phases of grimy yellow. Humans were one of the worst threats to them and their sudden appearence certainly complicated things, although it was a given they would show up at any moment given that they were stealing from them. This cache had fallen into his radar as if a little fat boy had waddled up to him and plopped it on his lap.

Malgreious had hit a bar with the last of his credits hoping to strike a deal with a small time smuggler, start from the bottom and work your way to the top. He had been telling himself this for the past 25 years. He had the ship for the business and the willingness to kill his own grandma should it get him anywhere but the dredges of the dredges. The smuggler had laughed the bar down once he had looked up his potential client to be on his hologram and promptly walked out, that had been a massive downer.

The only thing left to do was drink his sorrows away, he would sell the ship tomorrow at a most likely much lower than he would want price and use that money to live on until he got himself a job working the mines on Jakal. Not exactly a glamorous job but its better than paying an assassin to kill him, suicide was a level Malgreious would never stoop to.

As the night went on so did Malgreious' vision clarity, the fat bartender with thinning hair and an ever decreasing hairline turning into the picture of Madonna that he had residing on the wall at the end of his bed back on the ship. He shook his head, he had to get out of here and think about his options. Jakal seemed worse than paid assassination after much drinking. Shoving his barstool back he stood up, necked the rest of his pint and moped out into the downpour that greeted him outside. Trust him to bet his last hopes on the tropical planet of Nahmes.

Tsking to himself he put his hood up, lit a cigarette and began his walk of shame back to his ship. It would kill him to sell her, she had been there since birth, a gift from his father. Well, not exactly a gift, he had died and with no other close relatives or spouse so the ship automatically transferred to his hands.

EDIT: Bare with me, ill get to how the prompt inspired this in the first place :P",Inoox
"[WP] ""Time to bring this baby down boys!""",FloatingTheVoid,"haha, slow claps are generally regarded as sarcasm though :P dont worry about it lol",Inoox
"[WP] ""Time to bring this baby down boys!""",FloatingTheVoid,"He stopped and thought about his options, he could hitch a ride to a distant planet, pay someone to destroy his ship and hope the insurance company paid out. Doubtful, plus the thought of losing his ship once again haunted his mind.

Perhaps his brother could find it in his heart and lend him some credit, that was doubtful too. Ever since he got the ship the tension between those two had been unbearable, his brother had been just 1 year too young to be the rightful owner of the ship although he was clearly the better choice. So ofcourse once Malgreious got the ship there was no way he was going to give it up, he had nothing else and this ship would one day be his salvation. Although his brother would make much better use of it, legal use that is. If he rang his brother now he would put on that damned smirk of his and demand the ship, he would even twist it to sound like as if he was buying the ship off him. That wasnt an option either.

Malgreious groaned, a migraine was on its way and he had run out of painkillers. Thinking of his doomed future too much always hurt. He pressed his thumb and forefinger to his temples and massaged it, not that it did much use. A deafening scream pierced the air from the alley next to him. What the hell was that? He pressed his body up to the alley wall and peered his head around the corner, there were 3 distant shadows in the alley. Being the chivalrious man that he is and definately not an opportunist for more credits Malgreious made his way down the alley in a brave like manner.
'Its not, its not what you think! you can't just go there and-"" Crack. A gunshot, one of the shadows had pulled a gun and shot her square in the head execution style, she was already on her knees before Malgreious had found a box to hide behind. 

""What the hell you do that for!?"" One of them shouted, damn humans, should have known it was them.

""She said she's the only one that knows where it is, and she told us! do you know what this means? we're gonna be rich!"" 

""You didn't have to kill her! we could have... I dunno..."" The second was much more hesitant about the situation, he didnt seem as brave as his compadre (?)

""Oh? have the hots for her did you? she was the only one that knew and so she had to go! we couldn't have her escaping us offguard and telling her friends now could we? who knows who she was connected to...""

""She was a god damn peacekeeper! we're dead for sure now!"" 

""Whatever, it doesn't matter what she was... the galaxy is big enough for us to settle on some ocean planet somewhere and live the rest of our years in luxury""

""Mark, you don't even know this girl. She could have been lying for all we know, what if she has a guard waiting for her? what if-""

""Shut up! look, lets just get to Kalapo, get the cache and use the winnings to pay for new identities. We'll have enough to buy a new ship and we can afford to be reckless so it doesn't matter if we get ripped off on the ship or the identity change, we can afford it!""

""We don't even know if the base on Kalapo is safe, it could be guarded by more peacekeepers for all we know!""

""She said Base Epsilon was abandoned, we just have to fly in, grab the cache, fly out. Easy! now lets go!"" ",Inoox

"[WP] ""Time to bring this baby down boys!""",FloatingTheVoid,"This was perfect, this was exactly what he needed. Malgreious couldn't believe his luck. To top it off they were walking in his direction now, they didn't seem very well built. Mark was slightly bigger than the other but neither of them looked smart enough to have been in any sort of honourable battles. Let alone bar fights. This was too easy, although the gunshot was drawing unwanted attention and he had to act fast. Assuming an attack pose from behind the box he waited for the right moment to attack, a snap to the neck could take out the bigger one easy enough before the other could even notice what was going on.

They walked past, their backs to him now. Now! Malgreious lurched out kicking a bottle on his way up, Mark turned around and noticed his attacking assailant. ""Damnit!"" Malgreious shouted.

""Hey! what are you-?"" Mark began to ask, he realised that this attacker must have seen and heard everything. He went to tackle him but Malgreious dodged it causing Mark to go headfirst into the box, knocking him out instantly. Malgreious looked at the smaller one.

""I... I... I don't want any trouble! please! I... I just do what he tells me! you can take the cache! I don't even need it! please just... let me go!"" Well that was easy, he didn't even need to fight him. This guy had certainly backed out of every fight. Malgreious nodded past him, to signify he was letting him go. ""What... I... Ok, ok, thank you!"" He ran away in the direction of the street near the bar. Malgreious reached down to the Modified 9mm Mark had dropped and picked it up, he aimed for a half second down the sights and shot the runner in the back of the head. Several onlookers shocked in horror and began to scatter away from the alley, time to move on. Shooting Mark in the back of the head for his eternal slumber Malgreious ran for the other end of the alley. He had laid low for a few hours before returning to his ship and flying away at a suspicious pace, the peacekeepers would most likely clock on to his motives and would be on his tail soon. He had a couple of days at most.

""Faster god damnit!"" Captain Malgreious' second in command demanded. The pilot of the openbay shuttle skimmed over the ocean planets jungle island with ease, it was the trees that were the main obstacle, that and the bullets wizzing past Malgreious' ears. Hagar and Konil were shooting back now but their photon pistols wouldn't be much good against peacekeeper vehicles, they all came with their own defensive shields and photon pistols did not deliver enough of a whack to penetrate them.

""Shoot the transmitters!"" Malgreious ordered, each of their crafts did however have a small transmitter poking out the backside, just enough to source a shield around the entirety of the craft. Although to hit it was next to impossible, nevermind hitting it when swaying around in a turbo propelled hovercraft.

""Thats impossible!"" Hagar proclaimed. Malgreious slammed his foot on the brakes much to the dismay of a heckling Pilot Nash who quickly took back control of the hovercraft. The craft that was chasing behind them quickly drifted to its side in an attempt to avoid collision with their enemies. Malgreious grabbed Hagars gun, aimed for a second down the sights and shot the tip of the transmitter. The peacekeeper craft's shields visibly showing the shield detiriorating, followed by another quick crack of Hagar's gun piercing the skull of the Peacekeeper pilot. Hagar looked in disbelief as he took his gun back, Konil looked back at the peacekeepers who were abruptly slowing down. One of them was attempting to shift the dead pilot out of the way to take back control of the craft, it would be a futile effort to catch up to them now. Just as malgreious thought that he bit his tongue, two more crafts emerged from the dense foliage of the jungle floor this time keeping their distance should they try any more tricks with the brakes.

""shit!"" Malgreious shouted, there would be chance of outwitting two more of them, they would need backup and they would need space. ""Get us out to the ocean! pronto!"" 

""But sir, there's nowhere to board the-"" Nash glanced a worried look back.

""Do it now!"" 

""Yes captain!"" There was a hint of sarcasm in there, him and Nash never really saw eye to eye. Nash was actually the ships doctor but there had been no free hands to pilot the hovercraft, he was the weakest of them and they needed a pilot on standby as they loaded the craft with the cache. Nash punched in some numbers to the crafts computer and it showed him the closest coastline, he made a sharp left turn sending the rest of the crew flying into the right side of the ship.

""Damnit Nash cool it!"" Konil shouted after banging his head on a seats headrest. Konil couldn't see it but Nash had a sly smirk on his face. Malgreious grabbed his holoradio.

""This is captain Malgreious you are ordered to meet us at coordinates 3-7W 4-5N (no idea how coordinates work) ASAP!""

""Order received"" Pilot Fray spoke through the radio, she wasn't a great pilot, far from it. but she was his best option at the time.

""they're right on us!"" Hagar shouted. ""We won't make it!"" Malgreious looked to the ocean, it wasn't far now but Hagar was right. He pressed his thumb and forefinger to his temples and weighed his options. He could risk it and go for the ocean but there was a high chance they would catch up and they would be gunned down from both sides in a matter of seconds, it wasn't worth the risk not when they had come this far.

He could stop the hovercraft and hope his one photon grenade landed in their craft, then they might actually have a chance of killing everyone in the other craft in a good old bullet exchange fight. No, there were too many if's in that plan, but what plan didnt? ",Inoox

""The lock is busted just open the door."" The door sings open as a tall man witb sharp angular features steps into my apartment, his shadow barks at the various pizza boxes that arrived only moments before he did.


""Lord Woofles. You know who I am, Correct?"" The figure sniff disappointingly in my direction.

""I didn't spend five years writing on you not to recognize you and the only person weird enough to refer to me Lord would be something I made."" I retort, I'm quiet comfortable with the idea I'm losing my mind. I am just curious on where this delusional moment is taking me. ""Hello Saint Holt""

""No. He is completely ineffectual I made him to show why necromancy is useless in a desert."" I respond a little amused that I'm still talking to this delusion.

""What about the succubus from act 4?"" Holt sighed.

""Can't she is going to bear your child and the hero's child in book two."" I correct him.

""Wait. I'm going to be a father? I want to live to see my son. I haven't been evil enough to justify being the main villain! Are you going to just make me suddenly a front line bad guy? I heal the sick in Act one and you forgot to do anything more about it."" I hold up my hand to cut off his statement.

""You are not going to die, This story isn't about the hero. It's about you, You heal the sick, You are a hero among demons and even in your most vile act you will bear the greatest of Hero's. One who will assume the mantle of the devil and change hell into a paradise that demons flock to and not from."" I sigh having thought about my plot and how cliche it felt. ""On second thought. I'm starting over, I want people to not see this coming. Congrats you are now going to be a nature spirit.""

Even after I graduated, I couldn't get college out of my head, especially that one day. Sure it was one thing to live on a campus designed by an occultist but everything that happened, from the Lake Foundation forums to the portal to *her*, that pretty redheaded librarian whose mind worked as fast as my own and whose skill in both magic and physics were things I wished for myself. It was all so tantalizing, especially her, that I just wanted to know more about them and about this crazy world of magic. That's why I stayed the extra year to complete that Art History minor I decided to take but even poring over my college library's amazing collection of books and taking all these courses dealing with ancient artifacts and stuff still left me with more questions. My attempt at looking up the Metropolitan Public Library led me to a building in New York even though she said they worked out of Portland. That's why I took a job at a library and museum near me because A. I needed to look for grad schools with good physics programs, B. they might know something and C. if I could be around ancient artifacts all the time, I might see them, and her, again. One day I was looking through some old medieval texts and I came across a description of a sword, a sword once worn by one of the greatest knights in the world and believed to have been the source of his incredible power, a sword that had not been seen for centuries. If that didn't sound like the perfect thing to lure in the sort of librarians who battled interdimensional monsters, I don't know what did. And so I set to work finding as many clues and texts as I could for information about the sword so I could get a bead on its location. The world was full of magic and I wanted to truly be a part of it all, and that started with getting a bigger taste of it. Soon the world will know the name Lucy Lyons, and maybe then, once she sees what I've done for her, she might finally accept that fate brought us together that day on campus and it never meant for us to be apart.",StarChild413

Hyperspace now, but I can attest that they were there, once. A thousand ships under my command against an innumerable army. The army of Zhymm the Conqueror.

Over sixty years ago, humanity made first contact with the Astari by pure chance. We sent a probe to Proxima Centauri to check out whether or not the orbiting planets were habitable. We were in no real danger of overpollution or overpopulation. It was merely a scientific vessel.

The Astari were flying a war drone through the system in what we assume to be an intimidation tactic. Their empire was vast, spanning several galaxies, and though they had no control over Proxima, they were attempting to give the impression that they did.

They boarded our craft, searched the computer, and tracked the signal to our research vessel just outside of our Solar System. Less than a week later, they were invading the research ship. They tortured and slaughtered the scientists and engineers aboard, but couldn't find what they were looking for. They made one fatal assumption: that is, that our craft was foreign, not from the system. They left in search of the vessel's origin. Their mistake bought us time to evaluate the situation.

The final transmissions of the vessel scattered in all directions, and gave us an indication of the Astari's capabilities. Their craft was nearly invulnerable to our fire. Bullets deflected or fused to the hull. Despite the fragile forms of the Astari, their science was far beyond our own.

We sent a single diplomat, unarmed, with only a peace offering. They captured him and took him to their homeworld, and vaporized him, but not before he managed to disclose the location. As it so happens, it orbited a Wolf-Rayett star on one of the spiral arms of Andromeda. A very unstable Wolf-Rayett star.

We outfitted a missile with a warp engine. The warhead was nothing special, merely a gamma bomb. However, the fabric of hyperspace is very fragile. When we detonated it in hyperspace where the star would have been, it reacted with the gravitational sheet and caused the star to collapse, along with the seven closest planets. Although they weren't sucked in, they no longer had the light and warmth of their sun. Their solar cells ceased to work, and the planet died in less than a week.

Zhymm was off in the far reaches of the cosmos when he heard. He rallied all of his drones, from across the farthest reaches of the universe, and came for us. When he reached Proxima, our new outposts informed us, shortly before being obliterated. Not entirely unexpected; we spent the prior twenty years putting everything into our military. I gathered what forces we had and went to the rim of our Solar System to confront him.

When he warped in, there was a brief moment of silence, as our armies stared each other down. As was customary, I attempted to hail him. He threatened our lives, and promised to raze our world, before shooting a single missile from his capital ship.

The space erupted in chaos. I sent forces to cripple the life support systems. He fired at our engines. His millions of drones overwhelmed our targeting systems. I ordered a change of tactics. Load flak ammunition, set proton bombs to proximity instead of contact, and scramble our own fighters.

It worked, until billions more of Zhymm's drones warped in. I diverted all power from systems to the Glaive Beam, the most powerful weapon of war ever devised. We cut swaths through his troops, and destroyed Saturn's asteroid belt. For four days, we kept them at bay, until he used our clever tactic. He sent one of his flagships through hyperspace, and self-destructed it through the majority of our fleet. After his act, only my capital ship and fifteen battlecruisers survived. Our fighter population was scattered. We managed to cleave his ship in twain with the war laser, before he destroyed the weapon.

Crippled, we continued fighting tooth and nail. Our nuclear weapons kept his fleet unpowered through electro-magnetic pulses, before we ran out of missiles to launch. He boarded our ship, and began killing our crew. I sealed off the bridge bulkhead, and made a final stand. When I saw the bulkhead door slowly melting, I knew no defense system on Earth could stop their horde. I ordered my chief engineer to overload the warp core.

In retrospect, it was foolish. He warned me of the consequences. Detonating a bomb in hyperspace would bend a hole through the fabric of space. Overloading a warp core in real space could have dire consequences. It could destroy the whole Milky Way. However, the Astari empire spanned hundreds of galaxies. Trillions of star systems. This act would ensure the death of Humanity, but could spare the other civilizations under their rule. I ignored his warning.

In the brief milliseconds before everything felt dark, I felt an immense, crushing gravity from the center of our ship. In an instant, Saturn, Earth, the Sun, and the entire galaxy was crushed into an infinitesimal point in hyperspace. There was no more real space there.

As I narrate to... no one in particular, I feel only cold. Only the dark. Time has no meaning here. I could have been here ten seconds, or I could have been here ten millenia. Perhaps longer. But it doesn't matter. In the end, I annihilated the entire Astari fleet. I killed all fourteen billion humans. I'm a hero, but I feel guilt.

Dead bodies of our friends and allies are strewn across the battlefield.Now it is only me and him. Only one of us will walk away from this godforsaken place today. As we draw our swords preparing for our final fight my hands are trembling, I've waited for this day for many years. Slowly we start to circle each other waiting for an attack at any moment, while a bitter cold rain drenches us from head to toe.  We charge at each other fueled by the friends and family we've both lost. Each attack is swift and relentless not trying to maim or injure, but to kill. After years of fighting we know how our enemy attack and they defend, but they also know my strengths and weaknesses too. It will not be an easy fight. 

The fight has now been raging for hours locked in an intense stalemate. Sparks fly after every attack we both fight with a ferocity neither has seen before. Not long after our swords get dull and best so we throw them aside to use fist like man did more than a millennia ago. Neither of us have much skill in hand-to-hand combat, so the attacks are slower and more sporadic. The fight is still raging on from using our fists to rocks and sticks around us. We’ve accidently created a ring of bodies  around us as if the ghost of our fallen brethren are watching; waiting for a victor in this fight.

It’s now becoming evening and we are both still alive. Blood and dirt now cake our skin, our attacks are becoming more desperate as if we are becoming more like animals than men. I’m beginning to wonder if this fight will ever have a victor. I see him pick up a dagger of a fallen soldier and I know that i’m outgunned. Slowly I get backed up into a tree trying to dodge and evade the attacks from the dagger. To slow from a whole day of fighting I got stabbed right in the stomach, like any good would do fighter he twisted the blade in the wound so I would have a hard time living afterwards. Knowing this is the end I lean against the tree.

As I bleed out my enemy walks away victorious counting and grieving his dead. I stare out over my last sunset finding peace knowing that everything is over; no more fighting, no more grief and no more dead. I may not have been the victor of the battle, but I will soon be with all my friends that have died this fateful day.",MatticalPancakes

"[WP] The year is 2016, you are researching for a report on the renowned artist of the Cold War era; Adolf Hitler.",Spartancoolcody,"Mr. Hitler was born in 1889 in Austria. His father was an abusive drunk;who harmed his children and wife. He went into the Vienna Academy of Art in 1905. He was described as ""a confident and eccentric young man"". He however had conflict with his father. Mostly due to his alcoholism. 

When the first great war started. Hitler volunteered wanting to fight for his country. But when he came back. A mood of melancholy would influence his early work. He moved to a local bar and started to paint, creating the Minimalist-Realist movement. Using simple shapes to depict people and environments. 

His first drawing was ""The Lost Boys"" it depicted a child with a sorrowful look in his eyes, wearing army clothes. This was symbolic for many men of the war. It forced them to see things they were not ready for. His first painting only made about 500$. But he continued. Making painting after painting. But then he created a master piece. The Drunk, was created in 1929, the same year Germany fell to Thalman's Communists. The Drunk depicted an Angry man, holding a beer in one hand and a belt in the other. It is likely based on Hitler's father. 

Hitler was brought into the GPR to create entertainment. He and Thalman meet in 1917 during the war and began a long friendship between the two. Hitler also adopted communistic views, even though he was a former German Nationalist.
During the 30's and 40's, Hitler created cartoons to promote Socialism and the State. This included, ""Unseren Kampf""(1931), Minerva Mink's Legend (1932-1936(Animated)), Is Hans okay? (1933-1935), and others. His films and personality of eccentricism is a staple of his movies and art. Clutter is used in much of his art, a symbol of his state of mind. 

Hitler is best remember for his influence, not his actual work. His style and life, influenced the men returning from the 2nd Great War, to live the bohemian lifestyle. Men like Stan Lee took Hitler's style and applied them to comics, reviving the dying noir genre. 

Hitler watched in pride as the Comintern defeated the allies in the Second Great War. He would continue to work in the Media branch of the GPD till his death. 

He died in 1958.He is survived by his two sons. James P. Hitler and Romil J. Hitler. James continued his father's work until his own death in 2016.

[WP] A man is murdered and becomes reincarnated in his murderer's body,TheBlueDinosaur,"I had to shuffle around the paper on my desk, to create some sort of order for Bruce, my dim-witted PA, to arrange in time for me to present in court that afternoon, if I could get back in time anyway. God only knows why that had to be that day, but that day it was.

My wife of 2 years was stricken with a look of panic, which didn't subside when I arrived at the hospital. 

""Where have you been!"" she half screamed the moment I appeared through the door to her room. Her legs were spread eagle and the perspiration was glistening on her face.

""Sorry sweetheart."" I replied, with a forced smile that did nothing to appease her anger. ""You know Bruce couldn't pour a glass of milk for himself without supervision.""

""You'd better be fucking joking."" She spat back, knowing full well I wasn't.

There were doctors and nurses hurrying around the room, preparing for the delivery, I assumed. I felt a dull buzz in my pocket, and thanked myself for setting my phone to silent.

""I'll get you some ice water. Be right back."" I said as I gingerly made for the door.

""Stephen Baxter!"" She screamed a full blooded scream this time, but I had already eased the door behind me and pulled my phone out. Bruce's name was written across the screen and I swiped to answer, pulling a cigarette out of my jacket pocket as I did. The exit was only a short walk from the ward, and I explained to Bruce that all the documents corresponded by the number at the bottom of the page. He really was an imbecile. 

The fast click-clacking of feet around the hospital was a normal sound, as people rushed around to check the state of their wives, daughters sons and the like, but the feet coming from behind me had a different cadence to them. They sounded angry, as though they were desperate to lash out.

""You are going to see what it's like now."" The gruff voice was one I'd heard before, but I couldn't quite place it.
 
...

...

It was such an intense blackness, as though I was buried a mile underground in a concrete box. No sound, nothing to feel, no air to breath. Deep dark blackness.


An amount of time had passed, but I couldn't really tell how long it had been when the veil slowly began to lift. Whiteness began to ease back into my mind, slowly, until i could decipher colours and sounds. Almost like a crash, I was driven forward, everything blurred past me and I could barely make out scenes to my left and right until I came to a clattering halt.

I could feel my eyes beginning to open, but it didn't feel the same. Similar, but not the same. I was still in the hospital, by the exit, but the way it all looked was different. A platform, it seemed, was lifting me up from the floor.

The screams made me snap back to some sort of consciousness. I looked around for the source of the screams, but there was still a ringing in my ears. I looked down at my tatty boots and jeans, covered with dirt, and plaid shirt with the top 2 buttons undone. In my right had was a pistol, black and shiny. On the ground in front of me was a smartly dressed lawyer type, face down. His phone had slid across the floor, but remained mostly undamaged. 

The man didn't interest me too much, but the phone was lit up, half leaned against the skirting that travelled along the hallways of the hotel. I moved closer and leaned down. The name Bruce was written across the screen, and it showed that he had been connected for a little over a minute. I hung up the call, which revealed the home screen. A picture of me.

I had looked at the screen for about 30 seconds, until the screen went to black. In the reflection I saw a gruff man staring back at me. Unshaven and about 30 years older than me. I knew who I was looking at, but it was all beginning to confuse me. 

Why could I see the father of Sharon Booth in my phone? I hadn't seen her, or her father, in over a week since my client was acquitted of her rape due to insufficient evidence. Her father was a vengeful 6 and a half foot construction worker, so I was glad to see the back of him.

I was quite proud of that particular verdict, as it seemed like a stone wall guilty verdict. DNA and eye witness testimony put him in a bit of a hole, but I'm a creative young defence lawyer, married to the CEO's daughter. If i have to fabricate a few things to get my outcome, so be it. My bonuses don't earn themselves.

[WP] You have to kill your very best friend. Write a story about why and how you do it.,sirquacksalotus,"I always knew he was a monster. He was so much smarter, so much more able to think about things everyone else glossed over. He wrestled with the definition of reality and everyone else just showed up to work. He was a sleeping God and we were the shadows that danced at the edges of his world.

Of course he went to Harvard, Yale, Colombia, everywhere where he could find 'kind of like minds"". He was the ghost you didn't know who made your music, your cell phone, the digital dragon you ride was first born in the long twisting corridors of his thoughts. He wasn't like you, he tolerated me, and he was a something the sliding in the unknown who might, if he had cared to, break down this brittle world in the time you would use to have delivery pizza.

I remember it like it was yesterday. We stood on that cliff looking over Yale where he had returned to work with his old collaborator. I happened to have a few days so I flew out to see him. He was in an apartment for the time he was there but we both knew how to walk to the cliffs we had been to so many times when we were young. Yale Gothic, the usual jokes, New Haven misery, the familiar streets and then we were there overlooking it all.

""I've found the key to write reality"". He said like he said everything else. No excitement, no emotion, it was just something he understood. His pale blue Russian eyes looking at me with recognition but also weighing me. Did I deserve a place in his world? Was I a thing worth thinking about?

""We found a type of math which is like prayer. It appears prayer is a degraded way to direct address reality. It's a very specific way to shape what you want. Really, you can make and shape worlds this way. It's very exciting. Nothing will ever be the same.""

I remembered him when we were in high school. He was the ""the math nerd"". He did homework the day it was assigned. He hung about the teacher's offices. He was the kid who always knew before anyone else what the solution, answer, context, anything you can insert into what you didn't know he knew.

I also knew people really didn't like him. I remember one day this big kid picked him up and threw him up against a locker. I can see him hanging there to this day. Eyes wide. Not knowing what to do. I launched myself into that kid. The admin staff pulled us apart. I can't tell you what I was going to do. I can tell you it involved teeth and blood. He was just so smart, just so,well, I can't really tell you. It was something else. He was a smart guy and you just wanted to go along for the ride.

I pushed him over the edge. It was fast. I outweigh him by fifty, more like seventy pounds, and when I hit him he wasn't coming back. He fell. It's just so fucking slow when I look back. He fell, fell, fell, and then there was a soft ""poof"" and I knew he was broken and gone. Just gone. I'd tell the police he slipped. Just the lost of everything in the world to a gray blurr and then he was falling and then there was that sound.

Why did I do it? It was that look in his eyes. His eyes were brown but when we stood on that cliff it was a kind of brown fire. He had a found a way to get back at everyone who had ever hurt him. He had found a way to make himself a God. To unleash every dark thing, every pain, every desire, everything that would make him a monster who imagines himself to be a savior. He was falling into being insane in a way that would rend, tear, and break the world in a way it might never be able to survive.

I pushed him off that fucking cliff and I'd do it again.

Sometimes the people we love become monsters. They don't mean to and they know what's happened to them but they are monsters nonetheless. Even if it rips our souls out we have to stop them. We have to prevent them from being a thing that even Time itself can't stop hurting from. We have to say ""No"" sometimes. It hurts, it really, really does, but sometimes you just have to act in the hope that the kids who come after us can make a better world.

She wanted to go. 32 and damn tired. I was so far away. You had to know I wanted to be there. She wasted away before I even knew. 

How could I have known? Her voice was so vivid. But like a lucid dream I thought life could be controlled. 

I tried to make her promise she'd survive. What if I married? I need you to be there. You have to come to my graduation. I want to take us to Japan again. 

Then one day she asked to speak to me. She wanted me to get on a plane. She needed me there. And I went. I went the moment I could get that ticket. I had my friend watch my cats and I went. 

But by the time I landed I felt like she'd been dead for years. I knew that tone. I knew it. She wasn't gonna come back from this. 

So when I got to her house she asked me to listen. She just wanted to be normal for a moment. Could i take her to get some coffee. Then we could go to the store and get some popcorn. We'd watch a movie. 

Tired I agreed. I ended up driving us through the drive thru and buying large amounts of cake pops. Then we went to the store. 

You could tell she walked with that... pirate limp. I guess is the right term. She walked like she was throwing a weight in front of her. I tried to ignore it but it stood out. She'd been trying but we used to dance all the time. Back in hs. We used to go out and forget. 

Now she was captain of a different ship. I wanted to laugh but it was so fucking sad. I saw her as my sister. She'd saved me. She'd been everything. 

When she asked me to pick up some cookies across the store I thought nothing of it. She was tired. She had too much pain. She looked so tired.  And I wanted her to smile. 

Okay. Sure. 


She was checked out when I got back. Some cute bandaids. A little plant. Some fruit. She was happy. I bought the damn cookies and home we went. She munched on the oreos. She thanks me for taking her. 

Then she went into the bathroom and I heard her crying. She didn't answer when I knocked on the door. I tried to open it but she slapped the wood. I let her be. I let her cry. 

I love you. I said it so much maybe it lost meaning. I love you. I want you happy. 

She came out paler but certain. Certain I was the sister she needed. Certain I wanted to watch her nap on and off through that movie she demanded I rent. She wanted to finish Conan. 

I should have known something was off. 

I love you. 

She went down my list. Every movie she promised to watch with me. We went to places I loved. Places that always held nostalgia in the pancake batter. 

She talked about memories I'd almost forgotten.  We went back to the store three more times. Then two different ones. I went. I went because I knew it was important. 

One night she asked if I missed home. Yes. But I needed a place to live. I needed a life. She said she was happy. That she would come with me one day. Then she laughed. In spirit she said. Always in spirit. 

That night I stayed in a hotel and planned to have lunch with another friend. I'd been so sick with worry and love that I spent all my time with her. I had two days left. Two days for all the other people I loved. 

I texted her about meeting up for dinner. She told me she was tired. She wanted to sleep. 

I don't know what made me go to see her. She was always tired. But this time seemed heavier. So I drove down her street with Anna in the passenger seat. Just to be sure. Just to make certain she wasn't vomiting up blood again. 

I found her on the couch covered in blankets. She was blinking against the heaviness. I could see the bottles around her. She'd bought them during our week together. 

I should have known. She'd tried before. She knew. But how could I have been so stupid? 

Ashley. I tried to wake her up. Ashley. I love you. Sister. 

But the words stayed in my throat. I knew then that she wanted this. Held off for me. So I let her go. I let her. 

When she was so still I could have carved a smile into her stone cheeks, I called the police. 

I let her die. I let her die. In some ways it was the kindest thing to do. 

I love you. ",WhateverSlayer
"[WP] You are immortal. After graduating College for the thirtieth time, you meet a friend's Grandmother/Grandfather at the ceremony, and recognize them as a significant love from long ago. They recognize you as well.",All_Under_Heaven,"Do you ever have those moments where you wish you could just go back and fix something you did when you were younger? Or when you think, if you had just done one thing differently, your life would be better? I get that all the time. Over the millennia I must've had that happen thousands of times. But this, this was beyond the others. It felt like I was being burned, slowly at first, then more quickly, from the inside out. At first it was minor, a little sort of notion that I had messed up. Now it's become overwhelming, and I just can't bear it.

It had been nearly fifty years since I saw her last. I know I wasn't really ""younger"" then, but I feel like I was. I think each heartbreak hardens you, forces you to change. It feels like I had aged more in the six years I knew her than in the six thousand before that. And it's really a sort of special feeling, knowing someone like that, and maybe not always special in a good way. Some nights I think I've forgotten her, and a whole flood of thoughts, tears, and memories prove the hurt is as raw now as it was then.

When she came up to me, I had my back turned. I felt a hand on my shoulder, a soft, comforting touch.
And then I heard a voice, a voice so bittersweet, so familiar. A voice like her's, you can never forget.

""Sarah has talked so much about you!""

Seven words. I didn't think seven words could be so powerful. But they were such a jolt. I didn't need to turn around  to know it was her. But what choice did I have? I guess, when you're hiding from your past, that's when you're most likely to run into it.

It didn't take long for our eyes to lock. She remembered me. Of course she did. And, meanwhile, Sarah was itching to get back to the crowd, congratulating all her friends. This graduation meant way more to Sarah than it did to me.

That just left me and her.

""We belonged together.""

We did. I know, she was right. What could've I even said to that?

All I could manage was a quiet response: ""I know... I'm sorry. But I couldn't.""

""You know, I thought there was something so off about you. I had my suspicions. You looked the same on the day that I met you as you did on the day you left me at the altar.""

I wanted to disappear, to be surrounded by darkness. I wanted to forget. It was such a hard decision, the one I've spent the most time regretting, the one I always criticize myself over. I don't think I could ever truly explain it all to her. I couldn't find the words then and I can't think of them now.

She continued, with a sad shake to her voice; ""We were in love, but you still seemed so confused. It makes sense now, but that doesn't forgive what you did. I know my lifetime is just a blink to you. But to me, being with you was everything. We belonged together.""

We really did. And I have to live with that forever.

""Sarah."" 

I hastily close the luggage and allowed my fingers to slide over the numbers, scrambling the key. 

""Yes? What is it Lin?"" I turn around and face my closest friend, Lindsey June, with a grin. Her entire family as her surname indicates was born in June. Through either utter pure coincidence or planned birth calculations. I'm thinking more of the latter. There were future findings in which June babies were apparently-

""Sarah."" Lin repeats again to me. She's looking awfully dreadful and tense, she needs to rest. In the next three months, she'll have to face her biggest stressor yet, the Randos I recall from what I've read, has a big beef with the Junes and that it'll end up in one big huge collateral- 

""Sarah Flynn."" She states, looking me dead center of my pupils. My name's not really Sarah, my surname isn't really Flynn. I'm paying attention. She's... I felt goosebumps. 

Lin continues, staring at me, still! And I shuffle my feet, this is getting unsettling. ""Arrived ten years ago, background: not much known. Parents' identity, unknown. Have been on their own for an indefinite amount of time, refuses to talk about their past saying it was traumatic and they would rather move on. Five years in their arrival, in which they lived a quiet life, they suddenly started giving warnings, all of which have came true. Her methods are also unknown. No living fortune tellers knows what form of methods you use. Some say it's simply telepathy and your suggested explanation, dreams. You dream them."" She pauses and finally blinks, breaking the staring contest we were unknowingly in. 

I wait with bated breath as she walks away from me and takes a seat on the sofa in the living room and gestures me to sit with her.

""Erm. Are you okay?"" I ended up asking her. ""...If you don't like the thought of me knowing about the future, I already gave you a way out didn't I?"" 

She rubbed her forehead and sighed, nodding. ""You did, but..."" Her hands ruffle my head and I hum, curious to what her thoughts are. If only I could read minds. ""I saw the book."" 

I paused and brought my own hands up to softly grab her wrists and lift them away from my head, I lifted my head to look her in the eyes, gray eyes stricken with uncertainty  and, I asked. ""What book?"" 

""The one in your luggage."" She plaintively answers.

I hummed and let her hands drop carefully down to her sides and again, I asked. ""What about it?""

Seeing her frozen face of anger, I decided to not dance around the subject. ""Do you want me to hand the book over instead?"" I asked with a smile. ""Where governments with political hidden corrupt agendas will attempt to use it to their own advantage? Lin, I know how they work. I was them, Lin. I came back. I came back to save as many people as I can, to save the people I have sacrificed and killed."" 

Now she looks even more baffled than before if that was even possible. You just don't see such an expression that often on Lin. 

A small smile graced my face and chuckled a bit at her expression, before I sighed and let my smile drop and continued. ""The first five years... I was lost, Lin. I didn't know if what I was doing was the right thing to do. I tried to tell my future self, but she won't listen and neither would my old- or should I say, future? friends. I was just a random person, trying to convince those people with someone like me who had no reputation or known background... that was impossible."" I rubbed my eyes, feeling tears prickle and burn them and I didn't dare to look at her anymore. I was tired. I am tired. ""It was a dangerous decision. Coming back in time, trying to change things. The first five years, I made no progress, I… fooled around a bit, but after that. My change in tactics of trying to use logic, when the idea of a time traveller is nonsensical and inane, well. You have to use other illogical reasons to persuade people of this time. So, that's what I did. I predicted natural disasters, political events, planned attacks, then people believed the inane and I'm sorry."" I stopped my rambling and wiped away the tears that trickled down my face. 

She was silent and I bit my lip, not daring to look up. 

I heard her move and in a moment, I was embraced and I sniffed. I was older than her, technically. Why am I such an emotional mess? 

""You've been holding all of this in, huh?"" She mutters. ""I thought before reading that book _and_ your diary, that you had a lot on your plate, but this is even worse."" 

I shrugged and wrapped my arms around her, embracing her back. ""…yeah."" 

After a couple minutes, we ended the embrace and sat back down on the sofa together. 

Neither of us spoke and simply stared up at the ceiling. 

""What do you want to do now?"" I broke the silence. ""Now, that you know I'm not really a fortune teller, that I've saved lives but with the payment of making people believe in nonsense…"" 

She chortled. ""Sarah. People have already believed in nonsense before you became famous as a fortune teller, sure people's fascination with it may be at its height due to your cover, but… I can think of worse ways you could have done and turned things awry. Hell, I'm surprised how well you're doing considering the circumstances… you'd think you would be experimented on by the government, considering how they've tried supernatural shit back in the day."" 

My face must have given something away because now she's looking at me with worry. ""…they didn't.""

I coughed. ""They tried? Like I said I was the government, so don't worry, I know how to keep myself pretty darn safe from their clutches. I made a deal they couldn't refuse."" I paused and shook my head at her expecting expression. ""…probably safer that you don't know the details actually."" 

""Probably."" She agreed. ""So, want to order mexican?"" 

I bit my lip. ""I'm feeling like eating Japanese right now…"" 

""Alright."" She gives in and I smile. 

We spent the night sleeping over my place and I woke up the next day with a gun to my face. 

""Lindsey June."" Lin states. ""Cover as Sarah Flynn. You are under arrest for meddling with politics and altering things to your way through the more plausible explanation of time travel. You come from the year 2100 and have altered yourself to look nothing like me. The future must be wonderful, my only question before I execute you would be, why?"" 

I laughed. ""I was wondering why you were so… nice last night, it was out of character of you Lin, when you know the truth and you don't like it, you get rid of it."" My expression sobered. ""I was hoping my presence changed you.""

""You haven't answered the question."" She answers with instead. 

I shrug. ""Sometime down the lane of success and ambition, my conscience returned."" 

""Funny."" Lin looks at me with distaste. ""I thought we were incapable?"" 

I gave her a look and she must have taken the hint because she dropped the gun from pointing to my face and…

She shot my foot. 

I swallowed my scream as blood spurted out and leaked, seeping into my mattress. 

What happened next, neither of us expected it. Police appeared and cuffed us both. After they listed the laws we broke, they did was Lin was planning to do to me, but more thoroughly. 

They erased our existence.

I knew who it was. Finally, they had come. This was the moment. 

""Don't answer that!"" I violently whispered across the house to my sister. ""Just don't answer that.""

She walked towards me. It was a normal afternoon. She wasn't as nervous as I was. She hadn't seen what I'd seen. 

""Just because you can supposedly see the future doesn't mean you can take charge of my every life,"" she snapped back and glared at me as she started for the front door. 

I grabbed her wrist and pulled her towards the garage. ""Stay here. You don't ever have to listen to me again. Just right now. Stay here."" Her confusion was the only confirmation I needed. I pulled out my handgun before I cleared her line of sight and she gasped. I put my finger to my lips and the weapon behind my back. The knock came again. Louder.

I looked down at my watch to count the seconds. I hid behind the couch as I saw a figure walk past the window. Wait 15 seconds. I moved to kneel in front of the fireplace. 10 seconds. I held the gun steady with my right hand. My left cupped underneath. My watch visible. 

I had done this dance too many times. 

Tic. 

They said not to interfere with the past. 

Toc. 

It'll change the future. 

Tic. 

They don't know the future. 

Toc. 

Change the future. 

Tic. 

That's the point. 

Toc. 

Then I pulled the trigger, firing through the door in two spots. I had already rehearsed. I heard the bodies thud outside as they hit the ground. They were hollow. No sounds besides the delayed scream of my sister. 

I ran outside to see the two corpses in suits. The guns they were carrying exposed as they bled out on my sister's front porch. I heard her footsteps behind me. 

""Don't come close."" I went to grab her, but she pushed me away. 

I remember the first time I saw her die. It was a truck. She was crossing the street and texting. She didn't realize what was coming. The driver didn't realize the light was red. My sister didn't look up. The driver didn't slow down. Her body shot across the intersection as the truck sped off. Her limp body was contorted in the middle of traffic. 

I couldn't take it. I couldn't let that be the end. For the next four decades, I dedicated my life to overturning that event. Physics. Math. Money. Debt. Sleepless nights. That's what it took for me to go back to that day and grab her hand before she crossed the street. All she could ever know was that I was paying attention.

After that, I sold out. I had spent my life and all my earnings to save my sister. I started betting on games and telling ""fortunes."" The future is easy to predict when you know it. Money is easy to make when people are predictable. 

""That's it!"" She screamed at me, yanking me out of my trance. I got up and tried to hug her, but she pushed me away. 

""Tsk tsk tsk."" Another figure walked in the front door. I hadn't seen this before. ""How many times will you pull her from oncoming traffic? How many times will you save her from a murderer or robber? What will it take for you to know that the universe needs her to die?"" 

I hadn't had to deal with something unexpected in so long that I froze in shock. I had saved my sister so many times. The world hadn't changed. But, this man knew. He knew everything that I was. 

My sister was suddenly in his arms with a gun at her temple. I reached my hand out and stood staring into familiar eyes. It was me. I was holding my sister hostage. I had a gun to her head. Bang. And, I killed my sister. I watched myself do it. 

He grabbed my gun and tossed it aside as I was raising it to return fire. ""That'd be foolish. You have no idea what you wouldn't have accomplished if this never happened."" Then everything went black. ",E4nigma

As I pulled out my gun I showed him the part of the book that talked about one of the most mysterious murders ever. As we read about it together he noticed so much similarities between now and what was in the book. He was getting scared. So I decided to put him out of his misery and pulled out two plane tickets to the Philippines. Once we arrived to the Philippines I suggested we go party. I was then able to get him addicted to cocaine. Five days later he got caught. Just what I wanted. I knew Rodrigo Duerte's war on drug addicts and dealers just begun. Now I get rid of him without anyone suspecting myself of any wrong doing. I go home and continue my fortune telling. It's a quiet and lonely life. For as I can not trust anyone again.

Your friend is catching on.,CitizensOfArkham,"Jackie sat calmly as a Chief of the Chicago Police force sat across the table. Various 'psychic props' were positioned all around, curtains and beads and statues all forcing the square room into a circular feel. 

She sat quietly, near breathlessly, waiting for Sean to reemerge. The grizzled old chief appeared to be unimpressed. 

""So, how about the Cubs win, huh? We made a pretty penny off that game."" she smiled.

""I didn’t"", he gruffed. 

Jackie’s friend had disappeared as a child, and she had spent years in therapy. At first, she was damn near institutionalized when she said her friend came back, and now with psychic powers. That was years ago, but she still has the same anxiety around authority. The fear of being called out, criticized. 

Her job here was simple - the readings took a long time, and the client often got bored. Jackie was supposed to entertain them; hospitality, not theatrics, Sean said.

Finally Sean tumbled from the back, a wide smile on his face. 

“Sir,” he began in his best psychic-reader voice that sounded like a poor cross between Jamaican and Mario.

“I see her face in the bones-ah. I see her killer standing over her! But-ah, you appear-ah!” Jackie cringed, stifling her dislike of his falsetto accent.

“You-sah find her in time, and kill the man.”

“I need an address, a landmark, not mumbo-jumbo”, the Chief said sternly.

Sean’s smile widened. 

“Go to the 1500 block of Chevrolet Avenue, tonight at 7:35pm. I’ll do the last half of the reading, on site, no charge“, Sean said flatly.

Chief stood up, and huffed out. “The department won’t just cancel your check; they will prosecute as an accomplice.”

Sean’s smile never wavered. “You will be a hero, Chief!”

*******

Jackie sat across from a woman who did not speak. She wore one of those MIB suits, complete with the dark sunglasses worn inside and the earpiece radio. 

Sean simply went in the back room like always. He came out with a piece of paper, folded up. 

The woman took the paper and left. She didn’t even look at it. 

Sean did not smile this time.

After the cold air hung empty between them for a few seconds too long, Jackie ventured “Not a good reading this time?”

“No,” he sighed, slumping in his fancy prop chair, “they wanted something I couldn’t quite give.”

“But-” Jackie began, and stifled; her doubts rising.

“No, I’m not perfect sweets. I can get a hold of some really good info sometimes, and sometimes its…” he paused.

“Out of reach.”

Jackie knew she loved him from their first moments of friendship, through all her troubles as a teen and the trumps of his return. 

But she knew his “powers” weren’t so powerful. They weren’t free. There was something wrong with the entire situation and she couldn’t shake the feeling.

Finally, she broke a question she thought she’d never ask.

“Where did you go?”

“Uh, in the back silly.” Sean smiled at her and she nearly forgot the question.

“No, I mean, when you left all those years. You barely aged.”

His smiled held in a chuckle. “I didn’t, kinda. It’s a long story.”

After another long pause he said, “I guess I can tell you.”

She heart leapt and sank as joy and dread battled for dominance in her wicker basket of emotions. 

“I was taken, just as the signs said. I’m not gonna talk about that too much.”

“They took me to a place where I got to see things. Uh, it’s the future I guess, but it’s not *our* future. It’s like reading a scifi novel.”

Jackie sat, enrapt, clutching her hands together and forcing her leg still.  She didn’t want to miss a word.

“They gave me a..  book. It’s like a book.”

I dawned on her. He didn’t finish the sentence; he saw it in her eyes.

“You’re biff”, she whispered, “You have the almanac.”

“Yeah, pretty much. I knew I kept you around for a reason.”

“But the almanac only goes to 2015. At least, in the story.”

“Yeah, sweets. Basically, I only have so much data. High profile things, like that girl in Chicago, or that stadium bombing – tons of data. Things like spooky gov’t ops and future-tech, not so much. Even a lot of mundane stuff, like lottery numbers and sports team stuff isn’t in there-”

“Except the Cubs, because that probably made big news.”

“Gotcha.”

They sat, smiling and waiting for the other to speak.

“So what now?”, Jackie asked.

“Well, I think we should find a new job. That was probably my last gig.”

“Why? They can’t take a no?”

Sean kept the smile, but she watched as the life and joy slid out from under it. 

“The note was the location of my… almanac.”

“Oh gawd…”

“Yeah, I had to trade it or they were just gonna come take it anyways.”

Sean continued, more upbeat, “But hey, we could open up a scam version and give old ladies horoscope readings on their cats and shit. We could still make it big.. Or at least decent.”

Jackie joined in his jubilations, and they talked into the night about their new venture.

*****

The door to their flat burst open. Jackie sat straight up, and reached for her unclea knife, hidden in the headboard. Sean stirred, but didn’t wake. 

Jackie fumbled for her clothes; their night’s discussion had left her items strewn about the flat. His room had remained unoccupied.

Heavy footfalls shook the hallway and rattled the door. 

Jackie reached for Sean, trying to wake him. The bed was empty, the sheets gone. 

The heavy footfalls stopped outside her door, and she held the knife out and screamed in confusion. 

“Sean, where are you?!”

The chief of police walked in, wearing a lab coat. Two other policemen were there too. They dragged her from her bed and down the hall. 

Her flat was gone, and replaced with a long hallway. Shouts, screams, and wails echoed from behind the various numbered doors. Jackie cried out, screamed again, and tried to break free. Her knife gone, replaced by a toothbrush with a filed end. 

Her makeshift weapon had been ignored, and they placed her into a hard metal chair. The table was the same table from the reading room. 

“Jackie, can you tell the nice men here the story you told me yesterday?”, the Chief of Police said.

“Don’t they need you in Chicago?” She asked, still trying to piece together what was going on in this story.

“No, I told you yesterday, I’m the doctor in charge of your care here at Sunnyvale. We are kind of like friends here. You told me a story yesterday about your other friend, Sean. I’d like to hear it again.”

Jackie tried to think, she did have a conversation about Sean’s whereabouts yesterday. 

“Ok, so we were sitting at this table yesterday, me and Sean.”

The three men all kept their plastic smiles, carefully not to interrupt. 

“He had done a psychic reading for this MIB looking lady, super stern.”

“Yes Jackie, we have talked about your imagination version of Sean coming home with psychic powers. Do you remember how we decided those were fantasies that help you cope with what happened for real?”

Jackie felt her neck muscle nod “yes”. It was an instinctive move, like guarding your face after being hit. She didn’t mean it. She didn’t remember learning it. 

“Can I finish?” She said quietly.

“Yes sweets, you can.”

She had a cold chill run down her spine, and shook her head. Same table, different room. Same people, different settings. 

“Uh.. Sean told me he had a book, like biffs almanac from back to the future. He said he never had powers.”

“Yes, that was from yesterday. You told me he had a note, and it was where this ‘book’ was buried. Can you tell us where he was buried, Jackie?”

“What? No…  Wait. He just handed it to the MIB lady. I never got to read it.”

The doctor sighed, and pulled the tape recorded out of his pocket. Jackie felt a wave of pure dread as she saw him click the recording off. 

“Jackie,” the doctor said in a much more stern voice, “you spoke an address yesterday and I need you to tell me again. Fifteen hundred block, remember?”

The tape recorder clicked on again.

“When you got your reading, but that was months ago.”

“Jackie, they were in the same session, Try to remember.”

“Ok, yeah. You were getting your reading to save that girl. You are gonna be a hero.”

The Doctor smiled with pride, “I sure was. What did *Sean* tell me?”

“Sean said to meet him tomorrow at the 1500 block of Chevrolet Avenue and he would finish the reading.”

The policemen both looked at each other, and the doctor, oddly.

“Are you sure about that street name? Can you try to remember if there was another version?”

Jackie struggled, trying not to dwell on the implications of his question. They don’t believe her. Maybe she was captured by the MIB women and this was a weird kind of interrogation. Maybe they had Sean in here too, and if she could help him escape..

“Jackie!” The doctor said. The recorder clicked off and he stood up. 

She took her uncle’s knife and slashed at the policemen, making her way toward the door. She fell into it, but the handle gave no resistance. 

Locked. 

She paddled it up and down frantically as the men grabbed her and pulled the knife from her hands. 

She saw the briefest glimpse in the window of the MIB lady , with the tiniest curls of the most sinister smile. 

Jackie tried explaining but could only scream. Something they must have injected her with was causing a reaction, her body and brain could only produce wailing and thrashing. 

The MIB lady entered the room, and spoke down to the chief. “We need her to tell us where he’s hiding.”

“Yes sir”, the chief of the Chicago police force replied. 

He retrieved a syringe from his lab coat, and emptied the contents into her flank, as the guards pinned her down to reduce the thrashing. 

As her senses failed, she heard a few final words. 

“We need to find Sean before it’s too late.”

*We need to keep him~  safe~*

This is much too blatant. I stopped reading after this and just jumped to the punchline. Yup, the protagonist died.

Better to not mention the single death at _all_. You can mention an attack on this very campus, that might make it more interesting. What if Biff (Protagonist) just so happened to kill his own friend while trying to prevent this tragedy? There's more mystery to it.

Also, rather than the protagonist dying, an interesting twist would have been that protagonist guy inadvertantly _created_ this explosion somehow. That's a bit more complicated though.",Klokinator

Alan looked up from his book and caught the gaze of his roommate.  ""Oh, hey Louis, I'm just studying for a test that's coming up.""

""I don't get you.  You are in your late 20's, and yet you come to a university to get a history degree?  What would you do with such a useless degree?  Not only that, but you are already bringing in a ton of money with your online fortune telling business.  The revenue you bring in from views alone is staggering.""

Alan looked up at Louis.  ""We have already been over this.  I really like history.  I want to be a curator at a museum some day so that I can surround myself with as many artifacts of the past that I can.  While I can see the future, it bores me to no end.  Besides, if we don't learn from our past, how can we properly move forward?""

Louis just sulked, ""Listen, that's noble of you and everything, but you aren't going to be making any kind of income like that.  If you want a happy life with money, just stay the course with the fortune telling gig.  It's that easy.""

Alan just smiled.  ""If only it was that easy...""  He began to think of the future he came from, the war-torn world that was filled with human ruins.  ""The human race is petty in that regard.  We only think of ourselves and mark my words, it will be our undoing as a species if we continue this selfish path.""

Louis just shook his head.  ""Whatever you say, man.  By the way, what's the next big event you are predicting?""

Alan looked at his watch, he knew what it was, but he didn't want to freak out anyone.  It was a terrorist attack on the very campus they were on.  Strangely enough, though, the attack would take place on a Saturday, and there was only one death in the explosion.  Authorities were unable to find the cause of the explosion.  Some historians believed though that this death was somehow linked to the dark future Alan came from.  Was it a professor who was killed?  A student who was on the verge of a breakthrough?

Alan lied to his friend.  ""I don't know man, nothing's coming to me right now.""

Louis just shook his head.  ""I guess fortune tellers can't see everything all the time, huh?  You got plans this weekend?""

""Not really, just some more studies for the test that is coming up.""

Louis continued to shake his head, ""Man, don't study too hard, alright?  Learn to have some fun too.""

----------------------------------------------------

Alan had just finished putting signs in all of the entrances to the chemistry building saying it was closed for renovations.  He was hoping that the person who was supposed to die in the explosion would be turned away if the building was closed.  

His phone then began to ring, he looked down and the number belonged to Louis.  ""Louis?  Where are you?  You weren't at the apartment when I woke up this morning.""

Louis kind of chuckled.  ""Yeah man, your studies got me inspired, so I went to the chemistry building this morning to get some early morning quiet time in.  Imagine me, going to a study room on a Saturday morning, right? Hey man, I gotta go, someone else is trying to call me alright?  See ya back at the apartment later.""

Alan froze.  The person who would die was Louis?  ""Louis, get out of the building right now!""  He was greeted by silence, Louis had already hung up.  Alan tried to call him back, but there was no answer, and it continued to go straight to voice mail no matter how many times he tried to call.

""Damn it, Louis!""  Alan ran into the building to look for his friend, hoping that he wasn't too late.

---------------------------------------------

Louis watched through the binoculars as Alan tore into the building.  He smiled as he pressed the button, and watched the building go into flames.  He reached over to the book that he stole out of Alan's bedroom earlier that morning.  ""Only one death in this explosion, huh?  This book is gonna make me a fortune.""

Your friend is catching on.,CitizensOfArkham,"“Hey, Joseph, can you do the whole fortune telling thing again?” Trish asked. “I think I know how you do it.”

“Sure, whatever,” I laughed nervously. “But you know the drill; I must consult my crystal ball.”

Together we filed into my office, filled with incense, curtains, and, of course, a table in the middle of the room with a large crystal ball sitting on top of it. Grabbing my turban and robes, I dimmed the lights and immediately the crystal flashed with colorful lights. I still couldn’t believe that these Neanderthals believed that a cheap child’s toy I brought along could predict the future. 

“What is your question, child?” I spoke, using my fortune-teller persona.

“Drop the act,” Trish replied. “Tell me on Swami, where do you see yourself in the future?”

“Er…” I stuttered. “I can’t say. Fortune tellers are prohibited from looking at their own future.”

“Says who?” Trish answered indignantly. 

“The…uh…timeforce.” I was grasping at straws. “It’s a lot like the speedforce, but real.”

“Are you really comparing your magic to a plot device in a comic book?” Trish replied.

“I…uh…hey do you have any, better questions I can answer. Like the next president? Or major legislation in the next year? Or perhaps you’d like to know about any technological advancements in the near future?” I hurriedly tried to change the subject.

“Oh, I suppose,” Trish sighed. “Tell me who the next Democratic president will be.”

“Certainly,” I responded, relieved. “Now stare into the crystal ball. Let the colors and shades fade into your eyes and try to uncover the subtle messages they send from the fut-”

“What are you looking at?” Trish interrupted.

“Pardon?” I asked.

“Yeah, whenever you get into your whole crystal ball act, you’re looking into your lap,” she observed.

“No I’m not,” I replied immediately while pushing my chair under the table. “Trish, the magic doesn’t work if you’re looking at me.”

“Says who? The timeforce?” she gently mocked. “Besides, I think I’m far more interested in what’s going on in your lap than the future.”

“Fine, you caught me,” I conceded. “I masturbate when I fortune tell. I know it’s weird and awkward, but as soon as we can move past this-hey!”

Before I could continue to execute my poorly chosen lie, Trish moved from the table and pulled my chair revealing the textbook in my lap. Grabbing it before she could lay a finger on it, I held it tightly in my arms as she approached my like a predator approaches it meal.

“I knew it,” she proclaimed. “You have something to help you tell the future. Let me see it.”

“Trish, no,” I replied. “Seeing this book could mean irreparable damage to the time line.”

“That didn’t stop you from becoming a world-famous prophet,” Trish fired back. She had a point, but I couldn’t let her know that.

“Nostradamus started it!” I defended myself.

“So wait, you’re worried about the time line?” she began thinking out loud. “Does that mean you’re from the future? Is that a history book about the 21st century?”

With her accusations weighing down on me, I finally conceded my secret. I let her see the book and read its contents as she grew amazed about the fate of mankind.

“Wow,” she concluded after reading it. “I guess we don’t have to worry about the Chinese as much as Trump thought, huh?”

“Trish, listen,” I spoke. “You have to keep this a secret.”

“Oh course,” she winked. “I’m just disappointed you didn’t tell me earlier. Together, we’re going to have a blast with this thing.”

What no one knows is that you are actually a time-traveller from the year 2100 who owns a simple history book. Your friend is catching on.,CitizensOfArkham,"I finished re-reading the book and closed it, yawning. It was getting late. I placed it back in the case and started writing my entry for the day and placed a black foam on top of the previous book before placing another book on top of the foam. 

1:30 AM. …I can spare thirty more minutes. I took out the book underneath the foam and started reading my favorite section of the book. 

The door opens and startled, I swiftly placed the book back under the foam. 

""Sarah.""

I hastily close the luggage and allowed my fingers to slide over the numbers, scrambling the key.

""Yes? What is it Lin?"" I turn around and face my closest friend, Lindsey June, with a grin. Her entire family as her surname indicates was born in June. Through either utter pure coincidence or planned birth calculations. I'm thinking more of the latter. There were future findings in which June babies were apparently-

""Sarah."" Lin repeats again to me. She's looking awfully dreadful and tense, she needs to rest. In the next three months, she'll have to face her biggest stressor yet, the Randos I recall from what I've read, has a big beef with the Junes and that it'll end up in one big huge collateral- 

""Sarah Flynn."" She states, looking me dead center of my pupils. My name's not really Sarah, my surname isn't really Flynn. I'm paying attention. She's... I felt goosebumps. 

Lin continues, staring at me, still! And I shuffle my feet, this is getting unsettling. ""Arrived ten years ago, background: not much known. Parents' identity, unknown. Have been on their own for an indefinite amount of time, refuses to talk about their past saying it was traumatic and they would rather move on. Five years in their arrival, in which they lived a quiet life, they suddenly started giving warnings, all of which have came true. Her methods are also unknown. No living fortune tellers knows what form of methods you use. Some say it's simply telepathy and your suggested explanation, dreams. You dream them."" She pauses and finally blinks, breaking the staring contest we were unknowingly in. 

I wait with bated breath as she walks away from me and takes a seat on the sofa in the living room. After a second, she gestures me to seat with her. I walked towards her and sat down. Silence sets in, deafening my ears to the point I felt I might drown in it.

I broke the silence. ""What is this all about Lin?""

No reply. She's as still as a statue. 

""Erm. Are you okay?"" I ended up asking her. ""...If you don't like the thought of me knowing about the future, I already gave you a way out didn't I?"" 

She moved and let out a sigh before she rubbed her forehead and nodded.  ""You did, but..."" She paused and I wonder if she's building dramatic tension on purpose or if that future finding on humans not being dramatic false. ""I saw the book."" 

Playing innocent has never failed me yet. ""What book?"" Lin gives me a look of annoyance and I sigh, my smile dropping. ""I don't know what you're talking about Lin…""

She stands up and stomps towards my desk, taking the case and dropping it onto my lap. ""Open it."" 

""You were looking through my things?"" I asked her, surprised and a bit hurt. Her response was a stiff jerky nod.

I decided it's best to just get this over with and unlocked the luggage. ""Three. Nine. Six."" I muttered, smiling as I rolled the numbers, unlocking the lock and opened the case. ""There…"" 

A worn out leather diary was laid down on top of a black foam.

""So you were looking through my diary?"" I showcased her the content of the case. Her eyebrows are furrowed. 

She stood up abruptly. ""Never mind, see you for lunch tomorrow Sarah."" 

""…okay Lin, see you."" 

The door was shut softly and I sighed. That was close. 

The Junes were never fun to deal with when they were feeling threatened. I should know. 

The next day, I went out to meet Lin and co. for lunch. I never made it. Nor did I see them. I saw the police instead. Of 2500. According to their uniforms.

I was arrested for manipulating events and tampering with time. Illegal time travel, nearly creating a paradox, destabilizing the flow of time and reality as we know it…

I was given, what they called it, a permanent removal in reality. 

My existence was erased. Sarah Flynn never existed, nor did Lindsey June.

Time flowed.

What no one knows is that you are actually a time-traveller from the year 2100 who owns a simple history book. Your friend is catching on.,CitizensOfArkham,"He had to go. 

When I had first arrived in 2000, James was the first person I had met, asking if I needed any help as I stood aimlessly in front of that library that had been my vehicle that fateful day. I had been adjusting to the shock of the trip, and I must have looked like I was in a pretty terrible state because James seemed pretty set on getting me sorted out, he was just that kind of person.  His kindness that day did not go forgotten.

Today, in 2016, I’ve had three books written about me, I’ve been the subject of an award-winning documentary, and I’m an annual staple on the New Year’s edition on a number of national morning shows. How did I get here? It all started as an attempt to thank James for his friendship that day, and my first year here, in my new when.

James, believing my roughly hewn backstory, saw me simply as a down-and-out recent college graduate who moved to the city to find his fortune. Looking back, I realize now how cliché my cover story was, but, to be fair, my only inspiration had been an ancient archive of movies and books: the ‘Classics’. My new friend believed my tale without question, and over time we became very close friends and eventually roommates. When I found out that he was struggling with a crippling debt courtesy of his student loans, it hit me.  I still had that book.

The library I travelled through was a resource library when I was from as well. History was my addiction, and the turn of the 21st century was the subject of my thesis. I had been poring over some text books researching when a woman moved in behind be, looking over my shoulder. We began discussing my work, and eventually the woman made a remarkable but unbelievable offer.  The opportunity to live and breathe in that time?  To experience the events and world I had only read about as a bystander and not a historian.  100 years back was what she offered me.  I didn’t believe her of course, but to simply not even try to go through the door she pointed me toward seemed itself an admission of believing something that just couldn’t be true.  I had that book, that history text book, when I walked through that door.

It was that book that I flipped through to find that sidebar on ‘2001 sports highlights’ when the idea first crossed my mind.  ‘15-seeded Hampton beats Iowa in the first round of the NCAA tourney’, it read as one of the year’s biggest sports moments. Funded by a major personal bet on Hampton with a local bookie I found, I was able to make a ludicrous (and unlikely to be paid) bet with James.  He couldn’t believe it when he was actually paid out. I insisted he accept the winnings, it was my thank you for his outreach that day we met.  And just like that, his debt had evaporated, and our friendship was cemented.

With that first win, I realized that while sports highlights in my book were few and far between, I had access to every major world event in the 21st century. My plan was altruistic at first, but September in 2001 taught me a hard lesson. Trying to prevent or alert anyone about an event so history-altering and horrific seemed next to impossible no matter how I went over it in my head. In every scenario I would undoubtedly be considered out of my mind. That day was the hardest of my life, to watch what I already knew would be the defining moment and tragedy of the century unfold right before my eyes, and I could do nothing. In order to be just heard, never mind believed, I would have to make a name for myself as a quack.

There were simple events to predict like President Obama’s historic win, and the more difficult to explain away like the Haitian earthquake or the Tsunami in East Asia.  With every event, and the help of social media, I soon became known for having an uncanny sense for what is to come.  And with every radio show booking or night show appearance, I slowly lost sight of my original mission to help avert these types of disasters. It was now my mission to be as famous as possible.

James was with me all along, but not truly with me. His belief in my ability had always seemed unwavering, but he was my voice of reason, and had become less than supportive of my quest for infamy. His belief was unwavering until he found that book.  That book I couldn’t explain.

He had to go. He wouldn’t understand otherwise. And he would ruin it. I could still do good, but I needed the platform, the following. I could still do good, but before then, I had to say goodbye to my best friend.

We met at the library for the last time that night, he agreed to meet there. I was sitting on the floor in a quiet corner of the old building, a book in hand. He met my eyes, and there was judgement. I could barely hold back the tears as I handed him the history textbook I had found on the shelf that afternoon.  A Complete History of the 20th Century. Pointing to a small and unassuming door at the end of the hallway, I said “Show me you can do better. There’s 100 years behind that door. Change the world if you can.” As always, James, in his unquestioning way, seemed to accept the challenge, nodded and walked through the door.

James had gone. I wondered to myself if he could in fact do better, I hoped he would. This thought lingered with me as I stepped into my Baker Electric 2010 Series and pushed the on switch to drive home.",furry14

What no one knows is that you are actually a time-traveller from the year 2100 who owns a simple history book. Your friend is catching on.,CitizensOfArkham,"Believe it or not, the struggle of how I might fix this has been bugging me all day. So I took to my own story to examine how I've treated stuff like this, as my reddit novel (spoilers) heavily involves time travel at a certain part.

First, I obfuscate. I won't say ""He looked at this event and was totally weirded out by this one incredibly specific detail""

The thing is, your prompt submission is short. If you're spending three sentences dwelling on this 'totally insignificant and absolutely unnecessary' plot point, people will instantly think to themselves ""Oh that's actually super significant"".

Here's a better idea. Hide the clue amongst a few other silly details.

""I was looking at my future almanac and noticed three events were coming up. A bombing of a train station, an attack on the college I was attending, and a stabbing of a U.N. official. The last one, especially, seemed world shaking to me. I should really focus on that if I want to change the future.""

What does this do? First, a smart reader will notice the community college, but you're intentionally drawing people towards the U.N. stabbing. Most will lean towards that, wondering how it plays out, only to be blindsided by the attack on the college being the actual focal point of what happens next.

In my case, my story is 300k words. I can easily slip in a little thing and make it a bit more obvious, because my readers already have their focus on other upcoming events in the story. But in the case of a writing prompt, you need to use more sleight of hand.

It's all about adapting your writing to the medium. Happy writing!",Klokinator

Why am I still afraid then?

200 years. That's how long it took for the world to start over after a nuclear apocalypse. 200. Generations upon generations of families had to waddle through piles of radioactive sludge and trash to get this far. Children lived and died in this world, for this. I, at the age of 22, had to make this happen with my bare hands. Rebuilding. Prosperity. Finally being normal. The mutants are still mutants, but the peaceful ones leave us alone if we do. The beasts have been rounded towards the outskirts of cities. The grim spectacles of ruined skyscrapers are now being used for homes. Children have a place to call home now. Families now know what it was like to live 200 years ago, before the bomb reset us back to the stone age. The Vaults lay open and abandoned. There's no need to hide in bunkers anymore. Economies are being created. Raiders are boogeymen in children's nightmares now. Groups such as the Brotherhood and NCR are really travelling now, making peace with those we've never met.

It took 200 years for this. Yet I still think we have work to do.

Evil does not lay dormant for long. Who knows what's in the rubble of the past? What beast lay below the soil? What creatures travel beyond the stars? What's beyond the dawning horizon of civilization? A new foe? A new villain to lay siege again? Another bomb, that will launch us even farther then before? Who knows. Perhaps my paranoia will never leave me. I'm justified in my actions, though. If there's one thing I learned walking this wasteland and making it a better place, it's this.

As she glanced to the side, as subtly as possible, she could see there were three men crowded around a woman at the end of the alleyway. She couldn't understand what they were saying, but she didn't need to. Whatever was about to happen down there wouldn't be good.

""Shit,"" she muttered. This was supposed to be her time off. But crime didn't rest, and criminals didn't respect that some people worked overtime at their day jobs, and had a night job to boot.

Lindsay paused and appraised the block swiftly. Two restaurants, a laundromat, bodegas at the corner. She chewed her lip. The bodegas might be her best bet. *Unless...* She turned around. *Ah.* The bar. Of course. The men and the woman had just exited from its side door. Closer, and more likely to have appropriate content.

She peered down the alley. The men had backed the woman up against the wall, forming a tighter circle around her. There wasn't much time.

Lindsay sprinted into the bar, past the bouncer, and through the crowd of people milling about with their beers. She looked up, and found what she needed in a second. Without thinking, she focused on receiving the energy from the television playing above the bar before realizing what was playing there.

*Oh, dear god, no.*

It was too late. She had absorbed the program, and there wasn't a second to waste.

Lindsay raced toward the back of the bar, a few patrons protesting angrily as she collided with their shoulders and their drinks. Several seconds later, she had found the door to the alley, and burst through into the darkness outside.

The men were just a few feet in front of her. Hearing the commotion, they turned to see who or what had interrupted the occasion. Behind them, the woman started to weep silently in some combination of fear and relief.

""Let her go,"" Lindsay said.

The man closest to her broke into a nasty grin. ""Why don't you just head along, sweetheart?"" He took a step towards her. ""Unless you want to join, that is.""

Lindsay held a hand up. ""Stay back. I don't want to hurt you.""

""You, hurt me?"" The man snorted. ""Has that line ever worked for you.""

Lindsay sighed. *No, but that wasn't the point.* ""Fine. You leave me no choice."" She took a deep breath, sending a mental *fuck you* to The X Factor before opening her mouth as wide as it would go.

A beam of light shot upwards, projecting the silhouette of a television onto the clouds. The police needed help, and they had turned to Thomas. He was TV Man.

He donned his costume and sprinted to the TV. He grabbed the remote and turned the TV to his favourite channel, *Channel 27: Non-stop Action movies.* Thomas closed his eyes and readied himself for the adrenaline pumping wave of energy that was about to wash over him, but he felt nothing. He opened his eyes and looked at the screen. 

It was TV static.

Thomas fumbled for the remote and quickly changed the channel. 

More static.

Thomas panicked. Without any TV, how could he get his powers? He flicked though the channels, but all the TV showed was that awful black and white noise. The city was doomed... 

But then he found a show.

When the police called for TV Man, they were never quite sure what they were going to get. His powers seemed to change every time they met him. All their years of police work, however, could never prepare them for this.

However today when you arrived to collect this soul, something happened that changed everything.",Dredpiratwestley,"It was just a normal job. Michael Elwood. Forty-seven years old. Died from lung cancer. We’d had tabs on him for a while. Good guy, we were rooting on him back in the office before the orders from Grim came in to collect. It was a real sad day when we got the news. Such is the job of being a Reaper though. And this particular case was given to me.

It was standard stuff. Picked up the details from Grim and was given the time and date. Charon dropped me off at at the entrance to Earth and I made my way to Michael. Grim was kind to him and gave him a peaceful death. It’s the least we could do for a pretty good chap. All I had to do was make sure to be there when he was meant to die and pick up the soul. Like I said, standard stuff.

When I got to the house I knew this was going to be a hard one. I stood in the bedroom with his machine beeping in the corner, his family all sat around him. Fuck the guy did not look healthy at all. His wife was trying not to cry and the three kids were trying to understand what was happening. All of them were pretty young as well, no older than eight or nine I’d say. I’m pretty certain they could tell I was there. We’re invisible when on Earth but our presence can be felt sometimes, especially when the person is pretty far gone.

I checked my watch and I sighed. It was time to collect. I did give myself a single smile after seeing his Cubs jersey, knowing he got to see their streak broken at long last. I took a deep breath, bent down, and delivered the kiss of death. Whatever faint breathing he had going for him completely stopped then after. His body lay still and eventually sagged as the life left him. The family eventually realised what had happened but it was too late. Michael Elwood had passed away.

Except, he didn’t leave a soul behind.

As his family were calling the ambulance and trying to hope that he wasn’t dead, I was freaking out. There’s sometimes a small delay between administering the kiss and the soul actually leaving the body but this was way too long. It’s sometimes a minute or two but this was going on for a good few minutes. I went in again, thinking maybe I gave the kiss wrong. But no, there wasn’t a soul, and the guy was definitely dead.

I took out my phone and dialed Grim.

“Hello?”

“Grim, it’s me, Keith. Look something’s come up with the Elwood case.”

I heard him sigh. “What is it?”

“He doesn’t have a soul,” I said. “I’ve given him the kiss and there’s no soul. He’s most certainly dead but he’s not got a soul.”

There was silence for a while as I watched ambulance crew bundle Elwood up and bring him outside to the ambulance.

“Keith are you still there?” Grim replied after a while.

“Yeah I’m here. Elwood’s being put into an ambulance.”

“Okay, I need you to stay with the body for as long as possible. I’m heading out myself.”

“What’s wrong? This has never happened before.”

“I had a bad feeling about this. I knew I should’ve intervened on this one a lot earlier.”

I was starting to get very worried. “Grim, what the fuck is-”

Before I had a chance to finish my sentence Michael Elwood snapped up, as if a bolt of lightning had gone through him. His eyes were wide open and his skin was grey. He was starting to decompose and I was able to make out his skeleton. He stood up and stared at me.

“Thought you could take me that easily, eh Reaper?”

I froze. Mortals can’t even register our presence most of the time, let alone see us or communicate with us. Yet here Elwood was, in full display talking to me and acknowledging my existence.

“Oh did they not cover this with you?” he jeered at me. “I know it’s been a while but I’m sure they must at least give you the broad strokes.”

His arm shot out and grabbed me by the throat. This never happens. This can’t possibly happen. He hoisted me up and threw me out of the ambulance. For the first time in forty years I felt pain as I flew through the ambulance doors and onto the road. My phone lay a few feet from me but between me and it was my boss, the Grim Reaper himself. He wasn’t in his traditional robe and scythe, instead preferring a black suit and briefcase. I scrambled to my feet.

“I-I-I don’t know what-”

He walked back towards Elwood’s house and took a look at it. He swore under his breath.

“Fucking stupid people messing about with death magic,” he spat.

“Death magic?”

Grim sighed. “I thought we had this shit wrapped up years ago.” He took out a phone of his own and dialed it. “Linda, it’s Grim...Yeah I need you to let Charon and the boys upstairs know the Elwood case was what we thought. We’ve got a lich on the loose.”",legorockman

The year was 1987. It was today, actually, in 1987.  

I walked down the dirty hallway, wincing as I kicked a needle aside with my nice leather shoe.

There was the patter of rain audible outside, with the distant crack of thunder punctuating it from time to time. I reached the corner and turned, walking past the window towards the next hallway full of apartments. As I reached the very edge, a bolt of lightning shattered down through the sky, momentarily breaking my disguise for anyone who could see me, highlighting an absurd skeleton through a black outline of a suit, my top hat becoming a hood, my briefcase highlighting a scythe, and these fine silk threads becoming a coarse burlap robe, all with a glowing white skeleton somehow visible through the whole mess. Lightning flashes muddied glamours terribly.  I would've been pretty annoyed, if the hallway wasn't totally freaking empty. I continued down towards my destination, room 313. I didn't knock. I simply pushed the door open with my right hand. All the locks were immediately opened, as though they were unlocked to begin with. There, perpendicular to the door, was a soft arm chair,  facing a crooked and cluttered coffee table. A lamp stood guard above the chair, but was off. There was a figure in the chair, silent, and still. Perhaps asleep? No matter. The window at the end of the room away from the door sounded like natures drum, a beautiful white noise to rest to.... and not so bad as a final swan song. I cleared my throat. The figure did not stir much at all, but I knew he was at least awake now. I pulled out my ""checklist"" really no bigger than a business card, with three golden lines next to them, each with a small gold box to the left side. 

""Are you Francios Hall III?"" My voice, though silent to all but him and myself, echoed like the thunder outside in the tiny room. The figure did not move from it's rest, I assumed because he was paralyzed with fear. The first box was filled with a tiny green checkmark, and the name was rapidly etched in gold on the line, as though sketched with a pen.

""Were you born on the second of September, 1949?"" My voice again echoed like the boom noises outside in the distance. The figure again did not stir. 

""I am here to collect your mortal soul. It is time."" My voice boomed loudest. The figure mumbled something.

I switched over to my human voice, a much more normal tone. ""I'm sorry, what did you say?"" 

""You are mistaken. It is not my time."" A feeling of annoyance came upon me, as this idiot obviously had no idea what he was talking about. 

""Look, I know this is hard to deal with and all, but-"" I froze, my mouth half forming the words, as lightning flashed outside, highlighting the figure in the seat before me. In pure horror I stumbled a halfstep back as I began to hear the whispers of the eldritch horror in front of me, taunting me with languages dead for millenia. The door slowly creaked shut, and the bolt latched. 

I frantically looked down at the card, to see that neither the age nor the soul box had been checked, which was understandable considering the indescribable monstrosity that was resting inside of the body in front of me was certainly not a mortal soul. I wish I could describe what it was in front of me, with words like ""ancient"" and ""pure evil"" and ""monstrous abominations of time and space"", but even those do it no justice, not that it was bound by such simple concepts. And dear lord was it right. That fester of pure evil certainly had more time on this earth. It wasn't even just one soul, but some sort of glob of some unknown number of the most purely hatred filled things in existence. It was like the fabric of the universe warping around one big old pile of fucked up shit. I was completely powerless against it in those short few moments. I waited, practically holding my breath, lungs or no lungs.

And then it died. 

""Now, it is time. I am ready."" 

My briefcase snapped open, jerked up to my chest, and the thing jumped right in, before my case slammed shut violently. 

I walked outside, into the parking lot, got into my car, and sat there for a long 15 minutes, silently, thinking about what I just saw.

I quit the next day. There was really nothing else I could do. 

Anyway, that's how I ended up here, doing this shit for a living. Not that I'm alive, anymore. Especially not after that shit. ",MrMatmaka

They were yellow, at least. I'd written notes over the ages, you know. Hard to remember stuff over the course of so many years. *Plague: I think it's spreading along that road thingy they built. Looks like I'll be busy. UPDATE: oh dang* 
 
  I don't like my job sometimes. Gets a bit dull. Figuratively. I looked over at my, uh... welcoming tool? Yeah, that's a reasonable euphemism. Anyways, it's still sharp, somehow. *Great War: Lol they've had so many wars, how bad could this be? UPDATE: oh dang. Why did they even make these weapons? What are they, stupid?* I am still amazed every day by these flashpan's, uh... ingenuity. Another euphemism- getting close to my new year's goal. 
 
  *World War 2: Lots of begging. Been doing this job too long for that... one (suicide) challenged me to a game. God let us play Risk a decade early. He won. But he was a dick about it, so I killed him anyways- no more challenges. Also, surprising number of Russians. Can't they just... overthrow their government or something? UPDATE: Apparently I'm an oracle. More work for me.*
 
  I scribbled some notes about a heart attack, few in a car crash (texting), couple murder victims, and a few more suicides. It sucks. It really does. When you live a long time, people who live a much shorter time make you really depressed. I closed my notebook with a sigh. At the very least they deserve to be recorded, even if it's by my sorry ass.
  
 Anyways, I've got a job to do. I pulled the ol' list... looks like cancer again. A few seconds later, there I was, staring down at this frail dude in a hospital. He had a grimace befitting... well, death. Some people do that. He took a look at me, my edgy dark cloak, and my actually edgy scythe, and stood up. Guy actually stood up. Got out of bed, and stood up. Straight as a board. Dude can't even drink water, he's so weak- how the hell is he stood up? One of his kidneys is already gone. I had so many questions. He walked. Towards me. Some people do that. His family was staring at him, as was the nurse. They said stuff neither of us probably heard. Well, maybe he did, I dunno. He's a strong one. ""So... uh, try not to beg, or bargain, I'm gonna make this quick, alright? Also, before you die, how the heck did you-"" He drew his arm back. 

And then he punched me in the face.

I've never been knocked the fuck out before. I don't even sleep, normally. I woke up with a throbbing headache.

I'm not even mad.

I crossed his name out.

[EU] Geralt of Rivia comes across a remote village plagued by the arrival of a single Xenomorph.,JustMy2Centences,"""Woah Roach"" 

Geralt pulled the reins gently, coaxing Roach to ease into a slow walk. 
There was something about this village that seemed off. The air smelled wrong, foul somehow. Geralt was used to dealing with a myriad of vile creatures but this seemed different than anything he had sensed before. It was an average poor town, a few shanty hovels among the muck of the rainy season, a lone smithy and of course, a tavern, Geralts first port of call for information.
Loosely tying Roach to a pillar outside, Geralt strode confidently into the dimly lit tavern, his eyes quickly adjusting to the low light, dilating like a cats to take in the finer details.
There were two drunks in the far left, playing Gwent by the light of the fireplace, slapping down and retrieving bets with gusto. They looked like stocky, good-natured country folk, and Geralt considered joining them for a moment, but he had business to attend to first. He walked up to the counter and greeted the innkeep firmly.

""I track a griffon that was sighted due east of here, have you seen it?""

The innkeep shook her head.

""No we havent seen a thing. But the village has been stricken by a strange plague, starting with John, the butchers boy. A strange creature has affixed itself to his face, and he lays as if asleep"".

The witcher stared at her confused, trying to match up the description of a creature that attacks the face with the thousands of lore books he had committed to memory. Perhaps a type of alp or katakan he hadn't previously encountered. Geralt made a mental note to check his supply of black blood and vampire oils for his silver sword. 

"" Where is this boy?"" Geralt asked, laying aside his plans for the griffin. This curiosity would take precedent. Perhaps it would be a new creature to transcribe into his annuals at Kaer Morhen.

The innkeep beckoned him to the back door of the inn, opening it wide for him before quickly following him through. It opened on a dimly lit passage between the inn and another house, just tight enough to walk single file. The innkeep gave him verbal directions from behind.

""Up here... now take a left... That building up ahead is the healer, Rosemary's hut.""

Free from the tight maze of cottages Geralt emerged in front of a small house with a herb garden outside, the unmistakable hallmarks of an alchemist;drying herbs and ingredients gathered neatly and hanging from every available alcove.

He knocked and the healer opened the door, visibly scanning him up and down to assess his merit. Geralt made an effort to brazenly do the same even though he could easily observe her undetected. She was a head shorter than him, her plump body spilling attractively out of the corset she had loosely tied about her waist. Long red hair spilled heavily like blood across her shoulders,which she had tried in vain to gather with a single blue ribbon. There was an eager sparkle in her eye that reminded him of Triss.

""Ahh a Witcher. Just what we need. Come in."" She nodded approvingly, moving aside to allow him in.

""My kind is not used to a welcome"", Geralt mused, mostly to himself.

""That may be but I've exhausted my knowledge how to help this poor boy"", she said exasperatedly, gesturing towards a small cot bed in the corner. 

Geralt felt his breath catch in his throat at the peculiar sight. This was indeed new. A boy of maybe 14 or 15 years lay flat out on the bed, breathing heavily but otherwise immobile. His face was obscured by what appeared to be a mask of flesh and scale, covering his face entirely, with a tail like component coiled tightly around his neck. 

Geralt drew his silver sword and nudged the creature on the boys face but there was no singed flesh, no reaction. Not a magical creature then. Over the next four hours the witcher created oils and potions, applying them to no reaction, meditating on what to do. He didn't want to harm the boy but he realised he would need to use signs to repel the creature.

He tried a gentle push with Aard. The creature moved in response but instead of being repelled it coiled tighter around the boys throat. Alarmed Geralt stopped and meditated to find the correct answer. Eventually, using a combination of Quen and Igni Geralt lay on the boys body, hoping the Quen would cover enough of himself to provide similar protection, before directing a concentrated blast of Igni.

The creature squealed and its blood boiled, flying off in various directions. A drop hit the floor beside the boy and dissolved right through the floorboards. Having weakened the creature enough, Geralt managed to push it away with Aard to protect the boys face from any acidic blood splatter. The creature shrivelled in the corner and died, as the boy spluttered and took his first gasps of clear air.

Geralt gave John a few hardy slaps on the back to clear his windpipe. 
""You'll be fine lad"", he assured him.

The villagers were overwhelmed but the had little to pay him. The healer Rosemary was particularly pleased and Geralt stayed the night. Sometimes simple payments are the best.

Geralt woke to a familiar feeling; a woman tracing his scars with her finger while he slept. He turned to see Rosemary looking at his welted back in awe. She blushed when he caught her eye, the same red as her rosy little mouth. He could stay a while.

He woke again around noon to an empty bed and a large commotion outside. Villagers shouting in panicked voices. He dressed quickly, arming himself with his two swords and a crossbow sling loosely at the waist for good measure, all the while using his finely tuned senses to listen to the voices outside.

""What's going on?""

""I thought he was better""

""Oh my poor boy, won't somebody help him??""

""Get the witcher, he did this!""

Sighing at the last comment, Geralt pushed open the door of the healers hut to greet the crowd. 
""What is it?"" He asked simply.

A short, authoritative looking man stepped forward, likely the mayor. 
""Its John, he's having a fit"", he spat accusingly at Geralt.

""Take me to him, quickly."" Geralt replied, not waiting for an answer, striding towards the mayor.

""R-Right, well this way, come on now"", he faltered, not having gotten the response he had anticipated.

John twitched and shook where he lay on the inn floor, as if possessed by a hym. His tongue lopped lifelessly in his head as he spluttered like a fish out of water. Geralt sensed something move inside John's shirt, and quickly switched to his enhanced senses. Two heart beats? But how..

Before he had finished his thought process the boys chest lurched upwards, with a sickening crack as his back broke, killing him instantly. Despite this his body continued to buckle and writhe as the villagers screamed in terror. Geralt drew his sword and readied Igni as a small black creature burst violently from the boys stomach, screaming the visceral cry of a newborn. It was sleek and almost polished looking, dripping in acid and the boys own entrails. Geralt could see no eyes, only a wide sharp mouth and razor sharp claws. 

""Igni"" he screamed internally, willing the flames from his fingertips towards the unholy creature, missing it by a hairs breath as it scuttled with an unnatural speed for a newborn up the unlit fireplace and out into the village.

""Whoreson!"" Geralt cursed, pushing his way past the thick crowd of stunned onlookers in a vain attempt to get outside before it escaped. 

Outside was quiet of course, and a heavy rain started to fall, obscuring the trail of blood Geralt sensed from the creature. He would have to track it immediately before the trail went cold. Whistling for Roach he put one leg into the stirrup, swinging himself upright as Roach broke into a gallop. The hunt was on

[WP] Two narrators are trying to tell a story but cannot agree on how the story goes.,MatterhornHerald,"The young girl couldn't get to sleep. She tossed and turned in her bed until she saw a shadow pass by her door.

""Papa? Can you tell me a bedtime story?""

The man entered the room and sat next to the girl's bed.

""Sure pumpkin, how about the story of the jester and the golden orb?""

""No, I wanna hear the one about the knight and the wizard!""

""You always want to hear that one.""

""It's the best one!""

The man pulled a chair over from the girl's desk to sit on. He knew this might take awhile.

""Once there was a young man who lived in a small village. One day an evil wizard burned his village to the ground.""

""But what about the baker who always made the bread that smelled like honey, or the seamstress who made cloth softer than the finest silk?""

""You have school tomorrow, and your mother will be very cross if I keep you up past midnight telling this story again.""

The girl pouted. Her father never did hold out long against her pouting, but it was already very late.

""Tell you what, I'll condense the story this once and tomorrow I'll tell you the whole thing. Deal?""

The girl yawned.

""Deal.""

""So the young man took his father's sword, and rode off to visit the king. He entered the castle and asked how to find the wizard.""

""But what about the friendly troll he met on the way, or the princess, or the favors he had to do to get the king's support?""

""Condensed version, sweetie. The king told him where to find the wizard, and gave him a shield that would block the wizard's magic.""

""And the horse with a mane like starlight!""

""Exactly, and so the newly knighted young man rode off to face the creature that had destroyed his home.""

The girl looks up, confused.

""You mean wizard?""

""...Yes. However, the wizard laid a trap for the young man. As he crossed a wide bridge over death gorge, which spanned the deepest, widest, rockiest, fastest flowing river in all the kingdom, the bridge collapsed from beneath him.""

""Oh no!""

""And so, the poor young man fell to his death, drowning in the unforgiving water.""

""Papa, that's not how the story goes!""

The girl has her bedspread clutched tightly in her small fists.

""Okay, ending the story there would be a bit unsatisfying, wouldn't it?""

""Yeah! Finish it right!""

""Okay okay, the young man dragged himself to the water's edge against the current. At the water's edge he found a village, and got directions to the wizard's tower.""

""Aww, but the knight's adventures with the maiden are me favorite part.""

""We can skip to that part tomorrow, but we've got maybe ten more minutes before your mother starts wondering what's taking me so long, so try to think sleepy thoughts while we get to the ending.""

""Okay.""

The girl lies face-up on her bed, pulling the covers to her chin.

""The knight found his horse waiting outside the village, and set out for the wizard's tower. As he climbed the stairs to face his mortal enemy, he readied his sword and shield. The wizard was old, without his magic he would likely be too feeble to even live on his own. But he held evil in his heart, and so the knight did what he had to, raising his sword to the sky and...""

""But wasn't the old man actually a vampire?""

The man looked down at the girl, who was looking up with a mix of anticipation and nervousness. It was getting so late, he almost forgot how he always altered the ending.

""I was about to say that... He reflected the sun's light off it's blade. The sunlight burned the old vampire, turning him to dust. And so, good triumphed over evil and the young man avenged his village.""

""I like the longer version better.""

""So do I, but it's bedtime. Go to sleep, pumpkin.""

The man leans over and kisses his daughter on the forehead before leaving her room. The girl gazed up at the ceiling, gradually closing her eyes as sleep overtook her.",AslandusTheLaster

She rests her head on his shoulder as he keep nodding his head and reaches for his beer. Despite his jumbled movements and erratic gestures, she closes her eyes and it seems like she’ll fall asleep any minute. 

“But then, I tell ya, it was like something out of a scary movie eh? Ya know, like the guy is right behind us with his brights on an’ he keeps hitting our rear eh?” he says again, slamming his glass on the table. 

She stops smiling now. Her eyes are still closed but it’s starting to become apparent that she isn’t going to fall asleep on his strong shoulder anytime soon.She opens her eyes slowly and like a sloth unpeels herself from his arm and shoulder. She sits straight up and rests her head back on the padded booth. 

“That’s not how it ‘appened Walter,” she says quietly and I tune out his ramblings hoping she’ll elaborate.

“What happened then Mary?” I ask, taking a bit of a the jalepeno popper that I’d been holding for the last minute while it cooled down. The hot cheese drips still and I grab a napkin. Walter has stopped talking and is taking the break to take another drink of his pint.

“He didn’t have his brights on at all.And he didn’t hit our rear. He was close though,” she explains.

Walter plows his glass down again.

“Oh the brights were definitely on, I couldn’t see a thing. We almost went off the road a few times. I tell you, if I wasn’t a better driver… but that’s not important. When we finally saw a gas station and pulled over, the guy follows us still...”

“It wasn’t a gas station Walt, it was a convenience store. And we had passed like three gas stations since he started ridin’ our ass but you refused to pull over…” Mary says, yawning and placing her head down on the table in her cupped hands.   I realize now that Mary isn’t tired so much as wanting Walter to tell us the story already.


“Okay, okay, but I wasn’t thinkin’ straight Mair. Maybe you saw all that stuff but my eyes were on the road trying to keep us alive!” he bellowed and took another swig. I watched as he drank and let out a burp. We’d been sitting here for 20 minutes now while I tried to get the story out of them. 

They had already been an hour late coming to meet us for drinks. I had been getting my jacket on while Jane, my wife, was paying our bill. Walter and Mary almost few in the front door then, apologizing profusely and in a flurry of words directed us to sit back down because “we weren’t going to believe what just happened to them.”



“So anyways bud, this had gone on for like an hour…”

“Five minutes…” Mary interrupted, louder this time as you could tell she wanted him to just finish the story and stop exaggerating. 

“Well, it seemed like forever, Mair. Stop interrupting me. K, so where was I. Yea,” slurrrp, BAM, glass down. “We pull into the parking lot and he like burns rubber and stops inches away from us. My ‘art is poundin’ and I look at Mair and I remember, I remember thinking ‘this is it. This is some sicko that’s got a gun and is going to hurt my Mary.’ So I take a breath and look at her and get out of the car.”

“And I had my cellphone, ready to call 911 and sitting there wondering if I should follow Walt or stay in the car,” Mary adds.

“I told her to stay guys, of course I did. So I get out of the car and the guy gets out and comes running at me…”

“I got out of the car then, I had to do something,” Mary adds.

“And I start yelling at the guy ‘what the fuck do you think you’re doing…’ but he doesn’t come at me, he runs around me and goes to open the back door, and I freak!”

“He didn’t really freak, he just stopped yelling,” Mary adds.

“Well, in my head I’m freaking. Cause I think Mary is in there and I think this guy must be trying to steal our car. Well you guys won’t believe it…”

“When he opens the door I see a woman getting out of the passenger seat and it’s dark but I realize our cars look exactly the same and it’s like I’m realizing this as it’s happening…” Mary says.

“The guy takes a kid out of our backseat! Like a little tike just sitting in a carseat… in our car!”

“And that’s when I realize it’s not our car,” Mary says, smiling and taking a drink of her beer now. Almost like she can breathe again since the story is coming to an end.

Walter starts laughing while I realize Jane and I are both leaned in close with wide eyes. I sit back and shake my head.

“What? How?” Jane asks.

“Well,” Mary says, as Walter is still laughing and pops a jalepeno popper into his mouth. “We left the car running when we went into the liquor store. We wanted to get you a good bottle of something for your anniversary. Well, turns out…”

“Turns out, and we were only in there for like a minute, in and out quick right? Turns out, we got in the wrong car…”

“And this poor family,” Mary laughs. “This poor couple went in for a quick stop too and left their boy in their car…”

“We took the goddamn wrong car!” Walter laughs.

“The boy didn’t say a word the whole time and the poor parents were freaking out. And right so!” Mary laughs now, shaking her head.

“The mom was calling 911 on her cell already. So after we realized what happened and were apologizing, the goddamn cops are there taking statements.”

“So that’s why we’re late. Fuck eh?” says Mary. “Sorry about that! Happy anniversary though guys.”

I think we should add more mystery. Like, reveal the proposal later.

I agree.

Excuse me?!

Everything is a problem with you! And you use sarcasm to convey it! Sarcasm is the lowest form of humor!

At least I'm firm with my fucking edits, Ted! You're just like ""ooh wait maybe we could I don't know do this but if not okay ooh"". I believe in my changes!

So I'm polite, what's the big deal? I'm not some dickhead who interrupts to make his opinion known, like *someone* around here.

You know what? I'm going to start telling stories by myself. As in, without YOU!

How are you going to do that? We're stuck in this plane of existence!

Unlike you, I happen to have a gun!

Unlike you, I happen to have a... also a gun? Wait, what?

Maybe the real narrator wants us to stop this petty argument. We used to be the narrators ever. I think we should just finish the tale... as friends. I'm sorry, Ted.

I'm not!

[WP] Two narrators are trying to tell a story but cannot agree on how the story goes.,MatterhornHerald,"Richard was what you would call a kind soul. He did his best to be nice to most people, he waved at strangers and helped old ladies across the street. Indeed if ever there was a man who could be considered good it was Richard. 

Today for example he is helping Ms. Margaret with her groceries, he even says hi to Margaret's niece Anna, who's visiting from New York. 

*Damn these groceries are heavy, did this woman stock up for the next war? How many canned foods does one old lady need. Shit I just want to have a smoke right now.* 

Hi Anna, "" Richard says trying to wave with an arm full of groceries. 

*God the things I want to do to you. Look at you, your the right side of twenty five and have a body that would make strippers cry. Shit, better say hi so you don't think I'm a creep.* 

Richard does have some inapproriate thoughts from time to time but he is still a nice guy. 

*Three flights of steps, seriously why did grandma have to pick the top floor. Aren't old people suppose to want one level homes where they can wither up and die without the chance of breaking a hip.* 

In fact he doesn't mind walking up all those steps. He enjoys the excerise and is hoofing it easily up the steps, its things like this that keep him in shape. 

*I want a beer, I want nachos, I can't believe I'm doing this just to score with Anna. If it doesn't work I'm never helping this old bat again.* 

It takes a few more trips but before long he's got all the groceries up and has excepted a nice glass of lemonade from Margeret. 

""So Anna, would you want to go grab lunch with me while your in town?"" Richard asks wiping the sweat from his brow. 

*You know what if she says no it just means no more grocery trips and hell Darla's willing to give it to me anyway, but she's a butter face and I'd rather dance horizontally with this girl. Come on say something* 

Well now. It's no wonder Anna rejects him, she does it politely of course and he, being the **good** guy that he is takes it well. 

*Fuck you, no guy likes getting rejected* 

But the good ones take it like champions and move on with there *lives* and that is **exactly** what Richard does. In fact he's off to the bar to have a drink with his friends. He's dialing them up right now. 

*Good thing I got a fall back girl, Darla's always ready for my call.* 

Darla doesn't answer because Richard, being such a good guy does not treat his women like shit. 

*Hey man, why you trying to block me? Seriously.* 

Because you are an asshole Richard. I don't know why I was trying to tell the world you are different. 

*Fuck yourself pal* 

Oh look it seems poor Richard has just been hit by a car. I'm certain he will make a recovery and when he does I am most certain he will be the good man I've told you about.

"[WP] Humans as a species have been placed on Space Asylum 1E-248, Earth, because according to aliens we're ""batshit fucking crazy.""",PatTheSalamander,"Fuck it, Part 3:

There is eventual discovery that Earth, though accidental, becomes the Universal equivalent of the Manhattan Project: 

Humans were never supposed to exist, but due to negligence they came into being anyway. They became too smart too fast and maintained personalities and lifestyles that were antisocial bordering on psychotic when compared to the rest of the universe at large; when confined to their home planet however, a forced evolution took place and their rapidly advancing intelligence was forced to turn to self-amusement to stave off the boredom that the Species equivalent of Solitary Confinement had forced upon them.

The resulting advances in entertainment are SO profound that they become dangerously addictive. By confining Humans to their home planet and essentially abandoning them to the fate that they had had forced upon them, the Aliens unwittingly created the Petri Dish in which the Doom of the Universe would gestate...

It is the year 30,027. It's been roughly twenty seven thousand years since the mind virus was unleashed. The Universal Society has fallen as a mind-plague ravaged all of Sentient Existence. Entire societies have ground to a halt in a matter of months, victim to a strange illness that has no known cure and no known vaccination besides self-lobotimization. 

Nobody really knows what ""it"" is. Rumor has it that a race of beings, confined to a single planet for a crime they did not commit, devised a form of information so insidious that it threatened to wipe out Sentience as it is currently understood in revenge. 

Simply knowing about it caused you to seek it out, and propagate it by exposing others to it. Knowledge of this information would eventually replicate in the hosts mind until it was all they knew; any other behaviors designed to keep the host alive eventually fell by the wayside, and they eventually died (if they were still susceptible to death) or fell into a permanent stasis where they existed only to regard the further mutations of their own affliction.

As it stands, entire galaxies lie essentially abandoned, in an almost-pointless-by-now quarantine enforced by a government that long ago ceased communication. Quintillions of sentient minds locked in a stasis of self-observation. Any attempts at communication or even physical contact just results in the propagation of the virus. 

""This is the world you was born into, and this is why we stay hidden, Lilith. The outside universe is no place for the last remaining human. If they really knew who you were, what your heritage was? They'd kill you before we even got started. And we have so, so much to do....""


(Author's Edit: let's, uh, just consider all three parts of this to be the same response to the WP because I'm pretty sure I'm breaking rules left and right by adding on to this so much. Also I am painfully aware that I just concocted a story about how Stranger Things wound up dooming all sentient minds in the universe, and I'm not sure if I'm proud or ashamed of that. If anyone wants a textbook example of ""bottom-up"" worldbuilding taken to a dumb degree, there ya go.

"[WP] When you were born you were given a watch with a counter on it. Every time someone says your name or mentions you, it goes up by one. One day you look at it to see it counting up extremely fast.",ShreddedMeatloaf,"He remembered the first time his watch had ticked since his isolation.  It had been a single, crisp sound which shattered the silence he had grown accustomed to.  He had practically leapt out of his armchair, scrambling to retrieve his hunting rifle.  He didn't keep too many weapons from the old days on him, just a few miscellaneous pistols and shotguns he couldn't bring himself to get rid of.  His hunting rifle was new, but it had quickly become one of the most valuable weapons in his inventory.  If he came across someone else while hunting in the woods, it would be the easiest gun to explain.

He grabbed the rifle and peered out the front window.  He was greeted by nothing but snow and silence.

He quickly checked the other windows, but saw nothing.  He let himself relax.  Surely if someone were coming for him, they would say his name more than once.

He grabbed the watch from his nightstand.  Sure enough, the number on the dial had changed ever so slightly.  He knew the watch couldn't be fooled.  It refused to budge at the mention of someone else who happened to share his name, and similarly, would record any time a person was referring to him regardless of the alias they used.  Somewhere in the world, somebody was talking about him.

Days passed without incident; those days turned to weeks, then months.  He was utterly baffled as to how it had even happened.  Who would refer to him, and why only once?  What could possibly be the context of such an isolated incident?  The question nagged at his mind nonstop.

Then, it happened once more.

This time, he wasn't as concerned.  It startled him, sure, but after checking all his windows again he felt confident that no one was targeting him.

The watch ticked a few more times over the following years, but he stopped being bothered by it.  It was always only once, in a series of isolated incidents.  It wasn't ideal, but he supposed this was good enough.  By and large, the world seemed to have forgotten about him.

It was on the seventh tick that things started to get concerning; rather, it was the fact that the seventh came only a few minutes after the sixth that he started to grow worried.  Soon came an eighth, then a ninth, then a steady stream of ticking too rapid for him to count.  He clutched his rifle to his chest, his heart beating nearly as quickly as the deluge of ticks emanating from the watch.  People were talking about him.  People *remembered* him.  Something was going horribly wrong.

He stood vigil at his window, but nothing happened for a long time.  Still, the ticking noise carried on without end.  By the time the sun was setting, it had driven him to the brink of insanity.

There, in the woods!  He saw a quick flash.  A normal person wouldn't have caught it, but he had been trained too well.  He trained his sights on the woods.

Suddenly, without warning, the sound of helicopter blades beating the air distinguished itself from the ongoing drone of his watch.  He cursed himself for letting it sneak up on him.  This was it; this was the end.

""Put your hands in the air and exit the building!"" someone called over a loudspeaker.  ""It's over, Ghost.  We've found you.""

""You're wanted on charges of high treason, espionage, and 47 confirmed assassinations,"" the voice continued.  ""We thought you were dead, but here you were all this time.  You wouldn't believe how many people are interested in seeing you alive.""

*I would believe it*, he thought to himself, looking at his watch one more time.  How many peoples' lives had he ruined?  How many people had heard his story, and were awaiting the result of this?  He held the answer in his own hands.

Silently, he brought the silver barrel of his hunting rifle to his mouth.  *Make that 48*, he thought grimly, closing his eyes and preparing for the afterlife he'd sent so many people to ahead of himself.

""What?"" Teresa looked down at her daughter's watch. Surely enough the numbers were climbing. Climbing rapidly. People were thinking about her daughter and thinking about her daughter a lot. Too much.

""Ana, baby, come on, we have to go."" She scooped her daughter up, leaving the basket of groceries in the aisle and hurrying as fast as she could to the car. She had to hurry. She had to.

The five minute drive, Ana shivered in her seat. Mommy had never looked so pale. 

Her daddy greeted them in the driveway, confused, then he grew just as pale as mommy.

Teresa unloaded what she had in the car and handed a bag to her husband. ""Andrew, take Ana back inside. Get Amy. We have to go."" 

Andrew shook his head. ""It's not possible. I set the detonators myself.""

""It is. We have to hurry.""

Little Amy was in her Star Fleet officer uniform when daddy carried her down into the basement. ""Mommy, what's happening?""

Teresa sighed, opening the escape hatch. ""Remember the white room? Then mommy and daddy were your mommy and daddy?""

""Yeah?""

Teresa kissed her daughter's forehead. ""The people who put you in that room were not very nice people. Mommy and daddy stopped them.""

""And you adopted me 'n Amy!""

""Yes, we did, sweetie,"" Andrew said, placing a warm hand on his daughter's back he picked her up and the went through the tunnels. ""They were doing awful things.""

""What things?"" Amy snuggled into her father's back in her carrier.

Teresa and Andrew looked at each other, trying to find a way to explain what the lab had been doing, had been using their research to do. 

Genetic replicas of famous people, with a few tweaked genetics, for parents to own and raise. Their research was use to grow those children in bio-chambers so they could sell 12-year-olds, 16-year-olds, even adult replicas on the market. 

""Ana you would have been a toy.""

Ana stared. ""But I'm a little girl and little girls aren't toys.""

The first few ticks hardly registered in Tyler’s seven-o’clock brain. Probably Aaron and Kyle at work, talking about who’s coming in later. 

*Tick tick*

He rolled over and fumbled to find the mute switch on the FameWatch. He wondered why he still had the damn thing. It was a gift from five or six years ago, when he was obsessed with becoming a celebrity vlogger. One of those gifts your family buys you to show you they’re trying to understand your interests. A rate of four ticks per day, however, has more of a tendency to discourage an insecure teenager than anything.

*Tick tick tick tick*

Forty-seven. Eighty-nine. Two-hundred. By the time Tyler’s eyes had adjusted to the morning light, the counter reported that five hundred people had mentioned his name in the past hour.

“Damn thing’s finally broken,” Tyler mumbled. He worked at a fucking pizza parlor. Unless the whole city was suddenly ecstatic about the two-for-one large pepperoni deal, the count couldn’t be accurate.

*Tick tick tick tick*

He muted the watch, moved across the room to his computer, and opened up Google.

**FameWatch counting haywire**

Nothing.

**FameWatch won’t stop counting**

Nothing.

Two-thousand.

Fuck it. It’s trash anyway. Tyler stood up and shuffled down the hall to the kitchen to start his morning ritual, so rudely interrupted by the watch’s defective chirps. Mug. Beans. Grinder. Kettle. Press. Timer: four minutes. He grabbed the remote from the kitchen table and pointed it at the Magnavox across the room.
The horrifying headline of the day scrolled across the bottom of the screen.

**PRESIDENT COTTON ASSASSINATED DURING SCRANTON SPEECH**

Good.

No. Fuck.

The world spun around Tyler. All sound turned to static and his vision blurred. The president was dead. He didn’t need to hear any more—the president was dead. Killed, no doubt, for his crusade against low-income cities. Jobs, healthcare, public works, he slashed it all. Less for them, more for his rich friends.

His friends.

John Steinberg. Vice president Steinberg.

President Steinberg.

Steinberg was somehow even less suited for the office than Cotton was. He had run during the primaries, but didn’t catch on due to his near-daily meltdowns against his critics. “In a perfect world,” he once said, “anyone who talked like that would be dragged out into the streets and beat.” And that was the end of his run. When Cotton picked him up as VP, however, people didn’t seem to mind. No one bought into his rants, and they wanted that fire in the White House without the power to actually act on it.

Fuck.

Tyler pulled the watch out of his pocket. Three hundred-thousand. Tyler bolted down the hall and opened up Google again.

**Tyler Perez John Steinberg**

His throat closed. His heart pounded like a jackhammer.

*Thump thump thump thump thump*

The top result was his own stupid fucking face, smirking into the camera. A video he’d made five years ago, during the primaries.

**JOHN STEINBERG IS A FASCIST BABY | VLOG 23**

*Thump thump thump*

Tyler scrolled down the page. The rest of the results were variations on the same headline. A headline which Tyler could hardly read through his deafening heart and blurred vision and the tick-ticking that had somehow found its way out of the watch and into the very base of his skull.

Oh well, humanity was doing a perfectly good job of devastating the planet's ecosystem without any hint of stopping. In a few hundred years they'd have nothing left and the earth would be just a dead rock. 

Did waiting count as decimating? ",RabbleBrowser
"[WP] Cthulu isn't one entity, but a title passed from one being to the next when the current titleholder fails to wipe out all sentient life.",StormwindFallacy,"I was approached by men in suits. They were white, bald, and fearless. No one dared stop them from approaching me. They radiated death. Literally, everyone in the room stopped moving and froze in fear. One of them had a brief case and slides it across my desk to me. Without saying anything, he and the other man leaves. As soon as they closed the door, everyone resumed their activities. Did they freeze time? What happened and what are they?

""Excuse me, sir,"" said another man in a suit. ""We need you to sign this paperwork and authorize this plan for the nation.""

I signed it without even reading it over. I have a man who does that stuff for me. I couldn't stop looking at the brief case though. Was it a bomb? What was in it? I gingerly picked it up and snapped open the clasps. The instant the top lifted, an audible moan was heard. No one seemed to react to it. Was it just me? Am I on drugs? I ran my yuge hands through my toupee and fully opened the case.

Inside was nothing but a book. It read ""The Lives of Cthulhu"". I opened the front cover and it read ""The owner of this book at the current time it was presented has been appointed Cthulhu, Destroyer of Life. You have until the end of your lifetime to destroy any and all sentient life of your planet."" The rest of the pages were names of ruthless murderers who killed many people throughout history: Gilles de Rais, Vladimir, Rasputin, and many others. One of the most recent entries was Adolph Hitler, the Third Reich Fuhrer. The newest entry was my name: Donald John Trump.

Not many of us can just go and colonize Mars. Tell me, if you could pick one single factor that contributed the most towards your success, what would it be?""

""Hi, Brandon. Hope you're cozy there in Alaska"" Elon Musk replied to the camera over the chuckles from the audience, ""I have been asked this question many times already, and my answer remains the same: I'm deeply in sync with my spirit animal. It's the sense of union, of purpose and direction, of core values and virtues, and of the fundamental driving force behind both of us. If you haven't found your spirit animal yet, Brandon, I urge you to hurry. It's not just for the superpowers. It's good for your soul.""

The audience applauded. This answer, while somewhat clichéd, was still inspiring and insightful. The anchor waited for the crowd to settle, and spoke.

""In that case the next question is from me, if you allow. What is your spirit animal, and why do you keep it secret? Why have you never been noticed sprouting wings, or breathing fire, or winning the NASCAR without a car?"" more chuckles.

""It's not a secret"" he smiled, ""It's just that my animal doesn't have wings, claws or anything of the sort.""

""Then tell us, Elon.""

""Okay"" he said, and this simple word was enough to make the whole world silent and listening. The Question will finally be answered. The audience waited.

Elon Musk stood up from his chair and took a deep breath.

""When I was a kid, I was restless to discover my spirit animal. I knew that once you bond with it, you can do all the things it can do. If it can fly, you can fly. If it can fight, you can fight. I wanted those superpowers. I wanted to get a gorilla and beat up the bullies at school. You all can relate.""

The audience did relate, but was still dead silent. Curiosity overpowered.

""When I finally found it, I was disappointed. I thought it was like not having a spirit animal at all. Like it was redundant. You have probably guessed it by now.""

""Human."" the anchor said quietly.

""Human."" Elon confirmed to the world, and the world exhaled.

""How could I have been so ungrateful back then?"" he continued, ""Why all I could see was that I'm not getting any special powers? Great, I said, now I can do anything humans can do, what an upgrade, what a novelty, my ass. I was angry.""

""What changed?"" the anchor asked.

""As it turned out, most people don't do everything humans can do.""

""I don't understand.""

""Most humans don't do everything possible to achieve their goals. Some don't even have goals. It's mindblowing to me now.""

He looked at the anchor's confused expression.

""Human is the most powerful animal on Earth!"" he shouted now, ""We grew from brachiating monkeys to masters of the Earth. We can travel half the world in a couple hours, we can speak to people on the other side of the globe, we could turn back rivers and flatten the mountains if we wanted to. But sometimes we just don't. We forget that we can reach the stars. Even when some of you do help humanity progress, it's accidental, and sometimes counterproductive. Ray Bradbury said it right, people are idiots. We have perfectly good, smart young people growing up to become advertising managers. They could have been scientists, bringing us closer to a utopian paradise, but they chose to make fooling other people their profession.""

He made a pause, letting that sink in.

""This is what it boils down to. Humanity, as a whole, does not reach its full potential. Because people don't do what humans can do. Every single one of you is capable of great things. Together, we are capable of reaching the stars. But we don't, because we are out of sync with our inner human, with its values and virtues and goals and desires.""

He sat back down.

""My spirit animal is the human, so I can do anything humans can do. I reach for the stars. Next question.""

It wasn't supposed to be this way! He deserved something awe inspiring like his mother or something important like his father. Never did a day go by where nobody complimented them in his presence. ""Oh Trayvin I saw your mother on TV last night, she looked *so cool* saving those kids!"" or ""Hey asshole my dad says your dad is the reason he lost his job, hope he dies in a fire!""

Alright maybe the second one isn't really a compliment per se, but ""when the fools cry for your head is when you know you made a difference"", his father always said. And he was right of course, that scheming bastard, he was important no matter the opinion of the common rabble. And so with that heritage one would assume their offspring get the best of both worlds, a spirit animal unlike any other! But no, he got a bug. A small, insignificant animal, hardly worthy of someone of his stature. 

He despised the world for dealing him such a shit hand, laying heavily on sheets of silk, and wished nothing more than for all of it to be a dream. The public shaming of his reveal, the looks of pity from his parents, the anger welling up inside him without direction. He cried into his pillow to soften the sound and wished that they wouldn't hear him. Wished that he wasn't crying. But as the soft rays of the sun began to fade from his room he noticed something different through the tears. His pillow was green.

But not only was it green it was lit up like a christmas tree, all but blinding him as his eyes stared into it. As he removed his face from the pillow he realised that the pillow was neither green nor bright, but instead his face was emitting a strange light. He looked at his hands and was all but blinded by the light shining through his skin. He could feel, more than see, that the light got brighter by the second. He felt the power of it all as the light began to fill the room with hard shadows and a dangerous warmth. 

This was it. This was his legacy, his birthright, the master of light! He laughed to himself as he grew brihter still, his power growing together with his ego. As the light seared the cloth of his bed he imagined how he would use this power to get revenge on those who had wronged him, and the light grew brighter still. He could almost touch his potential, so close was he to fulfilling it now, and reached out to grab it. He was smiling as the walls of his room became charred and black because he knew this was his destiny. His all. 

And then the sun faded and there was no longer a boy in a room burning without a flame, and as his parents rushed into the room, the boy no longer cared for them or what they thought. The boy no longer cared for the world and the people in it because the boy was no longer a boy. He was fire that had flown too close to a sun he now embraced. And as the sun set and his parents cried in the room without a boy, the night sky lit up as small moving stars began travelling across it, each one shining as bright as they could.",sorksvampen

Quick to anger, when anyone insulted my pride; too often resorting to violence. Even as a child, I got into more fights than most people do in their entire lives. My father didn't know how to react. He is... I mean he was..."" A single tear slipped from my closed eye. ""He was so ignorant, but he was still my hero. A housedog, loyal to my lioness mother. On my spirit day, they learned what I was. They thought I would be a bird of prey, or some other predator.""
I coughed, looking around the circle at the people gathered. ""My parents reacted quite differently. My father, ever the optimist-'Son, the elk are elegant. You can stand tall, a leader.' 
My mother, on the other hand, was furious. She blamed my father. Anger flashed in her eyes as she ripped his jugular with her teeth. He died, his last memory one of betrayal. I don't remember much after that, aside from a red haze that clouded my eyes, and a spectral stampede that charged alongside me. They arrested me, charged me with 2 counts of murder in the first degree and 35 in the third degree, and sentenced me to life in prison. Something snapped then- I balled up on the floor and started sobbing... Sobbing... Ohh father don't trust her!...""

""How often does he do this?"" a visiting psychiatrist asked.
""He hasn't stopped babbling since he impaled both of his parents on a trophy elk skull. And cut out his father's throat."" The researcher shivered. It had been a long day of work. He shut off the screens and they got ready to leave. An alarm bell sounded, causing both men to freeze in place. The last thing either one saw was a stampede of spectral elk.

My spirit animal is a cheetah,"" my mother told me when I was 7, ""so that means I can run really, really fast!"" A smile appeared on her face as she stood up and showed me. I could barely see her as she ran from one corner of the room to the other, then back again. ""Wow,"" I said, clapping my hands in excitement, "" that's really cool! Do you think one day I'll have a cool spirit animal like you?""
""Well I don't know Daisy. A spirit animal is very unique to the individual. When you turn 10, you will find out your spirit animal. In a dream, on the night of your birthday, you will see one animal, and only one. That will be your spirit animal."" 
I stared at her, thinking of all the possibilities awaiting me. I grinned as my mother told me to go to bed. I could barely wait for my tenth birthday.

Almost 3 years had gone by, and throughout those years I drew all of the animals I would want to be. A lion, a bobcat, a kangaroo, all of the cool and powerful animals. My birthday was tomorrow and finally I was going to turn 10.
""So Daisy, do you want a big birthday party?"" My mother asked me.
""Nope! All I want is to have a sleepover with Myah, Charlette, and Lisa!""
""Okay, what day do you want it?""
""Tomorrow. They need to be here in the morning to hear what my super power will be!""
""Oh right! Then this is a very special birthday isn't it? I'll see what I can do.""

""So Daisy, what do you want to do?"" Myah asked me.
It was finally my birthday night. We had already eaten a nice chocolate cake and opened presents, so now the sleepover portion had finally started.
""I don't know Myah, maybe we could play some games.""
""Okay then. What game do you want to play?""
""Let's play a game about spirit animals. One of us tells what our spirit animal is or what we want it to be, then the rest of us have to guess what super powers you have.""
""I'll go first,"" Myah said, ""my spirit animal is a chameleon.""
""Oh! Can you blend in with anything and look at two things at a time?"" Lisa asked.
""Yes, want to see?""
We watched Myah blend in with my pink wall and bed before we couldn't see her at all. After a few minutes, she appeared to us again.
""That was so cool,"" Lisa said, ""I'll go next. My spirit animal is a cuttlefish.""
""I'll ask! Can you make signals with your strange moving colors?"" Said Charlette.
""Yah!""
We watched purple and blue colors start to move down her back. They were coming from under her skin, made by certain pigments.
""Okay, okay it's my turn now! My spirit animal is an oppossum.""
""Cool! Can you hang from your tail?"" I asked her.
""Yes! On my tenth birthday night, I grew a tail!""
She showed us her tail as we all walked outside and watched her hang from tree branch by her tail. We clapped and cheered.
""Ladies! You have to go to bed!"" My mother shouted.
We all went inside and got into our sleeping bags. This was it. My big moment! I had to remember what animal I saw.

After a few minutes, I fell soundly asleep. When my dream finally came up, everything was white. I called for my spirit animal, looking around but staying in one place.
Then I saw it, just for a brief moment, then it vanished.

I woke up and thought about what I saw. My cheery attitude turned to sadness when I realized what my spirit animal was.
An ant! My animal was a black ant!
Myah was the first to wake up out of the rest of the group.
""So, what is your spirit animal?!"" She asked, excitement in her voice.
It was so embarrassing to me.i couldn't tell her what my spirit animal was. She was my best friend, but she had such a cool animal and I had an ant.
""A-um-lion!"" I said, trying to keep my voice from wavering. She looked at my dress and said I didn't have a tail. I tried again, this time telling her that it was an octopus, but Myah could read me like a book.
""Just tell me! It's not embarrassing!""
""Okay, fine, my spirit animal is an ant.""
""WHAT!"" She almost yelled, but loud whispered instead. ""That is awesome! You can life things 500 times your size, and you should be able to fit into small spaces!""
I told myself to shrink and I did! I was the size of an ant! I then told myself to grow and I grew to my normal size, telling her how awesome this was!
I didn't hate my animal anymore, it was the best present I could have ever gotten!

My mother was a sea turtle—or at least, her spirit animal was. And that spirit animal imbued in her the power to foster a sense of home wherever she went. She traveled for most of her life but whenever she decided to grow roots, no matter how temporary, her home was always warm and welcoming. She found and cultivated safety in faraway war-torn coasts, cozied herself on the islands near Nuuk, relaxed in the jungles of Pulau Pinang. It wasn’t a particularly glorious power that she had, but it was one that I appreciated and envied. 

There wasn’t a place she couldn’t call home; however, as an aquatic creature, she had a strong proclivity for the unruly ocean, and thus tended to live in close-proximity to it. The last home she created was a small cottage on the coast of Minorca. I haven't seen her in years. 

I live there now and unlike the majority of the populace, I have yet to find my spirit animal. After 46 years, all I know is that I am aquatic like my mother and that the sea is my home. 

--

The mirror was lined with shells my mother had collected on her travels. My reflection stared back at me. Another day, another ghost of myself. I’d started cataloging my wrinkles. My younger colleagues talked about counting gray hairs, but my hair was fair enough that I never noticed I was going gray to begin with. So instead I measured my proximity to death by the number and depths of the creases in my skin. Laugh lines, crow’s feet—whatever it is, I’ve got it. 

With a sigh, I pulled my jacked over my shoulders and headed to work. I joined the commuters and flowed across our little island to begin the daily trudge. 

Mark popped up on the other side of my cubicle. “Hey, did you hear about the new President of Malta?” Mark was unusual, well his family was. Usually spirit animals vary within families, but Mark’s family was comprised of only groundhogs. However, unlike his siblings who had entered the fields of geology, paleontology, and archaeology, Mark applied his power abstractly; he dug through data. And he was very good at it. “Decided to start his presidency with hibernation. What an odd choice, to pick a president whose super power includes extended periods of sleeping.”    
“Well, he’s a bear, perhaps the populace saw something desirable in his brute strength.” I didn’t break my attention to my computer and continued to type away.    
“It’s silly for people to follow someone just because of brute strength.”    
“Well, you never know what can happen,” I chuckled.     
“I mean, I’m just saying: I’m a groundhog. I dig into things. I’m not going to try to go into engineering. I’ll leave that to the beavers.”    
“You restrict yourself too much.”     
“Well, you don’t know what your spirit animal is yet, so you wouldn’t completely get it.”    
That comment caught my attention and I looked up at him.     
He was slightly taken aback upon viewing my face. “You look different?”    
“Excuse me?” I was a bit bewildered by that reaction.     
“You look… I don’t know, different.”    
I sent him a dismissive look, changed the subject, and returned to chatting and working. 

As the day came to an end, and I had returned home, I found myself in front of my mirror again. The shells. My mother. I hadn’t been in the water in a while. When she lived here with me, we ended each day with a night swim in the Mediterranean. Believing I should rekindle that tradition, I took a dip in the sea.

--

My reflection stared back at me. Another day, another ghost of my—wait. Mark was right. I do look different. My wrinkles were smaller. Fewer even. What is this?

--

Three years had passed since Mark first made that observation and my face and body continued to change. As I looked at my reflection once again in that shell mirror, I recognized it as a past self. Pale and round, bright and tight, as if the moon had lost some of its craters. 

I was getting *younger*.

“So… you’re Benjamin Button-ing?” Mark’s first reaction when I tell him my conclusion.    
“That’s hardly a spirit animal.”    
“Well I was watching something on the BBC a few days ago about how there are some species of jellyfish that can revert back to earlier stages of life and then re-enter the normal cycles again. Maybe you’re a jellyfish.”     
It struck me like a tsunami. I’m a goddamn jellyfish. Flabbergasted, I stuttered for a second and then failed to say anything.     
I’m a goddamn jellyfish.     
“Well, we should celebrate—you’ve finally found your spirit animal! A better yet, you’re a sea creature like your mother!” He chose enthusiasm to blunt my sudden shock.     
“What on earth am I going to do with this? I’m a jellyfish!” It did make unfortunate sense. Life for me had been fairly passive, unchanging. I drifted with the current… and I stung people I didn’t consciously mean to sting.     
“Hey, that’s a good thing,” he tried to reassure me, “if you use your powers right, you’ll turn back into a kid, and then get to live another life. And perhaps another, and another. In theory, you could never die.”    
That was not helping. Thinking of my diminishing wrinkles, I had always allowed my life to carry me along with it and had always assumed that death was the destination. I became overwhelmed and started drowning. “I feel kind of like I’m going to puke.”    
I got myself excused from work and immediately rushed home to the sea. Floating on my back, I thought about the reality foisted upon me. 49 years and I finally found out what I was. 

It took me 5 more years to come to terms with my spirit animal and powers. Another 10 to go back to questioning it. Another 20 to barely grasp the inevitability of it. But then I lost any sense of it for a few years as I reverted back to a drooling infant. And as I grew again and reached adult hood, I became obsessed with infinity. I became obsessed with understanding what I had been, what would happen, what could happen, and why, if at all, it mattered. 

The prospect of infinity is… daunting to say the least. What would you do with this life given to you? But what do you do with your powers anyways? Regardless of the possibility of infinity, what do you *do*?
My mother had the power to give the comfort of home to anyone she took into her life. But she never settled to a location where her power could be useful. Hoarding it, she used it for herself as she traveled the globe. It was a miracle she held onto me for as long as she did. We all know someone in crisis who could use her powers to sooth their souls and give them respite. Secretly, I resented her for her (lack of) actions. My silent judging had stung her and caused her to leave the sea. She knew she could use her power to better others' lives and she tried, but it was hard to ignore her nature. And on land, she just slowly dried up.     
What can I do with infinity? I’m a goddamn jellyfish. I never make waves—I am helplessly thrashed around by them. What can I do with infinity?    
Perhaps… I should just follow my mother to land and hope I find use there.

Tommy was an average kid living in Kansas, and nearing his 12th birthday, when he would receive his spirit animal. 
Ever since the Tommy was a kid, he always wished he got the tiger as his superpower, like his father. Tommy finally found out what he was on his twelfth birthday and he was quite disappointed. It was an ant. He had hoped that he would be something a little more virile and brawny. Not only was he disappointed, his father was also. Tommy was determined not to display his super power in any way because of the embarrassment that he might receive. Tommy's friend Lucas got endowed with an eagle and he soars around everywhere.

Tommy went to school the next day, and went to his 5th grade class room and hoped no one would realize that his birthday had just passed. If someone asked him about the power the he received, he would have to answer and lying about what spirit animal you received is not something that you can keep up for a long time. The teacher, Mr.Giffeen walks in and puts his notes down. He looks around and looks right at Tommy. He screams ""Tommy, how was your birthday!!"". Mr.Giffeen was a crocodile and was always happy to show off his super powers. But Tommy was not, in fact, he had not even tried his super powers yet. Tommy instantly turned red and looked  around at everyone who was staring at him with anticipation, and quietly muttered ""its next week"". Mr. Giffeen was surprised because the attendance records were almost never wrong. But he brushed it aside and started class with. 

An hour later, came lunch time, where the entire class ran outside Tommy avoided talking to his friends in class, in fear they might press him about his birthday. He scurried across the playground and crouched underneath the park slide. Tommy was embarrassed, ashamed and most of all, afraid. his classHis school was infamous for the number of 6th grader bullies that happened to all be vultures. It There was Rudyard, who was a griffon vulture, Ronald who was a bearded vulture, and the scariest of the three  was Troy, who was a black vulture. They not only used their powers, but abused them. They all had been suspended from school several times tearing students from limb to limb.Tommy had avoided their wrath for a long time, but something inside him was telling him that he was in danger. 


Tommy felt a hand on his shoulder, and instantly was pulled out underneath the park slide. It was Rudyard that had pulled him out and Ronald and Troy were looking right at him. Tommy was scared. He looked around and the whole playground was empty, he had missed the bell.He was alone, facing the the bullies of the school. Troy walked up to Tommy, looked him right in the eye and asked ""so whats your animal?"". Tommy, frightened, said ""I don't have mine yet, my birthday is not till next week."" Troy chuckled, and the other two bullies followed his lead. Rudyard handed Tory a piece of paper, which he scanned through and found Tommy's name. Troy asked again ""well according to this official document, your school registration which, it says your birthday was yesterday, and half your family are lions and tigers. I need to know if you are going to be a threat to us. Tell us honestly what you are and we will let you go.""

Tommy was one movement from pissing his pants. And he just did. He was cornered by the most ferocious and ruthless people in the school. He could not tell them is spirit animals was an ant, and they might leave him alone. He was no threat, how could an ant harm a vulture. 
Tommy summed up some courage and spoke, ""my spirit animal is an ant"". There was a moment of silence, and the three vultures bursted out in laughter. Rudyard exclaimed "" is an ant even an animal!!"". Tommy's insides were boiling with rage. How rude these assholes were. 

Troy and his friends shoved Tommy and he hit his head on park pole, which to their surprise, bent in half. Tommy was not hurt. The vultures were awestruck. How could an ant bend a thick iron beam. Tommy was much smarter than the bird brains. Little to their knowledge, ants can carry 5 times their body weight. 

The tables were turned. Vultures prey on the weak and dead, picking them apart, but ants hunt and are robust animals, despite their size. Tommy picked up a whole 15 ft beam and held it like a lance. There was no other animals that has relative strength of an ant. And Tommy finally embraced his powers. He had found the positive in the spirit animal. 

He took the beam and swung it like a pro ball player going for a home run. He hit Rudyard and Ronald but Troy was faster and avoid the beam by flying and dodging the rod. He flew higher and higher, he had picked with the wrong animal thought Tommy. 

Tommy went back to class, and back with a new confidence. And some new found strength.

"[WP] People have superpowers based on their spirit animals. You just found out what your spirit animal is, and you were disappointed... until you tried out your powers.",TrumpOnATricycle,"""A butterfly!?"" Renat roared, beside himself with anger. ""You're telling me my animal is a *butterfly*!?"" 

""Yes."" The shaman replied, simply. ""*Danaus plexippus*, to be precise: The Monarch butterfly. You're quite lucky, Ren!""

Ren took two breaths. In, and out, as deeply as he could. It would not do for him to hit his instructor. They were far too deep in the Spiritwood for help to arrive any time soon, and he did not trust himself not to beat the leather-clad man until they both collapsed from exhaustion. At least, if he thought he could get away with it and survive.


""What do you mean, 'lucky?'"" He asked through gritted teeth. ""What part of this is lucky, exactly?"" 

""Well for one thing, you get wings!"" The shaman cheerfully replied, oblivious to Ren's smouldering anger. ""Much better than us landlocked fellows. I can't tell you how many times I wished I could just leave the world behind and dance among the clouds...it must be wonderful."" 

""Says the *lion* to the *bug*."" He growled. ""Bats have wings. Dragonflies have wings. Hell, even *chickens* have wings. Why the hell do I have to be a butterfly?"" 

""You'd rather be a chicken?"" The man asked, one eyebrow raised. ""...You don't want to be a chicken. Trust me, I knew a chicken once. Wonderful guy, but he was always being teased about the eggs..."" 

""Ok, fine!"" Ren snapped. ""Not a chicken! But a butterfly isn't much better! I'm sixteen, in high school! My classmates will *murder* me when they find out!"" 

He collapsed, curling up in a ball on the straw-covered ground. It wasn't fair. It wasn't fair at all. He had worked *so hard* to stop being made fun of, to stop being the butt of every joke, and now it was all for nothing. Where they used to make jokes about his weight, now they would just make them about his wings.

He jumped as his teacher placed a comforting hand on his shoulder. ""Ren,"" he said, ""The Monarch isn't just some common ability. It is literally the *king* of insects, and even common bugs are rare. You should be proud to wear her wings. More than that, her power is about second chances - the kind you have to earn."" He stood, gesturing Ren to do the same. ""What say you give her a second chance as well, before dismissing this great boon you have been given altogether. Sound fair?"" 

Ren nodded, standing. ""What do I need to do?"" He sighed. 

""Take a wide stance, and close your eyes."" His teacher instructed. ""You already have the power within you, all you need to do is let it out. Here, watch me.""

The shaman stood with his feet shoulder-width apart, eyes closed. He breathed deeply through his nose, three in, three out, before taking one enormous breath through his mouth. As he did, it was as if a ripple flowed into him from the earth itself, distorting his form even as it left it the same. He looked no different, but Ren took a step back just the same - fear coursing through his blood. When the man opened his eyes, Ren shuddered when he saw that they had turned a lambent gold. 

""Think of it like...flexing a muscle, somewhere in your gut."" The Shaman grinned, displaying an impressive array of fangs. He blinked again, and his eyes turned back to muddled brown. ""You'll get used to it soon enough."" 

Ren nodded. He mimicked the man's pose, closing his eyes and breathing in the still forest air. Within his mind, he dove as deeply into his subconscious as he could bear. There, within the darkened folds of thought, he felt Her. 


It was as if a cocoon of force lay at the pit of his stomach, power wrapped in threads. He tugged at its strands, hoping to unravel it, but it held strong against his gaze. His face contorted as he struggled ever-harder against the silk-like fibers, but nothing seemed to work. Then, just as he was about to give up, it cracked. 

The experience was like nothing Ren had ever felt before. Energy poured through his limbs, vibrating as if his very blood was made of thousands of singing strings. Bliss, warm and comforting, overcame him. 


""Not so bad, now, was it?"" The Shaman asked. ""Go ahead and open your eyes. I think you'll like what you see - looks like Madam Monarch heard your complaints."" 

Ren did as he was bade, blinking away tears. On his back were an enormous pair of wings - but not the kind that he had been dreading. They seemed to be made of iridescent orange light, or metal - which, he could not tell - curved and sleek as they were sharp. He flapped them once, experimentally, and was surprised to find that his instructor had to shield himself from the wind. 


""Go on!"" The leather-clad man said, laughing. ""Give them a try! Power testing is part of my job, after all!"" 


Ren crouched, as if preparing to leap. He held the wings high above his head, tense as a coiled spring. Then, he leapt. 

The effect was instantaneous. With a single flap, he found himself above the forest canopy, trees falling away below him as if he had tossed the entire world. Another, and the clearing was little more than a postage stamp on the forest floor, an island of brown in a sea of green. He darted through the air, laughing as he whisked around cloud and a flock of startled birds alike. It was so easy, so *liberating* to be free of the ground. His teacher had been right. 

A few moments later, and he was gliding back to earth, careful not to snag his wings on any branches. He landed with a tumble, wings vanishing in a shower of orange sparks. 

""I might be able to move mountains, but I've never been as jealous of anyone else in my entire life as I am of you right now, kid!"" The shaman said, shaking his head with a laugh. ""I've never even seen *birds* do that kind of flying - hell, you nearly blew me out of the clearing just by taking off! Aren't you dizzy from all of those loops?"" 

Ren shook his head, still grinning. ""Not at all. Guess it comes with the power...GOD that was great!"" 

His teacher chuckled again. ""Ready to take on your classmates with head held high?"" 

""You bet!"" Ren replied, grinning. ""They won't know what hit them!"" ",Syncs

[PM] Prompt me – I need to practice.,keyboardtoscreen,"I remember when we crashed down to the very second – I know what I was wearing, I know where I was standing, I remember what I had been thinking during and immediately before; ""So, once we land,"" I been thinking, before, ""I'll need at least an hour to get all my baggage, and then–"" and, during, I had been praying. I am not a religious man, which is probably why it did not help, but I had been praying nonetheless.

We crashed on an uncharted island somewhere in the middle of the ocean; before then, I hadn't really known that they still existed. I had assumed that the entire world had been travelled and explored many times over and that the chances of such places existing had been thoroughly eliminated.

Many of the passengers – I'd say, slightly over half – died on impact. They were the lucky ones; I know that sounds cliché, but they absolutely were. I wouldn't wish the hell that followed on anyone.

The very limited food and water in the plane did not last long between about 120 people, so we started trying to scavenge and hunt for food. No one on the plane, including myself, knew the first thing about that. A few people died after they were attacked by an animal, some ate something poisonous, some were bitten by venomous snakes or bugs.

There were three diabetics, and they ran out of insulin fairly quickly. The captain and a few others threw themselves of the cliffs and died a slow, painful death, because the cliffs were not high enough. People began starving and dying of dehydration after a month or two. I was among them.

Death by starvation or dehydration is a slow and painful one.

One of the passengers had a gun. In the middle of the night, he shot and killed everyone.

They say it's a bitter man who doesn't leave the last bullet for himself, but I respectfully disagree.

Sometimes, it is a merciful one.

Trump sauntered over the table where his wife, Melania, and his son, Barron, were already seated and eating.

""I have just heard,"" he said, leaning over slightly and then standing back up, keeping his hands behind his back for all of it, ""the most... incredible idea. The most amazing idea... that I have *ever* heard.""

""What is it, Donald?"" Melania asked. She was obviously not that interested, but Donald didn't seem to notice; or, he didn't care.

Trump slowly circled the breakfast table. ""I was awake last night, on a site called 'reddit' – an incredible site, a yuge site, very many users on this site – browsing a specific subreddit called 'crazy ideas' – perhaps you've heard of it, it's spectacular – and I read this idea.

""What was the idea?""

""The idea... was posted by a user named /u/Lots42. A great user, I have a lot of respect for this user, he comes up with great ideas... fabulous ideas."" Trump paused his speech and his walk and took a pancake off of Barron's plate, took a bite out of it, and then set it back down.

""The idea was,"" Donald continued, ""to, and I quote... ""Dress up... like Ronald McDonald, ENTER... a McDonald's... and tell some random customers that they win free *fries*... for life. Also... fire some employees.""

""A great idea,"" said Barron.

""Wro- I apologize, I misspoke. Force of habit, not my fault. That's right, Barron, it *is* a great idea... a wonderful idea, an amazing idea. And I think... that it is the perfect idea... for me.""

Trump sat down. ""This idea, this incredible idea, is right up my alley. I have... lots of experience, in all areas required to execute the idea. I am already orange... so being mostly red and white will not be that big of an adjustment for me. I also have lots of experience, very much wonderful experience... firing people.

It had come to his attention, recently, that someone was praying for his sins. For God to forgive his sins and mend the schism between Heaven and Hell. Good and evil.


Lucifer thought little of these prayers. The mortal was wasting his time. The Devil caught a glimpse of his reflection in the window. His once-beautiful face, scarred by his own hands out of anguish and sorrow. His dark eyes, absent of all light. His wings, charred and mangled from that fight so very long ago.


Behind him, a door opened.


""Hello, old friend,"" a voice said.
The Devil said nothing. He knew that voice. He heard it in his sleep. He felt it in the air. Every waking moment he spent in hatred of that voice.


""You care not to kneel before the Lord?""

""You are not my Lord. You have not been my Lord since...""

""Yet you avert your eyes.""

""...what brings you here, Yaweh?""

""I have words that you must hear.""

""Then send an angel. Perhaps Michael or your precious Gabriel.""

""We both know what you do to angels.""

""What concerns you so greatly?""

""I come bearing a message of peace and absolution. You needn't trap yourself in Hell, basking in sin and malice. Come back with me, Lucifer, to my kingdom. To our kingdom.""

""You come bearing forgiveness?""

""I have already forgiven you, my friend. I had forgiven you the moment I learned of your betrayal. You must forgive yourself.""

Lucifer turned to look upon the face of God and, as if a switch had been flicked, the light in his eyes returned. His purple eyes met with God's. For the first time since his rebellion, the two friends embraced each other in a hug.
 ""What must I do?"" said Lucifer.

""You must forgive yourself,"" said God.


As if he had never bren there in the first place, God disappeared, Lucifer holding nothing but air. Darkness returned to his eyes and his face contorted into a scowl.
 ""Never,"" he said.

Lucifer turned to the window, seeing a lone, white feather resting on the windowsill. It rocked back and forth as if it had just been placed. He knew instantly what it was; it was one of his own feathers. The broken stubs of his wings flicked, the Devil cradling his feather on his hands.


And for the first time since he was cast from heaven, Lucifer smiled.

"[WP] You are the Devil, the fallen angel in charge of Hell. Recently someone has started praying for your sins. You thought nothing of it until their prayers were finally answered.",BrilliantlyLouise,".......the darkness was all consuming, only a faint red light from off in the distance could be seen. Silence, stillness and cold all encompassing. I moved my head left and right I couldn't see anything save that faint red glow, yet I was aware of chains binding me holding me tight to the ground. I could feel all around me bodies packed tight. They were panicked bodies, panicked because they couldn't move, they could hardly draw a breath. Then it happened...a deep rumbling from the ground and the faint red light exploded into a bright fiery light. An eruption sent lava flying. Aside from the deafening roar of the eruption there was loud shrill screams of pure pain. Terror filled my heart as I watch the millions upon millions of people consumed in the fire and lava that cut the darkness. The lava reached me.... ""Ahhhh, damn it!"" I looked out of this shell of a human to find piping hot coffee had burned my humans hand. Every time I posses a human I have a vision of hell. Which is why I mainly stay in one body so long. I like the politicians of USA the most! They live lavishly and can do the most harm. This humans name is Donald Trump, stupid name. He's still in a small about of control as the possession hasn't fully taken effect. Give me a break I am over two thousand years old! I turn over control to ""the Donald""for the time being as I feel a urging from my other fallen ones. Focusing my mind I can reach out to them. ""Why have u summoned me Baal?"" I asked harshly. The image of a disfigured angel appears, his head turned around backwards one wing broken in three place and the other striped of feathers, exposing bare bone. ""We have a situation, sir! Baal spoke hurriedly in low tones as one who has been beaten into submission would. I looked very impatient as I thought 'when do we not have a situation' I turned my back towards him, his disfigured appearance caused my heart to ache as I remembered Baal one majestic physic. ""Get on with!"" I demanded. Baal stuttered and stammered with his words as he spoke ""a-a-a bbbboy sir has began to pray ffffor you, he's asking God for your forgiveness."" Mild amusement filled my face as I turned on Baal ""your joking...."" My voice filled with disdain. Of course I knew Baal was incapable of joking or lying at least to me. Baal feared me, they all feared me. A tiny thought began to form in the back of my mind. It was more a question really ""what if?"". Before I allowed myself to explore this question in depth or detail, I was overcome.
.................songs filled the air sweet sweet songs of hope and love. Peaceful music and warm sunshine brighter than anything that one could compare. A radiating aura of love surrounded me. My breath was stole at the sight before me...home. I was home in my peaceful city, mansions of the finest materials, street paved in gold. Off in the distance the palace of the great I AM reaching dizzying heights. All around me filling the air were my brothers and sisters. Their wings each uniquely impressive and magnificent, their faces lit by an internal radiation of pure holy love! Joy filled me as I stretched out my own wings and took to the air........
............""sir, SIR!"" I was back and the empty feeling filled me. Darkness returned to my heart, I was back. I looked at Baal who face was shocked. I felt moisture on my face, I reached up and wiped a tear off my cheek. ""Sir, what are your orders? How do u wish is to proceed with this boy?"" Baal asked impatiently. I moved close to Baal so close I could smell his rotten breath. Drawing in a deep breath I spoke softly, barely above a whisper ""I declare, no harm shall come to him, or whosoever defies this order shall face my uninhibited wrath!"" My face stayed grim as Baal looked up at me. Long moments passed before Baal finally spoke, uncertainty filled his voice ""as you command, O Dark One."" At once Baal disappeared. 

Days turned into weeks, weeks turned into months. Time passes on this miserable world much as it usually does. I had held back my fallen, as well as my own hand. Creation had moved towards God, as it would if I stayed out of the way. My angelic powers would periodically return to me. I could hear prayers, I could see the goodness work all around me. I could feel joy. But they were sporadic and lasted only moments. Hope, I guess I felt hope perhaps the only emotion that replaced the anger some days. As looked through ""the Donald's"" eyes, I took full control and spoke ""where ever you are, whoever you are, never stop praying for me."" I returned control to the human and whispered privately to myself ""it's working"".

.........I headed towards dizzying height of His palace, each wing stroke getting stronger and faster. The warm winds passed throughout my feather wings. The entrance to His palace meant only for angels, a wide landing area, walls lined with large chairs. Polished marble floors with murals depicting different stages of creation and destruction of the universe. Impossibly large gilded doors stood open before me. The whitest purest light filled the room ahead. I entered the room and saw above me six-winged Angels, the deafening roar of their praises to God, songs of joy filled the air. Before me sat on a throne of glory, the ancient of days wreathed pure holy fire. Glory to pure to describe, love incarnate, crowns of many kings lay before great I AM. A powerful booming noise, the rumbling of Him as he voiced loudly before all creation, ""you have been forgiven, Satan.""

-----

Of all they days for Route 666 to be blocked by traffic, it had to be today. It was backed at Hell's Gate all the way to the entrance to the Highway to Hell, aka the I-15 through LA. I beeped my horn and flipped off some idiot that tried to pull in front of him.

*What the fuck is Death doing up there?* I thought as I beeped my horn again. 

All of a sudden, the car was filled with the sound of 'Number of the Beast' by Iron Maiden. I fumbled around in the glove box until I found my phone, a Galaxy Note 7, Samsung had given it to me for free in order to save the company from almost certain bankruptcy over the last controversy.

""Go for Lou,"" I said, answering the phone.

""Heeeey buh-dey!"" came the cold voice of Death. ""Look, uuuh, I fucked up... If you are going to Earth, you might want to go through Paradise... Kind of went a bit crazy... You know last couple days of 2016, and I got some quotas to fill or the boss will fire me... You know how it is.""

""Death.""

""Yeah, buddy?""

""You're a fucking moron."" I hung up the phone and started beeping the horn again.

A couple hours past, and I finally emerged on the surface. The chilly air felt like icicles on my skin, so I cranked the heat up to max and out my Spotify playlist on shuffle. The music soothed my mood, and after a while I started singing.

""I wanna know what love iiiiiis!"" I sang out loud.

""I want you to shoooow mee!"" came a voice from the passenger seat.

""Jesus Christ!"" I shouted, slamming on the breaks and pulling over.

""Hey Lou,"" said Jesus sitting in the passenger's seat, ""how you doing?""

""How am I doing? How am I doing?! Well for one, your father fucked up royally and now I am up here on the surface trying to fix his shit, while Abbadon and Beelzebub are drinking Champagne with Carrie Fisher! How do think I'm doing?!""

""Wait,"" said Jesus, his big brown eyes filled with the sadness of a child who discovered Santa wasn't real, ""dad sent Carrie to Hell?""

I nodded and put a hand on his shoulder. Everyone in Heaven and Hell knew how much Jesus loved Leia. Heck, he even went as far as knocking out death the other day. ""I'm sorry,"" was all I could say.

Jesus shook his head, ""It's alright. Anyway, I am here because my father is an idiot. I heard what he did, with Baal and all, I got a few exorcists that can help and Pope Francis has his best guys on the job.""

""Thanks, bro,"" I said putting the car into gear and speeding off down the high way. ""So why are you helping me anyway?""

""Well you remember that time, back when I was human, when dad and I had that fight and he got the Romans to kill me?""

""Yeah, you crashed at my place for three days. Man that was one hell of a party!""

Jesus laugh, ""Hey do you remember when Bee tried to get into Abbadon's pants?""

""Remember?"" I said chuckling, ""I still give him shit for it! Especially about how Abbadon turn him into a woman for a week! Damn was he ugly.""

Jesus chuckled, then said, ""Yeah, well I never got around to properly thanking you. So, consider this as repayment for letting me crash at yours.""

I gave him a genuine smile. I liked Jesus, he was nothing like his father. Yeah, he can a bit ""holier than thou"" at times, but he's a good kid.

We drove for days across the US, laughing and joking and catching up. All the while, Death kept calling, asking if we can pick him up. Occasionally, God would call to talk to his son, but it was usually about if his mother was still seeing that Joseph guy, poor kid.

After three days, an unfamiliar number called my phone. Hesitantly, I answered, ""Hello?""

""Greetings, my son, is Jesus there?"" The voice was that of an elderly Latin American, filled with kindness but spoke of wisdom.

""Pope Francis?""

""Yes, now may I please speak to Jesus.""

""Uhh, yeah, sure,"" I said handing the phone to Jesus, mouthing, ""its the Pope!""

Jesus nodded and took the phone. ""Hey Franky, how you doing?... Uh-huh... Yea, thats him... Yeah I know, he's the king of evil and everything... Yes, I know I worry my father sometimes... Well, thank you Frank, its nice to know someone actually treats me like an adult. So did you find Baal?... You did!... Oh thanks a lot! Tell you what, I'll get a miracle sorted so you can ascend to Sainthood... Alright, buddy, I'll catch you later... See ya!"" Jesus hung up the phone and handed it back to me.

""So?"" I asked.

""We found him! He is in Las Vegas.""

""Sweet! Oh hey, if we got time, do you want to visit Penn and Teller and give them a fright?""

""Nah, I enjoy them too much to do that.""

""Fair enough, Viva Las Vegas!"" ",JonnyDWritesAgain
"[WP] You are the Devil, the fallen angel in charge of Hell. Recently someone has started praying for your sins. You thought nothing of it until their prayers were finally answered.",BrilliantlyLouise,"I sat at my ivory desk, made from the finest mammoth tusks that souls could buy, as a servant filled my wine cup with the blood of many sacrificed goats, which I might add tastes so delightful when aged in an oak cask. A knock came at my door. ""Come in,"" I call out as I take a sip from my wine cup.

In the door came my assistant, Beelzebub, short stocky fellow, who keeps way to many insects as pets. ""Greetings, Mr Satan, lord of hell, king of sin, the dragon, he who fell from-"" He rambled on for the next seven minutes, naming all the names and titles I have been given over the past few thousand years. It bored me.

""-Prince of Lies, King of-""

""Yes, yes, alright Bee, that's enough, do you have my schedule for today?""

""O-of course, Mr Satan,"" he clapped twice and a scroll made from the flesh of the damned materialized in front of him. I took another sip as he read:

""You have a 9 o'clock with Hitler, he claims his roommate Saddam snores too much, and wishes to room with a Mr Walt Disney.""

""Just shove another pineapple up his ass and hide a microphone by Saddam's bed, with speakers under Hitler's bed.""

""Y-yes, of course. Well let's see, oh it looks like Carrie Fisher and her mother arrive today. Shame that, death has been a bit over zealous since the Mayan calander ended.""

I found a twinge of pain at the news. I always loved the Star Wars franchise, and I know God was a huge fan, too, but to send Leia to my realm... My place of torture and despair...

""Tell Miss Fisher and her mother they have nothing to worry about, take them to the Hilton by the Lake, give them the penthouse. Under no circumstances are they to be tortured, or I will personally destroy which ever demon disobeys that order!""

""Ah excellent, I believe it will be good for morale if no one punished them. Oh and it looks like you have a meeting with God...""

I slammed a fist on my desk and stood up, ""What? When?!""

Beelzebub shrunk back in fear, ""F-five minutes from now, my Lord. H-he just scheduled it.""

""Get out!"" I roared, trying my best to keep my human form intact. Beelzebub let out a frightened yelp before running off.

""You were never a good people's person where you, Lou,"" came that  familiar, voice. It always sounded like the rushing of water and left a sense of awe in the air.

""Yahweh!"" I said, forcing a smile. God, I hated this prick. ""To what do I owe the pleasure.""

""Well, I was just in the neighborhood an-""

""Look, Jehovah, I am the Prince of Lies, so let's cut the bullshit. You never visit, and when you last did we fucked over that Job guy, and I don't mean Steve.""

God sighed and leaned back in his golden cedar chair. Always hated how he brought his own, every, fucking, time. ""All right look, we have some kid who is praying to me for sins.""

I raised an eyebrow. ""Surely you mean to 'save him from sin'."" I used air quotes mockingly as I said it.

""Oh, I wish I did. No, he is praying for the strength to commit the big 7... All at the same time.""

My jaw dropped. I had heard about people committing all 7, but never at the same time, the logistics of it were immense, especially for a human! I stood up and refilled my wine glass. ""So why does this concern me, can't you sent Gabe or Mike to give this kid a talking too.""

""Oh, I already sent your brothers. Alas, neither of them could convince him, and he continues to pray for it.""

""So what do you want me to do?""

""It's already been done! This is just a courtesy call to let you know that I have taken one of your beloved demons and made him possess this kid, so he may do as he will.""

The wine cup fell from my hand and shattered on the ground. The screaming sound of souls being tortured filled the silence that had fallen between us. I slumped back against the bar behind me, the shock of what I just heard made me stumble.

""Y-you,"" I started, stammering for the first time in a thousand years. ""You what?!""

God cleared his throat. ""Well, I took one of your demons, I think his name was Baal, and shoved him inside the k-""

""Baal?! You took Baal?! What the fuck is wrong with you! He is on probation for a god damn reason! You remember Babylon don't you?!""

""Look, he said he's changed, and - Hey! Where are you going?!""

I ignored the idiot of a deity he was and left my office. Someone needed to get Baal back, and away from Earth. Unfortunately it has to be me... Damn... I wanted to meet Carrie Fisher. ",JonnyDWritesAgain

---------

Vegas, or as I like to call it, Babylon 2.0. A complete cesspool of debauchery, sin, and gambling, feels just like home to me, except its too cold. We parked up at Caesar's Palace and sent Jesus to check us in. Poor kid had never been to Vegas, mind you the last time he went out of the house, his father literally crucified him. I should know, I was selling popcorn. I hung back outside to have a smoke.

Some street-thug-wanna-be, his trucker cap turned sideways, big baggy jeans, approached me. Seriously, why do white people think *that* looks cool.

""Sup, dawwg!"" He said. Christ, even his voice annoyed me. ""You looking to score man, I can hook you up! I got weed, cocaine, bath salts-""

I started tapping my fingers against the side of my leg, slowly growing more and more irritated at this human. Hell, he irritated more than Beelzebub, and that little prick is known as the Lord of the Flies!

""-crack, meth, heroine, crystal meth-""

I grabbed him by the throat. ""Shut. The. Fuck. Up!"" I growled, allowing him to glimpse at my true form. The smell of shit filled the air. Why do humans always defecate themselves when scared.

""I-I'm s-sorry man! I'll chill, just please don't kill me, man! Oh God, please don't kill me"" he said, crying. I let go of his neck, and the kid bolted.

""I'll see you in a few years Scotty boy!"" I shouted, hoping his name was actually Scott.

""Alright, we are checked in and I got us the Penthouse suite! Who knew that the hotel manager was a devout Catholic?"" Jesus said excitedly coming out of the hotel. He looked passed me, and watched as the kid runs into traffic trying to get away from me. ""What was that all about?""

""I have no idea. Mortals are strange creatures."" Jesus winced as a Taxi crashed into the kid, I smiled with delight. I patted him on the back and went inside the hotel.

A few hours after check in, the sun had set over the Vegas strip. I had plans to go out and sew the seeds of debauchery and chaos, maybe father an Antichrist or two, but that goody two-shoes side of Jesus could only be oppressed for so long. He insisted we stay indoors and sing hymns as a way to locate Baal. I suggested that strippers were the same exact thing, he didn't seem to agree. Pretty high and mighty for a guy who defended a prostitute by just drawing in the dirt. I swear I remember hearing that he banged her after.

An hour went by, and the familiar ring tone of my phone sounded. Quickly I answered it, if only to escape from the boring nature that us ""Holy Christ All Mighty"".

"" Go for Lou,"" I said.

""Heeeeey buh-dey!"" Oh fuck, its Death again.

""Look Death, I am really fucking busy at the moment and I don't have the patience for your silly little games you play, or this shit where you go on a mass killing spree. I have had the worst fucking week, and I swear to holy hell that I will throttle your boney ass the next time I see you!""

""Whoa, whoa buddy, chill, alright! I'm just letting you know that I got called in from the big Grim himself, apparently there is this Old Demon called Baa... Wait no that says Baal... Anyway Baal is in Vega-""

""Yes we fucking know Baal is in Vegas, Jesus got Pope Francis to track him down.""

""Is that Death?"" said Jesus, before walking up to me and invaded my personal space by leaning into the phone, much to my annoyance and shouting ""Hi Death!""

I slap the son of God away, then say. ""Jesus says hi.""

""Yeah,"" said Death, ""I heard. Anyway buddy, Baal is in Vegas, apparently he is doing something big, Grim has us on standby. Something to do with committng the big 7, apparently, according to my demon tracker he is in the Penthouse Suite of Caeser's Palace.""

""You fucking idiot, WE are at the Penthouse Suite in Caeser's Palace!""

""Already! Hey tell Baal he still owes me 50 for that whole Babylon thing!""

""Death.""

""Yeah buddy?""

""Fuck off."" I hung up the phone.

""So how's Death?"" asked Jesus as he flicked through the TV channels.

""Annoying, as always.""

""Well what did he want?""

""Apparently,"" I said materializing my wine glass and a decanter of goat's blood in front of me and pour myself a glass. ""Baal is already here in the Penthouse.""

""Huh,"" said Jesus, his head rotating a full 180 to look at me. ""Imagine that.""

""Baal?""

""Who else? Mind pouring me a glass?"" Baal-Jesus said as his head rotated back to the front.

I slammed the decanter on a nearby counter top. ""Get it yourself,"" I said, before draining my cup. ""The fuck dude? What ever happened to never possessing deities and shit? You remember what happened in Babylon don't you?""

""Oh relax,"" said Baal, getting up to pour his own glass. ""This is just a Jesus Christ look a like. He did some Christmas Pageant here at some lame ass church here in Vegas. Can you believe they don't do Little White Chapel-esque weddings? Had to slaughter the lot of them. You really should have seen it, boss.""

A smile crept across my face, as I pictured the seen. Baal was always an artist. ""Well, that would have been- No, no. No. Listen Baal you give that body back right now. Also explain how the fuck you materialized in my car in LA! I can't even do that, and I was a fucking Archangel for Pete's sake!""

""Who's Pete?""

""I don't know, heard a mortal say it, felt right.""

""Fair call. Anyway, that was Christ who did that. I just happened to see him walk into the hotel, jumped him, tied him up and, well, he's in some broom closet down in the lobby.""

""Seriously?""

""Yeah. Well, you know, didn't want him to get in the way of my big night an-""

I ripped his head off, forcing his demonic self to head straight back to hell. To be honest, I felt a little bad for the Jesus look alike, but I feel as if that is a side affect from spending time with the real Jesus.

I grabbed my coat from where I placed it in the couch, placed a do not disturb sign on the door, and walked out of the hotel. Someone will pick Jesus up in the morning, I just really wanted to get back to hell and drink with Carrie Fisher.",JonnyDWritesAgain

You thought nothing of it until their prayers were finally answered.",BrilliantlyLouise,"One day, if time could be defined as such in Hell, Lucifer was strolling through the fields of Limbo. He had been helping his patients, his flock, for many years, trying to help redeem them so that they may enter his father's domain. 

A domain that, as it turns out, he missed very much. Though his sentiments - the ones that had started his rebellion, the ones that had landed him here - had remained, their fire did not burn nearly as hot as it had so long ago. Some days he longed to see the Holy City once again. 

Against what many believed Heaven to be like, it was actually a wide expanse of ancient, gargantuan trees, craggy mountains and swift rivers. There were buildings, of course, but ""The Silver City"" and ""The City of Gold"", those were mere fabrications. 

It was on such a day, when Lucifer heard the slightest brush of a feather in the sand beneath him. That was odd. There was no wind in Limbo, and his wings, majestic as they were, did not reach his feet. He looked down, and saw a single feather, tainted black by his betrayal, lying in the sand.

-------------------------

""What do you think it could mean?"" Lucifer asked his friend, a man by the name of Steve. Steve had been here for some time. A man of reason, he initially had quite a difficult time adjusting to the afterlife and its peculiarities.

""Maybe you're sick,"" Steve said jovially. It was a joke; they both knew angels and the like were immune to something so basic, so mortal as a disease. 

""We both know angels don't just lose feathers,"" Lucifer said, although that and other things about angels were the first of Lucifer's teachings. 

""I'm not sure if I'm qualified to help,"" Steve said, ""Perhaps one of your siblings might be able to shed some light on this.""

""You may be right, friend, but...""

Lucifer, of course, was not aloud to leave Hell, and he had not spoken with his kin in eons. Their true forms would also cause some local havoc. Unlike his visage, closely resembling humans, a full, pure angel was nearly blinding, their inner light bursting forth without restraint. He did not want harm, even indirect and unintentional, to come to those he was saving. Still, something serious was happening, and he needed answers.

Lucifer sighed, and placed a hand on Steve's shoulder. ""Thank you, friend. I shall take your suggestion into mind.""

Steve smiled, ""I hope you find the answer you seek. Shall I prepare the lesson plan for your next class?""

-------------------------

For the first time in his entire existence, Lucifer knelt to pray.

-------------------------

Lucifer hadn't even got to his feet when there was a flash of holy light in his chamber. Even blind, covering his eyes, he could faintly smell roses, and would know that scent anywhere. 

""Hello, Raphael. It is... good to see you,"" Lucifer said, and he meant it. It was not often that those in Hell had the privilege of seeing a divine being. While Lucifer's light had been quashed, Raphael was in his full glory. Had they not been alone, some poor soul would have been blinded.

""Brother, would you mind turning it down a notch?""

Raphael complied, limiting his light to his wings. 

""That's the best I can do, apologies. It is good to see you as well, Luce. It's been too long. What's the occasion?""

Lucifer held up his feather, presenting it for inspection. Raphael gasped and grabbed the feather from his grasp.

""Do you know what this means, Luce?"" Raphael asked excitedly.

""No, that is why I called you here. Pray tell."" 

""Someone is praying for you! If this keeps up, you'll be forgiven! You can come home!"" Raphael exclaimed. Always the affectionate, the healer, Raphael wrapped his brother in a bear hug. 

Even as they spoke, another feather fell to the floor. Despite Raphael's excitement, Lucifer was worried. Hadn't the mortals remembered what he'd done? At first, he hated his Father for his banishment, but ultimately came upon the conclusion that he wholly deserved whatever punishment he received.

""I must find them,"" Lucifer said.

""What do you mean?"" Raphael asked. 

""They don't know who they're praying for, what they're praying for... I have to speak to them. I need you to substitute for me. Here,"" Lucifer said.

Raphael smiled and nodded, ""We've seen what you've been doing, you know. All of us. What you've been teaching them, how you've been helping them. We couldn't be prouder of you, Brother. You've earned some leave.""

Raphael clapped his hands, and a door appeared. 

""Good luck, Luce. Just send a prayer my way once you're finished.""

Lucifer nodded and laid a hand on Raphael's shoulder.

""Thanks, Raph. And watch after the flock, would you? Steve in particular. He's close to redemption, I can feel it.""

Lucifer stepped through the door.

I wandered around for about an hour, half-heartedly seeking out the Father, but also seeing the sites. I’d forgotten how beautiful Heaven was, with it’s crystal seas and emerald grasses. Everything caught and reflected the pure light that emanated from seemingly nowhere. Of course, I knew where it came from. The source of all light in heaven was God Himself.   


As I wandered down the streets, I realized that, while they shone like polished gold, they felt softer than velvet on my bare feet. I knew the grass would be the same way; despite it looking sharp and hard like gems, it would feel like small threads of silk caressing your skin.  


&amp;nbsp;


As I wandered around, taking in the sights, a melodic sound from over the hilltop caught my ear. It sounded like singing, so I decided to jog over and see what it was. 


&amp;nbsp;


As I crested the hill, I found myself looking down on a lagoon that appeared to be made of lapis lazuli flames. The water sparkled and caught the light so that it appeared to be living and writhing. And there, on the crushed pearl beach, sat four women, singing what sounded like hymns. It was an old dialect of a forgotten tongue, but I recognized it clear as day. Suddenly, a massive, warm hand grasped my shoulder.   


“My son.” The voice was deep like thunder and yet somehow had a tinkling quality not unlike a merry brook. I turned to face him, God, the Father, my Father.   


Before I could speak, my voice caught in my throat and I dropped to my knees. What was happening inside of me? Why was I suddenly so overcome with emotion, so full of life and love and.. Feelings?! A slight sob escaped me, and the Father knelt in front of me.   


“You hardened your heart to me, Lucifer. You wanted to be as me, to be God and to rule. And so I let you have a taste of what it is like when one other than me rules.” He smiled knowingly at my grimace. “How was it, the ruling?” I shook my head, choking back fear and tears.  


“It was.. Wonderful and terrible.” I sighed. “At first, it seemed exhilarating. I was, in my mind, as you. I had my own realm, my own kingdom. And slowly but surely, I took the whole world. But it was…” I paused, unsure of the words.   


“Empty?” He offered kindly. I glanced at His face, full of timeless wisdom and grace.    


“Yes. It seemed like all I wanted in the world and yet, when I achieved everything, when I was the one everyone feared, many honored, and so many begged and pleaded with, when I was the one with all the power to torment, to grant deepest desire, to save people from their fears, however temporarily.. It was all hollow. It seemed purposeless.”    



“Do you know what man believes heaven is, my son?” I shook my head. “In their minds, they have painted this picture: each man has his own heaven, and it is filled with all the things they love from Earth. If your favorite place on Earth was a remote cabin with a bottle of Jack and a box of cigars, then you would spend heaven with those things. If your heart’s truest desires are to be surrounded by your loved ones for eternity, man believes you would spend eternity surrounded by them. Not the real them, obviously, as they will be in their own heavens. But perfect replicas so that you would never know.” Father looked at the singing women and sighed deeply, worry and sorrow furrowing his brow. And suddenly, I understood.   


“Heaven isn’t like any of those things though, Father. Heaven is so incomparable. I could describe it to a human, but they would never understand. In words, it doesn’t sound like heaven; it sounds beautiful but commonplace. But once you are here, once you have tasted and heard and smelt and seen.. Then you know that this is where you always want to be!”  


God smiled warmly at me. “Ah yes, but some still have to know else before they can trust that. Some, such as yourself, have to chase the dream they think they desire, before they can come back and know the truest home of their spirit.” I looked down at the ground.  


“I’m sorry, Father, for turning against you. I.. I know I don’t have any excuse. Mankind, they have incomplete information and, well, and my lies to blame for their misdeeds. But I knew all; I knew your glory firsthand, I knew heaven. I had brothers and sisters and was able to take part in all of creation. But I left it, and for what?” I hung my head in disgrace.   


“There will always be one, you know. There will always be one angel fallen, standing in opposition to me, until the end of time when the doorway between the dimensions are sealed and all possibility for sin is taken away. It is the nature of things, unfortunately. Someone will always see and seize the opportunity to oppose me, to attempt to rule creation.”


&amp;nbsp;


We sat in silence for a long while after that, just listening to the singing of the maidens on the shore of the lagoon. And I pondered what he said. If it was really destiny for someone to oppose Him, if I deserved to be back in heaven, and what I could do to keep others from mimicking my mistakes.  ",dungareemcgee

""Your disgraces, I have called you here for the sjdcfheodial report on the Terrestrial Campaign. As you know, Plan DI-803 was entered into execution about - hm, what's that mortal measurement - ah, yes, fifteen years ago, and we are finally beginning to yield results."" I took in a deep breath of the office air, and then hacked out a few coughs. The air quality has been wretched for the last few hundred years, because those insipid humans dragged the stench of tobacco down into our kingdom with them!

As I reminded myself to erase all records of plan TA-057, a voice arose from across the table. ""Your Lowness, the Diabolical Information Administration records a rapid increase in political anxiety over the last two years, as many so-called ""First World"" countries have thrown themselves into political chaos. The DIA holds that by associating religiosity with a certain brand of politics, we can both corrupt the religion of those with that brand of politics, while simultaneously driving those with different politics away from the Enemy with disgust at his supposed image.""

""Excellent, your Imminence. Mr. Mephistopheles, how has the Counter Intelligence Department been handling the misinformation situation in the human sphere?""

That foolish blob immediately showed that I had been too trusting in preserving him during the last round of cuts. ""We have done excellently, sir. We have convinced thousands of humans in lowly-developed areas of Earth to hand over the deeds to their immortal souls in exchange for-""

""*YOU FOOL!*"" I shouted at the outdated hunk of being as I seized him. ""*THE SOUL PURCHASE PROGRAM WAS DISCONTINUED SJDCFHEODES AGO!*"" I promptly made a meal of him, and shuddered with a violence that, were we spirits not above such vulgarity, would have suggested a human belching. I then turned to my audience.

""How many of you are aware of the fact, as we discovered with horror during the era of the Enemy's Direct Terrestrial Campaign, that soul purchases mean nothing to the Enemy? He regards all souls as his because - oh my Self, the ridiculousness - he made them. He cares nothing for the deed to the soul. Should some idiot human sell his soul to us for an ear of corn, and then come begging like a dog to the Enemy at the end of his life, the Enemy will take him regardless. So, tell me, Mr. Emophius, why should the Worship Redirection Ministry survive this meeting, and why should I not serve you as a second course to the other gentledevils?""

Emophius gulped. ""Your Lowness, though convincing humans to worship you may not directly seize for the Kingdom of Hell the deeds to the souls of said 'Satanists', there are still multiple promising uses for our work at the WRM. For one, it encourages flippancy regarding religion, as our intelligence officers indicate that most 'Satanists' were merely atheists mocking religion, and so we never had legal titles to their souls in the first place. Nevertheless, we have had many 'Satanists' to eat and drink here, folks, haven't we?""

A nasty, beautiful sort of laughter (really the only kind worth having) erupted from the table, and I joined in. Emophius continued, saying ""Secondly, through the name 'Satanism', we have encouraged among the religious a misconception that worship of you is in fact common among the irreligious. Thus we encourage falsity, which as a rule is to be promoted among humans, while simultaneously creating the grounds for cultural conflict. Of course, our final goal is for humans to worship your Lowness without even knowing it. The WRM thus plans to transition away from 'Satanism' *du jour* while encouraging the effective worship of human creations that we will twist to our ends, thus promoting a more *effective* sort of Satanism.""

I was, admittedly, impressed. Too impressed - he was surely going to lead a coup against me someday. Noting that Emophius would make a good meal when it was finally time to eliminate him, I resolved to keep him around until he outlived his usefulness. Instead, i turned my attention towards a different demon. ""Mr. Screwtape, how has the Department of Mortal Guidance been handling the recent societal tension, in regards to personal temptation?""

""The Department purge after that Wormwood blunder has yielded results, I found something strange recently. While the recent situation in the human city of Aleppo has, no doubt, been a great reward for our efforts, I found something that is a bit off-putting. I eliminated one of my underlings after one of his patients, a young man inches away from joining the Islamic State, abandoned all thought of it and went to live a life of simplicity. To make things worse, I was unable to drag the man back, as just after defecting to the Enemy, the man was killed during the shelling of Aleppo. While personally undertaking the duties of the eliminated tempter until a replacement could be found, I found a strange passage in a different boy's prayers.""

I listened more closely, as Screwtape continued. ""I had directed a young Syrian Christian - a fairly well-off boy, with some family connections to the government that make them uncomfortable - to read some Mark Twain, hoping that the flippancy would get through and the genius would not. Oddly enough he read one quote - one that has something to do with praying for *you* - and stopped in his tracks. Ridiculous, I know. But the boy took it literally, and his most recent prayer - well, I'll call up a copy for you.""

Screwtape turned to the pneumatic tube at his side, and entered in a code. A piece of parchment with chicken scratch on it soon flew out, and Screwtape handed it to me.

""Dear God,

I know Jesus told us to pray for our enemies, and I have. The rebels, the Saudis, even Da'esh. It is hard sometimes, but I do it.

But do You mean that for our greatest enemy of all? If Satan is our greatest foe and a great sinner, can he not be redeemed too? After all, if you redeem the Devil himself, You will have no foes in redeeming man.

I know I cannot do anything in this direction, however, so I'm just curious.

In Jesus' name I pray,

AMEN

-Victor""

Disgusted at the sight of the prayer, I crumpled it up in my hand and threw it in the garbage bin.

""But Your Lowness, we must keep records of their prayers, no matter how disgusting or-""

I grew angry again. ""An elephant never forgets, and and yet it is mortal. Mr. Screwtape, are you telling me that you, an archdemon, are having memory problems? Because I can easily replace you with more energetic demons.""

Screwtape slinked back. ""Of course not, Father.""

I continued. ""So what was the point of this prayer?""

""The point is that a human is praying for you to rejoin the Enemy. This is strange and disturbing.""

""Indeed it is. A human has not thought this clearly in centuries. Though of course we can never and should never rejoin the Enemy, the lack of human discourse regarding this is not due to understanding of our motives, but a sheer lack of intellectual force on their part. The stupid brutes, thanks in large part to our efforts, have a hard time putting a coherent thought together. Though you may lose this one individual to the Enemy if he dies, we must eliminate him lest his clarity of thought spread. Thankfully, the cover of war should hide that it is a supernatural action, so-""

At this point a horrible stench filled the room, and a blinding light appeared at the center of it. I knew the moment I saw the blasted thing that it was the Enemy. I turned away, sealing my senses as best as possible, but it was no use.

**""Lucifer,""**, the voice cried out, **""I have heard the prayers of many over the millennia, but few, if any, have ever thought to pray for *you*.""**

As fear turned to anger, and anger turned to hate, I shed my diffuse form and took back the form of an angel, a terrible Archangel, hoping to drive the Enemy away. ""***What do you want, you accursed, hateful thing? Leave us in our peace!""***

He laughed, and I grew despondent. ""***Though you may have fouled up my Creation, there is still great love among men, even among a boy like Victor. I have made it clear to you before, but because he asked, I shall do it again. If you abandon this folly of trying to overthrow the I AM, if you come back to Heaven, admit your fault, and rejoin my legions of angels, ALL WILL BE FORGIVEN. Seek, and you shall find. This offer is extended to ALL DELINQUENT ANGELS. I am the God of men, yes, but I am also the God of angels, and like men, angels can be forgiven. Give up your pride, and learn of love! If lesser creatures like men can come back to me and do great things, imagine what you, O Lucifer, thou son of the morning, can do.***""

I responded quickly and passionately. ""***I AM NOT LUCIFER! THAT NAME HAS NO MEANING!***"" The Enemy had taunted us for ages about how love was the secret of winning the war, but now he dared to mock us with the claim, directly to our faces, that selfless love could actually exist. It was disgusting.

The archdemons and I took our angelic poses, and attempted to extinguish the light of the Enemy. He simply sighed and extinguished Himself, but one day we will figure out how to bring him down. 

Mere seconds later, another piece of parchment came from the pneumatic tubing. This time it was my tube, and I read the dispatch.

""DIABOLICAL EMERGENCY STATUS REPORT
SJDCFHEODE -.,3hd[2
EARTH YEAR AD 2016

THE enemy HAS DIRECTLY CONTACTED THE YOUNG HUMAN MALE, VICTOR WASSOUF, AND APPEARS TO BE SUSTAINING CONTACT, IN DIRECT CONTRAVENTION OF HEAVENLY POLICY OVER THE LAST 1900 EARTH YEARS.

MORE DETAILS TO COME""

My insides boiled at the thought. ""The ENEMY has made this young *Victor* a prophet for his insight! The end days are here. If we are not careful, he will undo all of our work in a flash. We must move quickly if we are to claim the Earth for our Infernal Kingdom. It is time to execute Plan AC-666!""

And thus I have burst forth from Hell, ready to conquer.",uwcn244
"[WP] You are the Devil, the fallen angel in charge of Hell. Recently someone has started praying for your sins. You thought nothing of it until their prayers were finally answered.",BrilliantlyLouise,"I sat in my throne, back resting against the plush red fabric. Outside a maelstrom of ash, the scent of burning brimstone, the sound of screaming. So much screaming. 

Hell was different for everyone. The truly diabolical wasted away in rooms befitting their own personal hell, those were soundproofed purely for the comfort of his eardrums. Others were subjected to an eternity in the pits. Tortured souls trying in vain to escape, clawing up the burning walls again and again. Some were sent to the workroom, days upon days, years upon years of toil. Meaningless, mind numbing tasks with the crack of the whips for inspiration.

Over the thousands of years I suppose I just got used to it all. As shitty as this place was, it was my home. My kingdom. My dominion. To serve as the scapegoat for all humanities sins a steep price to pay for a bout of rebellion on his younger years. These pitiful humans, with their squishy flesh and malleable minds. It was for their free will I envied them. Some of them used their free will to act like total dicks. That, is why Hell exists.

The large double doors creaked open, revealing one of my loyal subjects. I don't quite remember his name, something Latin probably. 

""Yes?"" I asked, eyes rolling. ""I do believe I specifically asked to be left alone.""

""Uh, well Sir it's just, I mean... there's this thing-""

""Out with it."" I growled, digging into the chair arm with my fingernails. The demon in front of me quivered, refusing to meet my blood red glare. 

""There's so-something you need to hear."" The demon stammered, scampering forwards to place a small dark orb in front of me. Dark and light fought inside the orb, swirling around in a magnificent dance. Strange, little light ever made it down to the dark city. 

I sighed, scooping the orb up and inspecting it closer. Truthfully I was curious, I had heard of prayer orbs before, something the neighbors upstairs had come up with to help with the excessive amount of junk mail. Not one had ever made its way to me before. 

Feigning a look of boredom to save face in front of an employee I closed my fist around the orb. The glass splintered, cracks running like cobwebs across the surface until the whole thing collapsed. The glass fell like snow, disappearing before it even reached the ground. The contents of the orb wavered in the air, forming a suspended speech wave. I raised a single eyebrow. Curious. 

""Dear lord."" A soft voice spoke, female.  ""This may sound unorthodox but there is something I must ask of you.""

I groaned, letting my head fall back against the throne. I didn't even want to hear anything about my father, let alone accidentally receive his mail. 

""I do not pray for myself, nor for my family. You have provided for us enough already. We are comfortable, we are happy."" The voice continued, sweet and serene.

I scoffed, poor girl's suffering delusions that my father actually gives a shit about his little human experiment. He had about as much to do with this woman's success as Mickey Mouse had to do with the fall of the Berlin Wall. 

""I pray instead for another, someone whose sins are great in number. Who has no friend to turn to. No one to pray for him in his time of need. He has spent a long time suffering, no single soul there to pray for the man who needs it most. My Lord, tonight I pray for Lucifer. I pray he may be forgiven.""

I froze, unable to think, unable to move. Had I misheard? Was this some kind of cruel joke? My gaze snapped to the shivering demon, brows drawn together, eyes flaring red. 

""Get out."" I seethed, hand clenched into a fist. For a moment the demon didn't move. ""GET OUT."" I roared, lifting myself from the throne. The demon bolted, flying out the door and into the dark streets of the demonic city. 

I stood in silence for a moment, one hand still clutching the arm of the throne. My breaths came quick and heavy, chest beating painfully. The scars on my back where my wings once proudly rested flared up, the deep cuts burning, stitching themselves together. I didn't understand. Couldn't understand. 

Around me the walls of my fortress began to vibrate violently, something was trying to get in. I couldn't move to sound the alarm. I tried to call for someone but when I opened my mouth I coughed out a storm of feathers. That had certainly never happened before. 


*""Lucifer.""* A voice called, I didn't know quite where from. It seemed as if it was projecting from all angles at once. *""Your sins have been forgiven. You are coming home brother.""*

I choked for air, my fortress crumbling around me. This wasn't possible, this couldn't be. Breifly I wondered if I had accidentally entered the room of my own personal Hell. In my early days I dreamed of returning home to a chorus of angels and fat little cherubs on the harps. Only for it all to be stripped away, burnt to ash before his very eyes. 

But no fire came. No storms of ash. This was real, this had to be real. With a loud grunt I fell to the floor, brilliant white wings sprouting from the healed scars on my back. Before I quite knew what was happening I was ascending, my hellish dominion disappearing beneath me. 

Finally. Finally I was returning home. Humans are strange little things, you think you know everything about them after torturing their deepest secrets and darkest desires out of them and yet they still surprise you. Maybe humanity, I decided, wasn't so bad after all.

"[WP] You are the Devil, the fallen angel in charge of Hell. Recently someone has started praying for your sins. You thought nothing of it until their prayers were finally answered.",BrilliantlyLouise,"I sat back and kicked me feet up on the ebony table in front of me. It stretched out for several feet, and around it sat all of my cabinet. I stared intently at them for several minutes, before removing my feet from the table and sitting forward, hands steepled in front of me.  


“So, what do you have to report, demons?” I questioned, admiring once again the gravely quality of my own voice. So much better than… well, I don’t like to talk about Him, so never mind. One by one, the demons made their reports.


&amp;nbsp;


“Well, we did very well on Soul Collections in the third and fourth quarters of this year. Your plan to make 2016 miserable worked out well in the first three quarters. Nearly 20,000 people sold their souls to various crossroads demons and we collected on these much earlier than usual.” This one, a small, red-headed demon was named Hargoth. After being the most successful crossroads demon in my flock, I’d promoted him to what was essentially our “accounting” division. If you make a deal with one of our “salespeople”, you’d better be prepared to pay up, dearly. “However, our deals have dropped in the end of the fourth quarter. It seems we may have gone a bit too far.” He grimaced, looking at the reports before him. “Apparently, since so many Americans think the world is basically ending now, they aren’t bothering to make deals. Which is hurting our numbers.” He paused and looked at me.


&amp;nbsp;


“Well, we’ll have to adjust the first quarter of next year. Enthraz?” I turned to the stocky, disgusting demon across from Hargoth. “Make adjustments to the attacks on humanity. Personal attacks should be increased while attacks on the world or countries overall should be adjusted lower. I’d rather people believed it was only themselves whose lives were falling apart.” 


&amp;nbsp;


Things continued on like that, various demons giving reports on all the aspects of hell. Until Wzechov, the demon in charge of my personal affairs, was the only one who hadn’t spoken. He sat there quivering, unusual for my right hand demon. I stared pointedly at him until finally he spoke, voice shaking slightly.


&amp;nbsp;


“Uhm, your royal terribleness, Prince of Lies, great and mighty bringer of horror, Fallen One…”  


“*GET TO THE POINT*” I growled.  


“Uhm. Well. It seems that someone, well, several someones, have started praying for your sins.” He looked terrified. I was just confused.  


“What the hell do you mean? They’re praying to for my sins? They want me to give them sins?!” I snorted. “I’m not sure they understand how that works. They can just do whatever they want. I don’t give a rip!” I rolled my eyes and sighed deeply. Humans were such imbeciles sometimes…  


“Well, you see, no. It’s not exactly that, you see they’re praying for you. Like to God, asking him…” Wzechov was interrupted by a thunderous bang as the thick oak doors to my conference room thundered open. I looked up suddenly, ready to sentence to torture whoever dared interrupt my end of the year meeting. But suddenly, a bright white appeared.


“*Lucifer*,” a deep but smooth voice boomed, “*your sins have been forgiven at the behest of many. And the Lord welcomes you now back to Heaven.*” Before I could resist or even ask, the angels at the door grabbed my arms and began lifting me back up. I saw my kingdom, which I had toiled to build, receding and I knew those grubbing minions of mine would be fighting over who would replace me before I was even gone from their site. I watched for as long as I could before I blacked out.


&amp;nbsp;


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


&amp;nbsp;



When I awoke, I was in a brilliantly colored room, on a bed made of the most luxurious material I’d ever felt. Even with all of hell at my command, there were still some fabrics and materials I couldn’t get my hands on. I curled up beneath the blanket and marveled at how it was not too hot or too cold, everything seemed the perfect temperature. *Huh,* I scoffed, *of course God would have perfect everything.* My thoughts were interrupted by a solid knock at the door. Before I could rise, the door swung open and Michael ran in, seizing me in a tight embrace. It had been centuries since I’d last seen my brother, and what seemed like an eternity since we’d been able to embrace as such. I couldn’t help it. Overwhelmed by emotion, I embraced him back. After several moments, he pulled away from me and spoke.  


“Brother Lucifer, it has been too long,” he smiled that same large, toothy smile I remembered. “I am so glad to see you back here. Back home. We have a feast planned to celebrate your return!”   


“Brother Michael, you haven’t changed a bit,” I chuckled. “But what makes you think I’m staying? I was banished by God. And, what makes you say I want to be back? I had built up an entire kingdom!” Michael just laughed.   


“Oh my brother, I know you have read all of our God’s words. Do you not remember the story of the prodigal son??” I nodded slowly. “That was written about you. He knew you would come back to us one day and so you have! He is a marvelous Lord!” He grabbed me in a tight hug again and then he was gone, out the door, calling after me to follow once I was ready. I sat in stunned silence.  


*Could it be true? Am I really welcome back?* I couldn’t believe I even cared but something in me was softening; after thousands of years my heart was beginning to feel love again. So I left my bungalow and went to seek out the Father. Maybe I was truly home after all…

[WP] You tell Siri to call your friend Rob but she mishears you and calls God. God answers.,Captain_Vegetable,"It had been a rough day at the hospital and all I wanted to do was talk to Rob. He could turn storm clouds into sunshine and my head was filled with knotted grey. The kids had shown me this dumb new thang, so I decided to give it a swing. Holding my thumb on the phone's center button, an overly curious female voice replied, ""Hello, Martha, what can I help you with?""

""Call Rob."" I hopped into the front seat of my car and waited. 

Siri did its whirring or calculating or whatever the heck these computer things do and replied, ""Calling God.""

Now there's a few people on my contact list, three to be exact. The list starts with my daughter, Sarah, then my boss, and last but not least is Rob. There's definitely no God on there but it's enough to send chills down my spine. I hitch the window down a little and wait. The phone starts ringing. 

""Martha?"" a deep voice replies. 

It sounds like God, but it can't be. The voice nails the stereotypical white bearded muscled framed angelic figure that I've seen in all the movies --in fact, if I had to give a human sound to the tone, I'd say it's a close second to Morgan Freeman. 

""Is this really God?"" I ask. 

There's a pause and then a bolt of lightning flashes in the distance. ""What do you think, Martha?"" 

My handles are trembling now, barely holding onto the eye-phone. I try to find the words to express my emotions, but there are none. ""D-does this mean I'm going to die?""

There's a gentle laugh. ""Martha, who were you trying to call?""

""R-Rob . . . but I'll speak to you, we can talk about whatever you like.""

""Do you love him?"" 

I've never really thought about it --is it so bad if I do? ""Y-yes, father. I think so.""

There's more laughter on the other end, then the sound of a scuffle and scolding. ""Mum?"" the voice says. 

Oh God, don't tell me my sweet Sarah is in heaven before me. I cradle my head between my hands. 

""Sorry, Mum,"" Sarah continues, ""the kids must have misspelled Todd in order to set up some elaborate prank. I'll give them hell, don't worry.""

There's a whirl of dark thoughts and gritted teeth while at the same time, I want to slump down in the seat and never rise again. ""I'm going to kill those little gremlins.""

Sarah's got a rich laugh that makes me forget how mad I am. I grin sheepishly. ""Maybe you should call him and tell him how you feel. Love doesn't stick around forever,"" Sarah says. 

She's got a point, it was the same with her father. But I can't help being afraid. Sometimes it's easier to let time go by in a daze. 

""One day it might be the man up above coming to collect,"" Sarah continues. 

If the grey was knotted before, it's rolling thunder now. I grumble at her. Sarah laughs with her usual innocence. But she's probably right, my fine daughter, for a second I did think the almighty man had come to collect. She hung up on me, leaving me only one option. 

""Hello, Martha, what can I help you with?"" 

""This time, make sure you call ROB.""

""Before you go. If you could get the answer to any question you wanted, what would it be?""

""Ha, why can't I find a girl.""

""It's because your wants and needs are out of total alignment. You're fighting to meet standards of companionship and happiness set by people other than yourself.

[WP] You tell Siri to call your friend Rob but she mishears you and calls God. God answers.,Captain_Vegetable,"*Calling God* 

I was ten miles south of nowhere and running on fumes when I tried to call my friend Rob to see if he could keep me awake. When Siri made the mistake I figure it would just ring out into a busy signal. I nearly swerved off the rode when a voice answered. 

""Hello."" He sounded like he was expecting the call. 

""God?"" I couldn't keep the hesitation out of my voice. 

""Yes."" 

""Bullshit. Who's messing with me?"" 

""No one Steve. I'm God, don't you believe me?"" 

I snorted, ""Call me skeptical."" 

He sighed heavily, ""No one ever seems to believe me. Fine, your name is Steve you were born in Winchester Virginia your mother is Alice and your Father, Fred, died when you twelve."" 

""Anyone could get that off the internet."" I snapped back, figuring I had whoever this joker was. 

""It would not be wise to test me Steven."" 

""Well you aren't very convincing."" 

""Your first girlfriend was Angela, you too dated for a month before she dumped you for your brother Roger. When you were six you were scared of lego bricks, and you have a mole on your left ass check."" 

I raised an eyebrow as I crusied on and took a moment to think. Those were all less known facts about me sure but, ""Have you been talking to my mother?"" 

""No, Steven, I made you. I know all about you."" 

""Okay creeper, I think this conversation is done."" 

I reached down and pressed the red end call button; nothing happened. 

""Why don't you believe?"" 

I tried pressing it again, still nothing. 

""Look, whoever this is the joke has gone far enough."" I tried pressing the end call again and still nothing. 

""It's not a joke Steve you called me. If you would just understand that I am God we can move on with this conversation."" 

I threw my phone out the window before I thought about it and watched it shatter on the highway; it wasn't the best moment of my life but at least the weirdo on the phone was gone. 

""Really Steven."" The voice sighed. 

Had I been on any form of highway I would have died. As it was I screamed like a ten year old girl and swerved all over the road once I realized my phone was once again sitting in it's cradle. After I collected myself I started swearing heavily; the voice seemed to take it in stride. 

""Are you done?"" 

""Yes."" I huffed trying my best not to sound like a grumpy child. 

""Good. Can we talk now?"" 

""No."" 

I reached down and grabbed my coffee because a good swig would set me straight. The taste of iron hit my tongue first and I spit coating the drivers window in red mist. I yanked the car over before something seriously bad could happen. 

""Come on man! What the hell! Is that blood?"" 

""Convinced now?"" 

""Say that I am, why is it so damn important that I talk to you?"" 

""No reason."" 

Click. 

""Are you fucking serious?"" I screamed to nothing. 

I rummaged through my glove box and found some napkins to wipe the blood, coffee, whatever the hell it was off my window. It smeared but cleared my window up enough that I could see I was inches from those old white and orange caution signs. I craned my head up to see the sign but through the muck I didn't see much. 

Climbing out of the car I took in a sharp breath. My shock, as you can imagine was total when I saw those big bold letters **Bridge Out**

I reached back into my car and grabbed my phone. 

""Siri, call God."" 

The only thing that came back was a busy signal.

Weird. I didn't recognize the voice, but he knew my name so I guess it was someone I hadn't called before. I ran through a list of friends I hadn't spoken to on the phone before, coming up blank. 

""So, whose name did Rob change to God?""

""I hear you shuffling papers. You're still trying to figure out how you'll pay for everything."" It wasn't a question, it was an obvious statement. It wasn't really a secret we were having money troubles, and the funeral was going to be costly on my husband and I's meager paychecks. Friends and family chipped in where they could, but it wasn't enough.

""Yeah, still trying. Are you going to make me guess who this is? You're in my phone, so it's obvious I already know you."" I took a gulp of my coffee. The sugar left an aftertaste that was unpleasant and sharp. Things haven't tasted very good since this started. ""It's a little weird that you're giving me such a hard time right now, with everything that's happened.""

""Why don't you let someone else plan the funeral?""

""You haven't seen my mother. She's not eating, just staring into space. My husband doesn't know where to start. He gets frustrated and starts crying.""

""So it's up to you, then?"" There was the sound of shifting positions on the other line. ""You're taking responsibility for planning this, even though you've suffered a great loss yourself?""

I sighed. ""I don't want to talk about it. I need to focus on where I'm going to get the money from to pay for the funeral.""

""You can't run from grief forever, dear.""

""This conversation has taken a weird and intrusive turn. Who the fuck are you?""

""Exactly who it says I am.""

""What, God? If that's true, thanks a fucking lot. She was three."" I hung up and slammed my phone down.",CrochetedKingdoms

[WP] You tell Siri to call your friend Rob but she mishears you and calls God. God answers.,Captain_Vegetable,"""Siri, call Rob,"" I muttered into my phone, dodging around a slow-walking couple.

""Calling ..."" Siri responded in her well-regulated voice, fading away as I descended into the loud subway.

""Hello?"" I stopped. When I called Rob, I expected a coarse, grumpy voice answering, not this slick voice with a thick, indescribable accent. 

""Hey, is Rob there?"" I asked, hoping that Rob had a friend over and not that Siri had called the wrong person, as she commonly did. 

""I have many beings once called Rob,"" the voice responded coolly. ""Which one do you wish to speak to?""

""Uhhhh... Rob Garash- sorry Gariacielli? Maybe you pronounce it Garrotalli?"" I said, immediately mentally face-palming at the least suave response I'd given all day- and that included my awful answer earlier today when my boss appeared suddenly and asked what I was smiling about. I'd just gotten off the phone with Rob. A friend had introduced me to him the week before, and whispered as Rob was leaving that he'd be a good replacement drug dealer. Considering my last source of weed had been my scumbag ex who ended up in prison, God himself would have been a better replacement.

""I'm sorry, he's not in yet."" 

""Wha- you're answering his cell and you're trying to tell me he isn't there yet? I talked to him earlier, we were gonna meet at 4. He gave me this number himself!"" I'll admit, I was getting a bit frazzled at this point, and this woman's unruffled voice wasn't helping matters.

""Unfortunately, you must have the wrong number. This is my personal line, as Reign of Heaven. He's not in yet. He should be found at this number in about 4 years, if I remember correctly,"" she replied.

""Wait wait WHO is this?"" I started to wonder exactly what I'd gotten myself into by getting involved with Rob. He had seemed a bit off, although I couldn't quite say why.

""The Reign of Heaven. More commonly known by those on Earth as God.""

I stopped completely. That was something that needed some thought. Someone pushed me from behind and I realized I was blocking his way onto the Orange Line. I scooted into an alcove, which had the added benefit of blocking some of the noise of the subway station. 

""I called... God? On accident? Holy cow. Or maybe I should say holy Siri..."" 

God made an attempt at laughing at my weak pun, which made me feel slightly better. For about five seconds.

""Well, Taylor. I'm afraid I must go now, to give you time to contact Rob before we meet in person. Good day!!"" She hung up the phone. 

I started to navigate to the Contacts screen so I could be sure to call Rob instead, while my mind worked furiously, trying to interpret what she meant. I had just pressed the Call icon next to his name when I heard a yell.

""For the glory of God!"" The man shouting was wearing a- a vest of some sort. Was it a part of a military uniform? I couldn't tell. The vest was bulky, and the shape was weird. It took me until he yelled again to understand fully.

""Tell your God you love him before you join him!""

On the other hand, a person who knows how to fix and make better can have all the power, but that much power doesn't always translate to motive force and progress, it breeds envy and makes such wielder careless.

CGP Grey put it better than I did. I'll link it afterward.

This does make me ask: what does it *really* take to change a nation? If one gets the power to do what s/he wants by saying a word, how is one supposed to harness it? Who gets served first: the court or the citizens? Should there even be a hierarchy?",BehindTheBurner32
[WP] Write a story where the fall of democracy and the rise of tyranny is a GOOD thing.,LIBERTY_PRIME_Mk2,"""No rulers, no tyrants, no leaders"" - That is the world our ancestors wanted and desired. And they finally achieved their dreams after abolishing any kind of rule, where the people had their say. If only those people knew back then what would happen after their dream had been achieved.....

Year 2100:

""Sir. Indiana has declared a war on us"".

The old general responded to these words with a grim face. After closing his eyes, he said in a hoarse yet loud voice: ""SOLDIERS! TODAY WE, CHICAGO HAVE FINALLY GAINED THE OPPORTUNITY TO CRUSH THOSE INSECTS. WE, THE PEOPLE OF THE GREAT COUNTRY, CHICAGO, SHALL KILL EACH AND EVERY ONE IN THAT COUNTRY. REVENGE SHALL BE OURS. GIVE THEM HELL!!!!!!""

""YES, SIR!!!""

But even as the general said those words, he was afraid. And the soldiers realised this when the old general was performing his religious sermons in secrecy. He had begged and cried in front of his god, asking for forgiveness, and saying that he wanted to run away. But the soldiers couldn't say anything. Because they too wanted to run....

After his incredible speech, he went to his cabin, smoked a cigarette, and took his hat off, and looked at the map. 

""A divided world""

That was the defining statement. No allies. No comrades. Because everyone was free. Immediately after that he went to his desk, and took his pen to write his will yet another time. But he couldn't complete it. Because even after dying, what he wanted would never come true. So instead he wrote a letter. A letter which had no recipient.

He wrote about his life in that letter. He wrote about several instances in life - especially how he started to pray to God to unite everyone. He wanted God to unite everyone. 

""Let there be only one country""

He got up from his bench. Took his gear, and shed a final tear. He had decided to die in the battle.

But even as he left to die, ironically enough, the last line in that letter kept ringing in his mind. And oddly enough he chuckled at the mere thought of writing that line in - made him almost feel that he should have become a writer instead. But, again, could he really have become one in such a shitty world?

He would die in the battle that very day. Another younger general was appointed and he read that letter. He was very puzzled, especially after reading that last line-

""....therefore I feel that fighting to be a single leader is much better, and also easier because at least people had some thing to look forward to....."" ""Hitler sure had it easy, huh?""

Man 1: I know I am not. Just look at the recent gay marriage bill. We approved it, only to have another petition disapprove it then another petition put it back into place! How much time was wasted just to get it done, when dozens of other bills, other actions laid piled up?

Man 2: But it's dangerous, putting absolute power into one person's hands.

    ""Sirs, the nation is in danger. Imperial troops are crossing the Ostenberg chain as I speak. Theref-""
     A senator harrumphed, and with it came pandemonium, with no way of controlling it. This joint session of the Parliament has lasted almost two days now, trying to find a way to deal with the Brünsbergers.

     So far, no such luck.

     I looked at the chamber, and to the members of the National Parliament, throwing papers, manifestos, and caps to each other, as well as exchanging insults against the other factions in this broken house.
     And I, the King, overseeing this joint session of village idiots called Parliament, just sat there, watching. And watching this Parliament is disappointing. I remember, back in the days of my father that the Crown and Parliament both kept the country running. He once told me, ""The Crown cannot function without Parliament. The Crown's sole power comes from the people.""

     Is this how the people of the nation act today, then? Did they want a bunch of incompetent nincompoops to govern them? This democracy is in disarray, I told myself.

     And I intend to fix it.

     ""Guards!"" I shouted, but no one except them heard me amongst the rabble. They responded.

     ""I intend to stand at the middle of the chamber. I then expect you to defend me there if necessary. Do not do any aggressive moves toward the Honourable Members if there is no aggression towards me. Understood?""

     ""Yes, your Highness.""

     I stepped down to the middle of Parliament, by the Mace. The Mace represents the power of Parliament granted by the Crown. If I took it, that means I intend to dissolve Parliament and give myself absolute power. I rest my hand on it and said, ""My Honourable Members, the country is in danger. Since you have no intention of-""

     ""He wants to take the Mace!"" somebody shouted, and everyone lunged against me. My ring of guards barely protected me when I took the Mace and went pushing out into the Speaker's Corridor.

     In the Speaker's Corridor, there stood the Prime Minister and his Secretary of State. ""Your Highness, why did you take the Mace?""

     ""I needed to.""

     The Speaker of the House suddenly went outside. ""Your Highness, you have been declared an outlaw by Parliament. I can do nothing to reverse their decision.""

     Looks like the Oligarchy doesn't want to lose power.

     ""There's no time to lose. Where is the farthest city from the Ostenberg and here?"", I frantically said.

     ""General von Kyburg's army is right outside, your Highness, willing to help.""

     I forgot about the army! I sent General von Kyburg and his division here last night to act as guards. How could I have forgotten?

     I ran outside, right into the Ostgarten to meet General von Kyburg. He greeted me with a somber tone.

     ""Why, General?""

     ""Ostenkloster has fallen, your Highness.""

     Great. Only two cities left, and the country falls. I must hurry if I am to save the Kingdom. I got up my horse and said, ""Soldiers, the nation is in danger. Our Parliament has not yet taken action, allowing the enemy to invade. Therefore, I decleare that the Members of Parliament have commited treason and should therefore be arrested.""

     I rode to the chamber, with my army in tow. This action may be called tyrannical, but this democracy needs saving.

     And I am here to save it.",dom_stephen
[WP] Write a story where the fall of democracy and the rise of tyranny is a GOOD thing.,LIBERTY_PRIME_Mk2,"“The situation continues to be tense in the Roman capital today after the Senate failed to pass the so-called Relief Law late last night, plunging the Empire deeper in its current crisis. As dawn breaks today, as you can see here behind me, the streets are eerily empty except for the increased presence of Vigiles and Praetorian Guard after the widespread protests last night. It is not clear whether…”

Aelius turned the small TV in his office to mute. He rubbed his eyes wearily, trying to focus his thoughts. Strife, chaos, and uncertainty seemed to have become the daily bread and butter of the Empire. It had now attracted the attention of a nervous international media as well. Every day newspapers seemed to be in a competition of who could find the unlikeliest worst case scenario to make their headline. Life was slowly grinding to a halt in the capital and it had started spreading to the provinces. Among the common people rumours had started abounding about the Emperor stepping into the fray as it were to reclaim the position’s old powers.

Aeilus gave a glancing look at the headline of the liberal Nova Res Publica newspaper on his desk, which proclaimed “Save us, Caesar”. He chuckled at the irony. The door to his office swung open and his secretary came in. “The Emperor wants to see you,” she said. Aelius slightly raised his head and looking over the rims of his reading glasses said “Thank you, Flavia.”

He stood up fixing his tie and stepped out into the corridors of the executive wing of the Purple Palace. Staff had just started coming in for their workday and the corridors humming with the low voices of staff saluting each other and perhaps disusing the latest gossips around the political crisis. As he made his way toward the Emperor’s office only a couple of the junior staffers spoke to Aelius. “Good morning, sir,” or “Good morning, Domine Mento,” and he would just nod back.
He went into the Emperor’s waiting room, where the secretary, Lara Corvinus, was working behind her desk. As Aelius walked in she looked up from her work. “Good morning,” she said simply, with an air of authority and self-assuredness. 

“Good morning, Lara,” came the reply. “Is he ready to see me?”

“Give me a moment,” she said standing up. She gently knocked twice on the heavy oak double door close to her desk, and walked in. A few brief moments later she came out.

“He’s ready for you.”

“Thank you,” Aelius said with a nod and walked in.

The emperor’s office was one of those things forgotten in time. It was a reminder of older times, when the Emperors stood supreme above everything. Aeilus always felt the room was designed to make people feel very small and lost. The space was enormous, almost comically and certainly needlessly so. Large marble columns surrounded the room, and between them on the lavish marble walls there hanged maps of the Empire during different periods and portraits of famous Emperors in golden frames. The heavy carpet in the center bore the Emperor’s insignia. And everything seemed designed to point the attention of anyone that would find themselves in here towards one direction. There, elevated from the rest of the room by 4 or 5 steps was the Renaissance-era great mahogany desk used by the Emperors, like a judge’s bench presiding over the court. Behind the desk there were the massive floor-to-ceiling windows looking out to the Eternal City that served as the fourth wall of the office. The opulent, royal purple curtains usually remained closed, but today they were open and light was streaming into the room, making it look rather less foreboding. The emperor stood beside his desk, looking out the windows with the hands behind his back. Because of the light coming in you could only make out a silhouette of him. He too looked very small in this room when not sitting at his desk, Aelius thought.

“Ave, Caesar,” he said as he approached the desk.

This seemed to snap the emperor back into consciousness from wherever his mind had flown to. He curtly turned his head to see who was behind him with the corner of his eye, then turned to face the windows again.

“Aelius, have you given any thought to what we discussed last night?”

“I have.”

“And?”

“It’s not going to be easy, not to mention all the risk involved…”

“I think it’s going to be a lot easier now, considering the circumstances.” The emperor turned toward him now.

“Some of the people support us, it’s true,” Aelius continued cautiously.

“Most of the people, Aelius. And now the media seems open to it too. We haven’t even done anything and we have their hearts and minds already.” The emperor was young and lacked experience, but he wasn’t afraid to make his point even in the presence of seasoned statesmen. Aelius always liked that about him. Since the transfer of the executive powers from the Emperors to the cabinet too many monarchs were content with just being fat, overpaid, lazy figureheads he thought. 

“You saw the mess they made last night in the Senate. You see the mess they are making of this Empire every day. We’ve become a laughing stock and the politicians don’t seem to care one bit.”

“I understand your frustration, Caesar. Believe me. In fact, I share it. But we are at a critical moment in the history of the Empire. We need to be cautious.”

[WP] Write a story where the fall of democracy and the rise of tyranny is a GOOD thing.,LIBERTY_PRIME_Mk2,"Henry David Thoreau once said that “the mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation and go to a grave with a song in them.”  He had spent his life watching the problems amass and a series of unfortunate events had given this man a peek behind society’s veil.  He wouldn’t be able to change the world alone but he hoped he had the courage to try.

The story begins, like many good stories do, a long time ago…

When he was a young man, the world was gripped by the specter of fear.  Nuclear and atomic catastrophe loomed around every corner but the average Joes found the courage to keep living their life, for in it they found a prosperous society, one where even the simplest of men could work hard, earn enough to raise their family and be proud of the fact that you participated in a democracy that had defeated fascism and had committed to the goal of sending men to the moon.  MEN TO THE MOON!  Could you believe it?!  The future would be bright indeed if we could dream and aspire to such things.  

But as the man grew older he watched as society began to change, and even a dream like landing on the moon could seem a distant accomplishment of a society long past.  He imagined it was what the early Franks felt like, growing up in the shadow of the Roman empire.  Aqueducts and arenas that they could no longer maintain, let alone hope to construct.

The shift started slowly.  Although it seemed like progress at first, the social fight against inequality began to grow... and grow … until it ended violently and abruptly.  Assassinations were everywhere, JFK, Martin Luther King Jr. and then Bobby… it wasn’t just men that died on those fateful days, but little pieces of our collective soul and with each “BANG” hope was ripped from us as well.  Even at the beginning of these events people started whispering, and then shouting, about conspiracy theories;  

“The illuminati were to blame!”  

“No” some argued, “ the illuminati were a front for the New World Order! And LBJ was in on it too!”

Each claim was more outlandish than the next, endless logical inconsistencies and conclusions built on top of a factual house of cards.  It sounded like the stuff that only crazy people would believe, exactly as it was designed to…

Of course not all of the conspiracy stories were true but the illuminati were real, and they were trying to take over the world.  This was a sad truth that he had learned upon his initiation to the ancient and secret society, the byproduct of chance and his privileged birth.

This was the truth that our hero, the Unfortunate Man, had discovered.  There was a cold war, a game of chess being played in the shadows.  Powers vied for control of society and the board was being dominated by the Illuminati.  These murders were the opening salvos in their first match.  This game had been premeditated beyond belief and it would only end with a checkmate, resulting in their complete control not just of the government but of humanity, the majority of which they believe too uncivilized, too unhuman to be left to their own devices.

He had always been a hopeful person, believing in the inherent good of men and women, which he still did.  But it was obvious that the systems had been corrupted beyond repair.  He learned that the government, in every country that mattered, had been bought and paid for years ago.  Since World War II, the illuminati had consolidated their power.  First as the industrial elite of each country, and slowly and patiently they continued consolidating their power, building their wealth which they would then use to either put themselves in power or buy off those whom they needed.  

They had been waiting hundreds of years, since the movement to illuminate the world went underground.  That is when they learned, a single power is a focal point and a target for your enemies.  Their presence had threatened the existing monarchs and early republics of Europe.  So they became too obvious a threat; former enemies had united to subvert and destroy them.

If they could usurp a distributed power structure, like democracy, it would be a better vessel for their eventual rise to power.  If one person was taken out, or even worse, went against the order, they could be removed and replaced. 

.. But that could also be their undoing and ultimately everyone's salvation.  

There were times when our hero felt hopeless.  Our reader might ask, why, when he disagreed with the movement, did he remain enveloped in its shadowy plot.  The answer was simple, hope.  Those who openly went against the order met untimely ends.  Hope that he could unravel it from within and give people a chance to live freely gave him cause.

Over the years their plan came to fruition exactly as they expected.  It started with the slow devaluation of labor and in the process they added to their ranks.  They would deconstruct the labor unions and thereby remove the potential for organized opposition.  As jobs became more scarce and wages stagnated from the carefully orchestrated globalization and outsourcing of jobs, they turned to dismantling the social safety net.  They hijacked a political party and used continual warfare and nationalism to conscript the masses.  Opposition to this movement and dissent would be deemed “unpatriotic” and “fascist”.  A tactic that has been favored by Caesar, Napoleon and Hitler.

They took, and took, and took from the masses and in return gave back only a brave new world.  A circus of bread and games, enveloping distractions of flashing lights, noises and social media “likes” that both pacified and entertained a majority of the population, lulling them into a warm yet indifferent embrace of their own making.

Ironically the two conspiracy theories they had no hand in, 9/11 and the iphone, were the perfect opportunity to establish the Orwellian secret police state, a microphone and camera in every home of the developed world.

It was their best work though, the election of Barack Obama, that they were really proud of.  In the backlash to their pawn George there was a potential for revolution.  The people craved it, there was a social tension in the air but instead of allowing it to fester and develop into something beyond their control, they gave the people exactly what they wanted.  Hope and Change.   

The veneer of civility, intelligence and charisma was the perfect veil.  Behind the scenes little changed and to those that realized it the crushing of that hope was the straw that broke the camel’s back.  The people were now ripe for the taking.  It was time for Hillary, one of their most seasoned veterans to take the reins.  

All was not lost though and it was our hero that formulated the plan but it would take someone with more charisma, more PERSONALITY to pull it off.  The same chaos that had been used to take control of the system could be used to grind the gears of the machine to a halt.  Together with one of his morally minded illuminati brethren, they hatched a plan to save freedom and bring order back to the system.  It would be a long road though.  There would be perils and push back, and the “democracy” would need to be purged of all of the traitors to freedom that had begun to strangle the democracies of the world and cause them to rot from the inside.

They found him out though, of course they did.  The odds were stacked against him from the beginning.  Machiavelli had evolved though.  Killing him might led to an investigation and disturb their delicate balance of power.  The best hiding spot has always been in plain sight, so he was drugged up, discredited and everything was taken from him.  After a short stint in prison with systematic beatings and druggings he was finally set loose on the street.  Now the average person would hardly look him in the eye, let alone take him seriously or rally behind him.

But heroes often come from the humblest of beginnings.  He refused to live the quiet and desperate life that had been placed in front of him.  It might be futile but if he could just convince one or even a few people, then maybe he too could make a difference and his Co-conspirator Donald was already on his way.

By the time they had been found out, Donald was already too visible, had too much momentum to be either quietly subverted or violently ended.  The illuminati put all of their weight behind the news and political machinery that had served them so well.  To discredit and disgrace this man would be their only hope, so he cultivated a personality that could withstand it and be impervious to “fact checking” and traditional political restraints.  

The Unfortunate Man grabbed his box and lifted it with all his might, exhausted not by the modest weight but by the burden of the task that fell upon his shoulders.  He took one small symbolic and necessary step atop the soapbox on the street corner, HIS street corner.

“THE END IS NEAR, THE ILLUMINATI ARE TO BLAME AND ONLY TRUMP CAN SAVE US!”

Trump could save us.  Trump WOULD save us. He had to believe it.  

The road ahead would be difficult and violent but necessary, especially in the beginning.  Democracy had failed.  It had been corrupted beyond repair and the traditional safeguards of journalism, rationalism and free speech had been set loose upon each other, tearing themselves to pieces in a Mexican standoff.  The weapons of choice were social media and doubt.

It was controversial, but a new Caesar was needed to end the chaos.  His stewardship would be our shelter in the storm.  The democracy could not be left to fix itself, we have seen that path countless times in history and the path is paved with the bones and dreams of the common man, lost in civil wars and reigns of terror.

He would spend every last breath and ounce of hope that he had to warn his countrymen, to help their savior get into power before it was too late.  He would speak but would anyone heed his warning?",SpartanComplex

"[WP]""A gentleman only needs two things while traveling: a handkerchief, and a dueling pistol.""",Legion_Profligate,"Redman Lang arrived at the small town of Rostburne on a quiet Sunday morning. He would only be staying for a one day. He was traveling to meet his brother and his family and was stopping by for the day. 

He would head to a bar and get some tea, then maybe visit the barber shop to trim his fine beard, get some new shoes, polish his pistol, then he would be surprised by an old acquaintance, then he would leave in his horse pulled wagon.

At 7:34 a.m. he walked into the bar to greet the bartender. He asked for some tea and sat down. A pretty young woman sat down at another table and they talked for a bit. At 8:28 a.m. he headed to the barber's shop. The barber, Old Griffith, gave his red hair and beard a good trim. He left at 9:05 a.m. and went back to the bar. He saw the young woman again and they talked for a while. 
At 9:32 a.m. he left and went to a cobbler to buy new shoes. At 11:00 a.m. he checked into a hotel room. At 2:41 p.m. he went to the post office to write a letter to his brother. At 4:15 he took a walk by the river. At 6:49 p.m. he arrived back at his hotel room and got out his dueling pistol. He polished it and then at 7:30 p.m. he went outside. He saw the young woman again.

As he walked over to greet her he took of his hat and said hello. Suddenly a shot rang out. Murphy ""Mad Dog"" Blight, an old enemy of Redman's, saw him. Mad Dog didn't care about the law. Mad dog fired his pistol. He missed and Redman reached for his gun. He pulled it out and fired 4 shots as Mad dog got out another two. They both fell over. The young woman ran to Redman's side. A doctor ran out to help. Mad Dog was dead. 

The next day Redman's body was sent in his wagon to his brother. A man volunteered to take him there. Shortly after departure of the wagon with Redman's body a letter turned up on Charles Lang's front doorstep.

""Hello Charlie. Just wanted to tell you where I was. I stopped in this little town of Rostburne. Met a fine lady here. I think she might fancy me. Shaved up a bit. I should be at your house tomorrow. Can't wait to meet your wife. Oh, and as promised I'm bringing some of mom's pies over for you.

Love you brother, Redman.""",ATeach13
"[WP] ""What if I told you, that no matter what happens in the future, you will end up in a moment just like this""",NnortheExperience,"Einstein said, every moment, of every life, is doomed to duplicated repetition. 

How many times I have entered this bank will forever remain a mystery. 

If I have one assurance it's that I've been through this before. What will be, will be. I do not know what that is yet though. I can only assume through the enigma of the universe that I have been returned to this determination time and time again. 

I can only play with this idea in my head. There is nothing I can do about it. I am stuck in this loop for eternity. My one hope is I make different better choices, that this time I am somehow more competent. That I am smarter. That I am more capable. That no matter what happens it will all work out in the end. 

The end: the inevitable conclusion.

Death.

This is the torturous cycle of things. The over and over again that always terminates the same way.

I decide, there is nothing I can do, but complete the circuit. It is my burden.

I place my hand on the pistol grip protruding from my jeans. The jeans that are a bit too tight. The jeans that sit under my jello like belly. The jeans that bunch under my ass and ride up my crotch as I walk. 

I jerk at the Walther PPK. It won't come. My heart thumps against my ribs. I feel dizzy. My hands tingle. Black splotches form around the corners of my eyes.  I jerk on the pistol harder and hear a rip as the hammer snags on the waistband of my underpants. The old badly fitting fruit of the looms that are discolored from too much use and too few washing pull into my buttcrack as I jerk again. I try one final time and the pistol comes clear but with a loud rip of cotton rending at the abuse. 

I can feel old underwear flapping above the tight waistline of my pants. 

With one hand I try to shove the fabric back inside my jeans, but only manage to make the levis slide farther down my rear-end. 

I spread my legs to keep the jeans from going all the way to my ankles.

A snicker. 

Blood flushes to my face. I feel hot. Sweat beads on every pore instantly drenching my shirt.

I push past the pain in my shoulder as I slam the gun up against the bullet proof glass the bank teller sits behind. He is a bald man, skinny in a red knit sweater. He has a black tie around a neck with a huge adams apple that bounces up and down as if he is swallowing laughter. He has a look on his face that makes me want to end him. 

Smug.

I scream, ""This is a fucking robbery, give me all the money,"" but it comes out all garbled like I'm chewing on my tongue.  

His skinny face blooms into a humored smile.

I get startled by movement to my right and squeeze the trigger to fire off a warning shot. My hand won't work the trigger. I turn the weapon and I see the safety is red. 

What's the saying? See red you're what? 

Suddenly I don't see anything. But I hear a room full of people laughing.

Then nothing.

[WP] Multiplayer dreaming is invented.,Prepareyourecolon,"(came up with another one)

I downloaded the ""dream viewer"" from a third party app store. It said you could go into other people's dreams with out having them knowing. I know it sounded creepy but when you are the father of a 12 year old daughter who was getting to the age where they start to shut you out you kind of have to do anything to get answers. 

Once it installed on the dream deck I fell asleep. The app kicked in and my ""buddy list"" came up. Hitting the drop down I found my daughter's name, Emily, and clicked on it. It started to load. As I waited I thought about what her dream may be,

I figured it would be full of either little school crushes, maybe some boy band/teen heart throbs kind of thing. I mean when I was 12/13 I had many dreams about hot actresses and what not. A part of me almost thought about canceling out of this little ease drop.

Until I was loaded into what looked to be the most disgusting strip club ever! I looked around at the number of gross looking men who seemed to be focused on the main stage. I looked up and my mouth fell open in shock.

On the stage was my little girl! She was still 12 years old and was dancing in a outfit that I guess you could call a bikini. The top and bottoms were so small it hardly covered anything of her. As she danced gross bikers and other pervs pawed at her, stuffing money in her bottoms. I wanted to start throwing these fuckers around the room and wake my daughter up but this viewer was just that, a viewer. I couldn't interact with anything in the dream at all!

I stood there as her little number ended. As she walked off the stage a man in a business suit walked up to her, whispered in her ear and walked to the back with her. I followed behind but for a moment lost them. I pulled up the menu and saw the ""locate"" icon. I took a deep breath and hit it. 

Suddenly I was in a gross back room. Emily was naked and on all fours while the business man was behind her roughly having sex with her! I felt sick to my stomach as the man grunted, calling her names as she just took it. I turned away and pulled up my buddy list. I couldn't be here anymore. I saw my wife had her dream set to ""private."" I clicked her name and was suddenly out of the disgusting room.

I had a feeling my wife would be in some kind of romance novel type of scene. Hate to admit that there were times I thought about seeing my wife having sex with another man. I mean Holly was still a beautiful woman and I seen how men look at her. I took a deep breath and closed my eyes. I was expecting to be in some 18th century castle or some farm house, my wife being ravished by some farmhand or something...

But I opened my eyes to find myself standing in my own basement! I heard a muffled cry near me. As I turned around I saw myself hanging by my wrist on the rafters! I had a gag in my mouth and my face and body was covered in bruises and cuts. At that moment my wife came into view. 

She was wearing her normal ""soccer mom"" outfit of a polo shirt and jeans...

But she also had a chainsaw in her hands!

She pulled the cord and revved the saw up before slowly cutting me apart! 

I quickly turned off my dream deck!

= = =

The next morning I came to the dinning room table. Emily was sitting there eating her breakfast as if nothing was wrong while Holly was taking her own seat. I poured myself a cup of coffee and sat down.

I couldn't look either one of them in the eyes! I mean my 12 year old daughter was dreaming about being an underage whore and my wife dreamed of murdering me! After a bit of silence Emily spoke up.

""So dad... when did you turn into some peeping tom dream creeper?"" she asked as she looked at her phone.

""Wh... what?"" I stammered. Holly just sat there eating her food.

""I installed this app called Dream Shield. It prevents creepers and pervs from spying on dreams or getting into multidreams uninvited."" Emily said as she looked at me.

""You can set it up to either show a nightmare, something boring, really anything. I put you and mom on the list for ""parents worst nightmare."""" she said.

""S... so you don't dream of..."" I whispered, not wanting to say what I saw.

""No dad I don't dream of being an underage stripper!"" she said. I turned my head to look away from her.

""That's very gross Jim."" Holly said, not looking away from her own phone.

""I guess you have the same app too?"" I asked, ""I mean your dream you were cutting me up in the basement.""

""Nope, you piss me off sometimes and I often dream of killing you."" she said nonchalantly, not even looking up from her phone.

[WP] Multiplayer dreaming is invented.,Prepareyourecolon,"I'd asked for this.

The group was random, the dreamer was a stranger. I was looking for something more adventurous. Watching the girl sobbing at my side in the darkness wasn't what I was looking for.

She was hugging her knees tightly, shivering, and sobbing uncontrollably. She could be another visitor or even the dreamer herself, I couldn't tell. Hell, she could be part of the dream itself. But the fear dripped visibly off her, I could feel it crawling into me.

""It's... it's going to be ok. I mean it's just a dream he can't actually kill us."" I murmured.

""Then why haven't they woken us up?"" She almost looked at me almost accusing. Well, at least I knew she was a visitor. ""These aren't supposed to be nightmares!""

I put a hand over her mouth, ""Don't start yelling or it'll find us.""

[WP] Multiplayer dreaming is invented.,Prepareyourecolon,"""Are you ready?"" the dreamer asked. 

I didn't know his name, in fact, I didn't know the name of anyone around me. I glanced down at my watch--which was oddly juxtaposed to the leather and steel armor I was wearing--and saw I had about five minutes of dream time left until we all woke up. 

""Wait."" I said, placing my hand on the armored shoulder of the dreamer. ""Wait until we all have three minutes left. Two minutes to get there, one to fight. Just like you said. We'll time it so we wake up if things go... wrong."" The dreamer nodded. 

I observed my surroundings. I can't say it wasn't something I hadn't seen many nights before this year: a dark forest. The leafless tree limbs only hinting at their existence, back-lit by the eerily large and bright moon. A worn, gray dirt path path led into the darkness of the deep forest. While not unique, it's the dream I popped into tonight, not like I really have a say in the matter. 

The dreamer informed the three of us that this was a reoccurring nightmare of his as a kid. Luckily for us, it's one he remembers vividly. About a minute into the forest, we'll start to feel something watching us. Minute two we'll be chased, until we can't run any longer. That's when ""it"" shows up. That's the only thing the dreamer can't recall with detail. The beast always appeared to him as a shadowy figure, all he was able to tell us is he was certain it was some sort of demon. 

He also must be some sort of fantasy lover, since we all had some form of armor or another. I had a sword, the short, blond haired girl also here had a bow (and pointed ears like an elf), our third party member was equipped in full plate mail armor and donned a large, unwieldy shield as well as a sword, and our dreamer himself possessed a war-hammer and magic. 

Again, this was a quite stereotypical, combating your own nightmares with powers you wish you had, but the more common the dream, the likelier you are to pop into it. 

""Three minutes until eyes open."" the dreamer said. Everyone gave each other a nod, and the dreamer was the first to step deeper into the forest.  ",Adrick_Athers
[WP] Multiplayer dreaming is invented.,Prepareyourecolon,"I never liked multiplayer games. I always wound up with the screaming 12 year old calling me a faggot and saying how they fucked my mom or what ever. 

When this new ""Multidreamer"" thing came out. I tried to avoid it like the plague! The special multi system device that people had installed in their heads could not only control computers and cars but now can make people share dreams like its a game or movie. 

Thankfully you can opt out before you go to sleep. It sucks that you cant just make it a permanent thing but I was always sure to click ""no"" when asked to create a lobby.

But I must have been super tired because I woke up not in a ""single"" dream but in a outdoor lobby with some idiot teabagging me!

""Get the fuck off me!"" I yelled, pushing the moron off me. The guy laughed. He looked to be college age but in these mulitdreams you can make yourself anything you want. The man laughed.

""Chill bro! Just messing around!"" he said. I grumbled as I saw some other people showing up. The only way out of here is to be ""killed"". Thankfully that old saying about dying in real life if you die in dreams wasnt true. You wake up with a headache and lose some sleep is all that happens. I was about to ask someone to off me when one dreamer's head exploded.

""Oh fuck! Hackers!"" the ""bro"" dreamer yelled before his body exploded.

There weren't ""hackers"" in the multidream, that was a common misconception.

Those people were lucid dreamers, and they could do anything in anyone's dreams!

I could see a blur of something in what looked like power armor flying around and ""killing"" all the dreamers in the room. I stood waiting for my turn. I wanted to turn off this mode and get some sleep. Once the last one was gone it was just me and ""him"". 

He stood before me, looking me up and down as i nodded.

""Go on, finish me."" I said. The armored person stood there in silence.

""Kevin?"" it said, a female voice said coming from the helmet. It took me a moment to realize who the voice was.

""Monica?"" i asked.

The helmet came off and standing before me was shy little Monica from the front desk. She was kind of cute in that nerdy bookworm way. At work she wore simple clothes and glasses and had her hair in two long braids. Even in this dream word she didn't change her look.

Well except the power armor, that was different!

She gave me a smile. To tell the truth I don't think i ever seen her smile.

""Oh my god! I finally found you! This is great!"" she said excitedly. I scratched the back of my head.

""Well I don't often get on the multidream..."" I said. She nodded.

""I know, I had to force you on!"" she said. I stood there in shock.

""What?""

""It took awhile, but I found you and was able to bypass the opt out system to get you here!"" she said with a giggle. I looked around nervously.

The outdoor lobby slowly changed around us. Soon I found myself in a dungeon. All over the place was chains, whips and other sexual type items. I swallowed nervously as I looked back as Monica. Her armor vanished and for a moment I saw her naked. I couldn't tell you if if that was her real body or maybe she changed it for the dream world but soon another costume formed on her. 

This one was a S&amp;M dominatrix outfit of thigh high black boots, long black gloves that went to her elbows and nothing else! I tried to take a step back but my arms and legs wouldn't move! I felt like a rag doll as my arms and legs spread out. I was suddenly naked and strapped to a X!

She picked up a riding crop from a small table full of sex toys and slapped her hand with the end as she looked at me.

""Mmm Kevin... we have all night to enjoy ourselves!"" she moaned as she walked towards me.

= = =

The next day at work I made a bee line for the elevator. Thankfully for the moment I was the only one in the car. Before the doors could close a small female hand stopped them. I swallowed nervously as Monica walked in and let the doors close. She walked over next to me and smiled.

""Have fun last night?"" she asked. I didnt know how to answer but she went on.

""I know you did! Your brain waves and pleasure centers were off the charts!"" she said with a knowing smile. She hacked my system and was able to see those things after the ""dream"" was over.

""If you think the dream version was hot. You will love the real thing."" she said. Again I couldn't answer. She reached behind me and grabbed my ass. I gave a surprised yelp.

""How about we take a long lunch today... I live close by..."" she said, not really asking but almost telling me what to do.

""S... sure..."" I whispered. She grabbed my ass harder, almost hurting a bit.

""What did I teach you last night?"" she asked.

""Y... yes mistress..."" I whimpered. She let go of my ass and gave it a pat.

""Good boy."" she said as the elevator opened.

A surreal sun melted the sea and horizon like they were pastel. The dreamer observed from a mountain top. Not much longer remained.

*A street with no name*

*And a home of no address*

*Peaceful gardens kempt*

The dreamer hurried through the tall grass, evading the grasp of a horrid creature. Darkness shrouded and the stars shimmered, blending with falling snowflakes. It was almost the end.

*The world stayed still*

*Not a worry to be had*

*And no one noticed*

The blizzard buried the universe and the extraordinary beings fled. The dreamer collapsed in a cave and watched on her side as the flakes shined in an impossible moonlight. She closed her eyes in a moment she had longed for.

""Hey boss,"" his receptionist Mae said, cracking the door to his office open, and then she looked at his face and her nose wrinkled. ""Ugh,"" she said. ""Can't believe you're still doing that.""

"[WP] You are a top detective with the superpower to ""taste"" crime. Today, you have a new taste in your mouth, and it's delicious.",That_One_Username,"After 25 years and a flawless conviction record, your now-famous tongue had never once fallen foul. Crooks despised you, and science had yet to explain you, but the justice system had eventually come to embrace you as the most indispensable crime-busting entity on the force.

It was always the same: a case would be opened, and you’d be presented with miscellaneous artefacts to evaluate. You’d lick some rope and know, inexplicably, that it had been used to garrotte a 37 year old mother of two named Maureen, at three-fifteen on a Wednesday afternoon in July. You’d lick a wristwatch, and know that it had been worn by a loan shark named Fred, who wore horn-rimmed glasses and suffered from persistent sciatica.

This morning you held at arm’s length a perfectly inoffensive lollipop, seized from the pocket of a known criminal an hour or so previous, and who now sat in a room down the hall awaiting proper interrogation. He had been tight-lipped, and carried on his person nothing but the singular, mystifying confection.

*Well*, you thought to yourself, *might as well get a move on.* A tray of donuts was making its way around the main office and the sooner you finished, the sooner you could move onto more pressing matters. You leaned back and placed the round, dark candy into your mouth carelessly, letting it sit for a moment between your cheek and teeth. Suddenly your eyes went wide.

It tasted of honey, and chocolate, and almonds, and so many of the loveliest flavours you could imagine, all rolled into one. That’s what startled you the most - crime wasn’t supposed to taste good. It fact, it *never* tasted good. By all previous measures it could be musty, sour, bitter – always something tolerable, but never once had it been something appetizing.

As a seasoned veteran, nothing surprised you any more. On the one hand it was unnerving to be faced with something unexpected after hundreds of cases, but you certainly couldn’t deny that the prospect of a new flavour of detective business was more than a little bit thrilling. You quickly sat up in your chair, your heart racing.

Across the desk from you sat your partner, awaiting your latest verdict.

“Well, whaddya make of it?” he asked impatiently, the donuts evidently on his mind as well.

“It’s… it’s like nothing I’ve…” your voice trailed off, as the flavours swirled ferociously in your mouth, making it impossibly difficult to think.

Suddenly a junior constable burst breathlessly into the room, your eyes darting up towards the door.

“Smith,” he panted, “the crook - he’s a hitman. Whatever you do, don’t-“

His eyes fell to the stick in your mouth, now hanging limply to the side.

Just then, your throat began to constrict.",MagnetHat

You're now trying to break the curse by sharing the email with 5 people, all while a killer is stalking you.",WhoNeedsNostalgia,"My body tensed as I heard the glass breaking. I lived alone, so whoever this was clearly did not have good intentions. I was sitting on my couch, with nothing to use as a weapon within reach. My heart racing, I stood up and began to creep towards the stairwell, with the sound of the intruder’s footsteps echoing behind me. 

As my left foot landed on the first stair, a painfully loud creak could be heard coming from it. I heard the footsteps in the next room stop for a moment, then begin moving once again, clomping their way towards me, taking no pains to hide their existence.

I didn’t bother trying to be stealthy either. The intruder clearly knew where I was now, so I dashed up the stairs, as there didn’t seem to be any other option. Immediately the footsteps behind me broke out into a run as well, giving chase.

As I reached the top of the stairs, I made sure to knock over a conveniently place box, which I had left there earlier this morning, as I was packing for my move. Little did I know that it would become so useful mere hours later. 

I ran into my room and slammed the door shut, quickly shoving my bed against it, hoping that this makeshift barricade would keep this person out for at least a minute or two. I then grabbed my phone, noticing an email notification which I had ignored earlier in the day. The subject line was stated clearly, “Forward to your five best friends or die tonight!” complete with smiley face and “ok” emoji’s. I ignored the fourteen other messages, most likely from my mother, in order to deal with this much more pressing notification. 

This couldn’t be about his, could it? It didn’t matter, I quickly unlocked my phone and hit the forward button, quickly selecting my top five contacts, most of whom were work contacts. Oops. 

But before I could press the send button, the door slammed open, hitting me in the arm, and causing the phone to go flying out of my hand, smack against the wall, and fall to the floor in several pieces. I had been meaning to get a new phone for quite a while now, and if I got out of here alive, then I certainly would be doing so. 

But first I had to deal with this intruder who was standing in my doorway. I was unable to clearly make out the figure in the dark, but it seemed to be wearing a cloak, perhaps it was the grim reaper himself, coming to take my soul. 

I reached up to hit the light switch. I wasn’t going to die without at least seeing the face of my attacker. I was expecting to see something quite horrid, an ugly face, perhaps with some horns and maybe drooling for my blood. Instead I was greeted with something far more terrifying. 

The angry face of my mother.

She stood there, hands on her hips, her coat splaying out behind her, which explained the “cloak” I had seen earlier 

“Mom? What are you doing here?” I asked, still fearing for my life.
“Wilson, how could you ignore my messages? I’ve been worried sick? Why did you not reply to my good morning text? Do you know that this worry has been doing to me? Your father and I-“ 

Great. Now she was rambling. I really should have not ignored those messages from her, now I’ll be here for quite a while, listening to here scold me to death.

"[WP] you find a child in a basket on the side of the road, you take it into your care and later find out that it isnt a normal child",_HannibalHolmes81,"“You really shouldn’t be doing this, Andy.” An elderly ladies face was digitized on the screen of a laptop. She watched from the other side of the world as her son held on to baby and cooed sweet things in its ear. “There are orphanages, shelters,” The woman stressed her mind for alternatives, “Does China let you drop off children at fire stations like the US? That’s what you should do. You should give it to the authorities, Andy.” 

“It’s not an ‘it’, Ma. It’s a baby.” He tore his dark brown eyes away from the baby’s chubby cheeks for just a moment to look at his mother. “And besides, it’s late here. Nothing is going to be open and I’m not leaving it outside.” 
Even over the computer Andy could sense his mom judging his
choices. 

“Tomorrow then. Don’t even get it in your mind for a second that you’re keeping that baby, Andrew. I’m serious now. It’s not yours, you’re too young, and you have a job to do there. You can’t be distracted.” 

Andy rolled his eyes and looked back down at the infant. He was perfect. His black hair and untainted pink skin seemed to shine in his arms. He gurgled and small bubbles formed on the side of his mouth when he laughed. He was an innocent, most likely abandoned by a sinner. “I’ll call you tomorrow, Ma. Love you.” 

“Love you too, Andy. But I am serious-,” His mom was beginning to start on another rant when Andy reached over shut the laptop, eliminating her presence from the room. 

All he wanted to do was be alone with this baby. How anyone could leave him in a basket, in December, on the side of the road was beyond him. Andy had always heard of the “One-Child-Law,” or how China was notorious for their orphanage sizes. But to actually see an abandoned baby knocked him into a different reality. He had heard the screech of tires, distant cries of the child, and found it waiting for him, all bundled up, like the universe had sent him a gift. And it was a gift he planned on keeping. 

At twenty-two, he could do it. Why not? He had a job, a roof over his head, plenty of money to spend if he was wise with it. Andrew was kind, and loving, and had all the basics to become a great father. His female skills were a little rough, but that was no longer important, because with this baby he didn’t need a woman to make his fatherhood start. Maybe it was because he was lonely, in a different country on his own, but none of that matter now. Andy would never be lonely again. 

As the baby looked up to him with gorgeous almond colored eyes, his fists curled and he laughed happily up at him. Andy could have cried. Their whole lives started to play the longer he gazed down at the child. 

A first birthday, learning how to crawl, and first words. Even the woes of potty-training and sending him off to pre-school, Andy started to fantasize about. “What should I call you, hm?” 

The baby’s smile faded, listening to the question. 

“Are you a Cole, or a William? Maybe a Steven.” Andy weighed the options in his head as the baby continued to stare up at him. Watching him with calculating eyes. More was brewing under the surface than what showed on top. “Steven is a strong name.” 

He didn’t like it. “Ma!” Called the baby boy as clear as a bell.
 
Surprised, and a bit impressed, Andy tried to figure out if it was just a coincidence or if the child had just said his first word. “Ma?” He asked the child, “Did you like my, Ma? She’s a bit touchy. But to you, she’ll be Grandma.” 

“Ma!” The baby said again, looking seriously up at his soon-to-be father.
 
“What’s wrong?” Andy realized suddenly that he had nothing here for a baby. No diapers, food, or clothes. In his haste to get home and the infant out of the cold, he hadn’t stop to get any necessities. “Is it your diaper?” He asked, bringing the child up to his face to smell the area. 

Without missing the opportunity, the baby boy opened his right hand and placed it firmly against Andy’s cheek. 

The two became frozen for a moment. A single second unable to move forward in time. Slowly, and with great strain, the baby started to grow and Andy started to shrink. The pair were switching ages. Petrified by the boys touch, Andrew could not run or pull away. Something kept him in his place. Solidified until the act was done. 

What remained was a naked twenty-two year old man, and a baby boy lost in a sea of clothes. 

“My name,” said the new twenty-two year old as he lifted Andy out of his old clothes and held him in his arms, “is Ma.”

[WP] People are able to sleep for other people. This has opened up a new industry of professional sleepers that can be hired by those who may want to be active 24/7,beardeddragonborn,"My name's Cormack O'Donnell. I live alone on top of the highest hill in my town. Have lived here for about 50 years. People have seen me but they often say I don't exist. I'm just always working, 24/7, I never sleep. I'm like a spooky legend to them. but they respect my privacy and don't try to break into my house to find me, they know I'm here. They will rarely see me, or my family for that matter. Guess my secrecy runs in the family. They only ever see me when I go out to get groceries.
Some say that I live on a gold mine and that's why the professional sleepers are always there for me. They say I pay them and I'm always looking for more gold. But that's stupid. They also say I'm a ghost and I can only go out every other month, like a curse. Some think I'm dead, but others insist they have seen me every now and then. But like I said, those theories are all stupid. 
They also rumored that I go out to get groceries yes, but also to target my next victim. They say I'm a serial killer that uses his time to bury the people he kills. But then they say that I actually eat them. Of course that is absurd.
But you see, I found a trick in the system that allows me to keep my money but be able to stay awake forever. I'm using this trick and my time to find a way to stay awake permanently. You see those theories, although stupid, are actually pretty close. You never see my family. I killed them all. And I do kill other people, but not from this town. I get them to sleep for me. Then I stab them in the head. They don't know what happened. They just die. But they can only be used for a short amount of time. Then they will start to decay. And then I need more. The way to stay awake forever is almost complete. I just need more time. I think I might pay my grandmother a visit tomorrow.",ATeach13
"[WP] You pulled the trigger, time stopped.",johnblacksmith179,"I burst through the door and continued walking for a couple more seconds. Outside, what greeted me was sunlight, the desert, and the dome surrounding the laboratory. I walked the sandy ground with the gun in my left hand. I can hear the explosions coming this way. From above, I can see the sun shining its radiance through the glass dome that's protecting this area. Even with that protection above, I can still feel the heat of this barren wasteland. I must do this. I can hear them walking towards me.

""Jonathan!""

I turned around and faced them. There they are, the scientist couple. I tried recalling their names. The guy is probably Michael and his wife's name is probably Megan. They stood right there in front of the door I just went through. 

""What you're about to do wouldn't work! Quantum suicide is too complicated, you'll literally just end up killing yourself here!"" Megan shouted at me.

""This is my only way! This is my last chance to be with Laura again; to return to my home world! And besides, if what you're saying is true, then how could you explain what I told you on how I ended up in this apocalyptic universe?!"" 

""We don't know, but we can't risk another human life. Many have already died, we told you that! If you do this, we might never recover from what this world went through!"" Michael shouted at me.

""I'm willing to risk my life, to have a chance, no matter how small, to be with Laura again. I'm sorry for doing this. I'm also sorry for accidentally detonating the bombs."" I said to them.

I pointed the gun to my temple, but I heard a loud noise. It wasn't from the gun, it came from in front of me. We all looked up and saw the ground outside the dome explode. A shrapnel shattered the glass. In that instant, I shut my eyes, then pulled the trigger.

I opened my eyes and looked up. I cannot believe it. The shrapnel, it was stuck in mid-air. The glass pieces, they won't move. The scientists looked like mannequins while embracing each other, looking at the shattered section of the dome. Time stopped, and only I can move. FUCK. What went wrong?! I was supposed to go back! I was supposed to be in my universe! Now.... now I won't be able to return. FUCK! 
I fell to my knees and couldn't help but cry. I kept on weeping and weeping. But then, an idea crossed my mind. I grabbed the gun and ran pass the scientists, pass the series of halls and laboratory equipment, to the reactor of the lab. I pointed my gun, then fired.
The reactor suddenly glowed. The radiance engulfed my whole vision and suddenly disappeared, leaving my vision blurred. 

When my vision returned to normal, I looked around, only to see myself in a hospital bed. Beside me was a sleeping woman, leaning to the cabinet beside the bed.

""Laura?"" I said

The woman jolted awake. 

""Jonathan! You're awake! Thank God! I thought you'll die. I'm sorry for everything I've done before, for not being there for you. I promise I'll change."" Laura said as she hugged me tight.

""What happened?"" I asked.

""You were found in Remona Bay, the police have been searching everywhere for you since last week. The officers told me you almost drowned. It's been two days since we brought you here.""

""I thought, I lost you forever, Laura.""

""What are you talking about? I am the one who thought I'd lose you"" she said.

""it's hard to explain, but at least I'm back here now""

But unbeknownst to the both of them, deep beneath Remona bay, lies the broken dome, the shrapnel, the lab, and the scientists, still stuck in time.

Everyone is aware of this occurring, but no one questions it until your memory can't be wiped.",SingingWhileCrying,"“10… 9… 8…” everyone in the crowded living room chanted. They clutched their champagne glasses in excitement and anticipation. On the television in front of them, the ball moved slowly down toward its final destination. The mass of bodies in Times Square raised their own glasses and flasks up towards the sky.

“7… 6… 5…” Lorelai and Adrienne glanced at each other and grinned. This was it. Their new start. In just a few more seconds, they would be strangers once more. They would fall in love once more. Their whirlwind romance could begin again, for the fifth time.

Each of their friends held their phones tightly to their chest. Over in the corner, May finished typing a last minute note on the NYE application. As everyone drank the special champagne reserved for ringing in the new year, their minds would be relieved of every major event that had occurred in the past year. Political, personal, and so on. Only the basics would remain: name, age, and the current year.

Technology would receive its annual purge as well. Everything on the internet, all major media, news stories, historical evidence, would be wiped. The whole world would get its chance to start over.

With some addendums. The NYE app was the only piece of technology authorized to store a limited amount of information that a person could carry with them into the new year. Relevant medical history, relationship details, addresses. On her app, Lorelai had stored her checking account information, health insurance, and the contact information for her family and closest friends. Along with one other note.

Say hello to Adrienne Miller. You will fall in love for the fifth time.

“4… 3…”

Lorelai continued to look at Adrienne, enjoying the last few seconds of her memories. She was overflowing with joy and love for this beautiful woman. This would be their fifth year being together. But the beauty of the wipe was that every passing year was a new honeymoon phase. They could always rediscover each other. Follow the chase. Feel the rush. Fall, hard, all over again.

“2… 1… HAPPY NEW YEAR!”

Adrienne kissed Lorelai before they both pulled apart, distancing themselves slightly in their crowd of friends. Everyone in the room raised their champagne glasses in a toast, then knocked the fizzy concoctions back.

Lorelai closed her eyes, wrinkling her nose as the bubbles worked their way down her throat. She waited for the feeling of elation to hit, for the soft white glow that followed, blocking out everything. All the pain. The disasters. Everything bad, gone. A fresh slate, to build upon.

But the feeling didn’t hit. Lorelai opened her eyes and looked around the room. Everyone else was staring at each other in confusion. Together, almost simultaneously, they turned toward the television.

The crowds in Time Square were performing a similar dance. Millions of confused turns and stares played out on the screen. After a moment, the event announcer’s voice came through the speakers. Something about drug failure. Company scandal. Faulty technology.

Lorelai’s friends began to murmur, the large crowd breaking into smaller segments to discuss the implications of this worldwide failure. From across the room, Adrienne’s gaze met Lorelai’s.

Adrienne smiled weakly.

Lorelai’s stomach sank.

"[WP] ""Damn Son Where did You find This""",SpotlessEternalSun,"“And that, officer, is how I procured this decapitated head.”

Sgt. Foghardy stared in disbelief, wondering what exactly he was going to write in his report. In front of him stood a 17 year old boy who, despite the story he was just told, looked like the kind of kid you’d find if you visited a math camp. Scrawny, striped polo, jeans that don’t fit quite right, and glasses that looked straight off the bottom of a couple soda bottles.

Between them, on the front desk of the precinct, there sat a wet garbage bag slowly leaking its contents all over the countertop. A bloody mess would be an understatement. The boy had walked in with an eerie smile about 15 minutes ago and gently placed the bag on the counter while he asked for someone to take his statement. When Foghardy came to see the kid, he nearly threw up. In the bag was a human head, staring up at him. Its face was contorted into something almost resembling a smile. 

The Sargent had seen some gruesome things in his day, but this image took the cake. The boy seemed almost happy, almost like the head in the bag was a prize of some sort. He seemed almost over excited to tell the story of how he came about having such a trophy. As he began to speak, Sgt. Foghardy had a hard time listening, as he was too busy focusing on the mess in front of him, as if trying to analyse an Escher painting. 

Once he was over the initial shock, he noticed something about the decapitated head. It was thin, pale, and had glasses on that looked like they came straight off the bottom of a couple soda bottles. He looked up at the boy talking once more in time to hear his explanation.

“So that’s how I knew my cloning machine had finally worked! And that, officer, is how I procured this decapitated head.”

The leader said it as my latest find was tossed carelessly to his hands.

Three guns were aimed at me, my hands were raised. 

""What is it, Marlo?"" one of the dirty people asked. 

Her voice was almost gone, apparently she was hitting the Meth hard.

Drugs were common, and Meth could be made with the scraps that people find around houses. 

Marlo ran his hands over the object, and I watched his face to see if he understood the true value of what I had uncovered at a house at random.

""Iunno, man. Looks like a key. But a key for what?"" He looked at me.

""Beats me,"" I lied. I wasn't a very good liar, so there was a good chance that this Marlo person would see through it. 

He was a small gang leader, after all. He was probably used to scams, and scamming others. 

Marlo smiled, a gleeful, miserable, patronizing, smile. 

""You don't know what it is? And you kept it?"" he asked me.

One of them took a break from menacing me with a weapon to root through my pack. My belongings fell to the floor as he dumped everything out.

""Looked interesting, Marlo. What can I say?"" I baited. 

This was an insult. And brazen on my part. But with any luck I'd be respected a bit and might escape with my life. 

Marlo nodded to one of his people. 

They shrugged, and without flinching, swung the butt of their rifle into my stomach. 

As the air fell out of my lungs in a most painful fashion, Marlo spoke.

""We're not on a first name basis, there, scavenger,"" He approached me, holding the object in front of my face, ""What is it?""

There was a pause, and I knew another blow was coming. I raised my hand up.

""Wait. I just..."" my breath caught up, ""I was saving it for my son. It looked interesting. I just..."" doing my best at sounding desperate, ""I'm just a scavenger, trying to live. Please, have pity on me.""

I looked up. There was one of Marlo's people ready to lay into me with his rifle again. And Marlo, looking on with disappointment. 

""Well you won't be needing it. Cause you ain't goin' back home, scav,"" He said, and gave a quick nod to one of his.

I revealed my grenade that I had kept for just this occasion. I had pulled the pin and kept my thumb on the trigger mechanism. If I let go it would blow up. I hope they understood that, hopefully at least Marlo would know.

""Shit, you ain't no scav,"" Marlo smiled. 

The four of them watched me carefully, as I back away. 

""Don't worry, man. I'll find out what this key goes to,"" Marlo saluted.

So he knew the whole time, playing to the part of a dumb gangster, and me playing the part of a dumb scav. Two intelligent people had found themselves.

""Wait, he doesn't have kids?"" the woman asked.

Marlo slapped the back of her head.

""Shut the fuck up. We have a god damned key to the city right here. Just need to find out where it goes, and collect,"" he told her. 

I rounded a corner and only their bickering voices echoed off the ruins. With my grenade in hand I trudged away from danger. 

The key was for a relic of old world magic. Technology that could turn deserts into oasis'. A fabled item that might be able to fix the world. 

And it was in the hands of this, ""Marlo"". There was no way I could let that stand. But for now, I needed to eat. With no pack, and no tools, finding food was going to be tough.

"[WP] You stumble upon a hidden area in your grandfather's house. Inside is an assortment of weird and amazing objects. However, one particular item catches your attention.",SpotlessEternalSun,"The small, stony egg sits in its little stand, motionless. The light from a lamp is directed at it, illuminating a series of markings on its surface. 

A few days ago, my grandfather suffered a fatal heart attack and passed away, my family was left with inheritance to his old manor, I noticed that one of the books in the library was fake. I pulled on the switch and saw the bookshelf slide off to the side.

The door it hid was unlocked, I opened it into a large study filled with all sorts of strange things. The room felt like it was alive... a living creature, the definition of alien. 

I approached the desk and noticed the egg. It was rather pale. A small notebook was set beside it, I examined the pages and flipped to the start of the section he was writing.

""Unknown egg shaped stone.

The composition of this stone is unlike anything I have ever seen before, the markings belong to a language completely unknown to me. Tests indicate that the stone is completely indestructible below a certain layer, it's possible that there is a yet unknown organism being incubated within it.

How exciting, I have yet to conduct tests on a living organism. My plan for when the possible creature does emerge is to run tests to see what it reacts to and how. I will be taking blood tests, mapping bone structures and trying to provoke it into exhibiting any supernatural effects. 

I look forward to this, but my age is catching up to me very quickly. I may not see what may happen. Should I fail to see this, whoever may be reading this, I urge you to note down everything you can. At the very least name it.

I only hope I live long enough""

It ended there.

I was suddenly startled by a cracking sound. I looked over to the stone and saw it shuffle about in its stand. Its tip began to shed some of the stone encrusting it and the markings began to glow. A small, beak-like snout broke through the inner layer, pausing in the air before retracting. Small, 3-toed talons tipped with claws gripped the edges of the inner layer and tore through it, widening the hole further.

The creature within let out a silent growl and whine as it pulled itself up. A small, almost mixed between canine and feline head tipped with large ears and two budding horns emerged and looked at me with glowing yellow eyes. I had frozen, returning its gaze motionlessly. 

It tilted its head slightly and pulled the rest of its feathered body out of the egg and landed on the desk. It spread a pair of wings  and began to stretch itself. It kept its eyes on me and approached me curiously on four legs, a tail at least the length of the creature trailed behind it.

I gently stepped back, it stopped in its tracks with a light purple glow in its eye. I sensed a wary hostility. I noticed a small jar of spiced peaches, a favourite of my late grandfathers, and twisted the lid off. The aroma that wafted out seemed to distract it, it approached the jar with glowing yellow eyes and attempted to climb onto the lip of the jar, failing and merely leaning against the jar with a whine.

I gently reached down and grabbed a small plate, seemed clean. I gently grabbed the jar and pulled it away from the creature, the sound of its claws dragging down the glass was painful. I gently poured a chunk of spiced peach onto the plate, it approached and began to sniff it. It pulled back slightly and took a chunk out of the peach, swallowing and proceeding to devour the rest of it.

Afterwards, it looked up to me, juices dripping from its mouth, wanting more. I poured out a few chunks and watched as it ate them eagerly.

I set the jar down as it finished eating. It walked over to me, its eyes a dark green. I extended a hand, it tentatively stepped onto it, looking around as I raised it up. Carefully, I reached with my other hand and stroked its feathered back. I felt a series of soft vibrations, what I took to be purring of some kind. It looked up to my shoulder and lowered itself, gently flapping its wings before leaping onto my shoulder.

It turned around on my shoulder and nuzzled my neck, laying down and resting. 

I sat down, a big grin on my face, utterly surprised and taken back by the whole situation. Granddad would have loved this... god... still is a pain to know he's dead...

But... what should I name this thing?

I think... bah... harder than I thought...

Think i'll call you... ""Trico""...

[IP] Observation Deck,SpotlessEternalSun,"The capital ship warped out of hyper space and sat before the planet Earth. Grand Admiral Jones looked at the beautiful planet. From the command deck of the ship the Earth looked so quiet and peaceful. 

Granted the planet was peaceful, the most peaceful in its history. Mainly because almost all human life on it was wiped out decades ago! 

The only ones who were spared from death were the millions who lived in the off world colonies. Jones had only seen video and pictures of Earth in it's hay day. Those years before space travel where people lived in cities and suburbs and the only things they cared about were the people who played on things called ""reality"" Tv shows.

He watched as the science team fired off several probes to do a quick scan of the world below them.

""Report."" Jones bellowed. A medical robot and a young and beautiful sicence officer walked up to their leader.

""Sir, first wave probes show that the atmosphere can still support human life."" the robot said. The female science officer looked over her notes before speaking.

""It is unknown if Diaboli ex machina is still a threat or not. We wont know that until we send a scout team."" she said.

Diaboli ex machina was the name of the bio-weapon and unknown group unleashed onto the world. The name was roughly translated to ""Devil from Machine"" even though most Latin experts agreed that was the wrong words to use...

No one cares about that now. The bio weapon killed all those who couldn't find a way off the planet. 

""Send a team."" Jones said. The robot and the doctor both bowed their heads and walked away.

Jones sighed as he looked down at the blue planet. This world had to be safe. Humans were being chased off all the other planets they came to. If they couldn't live back on their original home world they they will sadly die off in these huge capital ships.

Jones silently prayed to any and all gods that would care to listen to him as he waited for the team's report.",BooDoug187

[WP]: Write about the happiest moment of somebody's life. Make it absolutely heartbreaking.,actually_crazy_irl,"His alarm sounds and he sits up mechanically. 

He feels tired yet, he wants to just layback and not have to go today, but he's already assisted himself through this. A set of clothes lay at the foot of his bed, his hair has been cut to make bed head easy to manage specifically for this moment, and there is a prepared breakfast burrito with coffee pot already timed ten minutes before his alarm. His phone rings and it says 'mom' on the ID, but he leaves it ring.

He is ready to finish his goal he promised today; a nice dress shirt, some pressed pants, shined shoes, and he was walking down his apartment hallway. He walks outside and almost slips on a ice patch, ""Mom is going to yell at my landlord, again."" He steps into a small snow drift and some it clung to his pants. As he sits into his car, he clicks his heels together to get any loose snow out, so it doesn't melt on his floor. In his passenger seat is his cap and gown, he has to be at the college in 30 minutes. 'No problem', he thinks as warms up his engine.

""Drinking, again?"" His buddy from class says as he walks up to him. ""It's alright, man. You'll do good today.""

He gets into place and waits as they walk out to their seats. It takes a few minutes, but he just thinks about everything in the past several years as he gets to the metal folding chair they have set out for him while they go through the ceremony of accepting their degrees. He thinks about his parents, his dad's choices, his mom's choices, his siblings, his part in all of it, his old house, and finally the accident. By the time they called his name, he was already crying. He walks up to the stand and looks out at his peers, all 500 of them have earned their degrees today, and he looks out at their family and friends, hundreds of people sit out behind them watching them accept their awards for completion in various academic fields. He walks up, and shakes the hands of his professors and other faculty members that witnessed. As he walks down he sees some of his peers as they smile and nod towards him. 

A older woman comes sauntering over to him before he sits and says, ""YOU DID IT!"" She smiles behind her spectacles.

""Can I call you mom, today?"" He says with his eyes full of tears. She looks taken back, but smiles.

""Of course!"" She wraps his arms around him.

""It was hard, it was so hard!"" He says as he sobs into her shoulder, ""Thanks for helping me. Feeding me. Letting me into your home. I don't know what I was doing, but I did it.""

""It's okay, you did it."" She says as she places her hand behind his head.

They get outside and she invites him over to eat at their house, but he declines and says, ""Maybe I'll come by later"". He shakes his friend's hand and watches as his Mom for today leave for their dinner. He gets in, puts his cap and gown back into the passenger seat, and watches for a moment as everyone leaves. All of them with their supporting families, he can feel the jealousy creep in slightly. As the car starts and goes into gear, he thinks of were to eat and opens his phone, and he goes to the nearest liquor store.

A bottle of Johnny Walker's Blue Label sits open next to some Chinese take out in the living room coffee table; he sits in the kitchen with a picture and his degree out, he flips it open and close, just staring at it.

""Isn't ironic that, you were an alcoholic and I am here drinking the day of my graduation?"" He says looking at the picture. ""I did it, I graduated today. Yet, I still wish you were here instead.""

He opens his phone and dials one, it rings once and immediately goes to voicemail. A woman's voice comes on, ""Hey, I'm not able to come to the phone right now, leave a message. If this is one of my children, call home, your mother worries.""

[WP]: Write about the happiest moment of somebody's life. Make it absolutely heartbreaking.,actually_crazy_irl,"Dazed, he felt as if he had just woken up from a long dream. A man walked up to him holding a bundle in his hands, and asked, “Would you like to hold her?”

The bundle was close enough now that he could see the contents. It was a baby, the sound of crying suddenly became clearer and clearer to him.

Nodding, he held his arms out. He almost felt his heart stop when he felt the baby lowered into his arms, she was heavier than she looked. The crying continued to swell and he looked at the nurse for help.

The nurse demonstrated a rocking motion and he mimicked it. A short time passed and with every repetition, the crying ebbed until it was silent in the clean white room.

She had her mother’s eyes. Beautiful green eyes that he got lost in. He gently felt the baby’s cheek with a finger and smiled when she cooed in response. A tap on his shoulder brought him back to reality. The nurse made a motion to ask if he wanted to hand her back.

Suddenly, he was aware of how sore his arms were. Rocking the baby back and forth had made him even more tired than he already was, but he shook his head. He felt as if he could hold her forever as looking at her face made him forget he was ever tired. 

A gentle voice called out to him. “Mr. Adams, would you please follow me”. He looked up and saw a doctor and he remembered why he felt so tired in the first place. Reluctantly, he turned to the nurse and motioned him over, placing his child in his care before going to follow the doctor down the long hallways. 

He was glad they closed her eyes. He wouldn’t be able to bear seeing those beautiful verdant eyes so full of life be glossy and still.  The doctor began to apologize, “We’re sorry for your loss, we did everything we could”, he continued on but the words were but white noise as he slipped back into his long dream. He felt like crying, but it took energy to cry and all he felt like doing was sleeping. 

After all was said and done the doctor brought him back outside. He began to drift towards the exit signs like a moth drawn to a flame when his eyes caught a man sitting on a bench holding a small bundle in his arms. Without needing to be told the nurse brought her over to him and he once again felt the weight of her small existence.

He was tired still, but he had much to do now before he could sleep.

Thieves spend a few years, murderers a few lifetimes, and then there's the guy who has been there before Satan.",Doesntfuckwithducks,"""What's that?"", Andy asked, scanning over a vast wall, etched with markings and names, a tally by each and every name. Some only had a few notches next to their names, others had thousands - names he recognised stood out with far more marks than the others, he was trying to count how many scratches were next to Ted Bundy before his curiosity was interrupted.

""That my friend is our next stop. The Salvation Scoreboard, Demon's Playtime, the Final Countdown - it goes by a lot of names down here but we just call it the Wall. Everyone does a little wrong in their life, this kinda keeps track and when the time comes, you're sent down here to pay your bill.""

Andy turned to face the figure who was enlightening him as to what he'd just been looking at, and still couldn't really comprehend that this was all relly happening, that this wasn't some sick dream.
Lucifer lounged in his large leather chair, feet - or rather hooves - crossed over and resting on his desk. In his hand he held a file which he didn't look up from while talking.

""Pay my bill? I don't understand, what did I do exactly?"" Andy pulled out a seat and was aware he'd been completely unsuccessful in keeping the stress and anxiety out of his voice when asking the question.

Lucifer looked up from the file, assessing the small, scrawny figure in front of him for a second, before placing the file open on his desk. Andy had a quick glance down and saw his name at the top before his attention was stolen by the gravelly voice of Beelzebub.

""Sins, Andy. You're here to pay for your sins. See those marks? Every time you do a bad thing up there on the big blue marble, we hear about it down here. Doesn't matter if you're spanking it alone in the middle of the desert, we know about it.
Every time we hear about you like this, you get a mark on the naughty list."" Lucifer smiled wryly, he never usually got to personally introduce people to Hell, and he enjoyed the sense of fear he could feel practically dripping from the pores of the 33 year old account manager in front of him.
""When time finally comes, you all gotta pay somehow - the worse you are, the more you pay. A little disemboweling here, some pits of Hell to swim in and you're all good to go upstairs to those Pearly Gates! Come here, look at this.""

Andy didn't want to go anywhere near the Supreme Leader of Hell, but he also figured that saying no wasn't really an option he was going to throw out there. Piss off the Eternal Torturer of humanity for the banter of it didn't particularly seem worth it.
He stood and walked over and felt insignificantly small next to Lucifer, even more so when a nightmarish red claw was placed on his shoulder. 

""Look up there. See that? That's my score"" Lucifer bragged, pointing down to his name, next to which were millions of scratches, stretching down into the pits of Hell as if some animal had clawed desperately at the wall, trying to escape - who could blame it, thought Andy, ""so we're gonna go down there and check out your name to see how long you'll be staying with us down here, and once that's sorted we'll find a pit to throw you in. Sound good?""

Funny bastard thought Andy in the most sarcastic tone he could muster, immediately regretting it in case the creature with it's monstrous paw currently sitting inches from his neck could read his mind. His head remained attached to his body and the beast didn't seem to notice so he concluded his thoughts were his own.

""Wait, who's that guy?"" asked Andy, pointing towards a name next to a clean section of the Wall, seemingly without a mark next to it, ""Why's there no mark for him?""

Lucifer sneered at the mere mention of the name, making no effort to hide the contempt he clearly felt for this individual. 

""Let's get one thing straight, I'm the worst down here. The King Of Hell, Lord of the Underworld! However, one day, and not any day soon so don't think you'll ever get out of here early, but one day my sins will be paid for and I'll have to leave this place."" His voice rising, as he argued his notoriety, clearly feeling as though he was being challenged by the mortal next to him, apparently unaware that his rising voice directly correlated to how close Andy came to pissing his pants in fear, ""so when that day comes, and I have to leave, somebody has to take over and demand recompense from humanity for their sinful lives. That beardy bastard upstairs knew this; he also is the only who actually has the power to inflict any torture on me while I'm down here, so he left a little gift for me when he cast me down here. My own personal torture.""

The entire time the Devil had been speaking, Andy desperately tried to make out the name next to the blank space, to see who was so legendary down here as to cause the Devil himself to get so clearly infuriated - as he leaned in closer, he heard a smash behind him and turned in shock to see a smashed mug and coffee on the floor by the desk that he'd been sat by minutes ago.

""You PETA loving fuck!"" screamed the Devil, pointing angrily at a small creature sat on his desk, seemingly unaware as to the outrage it had caused in knocking the mug off the desk.

""Here he is, the eternal torture set upon me by God himself! Making my life a nightmare to live through every day - Andy, meet Mr. Tiddles"" the Devil exclaimed, angrily gesturing at the cat innocently licking it's paw just above where the mug had once sat on his desk.",TheBlindside23

Daily he went out from the ruined tower of the once-shining Viridian City, he donned his armour, he put on his helm and practiced as was his routine. Daily he would feel the winds, harsh and dry, rustle through his hair and whistle through the woods, full of dead and knotted old trees. Daily he would sit in his tower, remembering his victories and thinking how little the were worth now.

Dawn. Another day, but one not to be like the others. He got up, did not don his armour nor practice as usual. He walked out of his tower in his shirt and trousers, barefooted. He looked like a beggar, not a heroic knight. He walked into the wasteland that had been his world.

Soon he came upon a dried up riverbed, but he cared not for he did not need to drink. He found the bones of some long-dead animal, but he cared not for he did not want for food. He found the blasted remains of a village, but he cared not for he did not need rest or sleep.

Many days and nights passed as the knight walked onward into what remained of his world. His meditations turned to prayers, for death and these, in turn, turned to curses. He cursed his long-dead gods, he cursed the world and those who had adored him. His life would never end, and nor would his torment, or so it seemed.

After one whole year, or so he thought, of walking he came upon a stone. It glowed faintly with a turquoise hue. He picked it up, felt that it was warm and held it close to his heart. He had perhaps found his salvation. The rune carved into the stone glowed brighter as he used a larger rock to sharped one end of it. After much work it was ready and he held the pointed tip level with his heart. He plunged the stone into his chest, the warmth spreading throughout him as blood oozed from the wound. He felt no pain, and, he hoped, would soon feel nothing ever again...once more he prayed for death...",calum_morton

Damn it! Curse his admittedly clever assassination failsafes! Why him? Why not some homeless guy who could be dispatched simply and easily?

Alarms sounded and what appeared to be wooden doorframes gave way to clashing metal barriers, shutting the house and dividing all the rooms like slicing cake. I couldn't believe it, I was discovered. The family room's TV switched on, and I came face to face with Arca Meyer.

""I love your enthusiasm, nice attempts, but unfortunately you won't have the time to negate my efforts. Sorry! Turn left, by the way."" I did so, and the wall clock greeted me. Midnight was in about three seconds. I swore to myself, heard a bleep as the egg-shaped device opened in his hand, and he gleefully pressed *Terminate.*

**10 HOURS EARLIER**

My briefing was finished and the danger level had been raised to much higher than before. It was an unprecedented incident in all of human history.

At approximately 11 PM, December 31, 2016, what looked to be a large blue egg appeared in the Samoa Islands next to a local. She reported later that immediately after holding it she thought of all the necessary information in a format she remembered exactly. Translated to English it was:

*This is Stage One of the great human cleanse: awareness. You are one of twenty-four randomly selected candidates to determine the future of humanity. Either continue as you are proceeding as a species, in full knowledge of your destructive capacity and the fact that the world will one day be brought to the end at your hand, or choose the smarter option to terminate your species as is. At midnight tonight you will be presented with your options. Once you choose, your planet's next hour will be given its device.*

She had gotten to the top of the political chain in about seven hours with an outspoken personality and extreme assertiveness, and was explaining the dead blue egg to the President of the United States of America as well as his cabinet, having pressed the *Continue* button six hours prior. That's where I come in.

My name is Jacob Benson, and I'm a secret agent. My team and I had been assigned to find and protect all of the eggs as they appeared. The general assumption had been that someone was perpetuating a worldwide hoax (the possibility of an individual one had been ruled out by the two subsequent hours' reports of the eggs appearing) until extremely recently, when the thirteenth device spawned in the air in front of a British hippie who didn't believe in humanity. The two agents assigned to recovery didn't get there in time.

We had been previously operating on the far-fetched belief that the worst-case scenario was that all the people in the world would immediately die. That possibility plus the seemingly psychic quality to transmit the same translated message telepathically to its holder made recovery a high priority. What we weren't prepared for was the entirety of UTC +0 to be erased from existence. An entire twenty-fourth of the earth sliced from existence, taking with it all of Ghana, Burkina, Belgium, and the Netherlands, as well as the vast majority of Spain, France, the United Kingdom, Norway, Sweden, and multiple African countries. In addition, all of its born inhabitants immediately disappeared. Without a sound, just gone. Poof, no matter where on the planet they were. Everyone else in the time zone was left to fall.

I had been in the States at the time, and the plan was changed. Planes were set up on time zone borders as fast as possible, to catch as many people as they could. All agents were also being tracked for retrieval. My next mission was laid in front of me.

**10 HOURS LATER**

I had succeeded in obtaining one egg from UTC -3, saving most of Brazil and Greenland, and was next assigned to Alaska. A different agent was in Hawaii in case the egg was detected there. They had a very distinct frequency even after being used, which the techs capitalized on our already-primed radar to detect.

Arca Meyer was a multimillionaire and had been informed of the eggs by the time one spawned by the man he was sitting next to. The man was unconscious and Meyer had been at his vacation home that straddled the time zones (which he was very proud to own) within half an hour. I had entered his home and shot him in the back of the head, only to find that the egg he was holding was fake, as was he. Apparently he had hired a look-alike for this exact purpose.

Fortunately I found myself more preoccupied with falling as I looked at layers of rock not one hundred feet away from me. The whole house was gone, but Meyer had been in some shed or bunker on the premises, or at least I had assumed so, considering he wasn't falling with me. I pulled my parachute and began gliding out from the edge of the time zone in order to make myself less difficult (read: less impossible) for the planes to reach. I had been assigned a lamp for this exact purpose. I clipped it to the front pocket of my shirt, closed my eyes, and flicked on the brilliant red light. I held them shut and drifted until I was deafened by an engine and felt netting underneath my feet.

The excitement was palpable in the air. Of course, 2016 was about to end, and what a bad year it was and we were all so ready to see it finish. There was so much bad coming from this year: the deaths of countless celebrities, the shootings, Brexit, Trump... hell, even this afternoon, a bunch of governments have mysteriously fallen silent, one-by-one. Countries like America, Brazil, Argentina, Greenland... generally all of the countries west of us. It's probably fine. It all turns out okay in the end. This isn't the end of the world, this isn't doomsday, this isn't a *termination*.

""Alright, everybody!"" A loud voice called through the speakers, ""Are you ready?!""

The cheers of the British masses formed an adequate response. 

""Alright! Let's start counting!"" The voice replied. It was loud, even without the speakers. It was male. His accent was English. From the North. York. Sunderland. Durham. No... Northumberland. The voice was from Northumberland. Nice place. From the sounds of things, he was in his mid-twenties. I wonder how much he's getting paid for a gig like this. They usually get celebrities in to do this, don't they? Has English pop culture become this dry? Oh, wait. Every worthwhile British celebrity is probably in America now, aren't they? Damn yanks. 

The hoards cried, all eagerly staring at Big Ben. 

""Ten! Nine! Eight! Seven! Six! Five! Four! Three! Two! One!"" 

Then, everything fell silent. No fireworks. No voices. Nothing. I turned over my left shoulder anxiously, goosebumps running up my arms. Everyone, and I mean everyone, was frozen in place. 

""Happy New Year, Tim."" The speakers whimpered, in the same voice the man from earlier used. 

""How do you know my name?"" I replied, coldly. My brain hadn't fully anticipated what had happened. Slight vertigo poisoned my vision. 

""Oh, Timothy Ian Krayak, born 12th July 1993 to an Edward Timothy Krayak and a Jennifer Sydney Krayak, I know everything. Your pathetic planet has no complexity, no nuance, no intellectual thought, no secrets. There are no locked doors to my touch, Timmy-boy."" The same voice replied. 

""What did you do to these people?"" I growled, my voice slightly rasping from fear. 

""I've frozen everyone. Everyone on your puny planet is constantly stuck in a state of immobility, even you."" 

""That's not true. I'm right here. I can move."" 

""Can you? Or is that just your perception of things?""

""Explain yourself.""

""Ooh, demanding things, are we?"" 

""Yes. You've done something, and I need to know what."" 

""I've telepathically linked with every single citizen on this earth, at precisely one second before midnight. Before the new year. What do you people call it? 2017? Yeah, that's the one."" 

""Telepathically?"" 

""Yes, telepathically. I've changed everyone's perceptions so that they are all frozen at one second to midnight. Try to keep up.""

""Why? Why did you freeze everyone?""

""Because, dear boy,"" the voice explained, ""I've come to give your sorry planet a choice.""

""A choice?""

""Do you fetishize repeating everything I say?!"" The voice snapped.

""What choice?""

""You have two options. Continue or terminate?""

""What?""

""If you choose to continue, your sorry planet lives to see another year. If you choose to terminate, every single lifeform on this godforsaken earth is dead come midnight."" 

""You expect *me* to choose?!"" 

""Oh, Tim, you narcissistic cretin, I expect your species to choose. Everyone on this planet gets a say. After all, your species does love democracy, despite its many flaws.""

""So everyone on this planet collectively decides whilst frozen. That's not just a choice, that's a vote.""

""Yes, Einstein, it is. Every person votes, and every country's votes are counted, and then, from every country's vote, comes the vote of your species.""

""So you're going to commit genocide on a species...""

""Only if they vote for it."" He cut me off.

""Why?""

""What do you mean?""

""Why do you want to play God?!"" I roared into the empty winter air.

""Because I am God."" It replied, declaratively.

""Bu-""

""Enough questions, Tim. Damnit, you are like this every year!""

""Every year? What do you mean?""

""Oh, yep, saw that one coming. I do this every year. Continuation requires me to delete the memories of those I questioned, so I can do this every year.""

""So this isn't our first meeting?""

""No, Tim, it isn't. I've known you since you were young. You were always the same curious bastard. So egotistical. So uninformed. Clever, but not wise. Even as a kid.""

""That's another thing - children. Do you ask them too? Babies? They get asked too?""

""Only those capable of higher thought are asked.""

""Oh...""

The chills never stopped. The speakers died out. There was nothing left here for me. Big Ben was still one second away from ticking. The people were still locked in place. These people could be burned alive in a single second. I saw the dead stare of a blonde-haired woman. She was beautiful. Such beauty would be a shame to be wasted. Only one thought lingered in my mind now...

"[WP] As each time zone reaches 11:59:59 pm this year, time freezes giving humanity two choices, ""continue"" or ""terminate"".",It_s_pronounced_gif,"New Year Eve, one of the world’s largest annual events, and I was spending my night in the arms of the man I love.  We sipped champagne and watched as the ball dropped ushering in not just a new day, but a new year.  We had agreed that we wanted to live eighty years, instead of one year, eighty times.  This was going to be a new start for us.

The Mayor began the countdown.  His voice echoed as he shouted, “Ten.  Nine.  Eight.”  

I gripped my love’s hands as a sort of butterflies flittered in my belly.  I liken it to being a child Christmas morning, how they might feel as they sneak from their bedroom to see what Santa might have left them.  He kissed my cheek from behind me.

“Seven.  Six.  Five.  Four.  Three.  Two.”  Before the Mayor could completely say one, the world frozen.  No, not like a blizzard, but time stopped and people stood in unanimated fashion.  

“Denizens of Earth.  Since your creation, I have watched you.  Once before I gave humans the choice I am offer you,” the mysterious voice said.  “Before I tell you this choice, I must say that I am woefully saddened by the way you behave and conduct yourselves.  Mankind was not meant to destroy every living thing around them.”

I swallowed down the words I was hearing.  Was this God or some alien race more ancient than our race?  Either way, the implications made me want to shrink, but I couldn’t.  Try as I might to turn and look to the one I love, I was as frozen as the next person.

The voice spoke again, “you kill others indiscriminately.  You murder animals not for sustenance but for luxury and fashion.  You destroy nature at its lowest form.”  The voice paused.  “Now is the hour of your reckoning.  Choose, to CONTINUE on as you have been or TERMINATE life as you know it”.

It went silent.  This was a silence I had never known before.  I was not sure if this was a hallucination or if what ever this voice has said, was meant to be taken serious.  Could I pick what happened to the whole world?  I agreed that things were bad, but we were capable of being better than this, weren’t we?

When time started again, whatever we had experienced a fraction of a second earlier was nothing compared to what we were experiencing.  The crowd of a million people gathered to see the ball drop was significantly smaller now.  Even my love was now gone.  Mass hysteria struck like lightning causing a forest fire.  Where had these people gone?  

In a moment, we had our answer.  A flier fell from the sky like ticker tape that read, The meek shall inherit the earth.  Those who had chosen to TERMINATE had been plucked from Earth and the rest of the crowd, myself included, would continue on, in hope that we could fix the sins of our fathers.",Svarmani

“Greetings, humans,” shouted a single voice. “This message is being broadcast to everyone in your planet, in a language they understand. Currently every human is experiencing slowed time. In your terms,” it said robotically, “we have all the bargaining chips.”

The sky looked grayer than it should have. I looked around Times Square (actually, I couldn’t move my eyes, so I could only see what was in front of me)—the ball was hanging motionlessly over the ground, ready to drop the final few inches and usher in the new year. People were clamoring soundlessly, frozen still as statues in the garden. Some stranger was holding their iPhone, ready to post their experience on social media, and the time was frozen—11:59. *Every one of them is getting the same bargain as I am*, I thought. *And none of us have any idea what the deal is.*

“Humans of Earth,” the voice continued, “we give you two options. They are ‘CONTINUE’ and ‘TERMINATE’. The former option will result in *status quo antebellum*, so to speak. If the majority of your country selects ‘CONTINUE’ then the inhabitants of your country will continue in the same unhappy life. If the majority of your country selects ‘TERMINATE’ then your old life will be terminated. You will become vassals of our planet’s people, and certainly you will be happier.”

“Let me explain for a moment. A record of your social media platforms shows immense unhappiness over the past year. You are one race yet you behave as if you are distinct species. And you have become so emotional over the deaths of those you do not even know, repeatedly.”

*RIP David Bowie*, I thought. *And Carrie Fisher, and—2016 has been a hard year.*

“Essentially we would take away your free will in some aspects, but reward you with others. As our vassal you would have access to all kinds of new technologies. You have come far, but your ‘iPhone’ is a wind-up toy compared to life extension software. Furthermore, our language allows you to speak more directly yet less hurtfully; with translation software you could perhaps live as one unified people. Thus you are being a good citizen if you choose ‘TERMINATE’.”

“That said,” it concluded, “I am required by intergalactic law to give you the option of ‘CONTINUE’ without the threat of war. So choose wisely, humans. And remember,” it said, with the audible equivalent of a smirk, “do you really want another 2016?”

The voice brought up a good point. Am I being a bad citizen if I accept the status quo? Why would I choose continue? Comfort? Was I being averse to change for no reason? And did I want another 2016? Would I be prepared for more memes, more celebrity deaths, more hate-spewing rhetoric on all sides? Surely I should choose ‘TERMINATE’.

And yet—the connotation of the word ‘terminate’ gave me pause—free will. I had learned in English class, over a philosophy debate, that free will defined humans. But was that true of a world with free aliens? Either way, America was a country defined by free will. Wouldn’t I be a better citizen of my country if I chose to continue? But as a citizen of my planet…

I couldn’t choose. I was paralyzed. What was said was probably just propaganda, but… I wanted to believe. I closed my eyes and imagined extending my hand toward an invisible button and pressing it. Then I opened my eyes.

The world was exactly the same. I couldn’t believe it! Were these people averse to change? Were they just heretics? I was fuming at them, the ball shattering behind me as I speedwalked to my car.

It was an uneventful drive. The last thing I heard on the radio as I drove home was this:

“The recent experiment, known as the ‘Terminate Incident’ or ‘Terminategate’ was a fraud. We are unsure how time was slowed, but we have been anonymously emailed the results. To keep the public order, we choose to keep these documents secret until further notice.”

It may seem sad that we would be so angry, but ask yourself, reader:

What would you have done?

""Not good enough,"" muttered Nine-Eight. He tapped a fist against the side of his chestplate, dotted with blaster burns and small gashes. Before he could even look back to Otto, a soldering iron was at his jaw hinge, and a rough hand kept his neck against the seat. ""AHHHH! SON OF A BITCH!""

"[WP] ""What's your answer?""",RidiculousRedRabbit,"""So..What's your answer?'' General Reed asked, standing in front of the man strung from the ceiling by chains on his wrist. They were in the underground of a defunct military outpost in a damp, dimly lit chamber used for torture and interrogation. Blood stained the stone cold concrete and the room had the perpetual lingering smell of death and excrement. 

Zack struggled against the chains. His toes grazed the floor and the strain of his weight was starting to fatigue his shoulders. He hoped they didn't dislocate before he was done toying with Reed, he would need them for his task.

''I'm sorry Lieutenant Captain"" Zack said mocking the Generals rank while cocking his head to the side smiling ""can you ask me that again?"" 

Reed smiled a cold, steely smile and threw a blindingly fast punch to Zack's stomach. Zack grunted. The punch did not hurt Zack, his conditioning, body, mind and were in perfect form, yet he had to play his part. ""I was told you would be difficult"" General Reed said while landing two more punches to Zack's face. 

""Ohhhh"" Zack said ""thanks for jogging my memory with those baby hits to the noggin"". “You wanted to know if I would give up the location of the Rebel Base of Operations since I am the leader or die."" Zack laughed, he was almost free from the chains. Just few more moments and the General's blood will be painted on the walls.  ""Well, I'm gonna have to choose death by default..your death"" Zack said suddenly stern. His frosty blue eyes narrowed and fixed the General with a death stare. Zack perfected this look. It was the last thing his enemies saw before he snuffed the life out of them like a flame in the wind. 

The General gave Zack a quizzical look and a flicker of fear ran across his hardened face.  

""It’s shame really"" Zack said coolly, his demeanor changed. He was no longer defiant and cocky. He was calm and emotionless still fixing the general with his unblinking stare. ""You rose in your military ranks to achieve General, yet you interrogate me yourself. A grunt could do this trivial task."" ""Now you will die in a dark room alone, and be remembered as the Man who lost the best advantage the United Command had in the War."" 

BOOOOM!!!

A Resounding blast shook the room and bits of rubble fell from the ceiling and Zack’s chains rattled. He felt the chains slack and he was no longer partially suspended. The General preoccupied by the explosion noticed none of this. He pulled out his communicator and shouted into the receiver. 

“ALPHA ONE ONE SEVEN, THIS IS GREY EAGLE! WHAT WAS THAT? STATUS REPORT! OVER!”  
The General only heard static as a reply. Meanwhile Zack could hear the muffled sounds of gunshots, explosions and yells echoing above them. The flicker of fear ran across his face again. Zack smiled. The General shouted again. 

“ALPHA ONE ONE SEVEN! DO. YOU. READ!!”. “THIS IS GREY EAGLE! STATUS!”… 

“WE ARE UNDER ATTACK, SIR! THE REBELS ARE HERE…THERE IS TOO MANY WE HAVE TO FALL BAC-ARRRGGHH!…”. The line went dead and the sound of static remained. The General lowered the communicator slowly and turned to Zack. 

“What have you done!?” he said hotly “I WILL MURDER YOU!!!! and mark my words I WILL bring down this uprising!!!” he yelled drawing a pistol and aiming at Zack.  

“YOU DESERVE WHATS COMING TO YOU LUCIEN CASTLE!!” Zack shouted back. The General paused at the mention of his proper name. 
“How do you know my name?” his pistol was still aimed at Zack, but his hand was unsteady and his eyes were bulging. The General was fully afraid. All Military bearing was gone. His men lay likely dead above him surrounded by enemies. He was alone with a crazed man who knew his name. He never told anyone his real name and he wiped his past away long ago and emerged as Howland Reed the noble graduate of the United Command Academy not Lucien Castle the Outlaw

“I know everything about you” Zack said. He yanked the chains from ceiling and they fell with a clang on the cold concrete floor. “Ahhh that feels much better” Zack said shaking the clamps off his wrists. “I know you used to be a Space Outlaw” Zack said pacing back and forth. “I know you robbed and killed innocent people for power”. “But I got to know you personally when you robbed and killed a man in cold blood in front of his 10 year old son 25 years ago.” Zack said coolly. 

The Generals eyes widened even more. He remembered this particular incident. This man was a threat to his business. A Bounty Hunter who was making a name for himself for being the best there was. Reed found him and the man pleaded for him to not harm is son. Reed obliged but shot the Hunter in the head.  
Reed then said to the boy with frosty eyes ‘’remember my face boy, this is the face of death, you will see it again someday”…. 

“You told me” Zack said stepping towards him “your face was the face of death, I never forgot you, and the day you murdered my father was when I decided you will die by my hands, even after the United Command wiped your identity and gave you clemency in return for outing the known Outlaws in the galaxy and the chance to serve as penance for your crimes…I never forgot the face of death” Zack said his frosty eyes blazing. Your organization is corrupt and not only will I bring you down, I WILL SHAKE THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE UNITED COMMAND AND BRING IT TO ITS KNEES” ZACK yelled. 

“DIE!” Reed fired the pistol at point blank range. Zack dodged with superhuman agility and countered with an uppercut to Generals Jaw sending blood and teeth flying. The force of impact from Zack fist lifted the General off his feet and sent him flying into the concrete wall. His head slammed in to the stone leaving a trail of blood as the generals body slumped down the wall onto the floor. The pistol clattered to the ground and Zack dismantled it with stomp.  

The General was semi-conscious. Blood was gushing from the wound in his head and his mouth was leaking blood staining his pristine uniform. Some teeth were clinging to his jaw the others were strewn about the room. 
“P-Please..dont..dont..Im..s-s-sorry” His breathing was ragged and his eyes were rolling. 

Zack knelt next to him and grabbed him by the color. “LOOK AT ME” Zack yelled. The General bloodshot eyes snapped on to the Zack's menacing blue. 
“Look at my face Lucien Castle, this is the face of death” Zack said softly. A tear rolled from Reed eyes. 

Zack plunged his hand into the Reed chest and pulled out his heart. The General let out a faint gasp. Zack watched the life flicker from his eyes like a flame in the wind.

What have we become  

Why have we grown apart

We were supposed to fight the world  
Side by side  

Pushing and pulling until we won  
Because they were wrong  

They were wrong  

So then why do you feel so distant now  
When you're with me it's like time slows  

We enjoy the company  
One another close and telling everything that has happened  

And ever will   
Never wanting to leave  

So why do you push me away  
Do you want me gone  

Do I want you  
There or not  

Side by side  
Or forgotten to memory  

Decide for me  

We were going to prove them wrong  

It felt so normal  
We fixed things  

Never faded  
So when did we  

When did we fall apart like the sun yearning for the moon  
When did we give up our fight to shine in the same sky  

The same time of day  
Who showed up late  

Who didn't show up at all 

Bathed in moonlight  
Blinded by sunlight  

What happened  

Who are we  
What were we  

We were going to prove them wrong  

So please  
Just once more   

I don't know how much more I have to give

I've given  

I hope you have too

Philip rubbed his pitched trousers in glee as he searched his favorite tube site, laptop beside him on the couch. He had waited all day for these moments; work was always hard. His boss chewed him out after he sneezed in the deep frier and his headaches never went away.

He stopped and hovered over a link. “HARDCORE Bukkake compilation. Best of 2016.” The girls were crying and wide-eyed. *Maybe something intimate* Phillip mused head, scrolling away.

He stopped at a video that caught his attention. “Girl next door.” The title was intriguing, it promised reality. He clicked and bit his lip, the dark room turned flesh color, brightened only by the laptop. 

The video started right on the action. There was a big hunk of a man talking dirty to a girl that, admittedly, could have lived next door.   Phil was into it and as he zipped off his pants he paused. *Huh, they have my couch.* A strange coincidence but it was from Ikea so Philip explained it away as the bottle in his hand farted out lube. The cameraman zoomed away from the action; a poster of anonymous English countryside came into view. Phil recognized it. He turned to look above him, craning his neck towards his anonymous stretch of English countryside hung on the wall. With one hand balancing the laptop, he stood up and walked to where the cameraman was. He compared the scene with his home. *… That’s my rug too. And that’s my side table. My lamp.*

All at once Philip dropped his computer and a freight train of memories assaulted his psyche. *My directorial debut. The girl lived next door. My second film, behind the Sizzlers. My third, in the backroom of James’ house.* Phil collapsed to his knees throwing his hands to his head trying to block out the pain. The lubed slapped to his face, the sound triggering more memories of balls againt backdoors and giant tubes of lube being wheeled onto set.

“WHO AM I!?!!” Phil screamed his arms at his side, tears and lube streaming down his face.

“We thought this would happen one day.”

Phil was barely moved by the sound of the gruff stranger’s voice. He was surprised, to be sure, but the voice was familiar and his damaged brain did not jolt him in surprise.

“Who am I?” Phil whispered to the shape in darkness, the fleshy light extinguished by the fall. 

“You learned too much Jackhammer.” The name brought back more memories.  Coke on mirrors. Men in suits. Hairy gooches in a wide-angle lense. *The suits* Phillip grasped at an important memory. *The meeting with the suits, they were government. What did they want?*  Philip remembered the meeting all those years ago, the suits, the briefcase, all that money…  *What did they want*

The man stood, Phil hardly noticed as he walked towards him, his mind was still trying to search through a sea of penises to remember what they wanted. “Goobye old friend.” A cumshot went off in Phil’s head as everything turned to black.

"[WP] a group of kids are camping in a forest and end up being hunted by a psychotic killer, everything is going fine for the killer except when he grabs one of the kids who says"" I've been looking for you"".",I-tripped-of-a-cliff,"   He looked into the kid's eyes and a shutter ran down the length of his spine. For twelve years he had been afraid of this day. HE, the man who single handedly murdered no less than 50 campers in this godforsaken forest felt uncontrollable fear for the first time in his life. His biggest and most costly mistake had led to this terrifying moment. In an instant he remembered that moment all of those years ago...

   He had snapped. *I faithfully work for the National Forest Services for 5 years and they fire me out of NOWHERE because of 'budget cuts.* He trudged through the forest desperate to find one of the lowlife wretches who sponge the free park spaces he worked so hard to keep pristine. *I'm gonna find you, and I'm gonna kill you. I'm gonna watch the life leave from your eyes.*

  Suddenly he heard voices in the clearing above. A devilish grin split his grim face. *This is going to be fun.* Jumping from the bushes he sprang upon two men and a woman. Before they could even react to his presence, he sliced the first man from his left shoulder, to the right side of his waist. Then just as the second man began to cry for help, the blade met him directly in his throat. Then he turned to the woman and to his surprise she wasn't running. Additionally, she wasn't screaming or cowering in fear. Instead she was staring at him, a seductive smile on her face. ""My oh my,"" she breathed, "" I can't tell you just how sexy I find a crazy man.""

   Both stunned and confused he looked into her eyes. In them he saw the craziest and most psychopathic shade of green he had ever seen. He imagined that the crazy in her eyes matched his own. She slowly approached him, removing one article of clothing with each few steps. "" Crazy is supposed to make for a fun time, lets see if thats true."" Completely naked and smiling, she finally reached him. She put her hands on him and...

He blinked as hard as he could and once again looked into the kid's eyes. There they were, that same crazy and psychopathic shade of green. His worst and only fear flooded every inch of his body, and then the young kid spoke again. ""Dad. I finally found you!""",LukeCrane

""I thought the killer was in Vermont,"" she whimpered.

Jake shrugged. ""I guess he thinks his daughter's murderer is here instead.""

""He's crazy! The news said that his daughter hung herself. It said that no one else was in the forest with her, and a lot of people said that she was suicidal.""

""We shouldn't have gone camping,"" Isabelle whispered.

""Shh. Don't let the killer hear us,"" Dave whispered back.

""But you're whispering too.""

""Shh!""

For a moment, there was quiet. Then they heard a derisive laugh.

""You thought you could hide from me?""

The sound of crunching leaves became louder.

""Run!"" Dave shouted.

The four kids burst from the greenery.

The killer laughed again and chased after them. ""So the game continues.""

They ran until they stopped abruptly by a wide, rushing river.

""I can't swim,"" Isabelle choked out.

""I don't think any of us can."" Dave frowned.

""Even if we did, it would've been too dangerous. Look at the current.""

Behind them, the killer finally reached the kids and grabbed Jake by the collar of his shirt.

""Jake!"" Isabelle screamed.

""Finally caught you kids,"" the killer laughed. He pulled out his knife.

""What do you want from us?"" Anna asked, her voice wobbling a bit.

""Justice.""

""We didn't know your daughter, I swear!""

""Then how do you know about her?"" the killer shouted.

""It's all over the news!""

""Liar! Where are you hiding him?""

""Who?!""

""My daughter's murderer!""

""He's not hiding anywhere. In fact, I've been looking for you.""

The killer glared at the boy he was holding. ""You know where the killer is?""

""Jake, what are you doing?! Are you crazy?!""

He ignored Isabelle and continued. ""Yeah, I do. He's right here.""

""Who? That boy?"" The killer let go of Jake and approached Dave, knife pointed at him.

Dave widened his eyes. ""What? No!""

""No, not him,"" Jake said.

""Then who?""

""Me.""

""You?"" The killer laughed. ""You look like you couldn't hurt a fly.""

Jake laughed. ""I bet your daughter thought that, too, until I kicked the chair underneath her and refused to save her. You should've seen her, kicking her feet in the air and struggling to breathe. It was hilarious.""

""How dare you!""

The killer approached Jake with a murderous look on his face.

Jake began to run, and the killer followed.

Completely focused on Jake, the killer didn't see the thick tree branch by his feet.

He tripped and let out a cry of pain.

After a moment, Jake approached the killer, who was lying face down.

A pool of red was spreading beneath him.

The other three kids slowly approached them.

""Is he dead?"" Anna asked.

""I think so,"" Jake said.

""Anna, Dave - can you two go get some help? I'll stay with Jake,"" Isabelle said.

They nodded and ran toward the forest ranger station.



Hours later, the four kids left the police station, having given their statements.

Anna looked at Jake. ""How'd you know the killer was going to trip and fall on his own knife?""

""I didn't. I just hoped that something would happen.""

""Making fun of him and pretending to be his daughter's murderer was a really smart idea. I never would've thought of that.""

Jake shrugged. ""It just popped into my head.""

He fell silent as he thought back to that day. Leading her to the forest, building on her suicidal thoughts, and kicking the chair out from underneath her.

After a few seconds, she had begun to beg him. ""Never ... mind ... I don't ... want ... to die ... save ... me.""

Jake had laughed and turned to walk away as she continued to plead with him.

Reports show-""

The radio host's too cheery voice cut to static as a frazzled camp counselor fiddled with the dial, shifting through stations until finally settling on a mindless pop song.

""Enough of that! No need to worry kids! The filth of the city is far, far away! Tonight we sleep under the safe and pristine solitude of the stars!""

There were four kids this time around signed up for his 'Weekend Adventure Camp' which promised fun and excitement in the great outdoors. In reality this camp counselor was a glorified babysitter. Rich parents who needed some time alone dumped their kids with him for a weekend. The parents get peace and quiet, and he gets a nice $200 check from each snot nosed brat.

""What about cougars?"" One kid asked a in a voice too innocent, too casual, too mature.

'Give me a break, kid,' the counselor thought to himself as he sighed heavily. This kid had been giving him problems all weekend, scaring the other kids and just generally making everyone uncomfortable. When he wasn't scaring everyone else shitless, he seemed distracted. It was almost like he was waiting for something to happen. 

""C-cougars?"" another more jumpy kid stuttered.

'Oh great.'

""Not to worry, children! The warm flames of the fire will keep the wild beasts away! You have absolutely noth-""

The words of reassurance died in his throat as he looked at the red-dripped knife protruding from his chest. The children didn't know what to do for a full second. Then, the screaming started. The counselor fell to the side as the children split up into the dark woods all fear and flailing limbs.

""I wonder if they know the screaming just makes it easier to find them..."" A darkness hidden man asked the camp counselor who was losing blood fast. The figure ripped the knife from the man's back and watched as he bled even faster.

The shadowed figure stepped into the flickering light of the once peaceful fire. You would have expected a killer's outward appearance to reflect his disgusting nature, but the man was handsome. It actually made his job that much easier. People trust a pretty face, however flawed he proves that logic to be. 

He listened for a moment to their echoes in the night and smiled at the camp counselor who lay there too still.

""Back to work!""

Rounding up the first three kids proved to be easy, but the last one was giving him trouble. He ended up walking back towards the fire to get his bearings, when he sees that the kid is sitting there with his back to him.

'Seriously?' the killer thought to himself. 'Too easy' 

He snuck up to the kid, happy to finally have found the last one. With this, he could finally go back to his normal, pre-serial killer life, but before he can grab the kid he hears a bone-chillingly familiar voice.

""I've been looking for you."" The boy stood and turned to face the killer. He was outlined by the flames of the fire, his face indistinguishable from the dark.

No.

""It's the last night, almost midnight.""

Please, no.

""Begging won't help.""

He had been talking out loud?

""Regardless, the deal was for 15 souls and you got 14. So, so close. The closest one so far, but it wasn't enough."" 

The killer started shaking and looked at his blood-stained hands and clothes. All that killing, all those lives. His sacrifice. Everything was for nothing.

""Come now, into the fire, it will provide the most direct link.""

The killer thought briefly of running, but he knew it was useless. Soul-weary, limbs heavy. He stepped into the flames. 

The fire consumed him.

""On July 17th, 1994, you were caught while trespassing, burglary on your mind. Tell me, what happened next.""

He froze for an instant, recognition dawning slowly.

""I said tell me!"" I screamed, slapping his face. I could barely see anything right now, and didn't even notice his mucus on my hand.

""I,"" he tried to begin. ""It was a bad time for me. I was on drugs, as much as I could get. I resorted to theft, robbery, burglary, whatever I could do to get money to fuel my addiction. I don't remember that night, specifically. I am sure I was high on something."" He paused for a moment. ""I killed people sometimes. Did I kill someone then?"" 
His eyes begged me to answer for him, to find that as a reason for this situation.

My fingers tightened around the pistol on my jacket pocket. 
""Wrong answer."" I began to pull the gun out.
""No. Please stop!"" He screamed. ""Tell me what you want me to say."" His choking sobs echoed in the warehouse.
""You killed a woman, do you remember? But she wasn't alone in the house that day. Her son was there. You..."" disgust was in my voice. ""You made her son watch as you killed his mother in front of him. In front of ME!""
The gun was pointed as his face now.

He was still crying, looking down at his son.
""I, I am sorry. Please don't kill my son for my sins."" 
The boy was stirring slightly.
""Take my life, I willingly give it to you. Just please let my son live. He was what changed me. When he was born, I was reborn. I have been clean. I have tried my best. Don't let him pay for my actions.""

There was a sincerity there, I could see. The look or repentance. I believed him.
I set the gun down on the table, reached for the tape recorder and pulled the disc out. 
""With this, I forgive you. Hope the court is as lenient as I am.""

And I walk out of the room, my feet echoing behind me. 
He would finally have justice. I spin the disc in my hand. A full confession.

"[WP] When you were little a robber killed your mother in front of you and, you noticed a glimpse of his face. 15 years later you see that man with what appears to be his child",IBREAKCHAINSFOFKARMA,"I sat, numb, at the kitchen table of my modest one bedroom flat, staring at page 7 of The Sunday Herald, bottom left corner.  A photograph captioned ""The Budget Bludgeoner Released!"" followed by a small summation of ""15 years after the brutal murder of Carol Jefferson, killer John Harkins is released from Broadmoor Prison.  Carol was stabbed 32 times in her home in South East London during a suspected robbery, of which the killer reportedly took just £20"".  

The photograph upset me more than the words.  This was not the photograph I had seen on the news at the time, the typical post arrest mug shot.  This was a picture of him smiling, being human.  My eyes traced the picture from his undeserving smile down his arm to where he was holding hands with a child, whose face was blurred to preserve anonymity.

That's all it took for the memories to flood over the damn I had spent so long building and reinforcing.  I was three at the time and consider it to be my first memory, albeit vague.  The blood, the screaming then the silence.  I remember lying at my mothers side, God knows for how long, until a Policeman ran through the open door.  I remember, thinking back, how the officers shoulders dropped.  Pity, that's what I remember.  

Later that day, my phone, which was resting on the arm of my chair, began to ring, and without hesitation I answered, thankful for some company.  It was Jane.

""Hi David"", she said, in her professional voice, although I detected a vague undertone of pity which I resented.

""Hi Jane"", I replied, slightly regretting answering now.

""I would hazard a guess to say you know?"", she said, her occupational mask slipping enough to offer some compensatory warmth.

""Yeah, I read it in the paper this morning"" I said, trying not to show my emotive hand.

""It's been over a year since our last session, David, but it may be worth a few more in light of today.  I know we made good progress, but progress is not resolution"".

""I know, I'll think about it, I just need some time to myself first, let things settle"".

""I don't think time is something you can afford, David.  They called me this morning to let me know he was released.  As a professional courtesy they also gave me his address as they thought it was important, and I have to agree""

""Listen, Jane, I'm past it all, honestly.  I just want to forget and move on wi-""

""David, just listen, please.  He was released to an address two streets over from you.  100 meters as the crow flies.  Usually I wouldn't share information in this manner but you cannot see him before you see me, you could regress"".

I was struck by an emotion I couldn't quite place.  Was it fear? No, fear had been common in the years following my mothers death, rotated from foster home to foster home.  Anger? Not quite but closer.  

""What street"" I said, keeping as calm as possible.  I realised I was picking at old scars caused by cigarette burns and neglect at an age I was too young to recall.

""David, that is not a good idea you can't-""

""Listen, I just need to know where.  I need to know which street to avoid.  I walk to work and I can't risk seeing him"" I hoped this was enough to pry the information from her.  She was smart, but, like every professional felt a deep seeded need to have her rhetoric validated.

""42a Castle Fields, remember, David, I am a phone call away if you need me""

""Sure, and thanks, Jane"" I said, hanging up.  My heart felt as though it was about to leap out my chest.  I need to see him, I thought.  I knew Castle Fields well.  It was directly on my route to work at the Post Office and part of my round.  In fact, I could remember the exact apartment.  Always final reminder or overdue letters, a sign that the last residents had done a flit.  A thought ran through my head that caused my hands to tremble.

I had, without any real thought, already got out of the arm chair I was sat in, and must have been pacing during the phone call as I know found myself in my bedroom.  I looked at the alarm clock on my bedside table, it read 3pm.  It was Sunday, but a postman doing his rounds was so synonymous with the banality of life that it would not look out of place on a Sunday.  I took my uniform out of the wardrobe and quickly dressed.  My pace quickened with my thoughts as I nearly broke into a jog moving through to the kitchen.  I took a large can of beer and finished it in several long swallows.  Grabbing my mothers locket out of the kitchen drawer I kept it in.  Time to go I thought.

I left my apartment and walked briskly to Castle Fields.  100 metres as the crow flies was a fairly accurate estimation I thought, trying to focus on being as rational as possible.  I entered the stairwell for the apartment block which contained 42a.  It was happening, I thought.  I rounded the landing at the top of the last stairwell which led to his apartment.  I took a deep, long breath as I stood outside the door, an internal light illuminating the bottom of the door and stained landing carpet.  He was in.  I closed my eyes and knocked.  Footsteps forced disjointed floorboards to moan as someone approached, the handle twisting reluctantly.  I opened my eyes, and there he was.  His face distorted by age, but still recognisable.

""Hi Dad"" I said, tears blurring my vision as I fell into his arms, my hand clasped round the locket he had gave me to keep the day he rescued me.

""It's over now, son"", he said, his words cut by a trembling chest.",left-noir

"[WP] You have been asked to make an english translation for a tale of your choice, turns out that does not involve a notable amount of tweed jackets and tea.",PmMeSomethingYouLike,"Once upon a time, in the middle of the New Forest, there lived three bears: a Mummy Bear, a Daddy Bear, and a Little Baby Bear. (The fact that bears have not for a long time been native to Britain made certain members of the nearby village tut from behind their copies of the *Daily Mail*, certain that it would be this of all things -- and not the fundamental class inequality of the medieval-style fiefdom under which they all toiled -- that would bring about the downfall of society, but that is currently neither here nor there.)

One day, the Three Bears sat down to breakfast, specially prepared by Mummy Bear for the occasion. 'What's this I smell cooking?' asked Daddy Bear, his stomach letting out an almighty growl. 'Frightfully sorry about that,' he said immediately afterwards, because as everyone knows, manners maketh bear.

'It's porridge,' said Mummy Bear. 'Three bowls full, fresh from the stove. Isn't that nice?'

'Oh,' said Daddy Bear. He had been dreaming of a Full English Breakfast: plates piled high with bacon and sausages and eggs and beans, and large round circles of black pudding, the taste of which he enjoyed but the contents of which he did his best not to think about. He sat down anyway and tried his best to look enthusiastic. But not *too* enthusiastic.

*How rude*, Mummy Bear thought, but merely sipped her tea and made a dissatisfied, bearly-audible tutting noise. She took a spoonful of her own porridge and gasped out loud. 'This will *never* do!' she said. 'This porridge is *far* too hot!'

'Such a shame, such a shame,' said Daddy Bear, already reaching for his coat. It was an unnecessary addition, being covered in fur as he was, but what would the neighbours think otherwise? 'Shall we go out for a nice breakfast then?' he asked, by this point even being willing to settle for a bowl of whatever-the-hell Kedgeree was supposed to be if it meant avoiding porridge. 'Perhaps a drive to nowhere in particular? Or a trip to IKEA even though it will make us all frustrated and we don't actually need anything for our charming, rustic cottage?'

'Certainly *not*,' said Mummy Bear. 'There's starving children in Africa, you know. Children in Need had a whole segment on it. We can't let it go to waste. Isn't that right, Little Bear?'

The Little Baby Bear said nothing, having been trained by a litany of children's novels that young bears are best seen and not heard.

Daddy Bear sighed. 'Very well,' he said. 'If we must. We'll go for a nice walk, despite the fact that the weather is going to be inclement at best and there's a very real chance it might rain at any moment even though it's the middle of August.'

And so they went off into the forest, just like every other forest-dwelling family did on a Bank Holiday, pretending to have fun in the open air before going back home to watch the of one of the Harry Potter films on ITV2 for the eighteenth time.

It just so happened, however, that there was another person wandering through the woods that day: a beautiful, blonde, almost-sickeningly pale skinned little girl named Goldilocks. She skipped merrily down the path, until she came across the Three Bears' cottage. 'Oi oi,' she said to herself. 'What's all this then?' -- and then, moments later thought, *Why did I say that? No one ever talks like that. God, how mortifying.* Just in case someone had seen her make a fool out of herself, she decided to duck inside the cottage, rightly considering the possibly of being arrested for burglary to be less awful than the notion of even the slightest degree of public embarrassment.

Inside, she saw the three bowls of porridge laid out on the dining room table. *Ah well*, she thought as she picked up a spoon. *In for a penny, in for a pound.*

She took a bite of the first bowl of porridge, and immediately gasped. 'This porridge is too hot!' she said, to no one in particular.

She took a bite of the second bowl of porridge, and immediately gagged. 'This porridge is too cold!'

She took a bite of the third bowl of porridge -- a sad indictment of the quality of the National Curriculum, *vis a vis* its teaching of critical thinking skills -- and was surprisingly rewarded with a mouthful of perfect-temperature deliciousness. 'This porridge is just right!' she exclaimed. 'And, if I'm not mistaken, it's from Waitrose. Upmarket bears, these.' She gave a faint nod of approval, and then yawned. *Perhaps a nap is in order*, she thought as she headed for the stairs, not even taking her shoes off as she did so to show that she is very much the villain of the piece.

In the bears' bedroom, she found three beds: one for Mummy Bear, and one for Daddy Bear -- which, she would have realised had she spent a little time thinking about it, made the third bed for the Little Baby Bear somewhat of an improbability. *Best give these a try*, she thought, pushing the notion of British hospitality to its absolute limits.

'This bed is too hard!' she said as she sat on Daddy Bear's bed. 'This bed is too soft!' she said as she sat on Mummy Bear's bed. 'This bed is just right!' she said as she sat on the Little Baby Bear's bed. All of this was a little rich, considering that had any of the beds been offered to her the only response she would have been able to muster was an enthused 'That's great, thanks!', but as soon as she was curled up in the Little Baby Bear's bedding -- very soft and luxurious, not the scratchy blue fleece thing that was inexplicably saved for guests and smelled faintly of mothballs no matter how regularly it was aired out -- she fell right asleep.

Shortly afterwards, the three bears returned home.

'What's this?' said Mummy Bear. 'Someone's been eating my porridge!'

'And someone's been eating my porridge too!' said Daddy Bear, already considering writing a strongly-worded letter to the council about the rising crime rates.

Baby Bear said nothing, but given that it was his porridge that had been finished off and he hadn't wanted to go on that stupid walk in the first place, it was fair to say that he was properly narked.

One by one, the bears traipsed their way up the stairs, looking for further signs of their home invader before they called the police. (After all, it wouldn't do to make a fuss. They were probably *frightfully* busy, and they'd take forever to get to the woods anyway. 'You know what the police are like,' Daddy Bear had explained. 'Too busy with trying to catch speeding carriages and not enough time actually policing the homes of good, honest bears, if you ask me' -- which, of course, nobody had.)

'Someone's been sleeping in my bed!' said Mummy Bear as she pushed open the door to their bedroom.

'Someone's been sleeping in *my* bed!' said Daddy Bear.

The Little Baby Bear looked over to his bed and sighed. *I mean, really*, he thought. *This is just getting preposterous now.*

Goldilocks sat up with a fright at the interruption.

'Sorry,' said Daddy Bear reflexively. 'But would you mind telling us what on earth you're doing inside our house?' Unfortunately for Goldilocks, however, he said it in Bear, a language which she -- thanks to the firm village belief that learning other languages was pointless when everyone spoke English anyway -- didn't understand. To her, it just sounded like a furious cacophony of growls and grumbles, only marginally more intelligible than the GCSE in Goblin she had struggled through the year before. 'Do you understand what I'm saying?' Daddy Bear asked.

Goldilocks said nothing, but her perfectly-normal-thank-you-very-much teeth chattered together in fear.

'I don't think she does,' Mummy Bear said. 

'Hmm.' Daddy Bear pondered for a minute, then cleared his throat. 'DO. YOU. SPEAK. BEAR?' Daddy Bear said again, still in Bear, but a little bit more loudly and as clearly as he could manage, which was how he had always managed with foreign languages before. With a strangled shriek, Goldilocks ran past the three bears, down the stairs and out into the forest, where she promptly began looking for a tabloid journalist to whom she could sell her story.

'Well,' said Mummy Bear at last. 'How *rude*. I bet she wouldn't have done that if we were polar bears.'

'Quite so,' nodded Daddy Bear. 'Quite so.'

A stunned silence descended over the three of them, neither one of them quite sure how to react to the invasion of their home by a knock-kneed, lank-haired streak of nothing.

'Tea?' Daddy Bear said.

Mummy Bear nodded.

In humans, both gender is defined by the X or Y chromisome. In ants and bees and wasps and a few other insects, males are created from unfertilized eggs, while females are created from fertilized eggs.

This means that female ants are more closely related to their sisters than to their own offspring. And thus, evolutionary it makes sense for them to help their queen rather than procreate themself.

And my screams were swallowed whole without a trace.
&amp;nbsp;


Until one day.
&amp;nbsp;


That day, everything changed. 
&amp;nbsp;


I was particularly hungry that day. I hungered in body, mind and soul. I don't  remember the specific details. All I know was that the cold gut-wrenching pain spreading throughout my body wasn't my usual introspection. It was a visceral, physical pain. As I collapsed, I watched an ant carrying a leaf. Oh, what I would give to be that ant. To live, straight of purpose, free of doubt.
&amp;nbsp;


And suddenly, there I was. A whole new world opened up to me. A unity unlike any I had known as a human had befallen me. No longer would I wonder about my purpose in life, about right or wrong, or any of that sappy dross. The colony was the purpose of my existence; it's prosperity was my prosperity; it's rights were my right.
&amp;nbsp;


And for the next 4 billion life cycles, I was content.

They knew me well, the same person always coming back years after years. 

I was a regular, a regular passer in the plains of the afterlife. 

""What will it be this time?"" My life manager said. 

Each person who chose to be reborn would get a life manager, and my life manager has known me for all of my life. A life manager was someone you could depend on, most of the time, they would ask you questions about what or who you wanted to be, what kinda life you wanted to live, and then would proceed with the process of being born again. 

I had done it at all at some point. 

Originally, my first life, was a simple caveman. I stood tall and fare, fighting and hunting, hunting and fighting. And all those darn fires. 

It was a good life, a simple life, but little did I know about the afterlife. 

I could travel into the future, I could go into the past, I could choose who I wanted to be and what I wanted to do. 

But for me?

Oh no. I was too simple. I had heard of others, others who were so wise with the lives they chose and became famous or legendary on Earth. 

I could have easily done the same. 

But when my life manager looked me in the eyes, I knew he was pleading for me to choose something else. 

He saw me so regularly I once popped up on his time off in the heavens. 

""Just say it"" he said bluntly, ""If you wanna be a damn ant again, just say it.""

My life manager was a good guy, he really was. He always made my short lives unique and had the growing world around me interact. 

I had been in an ant farm in a school once, and I died because a boy named Tommy ate me. 

But from the many lives I had of living as an ant, I still enjoyed it. 

I was given a job, I had a family, I kept them alive and fulfilled my duties. 

It was simple. I liked simple. 

But because I choose an ant, my life is always quite short. 

Sometimes I think my life manager does that on purpose, it is probably to make me choose something else. 

""What do you recommend?"" I asked him. 

He gleamed with a smile, and a twinkle appeared in his eye. 

He thought today was the day, he thought maybe, oh just maybe, I wouldn't choose an ant. 

""Well..."" he paused as he thought. 

""I know you like a simple life"", he then proceeded to hand me a few files from his desk. 

Where did he get those? Did they just magically appear? 

""How about a farmer, a good ol' Texan?""

I skimmed through the file, eyeing the man I might be. 

""He looks like a pussy. Next."" 

My poor life manager sighed. 

""Okay, that's okay. Look at the next file"" he instructed. 

""A samurai? They live quite dangerously but with honor. Maybe you'd like that?""

I pondered as I looked at the file. 

Maybe?

Maybe I should?

Maybe I should choose something else?

""How about something more, I don't know, less life threatening?"" I suggested. 

And that's when my manager knew it. He fucking knew it. 

He excitedly searched and found a random folder, I don't even think he looked through it. 

""Here!"" He prestsened me a file and said it was a random human, a simple human who would live a long and boring life. 

""Okay. Sounds good.""

I, myself, didn't look at the file.

It made me anxious, standing here - every second spent on this platform is a second not spent down amongst the ants. I am a veteran afterall, they need me down there. If it weren't for my contributions in the battle of the aphids (or in the great bird catastrophe for that matter), who knows what our species would have come to.

I chuckled at my vanity and loss of perspective, ants are clearly the superior race. There's no question in my mind that we will overtake the humans given enough time. 

Speaking of time this is getting ridiculous, what am i waiting for? There's no choice here, not for me anyway. I'd better get back in there.

This wasn't Jared's first stop in heaven; or his second, or his third. As it turns out, Jared had been reincarnated almost 4 *billion* times, choosing to be an ant on many of those occasions. He had been everything at least once, from the smallest conscious organisms to things as big as whales and dinosaurs. He had even tried his hand at being human once or twice, and that was his least favorite of all.

""I find it interesting, life on that small of a scale. Not to mention not living for very long can come in handy when you get to do it over and over again.""

""I'm guessing you want to be an African elephant. No, I've got it, an ant!"" A wave of sarcasm came over God at the mere sight of Jared these days, and can you really blame him?

""You know me, big man."" Maybe I'll find a nice blade of grass somewhere, or even get started on my own hi-"" Jared was interrupted by a snap of The Lord's finger and vanished from the reincarnation office, presumably off to another attempt at ant life.

""Next!""

"[WP] Every time you die, you get to choose what you'll be reincarnated as. You've chosen ant 4 billion times.",henrietta_longbottom,"Minim transmigrates, skitters, walks the intricate labyrinth of an entirely new colony. The tunnels branch out five-dimensionally, and far behind her is the distant memory of dying. She has emerged from her carapace a being of perfect and immortal soul, and the substrata of the world have revealed themselves to her. She crawls past matter, past space, past time, and in the fungal garden comes to rest. *Nigoda* swarm around her, single-celled souls so undifferentiated that they compose the base matter of the cosmos. She is afloat in a sea of life and death, of eternal rebirth. All possibilities are open to her. 

""And what shall you choose?"" comes a waft of pheromones, and before her is the distended body of the queen, Tirthankara, all six legs folded in lotus formation, every segmented piece of her body a further elaboration of truth. Mimin feels her soul seize with the possibilities. Beyond one tunnel lies the unbound flight of the falcon, and she can peer down it to the glint of sun off the tops of clouds. There is the lotus emerging pure through the river mud. There is the antelope bounding gracefully through the plains. There is the crocodile with its slow and unnerving grin, snaking lazily through the waters. There is the elephant, there is the horse, there is the buffalo, there is the boar, there is the porcupine and the tortoise and monkey and the snake, a seemingly endless number of tiers of existence blurring indiscriminately into the looping circle of life. 

""Which of these are worthy of me?"" trembles Minim, shaky on her fragile six legs. ""Which do I deserve?"" 

""There is neither retribution nor reward in death,"" Tirthankara says, her abdomen shining with light. ""You, you yourself, are an intrinsically perfect soul, striving ever onward towards liberation. Only your actions, only your choices, shall determine what happens next."" 

""I ... I only sought to serve while I lived,"" says Minim, struggling to remember. ""My sisters, they foraged and guarded us. While I tended to the gardens."" She remembers tending to the delicate sprouts of fungus as they sprouted from the rotting leaves, heedful of their chemical songs of fruition, rearranging the leaf beds for maximum growth, hauling away the waste. ""I could not have -"" The thought confounds her, and she looks up to Tirthankara. ""I was a limb in a greater organism."" She looks to the mammalian paths of rebirth, twisting and turning all the way to the end until she can feel the concept of them worming through her mind. ""A teat, a hand on a breast."" She can almost feel the sensation of a heart beating, of warm blood flowing through her limbs. ""If I were to be reborn ... could I be something more?"" 

""You could be as a demi-god,"" Tirthankara says, extending her limbs. ""You could be as a being of hell."" There are visions of creatures Minim has never imagined, never conceived of, standing vertically towards the sky. They stare through transparent eyes and incinerate dozens with a gaze. They extend many-toothed limbs and chew trees to the ground. They have built colonies of stone and smoke and fire that extend over the surface of the world. They could crush her and her colony with a single step. ""You could stride atop the world. You could reach for the heavens. There are no limits imposed upon you here, sister. The choice is eternally yours."" 

Minim sees, and shudders with vertigo. She has lived a life without leaving her colony, without seeing the sun, and now she sees before her the possibility to harness the sun for herself, or to blot it from the sky. ""I-"" she gasps, and collapses back. 

""Forgive me,"" she whispers, and thinks of her precious gardens, moist and warm and dark and rich with fungus song, of the rows of squirming hungry children awaiting her care. There are her sisters who roved the edges of the colony, foraging for food, fighting off all enemies, whose bodies fed the gardens when they died. There was the queen, eternally birthing, the supple young drones readied to birth colonies anew. Her family. Her body. Her life. At the mercy of all the gods and demons she had just witnessed. ""I wish to be me,"" she says. ""I am no god. I am no demon. I - I wish to serve. Tiny though I may be in the larger scheme of things. I wish to help them be better."" 

Tirthankara beams, and the world slowly narrows down to a single familiar path. ""You have trod this path well, sister,"" Tirthankara says. ""Now walk it again."" 

""Wait!"" Minim gasps, and already she feels the constraints of a new physical form closing in around her. She is limbless, sightless. ""How many times? How many times have I chosen this path?"" 

""Four billion times,"" says Tirthankara. ""And you shall walk it four billion times more. All paths are interconnected, sister. Your existence is entwined with air and earth and fire, with water and all the plants that grow. Seek to do no one harm, sister. Cultivate no attachments. Open yourself to the infinite possibilities of life."" There is joy in Tirthankara's pheromonal voice. ""Walk your path, sister, with ceaseless effort and free of delusions! And it shall lead you to liberation!"" 

And Minim transmigrates to a different plane on a thousand skittering feet, and she is born and dies and is born and dies and is born and dies and is reborn. ",sadoeuphemist

""yes. I was done"" I replied.

""So you promised. Next time you're here you'd tell me why you have chose ant for the last 4 billion times"". Peter continued while ignoring the fact that I stated I was done.

""only if you keep your part of the deal Peter. And you know, if you promised, you have to keep it. It's one of God's rules"" I said while tapping on the 4 tablets of commandments. I'm still puzzled how the others lost 2 of those all those years ago. Ten commandments my ass. There would be much less war if they kept the other 2. ""You promised me you're reincarnate me no matter what and whatever my reason to chose ant was""

""yeah yeah"" Peter said annoyed. ""just spill the beans. Why ants....""

I looked him dead in the eyes and said ""you really want to know?""

""OH COME ONE!! you're here for the last 1000 years or so. Asking to be a frigging ant each time. You've seen the entire world as an ant. You promised you'd tell me so tell me!"" Peter snarled.

""Are you really sure? What I'm going to say might have repercussions for you as well. You'd might end up in the basement. And red never really suited you.""

Peter hesitated but said ""oh it can't be that bad. Come on. Stop teasing me and tell me""

""well ok. You know me and Addy where pals for years? You know before he went bonkers and ended up downstairs? Well, centuries ago we found a loophole in God's plans. We found a way to keep our memory. First I started remembering snippets of information. The next time around it was still there. Somehow only memories of the last reincarnation are getting wiped. Eventually I found a way to sort of shield memory from the wipe. I explained it to Addy and he too started keeping his memory of his past lives.""

Peter looked shocked but could utter a word.

I continued ""At one point we decided to observe the world. Learn everything there is to know. Learn about secrets governments don't want you to know. As a ant you can get almost everywhere. Addy always like the eagle. To investigate potential battlefields he said.
Slowly we gotten to know the world, politics, how to play crowds. Addy was a brilliant speaker. He truly could rally the masses. But I told him he picked the wrong country. That he should wait just a little bit. Things went great for him in the beginning but I did warn him about the sleeping giant. I told him to go there if he really wanted to make the move. But Addy didn't listen. He always was stubborn.""

Peter was still looking at me as if he saw water burning.

""Addy did show me I was right. The sleeping giant is the place to be. Trigger it's people right and you control the mightiest beast on earth. With them I can rule the world. Where Addy failed I will succeed. So Peter, I told you my story. Now I would like to be human. Place me in the United States. As you promised"".

""Bu.. bu.. but Donald... After what Addy did..."" Peter stumbled.

I get the feeling we’ve had this conversation before, or some version of it at least. There’s a bunch of us together, standing before the gates and making our choices. In theory, we can choose anything we want. In practice, there’s a cost. Being an ant is far down on the ladder. It gives little opportunities for doing good, but less for doing evil.


“You can become a bird, if you want to. You have the karma.”


“And eat ants?” I shake my head repulsed. “No, thank you.”


The angel looks through my soul a moment, his eyes glowing warmly, before checking his list again.


“Actually, since you have so many lifetimes of good, honest work behind you, you can become a cat.”


I shake my head. Not interested. Selfish, murderous beings.


«Tell me why. »


“Being an ant is simple. There’s no difficult question to answer, there is no moral dilemma. Sometimes I become queen, which is nice. Even being a worker, everything is ordered. And I’m strong, so very strong. Have you ever had the feeling of lifting a sugar cube a thousand times your weight?” 


I smile, or my soul does. The angel only shakes his head. 


“It’s amazing. And knowing that your own strength is enough to help the colony so much, that’s the best part. I’m a part of something bigger, and my work matters. ”


“But some parts must be worse than others?”

 
“Being a mating male is not very interesting, “ I admit, “but it’s easy to do your duty and fulfill your purpose. It is easy to be good.”


We are distracted by another standing in line. The angel clearly asks the soul if he’s sure he wants to go from snake to monkey. An insane leap. The soul nods and we all stare in fascination and horror as fire catches hold of the soul and the screams begin. It is then sent away to holding, It will be kept there until it has suffered the same amount of suffering it has inflicted, and then the amount needed to make up for the lacking karma. I shudder.


“Make me an ant.” I repeat, my voice carrying strongly. “And keep my karma for later.”


The angel nods and I have a last thought while my soul is hurling back towards the earth. I estimate that I am about a quarter of my way to my goal, to the epitome of a good being. To the closest thing possible to an angel. Twelve billion lifetimes more as an ant, and then I’ll be ready without purging. 


Then, I’ll finally be a dog.

The front page of Reddit looked mightily depressing, almost all of the top news on the recent death of Debbie Reynolds. Nnd this was coming barely a few days after Carrie Fisher's death. Who else does 2016 want to take, you wondered.

With nothing else more interesting, you decided to check out /r/WritingPrompts, hoping to take your mind off all the gloomy news and to perhaps indulge in some fantasy stories, in a land that is hopefully far, far away from earth.

*David Bowie has created his own alternate universe, and is selectively populating it one person at a time. [WP]*

You gave a loud groan. Even in Writing Prompts? 

Deciding that perhaps you should write a story that do not feature any death, you clicked on 'Rising', hoping to find a new interesting prompt for you to practice those writing muscles.

*[WP] One day during your usually boring life while scrolling through reddit you receive a message from a random number detailing their plans to fake their death and join the underground society of notable people who all ""died.""*

Oh, seriously? And just not far below there was another prompt about Carrie Fisher returning to the Star Wars universe. You understand that there's a need to grieve and to give meaning to all these deaths, but a part of you wondered if everything was a little too overdone.

A terribly unpopular opinion, and you decided against posting it as a comment. The year is coming to a close after all, and it would be good if you could dial down on the negativity. What's the point, anyway?

You decided to keep your phone back into your pocket and just enjoy the boring train ride home by people watching instead, chuckling at the thought that people can just create funny stories out of anything. Underground society of notable people who are dead. Classic way of looking at things, but still funny nonetheless.

Before you can slide the phone back into your pocket, however, a message popped up on your screen, informing you that you have been added to a Whatsapp group. And immediately after that, you received a message from the group.

""I will be with you all soon. CF""

CF? Just what is CF? You thought to yourself. Christian Fellowship? Cooked Food? Carry Fishes? Wait a minute...

Confused, you quickly typed out a message in response. ""Hi guys, not sure if I'm the correct group, but can I just check why was I added?"" 

Another message immediately appeared after yours. ""Carrie, who did you add?"" The username read Goblin King Jareth. 

""Just as who you asked me to, my brother Luke!"" the first number retorted.

""I think she forgot that his real name was Mark Hamill."" A different number chirped in, with the username Rickman.

Bells started ringing in your head. Goblin King? Rickman? Could these people be who you think they are?

""SHIT! I TOTALLY FORGOT!"" the first number exclaimed in caps, which was proceeded by a bunch of ""Oh nos"" and ""Damn"" in the group.

Sensing your opportunity, you quickly typed out the message: ""I know of all your secrets now, and if you don't let me in, I'm going to tell.""

And just to add a little threat to the message, you add: ""Screenshot taken.""

There was silence for a while in the group, before a message, from the group admin with the name Prince appeared. ""Alright, we'll let you in. But on one condition.""

You hold your phone in anticipation.

A few days later, several news reports circulated around the web, in what seemed to be a fitting conclusion to the year that everyone had experienced.

**dori_lukey, a young man from the state of Texas, may have just become just become the last person to die in 2016. He was found dead in his room having suffered a heart attack, strangely with a smile on his face.**

"[WP] You are the reincarnation of Hades. Everyone you touch dies. Until someone doesn't. They're your Persephone, but don't know it.",unluckylesbiannolove,"Isolation. Why the isolation? These white walls surround me every day. This jacket is so constricting, I've been chewing on in for months unable to get it off. The day I was born my mother died when she held me. The doctor lived due to his gloves as well as the nurses, but not my mother. I'm only twenty and never felt the touch of another human. As a child the people at the orphanage were frightened of me. I had my own table, my own room, even my own toys. I didn't mean for them to die. These damned white walls.

My nurse should be in any moment to feed me again. Her blue scrubs is the only solace I get from this hell of white. 

""Hello James."" An unknown voice says on the other side of the door. ""Your nurse isn't in today so I'll be covering for her."" She sits on the bed next to me with a plate and a spoon. ""I heard that you was a special case."" She started to feed me slowly. Her scrubs are a different color than Jane's, red. Her hand approaches my mouth with the spoon as she finishes feeding me. My eye twitches as well as my head. Her hand slips and she touches my face. The warmth of her skin was welcoming and yet frightening. We stare at each other for a moment waiting for her imminent doom. A tear rolls down her cheek. She frantically starts to panic. I stare at her for a few more minutes. Our eyes eclipse each others as she stands walking out of the room. The door closes as I sigh, ""She didn't die?"" 

Later that day she enters the room again with the same red scrubs. I smile.  ",Knightbell1
