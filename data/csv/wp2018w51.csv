[IP] The Door in the Glade,xdisk," I built it as a joke. I’m so sorry.

When I first put up a door in the middle of the forest, in a clearing where the fog of the mountains tasted like pine drops. I had meant to brag to my friends about how I owned a house in the middle of nowhere.

It didn’t take long for my ‘house’ to receive visitors. My friends and I took turns opening and shutting the door knocking on it highly drunk. When you live in the country with nothing to do you’ll enjoy working for your entertainment.

Halfway through our play session, with an open fire crackling nearby, we heard the door open on its own.

Laughing it off my friend Buck closed the door.

It swung open and smacked him in the face bloodying his nose. He started to get upset. *Ha what a pussy.* Tears started well from his eyes like he was going to cry and crawl into diapers. “Whoever's doing this, That’s not funny. You broke my fucking nose!”

The door almost with a mind of its own swung shut. We all got up curious and walked over to investigate. Hoyt checked for wires under the doorframe. Nathan-Ray took off one of his socks and staked it in the ground-- A makeshift windbag that remained eerily unfilled. 

Unsatisfied we wandered back to the warm glow of the campfire. Buck stayed behind to vent his frustration on the door or something. He kicked the corner almost injuring himself, pissed off.
 
That's when the door opened and something grabbed Buck by the ankle dragging him through the doorway. The door shut with a sickening snap.

We bailed. Poor buck is probably still out there with a broken nose and a sprained ankle in the middle of the forest. We ain’t going back.

[IP] The Door in the Glade,xdisk,"""We should have brought a ranger with us!"" Martin complained. The warrior was not fond of the whimsy the wizard took with their task. After trekking for several hours with the egghead, he felt apprehensive at their possible unpreparedness to continue in their investigation.

&amp;nbsp;

""A shoddy door isn't it?"" Like Derrick's voice sticking out from the gentle rustling of pine needles, the presence of the open door was a staccato in otherwise serene scene. More forward in his speech, Martin asked the relevant question ""Shoddy door?! Is that all you have to say? Why the hell should a door be here in the forest?""

&amp;nbsp;

""If we found a house, it would still be a door in the woods!"" Derrick's attempt at humor elicited a groan from his companion. ""Fine I'll be serious. Portal spell! Well, an attempt at one!"" His hand gripped the metal knob as he swung the white wood back and forth. ""Look where I'm pointing."" Following Derrick's finger, the warrior saw the visible gap, about the width of his palm, between the top rail and the frame's casing.

&amp;nbsp;

""Why do you need a door for a portal spell?""

""Reagents silly warrior!""

Martin watched as Derrick pulled out a small tome, it's cover containing an illustration of the map of the world superimposed on the symbol for magic. The sound of the wind serendipitous stopped as he flickered through the pages.

&amp;nbsp;

""Page 143, you're literate right?""

One page contained a sketch of a door, not much different than the one they encountered. On the other leaf, a beautiful wall of calligraphy outlined the methods of the spell. He began to read: ""Trace your finger around edge of the casing, focusing intently on the other door you wish to walk through...""

&amp;nbsp;

Flabbergasted, Martin glanced up from the book at Derrick.

""Continue down, where the spell outlines duration."" 

""The portal will decay whenever objects pass through. This will also happen naturally over time as air passes through any cracks. You may want to hang a sign 'Keep closed when not in use.'""

&amp;nbsp;

Closing the door, Martin inspected the sturdiness of the latch. Even a tiny wiggle dislodged the door, swinging it back open.

""So even if this did work, the portal would intentionally collapse quickly. Interesting...""

""How so?"" Derrick asked.

&amp;nbsp;

Coming around to other side, the warrior began to open and close the door, 
""See which way the door swings? Follow the path.""

The young wizard squatted, gathering a speck on dirt on his finger to inspect.

""There's far less grass on the other side, and I can detect some foreign clay. Do you think?""

Martin finished Derrick's thought: ""They're using this as an exit from the woods back into the village.""

&amp;nbsp;

""That would explain the weird frame!""
Derrick pulled out a piece of sewing tape from his sack. Not an ingredient for any other spell, but not without utility. Stretching on the tips of his boots, he shouted, ""Ha! Taller than a standard door!"" 

""Let me guess, the boards don't matter but the frames need to match?""

&amp;nbsp;

""Correct! We won't have to hire a ranger to track them. If we find a door with this frame back in the village, that's where the cultists are conniving!"" Birds flew from the thrush as Martin broke the door from the jamb's side, sending a hollow thunk into the air.

&amp;nbsp;

""Damn-it Martin, I didn't write the height down! Let me get remeasure from the other side before you go bashing again.""

The warrior sighed. Perhaps they, or rather he, needed the ranger to share the burden of supervising Derrick.",fr8train_prompts

[WP] You thought your nanny had been the sweetest old lady from the moment you met her and would never even think about hurting a fly. Now she has accidentally killed one and is on a adrenaline filled rampage. You decide to talk her down.,504707,"Your nan swipes at a fly buzzing around her face. In the clumsiness of age, she squashes it between her hand and forehead. ""Oh, bother."" The fly drops to the counter infront of her. ""I got him.""

You laugh at your nan's apparent concern for the fly, which is spinning around and buzzing in it's last throws. 

""You better end him nan, he is suffering."" You say semi-sarcastically.

""Deary me, oh I couldn't. Can you get him for me love."" She asks.

""Sorry nan, I didn't knock him down like that, you have to do it."" You try to make her feel worse, for some reason her concern for the fly is hilarious. 

""Well"" She reaches for a tissue and places it over the fly, before slapping her hand down over the tissue. 

Bang. She waits a moment. Bang, bang, BANG. She begins to whale away on the tissue with a reckless abandon. 

""Nan, NAN, that's enough! you got him already"" You go over to subdue her. ""You'll break a hand hitting it like that.""

She breathes heavily, ""I didn't want to kill him. I really didn't mean to"" she is noticeably shaking and you work to calm her down. 
""Relax nan, it's just a stupid fly, no need to get worked up.""
""I didn't want to kill him, I didn't want to kill him."" She begins to whip herself up into a frenzy. 

She pushes you aside and reaches for the knife block, pulling out a shiny, sharp blade. You attempt to stop her but she holds the knife to you. ""I'm no murderer, I didn't mean to kill him!""

You instinctively put your hands up, in shock. ""Whoa, relax nan, put down the knife, you didn't mean to kill the bloody fly, I get it.""

She screams back ""No no, not the fly, not the fly. You're grandad!"" 

You freeze in shock at the confession. Grandad went missing a few years ago, we thought he drowned while swimming in the sea. 

""Nan, put the knife down, it's okay."" You reach forward to console her, but she jabs the knife in your direction in response. 

""stop don't come near me or I'll do the same to you.""

You've never seen her like this before. Suddenly, your dad walks in from the lounge room. 

""What the hell's going on here?!"" He walks straight up to nan and attempts to take the knife from her. With uncharacteristic speed she thrusts the knife into his eye socket, penetrating his skull with at least half the blade. A grotesque shriek cries out from your dad as he drops to the floor, knife still imbedded in his head. 

""I DIDN""T MEAN TO KILL HIM, I DIDN""T WANT TO."" Nan screams. 

You are frozen in shock and fear, trying to think of the next move. She is having some kind of episode. Tears fall from your face as you respond. ""Nan why are you doing this? You've killed dad!""

She leans over and pulls the knife out of his skull, a sick sound is heard as the blade slices out of his head, while still leaning over the body she turns her head to you and quietly whispers with a smile ""I didn't want to kill him. I'm no murderer."" 

""Okay nan, you didn't mean to, just put the knife down. I'm your grandson! Please stop!""

She seems to get lost in thought and drops the knife, before looking down over the body of her son. 

""What have I done, first his father, now him."" She collapses ontop of him and cries onto his chest. 

You quickly grab the fallen knife. Unsure of what to do with it you throw it across the room. Nan pops her head up and looks at you with menacing eyes, as she does, a fly buzzes right onto her forehead. She looks to the fly and then back to you.

""Let me get this one nan..."" You take a few steps back, to then run up and flykick that bitch into next week. Her body ragdolls to the floor in a bony mess. You get back to you're feet. 

""Sorry nan, I didn't mean to do that. I'm no murderer!""

You put on your sunglasses, light a cigarette and wonder why you even wrote this shitty prompt. 

The end.

If you’re listening to this, then you either already know this story, or want answers. Both of those situations are unfavorable outcomes, but I suppose I owe an explanation for my actions.

The first century of my life was nothing out of the ordinary, I managed to make it to ninety five years of age before dying surrounded by the tribe I helped lead for half a century. When I closed my eyes for the last time, I expected the calm darkness of the void to greet me and shepherd me into the honored Halls of the Fallen.

The second century was one of confusion and pain, as I was forced into slavery by the very people I held so dear only a few short years ago. I only made it to thirteen in my second life before the taskmaster broke my back as an example to the others. The third life was only one of three years, as the biting cold of an unfamiliar land claimed half of the village. My fourth lasted only a few minutes as I strangled myself with my own umbilical cord in an attempt to break the cycle. When the fifth life began regardless, I managed to survive eighty-four years in a grand city of sand and gold. It was a lonely life, but I soon came to terms with my unending life.

The third century was one of hedonistic pleasures and several short lives. I would wake in the morning, throw myself into whatever activity I so desired or whoever I do wished without so much as a second thought. Death meant nothing,  punishment was useless when a quick bite at the wrist or slash at the neck would mean immediate freedom from imprisonment. My longest life was a mere twenty two years, ended when I was beheaded for seducing and bedding a princess the night before her wedding. Having been a woman a few times before, it was fairly easy to please her in all the right ways. Of course I couldn’t blame the king for his wrath, as if some dashing young rogue had done the same to a daughter of mine, I would demand his life as payment as well.

The fourth, fifth and sixth centuries were ones filled with amassing... Things, I suppose would be the general term. Wealth, knowledge, secrets, anything I could possibly use. Fifty years were spent studying solely cartography, thirty spent learning nothing but languages to prepare for future lives, eighty were used to study sciences,  entire lives were dedicated to mastering a subject until I knew all that was available. Sometimes I would be executed for what was seen at the time as witchcraft, others I would be tortured for supposed heresy. In the end it mattered very little, as I would just continue where I left off in the next life. 

The sixth century was where it all began to pay off, though. With several lives worth of experience I knew how to patch people up better than anyone else. While the other doctors were worried about the “balancing of the humors” I was performing what was at the time miraculous. Dying men are quite desperate to stay alive for some odd reason, and will pay any amount to remain on this mortal coil. Another doctor would simply bleed the patient to cure a headache, whereas I would grind together a concoction akin to a fairly weak version of modern day ibuprofen. My rivals would amputate a limb with a relatively superficial cut to prevent gangrene, I would douse it with alcohol and bind it with sterile cloth before touching so much as a scalpel. To be fair to them though, germ theory was relatively new and unpopular. Some of the patients would pay in gold, which I would have discreetly placed in dead drops around the known world, others payed in the much more valuable currency of secrets. Thirty silver coins to save a life is one thing, but words with the ability to bind another into service? Absolutely priceless.

The seventh century was when things began getting rather messy. Revolutions were waged thanks to some behind the scenes manipulating, kings and nobles were beheaded in the streets, a new country was formed in the so-called “New World” in part thanks to one man’s stubbornness along with plans I had set decades before the actors had so much as thought about taking the stage. A few issues arose when I was attempting to instate a new governing body during one particular revolt, and I went from operating the guillotine to being forced through it. The life after that I found myself having the skin flayed from my body and my heart torn from my chest in a display for sun god at the tender age of ten, slain by the remnants of a rather brutal warrior culture trying to escape their extermination.

The eighth and ninth centuries of my life were Hell. The first great conflict flared up when I thought it would be a grand idea to quietly assassinate an archduke so I could have one of my puppets take the throne and unite the world under one banner. The Serbians who were ordered to do so did it in the most public and foolish way possible, which ignited a powder keg and ruined centuries of planning in an afternoon. The one consoling thought I have of that time is knowing the cyanide capsules I gave them were far out of date. I was drafted into the Great War, and died horribly in a gas attack. The next four lives were short, as the war was indiscriminate in its choice of victims. I starved once due to a food shortage, was blown to pieces in an artillery barrage, was gunned down trying to cross several borders to get to Africa where I still had some dead drops remaining, and was beaten to death by an alcoholic father who lost a leg to the conflict. 

When it was all over, my plans to unify the world had been for naught. Europe was in shambles, one of its greatest military powers was saddled with all the blame and was in ruins, the land where I lived my first life was suffering dearly. The whole world was suffering dearly, and all because of my idiotic delusions of grandeur.

It all came around in that bar, though. My ninth century of life, where the weight of the world had finally fallen upon my shoulders and snapped my spine. They were there to pick me back up off the ground and tell me with enough manpower and force of will, we could take back power from the usurpers and reforge the world in our image. We all seemed so very different on the surface. There was an artist, a former General, a revolutionary, a failed aviator, a veteran of the Russian Revolution, and a future morphine addict among us that night when they whipped that bar up into a frenzy and had us storm out into the night. But the one thing we had in common was clear; pure hatred of the current state. When I took a bullet to the neck from officers we fought I wondered if the little Beer Hall Revolt would actually accomplish anything, and awoke in a small Polish town, I found I wouldn’t have to wait much longer. The next handful of lives lasted an average of five years and killed much of what faith I had left in the human race. When I finally returned to life in a busy Japanese city, where I wouldn’t have to fear the frontlines of the war or extermination thanks to poor luck on the genetic draw for quite some time, I was overjoyed.

At least I was for about three years.

Out of all my deaths, that one was the one that pushed me over the edge. The burning, blinding light, the feeling of my tongue melting in my throat, of my teeth shattering as I clenched them in pain, of my eyes boiling in their sockets, of my body being torn apart at the subatomic level and the screams I heard as the shockwave toppling the city. When I came back as an American child I remember how disgusted I felt when I heard the radio say that a second one of those things had been dropped on another civilian population, and how the people celebrated this mass murder of non-combatants. 

Imagine my shock when I ventured out into the world a few years later to discover that kind artist I had drinks with had been the one behind the horrid deaths I faced in Poland and Austria, that he had most of his allies from that night executed in their sleep and had left half the country in the hands of the Russian Communists thanks to his incompetence. After discovering the state of the world, and seeing where it was all heading, I finally snapped irrevocably and realized humanity, as a whole. Was beyond any redemption.

It’s now my fourteenth century of life, and I’ve finally found a way to end this little game I’ve been forced to play for far too long. My past eight hundred thousand or so lives prior to this one were fairly short on average, as I made sure to be born into wealthy families and live just long enough to dump as many of their assets into various fronts as soon as possible while trying to keep suspicion down. A few lives later and with several expensive bribes placed in some very dirty hands, I’ve managed to gain access to a single nuclear warhead, and a formerly decommissioned missile silo. With any luck and with the “information” I’ve been leaking to the higher ups at the Kremlin, the Russians will assume this is preemptive strike preceding a full-scale NATO invasion of the Motherland. If all goes to plan, every man, woman and child on this godless rock will be incinerated in a heartbeat when the policy of Mutually Assured Destruction kicks in.  I’m not gonna lie and say being torn apart atom by atom is a pleasant experience, but it’s far better than allowing the thing once called humanity to continue existing.

Then, at last, I could die.

...what? You expected me to go on some motivational rant, here? To justify my will to omnicide?

Fuck that. 

Fuck that very much. I decided that there was only one solution to the problem of my immortality, but it wasn't exactly a problem that I wanted to solve. Quoth Faust, ""Stay! Thou art so beautiful!""

Immortality is a war that I've waged against the frailty in my soul for more than a thousand years - and I expect that I will wage it a thousand ears more. But, though lost friends and hollow moments still seem to gather behind me, I can see the light at the end of the road.

I was Muhammed al-Khwarizmi. I was Issac Newton. I was Charles Darwin. I was Albert Einstein. Here, now, today, you all already know my name: but I will not tell it to you. Not, at least, until this life, too, slips past my grasp.

There are sorrows, yes - but I will not rest. I will not close my eyes. And neither will yours be closed by me.

I want everyone to have the chance, to join me, to while away the aeons left to this world for starlight. And if heaven is a bright day of forever, if hell is high noon without a drink in sight, then, still, I want neither part of them. Because I'm in love with this world. I'm in love with it. Even though I've lost so much, even after all these years, I'm in love with it.

Maybe that's why I'm still here - god knows, walking the road to my final solution would have been the opposite of difficult in the latter half of the previous century, and even now, still.

But I won't. Because it isn't all meaningless, and because there isn't nothing to be done about it. Rather, I think that it's only in an imperfect world like this one that we can chase meaning, purpose, and truth. What is heaven but an idiotic, smiling eternity? What is hell, but a banal, perpetual torment? In either place, all that awaits me - that awaits any of us - is an eternity where everything we do lacks purpose and point.

In a world of paradise, you never have to try to succeed, and in a world of torment, you never will no matter how hard you try. Only here, in the middle, where the two intermingle is there a chance.

And that's all we have, because, in the end, I'm just as mortal as you. Oh, it will take more, for me to die - but in the end, I *will* die.

I am, ultimately, mortal. And that's all I have. A chance. A bigger chance, but still: only a chance. I want everyone to have as much as I've had, if not more - and if that attains, if I can end disease, starvation, privation, and pain - then maybe, the odds of my own chance won't be so bleak. 

And perhaps one day I will give in to weakness. But not easily. No.

I won't go gently into that sweet light.

I will rage, rage against the dying of the night.",Rubris

Immortality...it's been a concept, an idea, a dream of many for the entirety of existence itself. Some want it, some abhor it, some are indifferent.

I have the privilege...or rather the disadvantage of being immortal.

My body dies. My mind moves on, slowly gathering millions to billions to trillions of information throughout the ages.

Hence, I get to experience everything, from abstract to concrete. Experiencing everything gives you all the emotions you can think of; happiness, sadness, enlightenment, grief, etc. From learning how to farm and make it a widespread idea to arranging blueprints for a time travelling machine, you see it all.

The only thing that sucks about it is the pain.

Pain from an injury, pain from losing a loved one, pain from losing a war, pain from winning a war and realising that all that fighting would only brew more pain. At war or at peace, pain is *always* evident.

Now I recall how I gained my immortality...painfully so.

My life had a beginning though it wasn't from when the world was created. I ended up in the ages wherein every child had to know how to wield a sword and tamper their armour to survive. Those were the simple times. I only remember being sent to take down a group of necromancers. There were five of us in a group. We fought through the lair of the damned bastard but only I made it to the main chamber. When I got there, the necromancer simply smiled at me and offered me my friends back. Without smart hesitation, I willingly pleaded and begged.

Apparently even then, play on words were already a thing. When he meant bring my friends back, really he meant me dying throughout decades just to see them again in different forms.

But even then, they started fading. That's because of how this world has now shaped itself. There are barely any people of a pure heart anymore...and to live on knowing that is truly the most painful thing.""

The press stays silent. The soldiers shiver in place, the obvious shaking of their guns aimed at me.

One brave reporter finally stands up, sweat beading from her forehead. ""I-is this why you now choose to end all of humanity?""

A sympathetic smile comes to my face. ""Know that I am only human yet my mere presence makes you tremble...given I've just told you that story now.""

Low mumbles can be heard. I sigh. ""Two things will happen. One, I succeed in eliminating all of mankind in, give or take, a month. Two, I've incited enough fear into everyone watching that chaos will inevitably ensue and humanity will begin to make itself extinct after this meeting."" My eyes droop.

So I began a large scale plan to create an idea which can over power governments, principles, morals, and life it self into question with one sentence... are we conscious of the life we’re living or are we settling for the reality we’ve created in the safe box that is society are you you? Or what everything else wants you to be?

However I had a carefully placed plan laid out with my usb and 50 years of planing I was ready to download the program of the century which was capable of going worldwide in seconds and all I needed to do is sneak into YouTube, why YouTube you ask, because I wanted to know what really happened to YouTube that got blacklisted so my side quest took me a detour but I digress, now entering the building I’m approached by many characters which make me sick with there who are you questions I quickly knockem out because I trained with Bruce lee to taught me the art of I’m water and water is me and with that I was able to achieve one punch form, single handly defeating all the guards making it to the mainframe where I injected the question of life time, within seconds all websites programs signals etc were infected and turned and erased converting into my carefully calculated plan, but then I realized it was my other usb and that I had just downloaded my recipe for immortality sauce. I fucked up
many years later everyones immortal and work towards humanity’s survival Except me realizing what I’ve created i needed to fix it so it was back to the drawing board, however unlike before I was now richer then any other man for my recipe but still hated for destroying the internet, which I think was a blessing in disguise I flew my stealth bomber toward cern now controlled by the Scientologist and other fanatics I ejected into the sky carefully parachuting my way down into the facility where i fought my way through endless waves of wide eyed freaks and the top guy Tom with engaged in combat exchanging blow after blow he was the only equal to me for he had MI6 training and had mastered the Norris round house kick we fought for hours and probably would’ve kept going until I stopped and challenged him to a foot race fastest one would win loser surrenders, I knew I was going to lose for he’s had many running scenes, while my endurance was shot so took of first one to shivas statue he past me quickly laughing maniacally, however I’d have the last laugh I locked the door behind him and rushed to start the particle accelerator pushing it into over drive within seconds a black hole was created and we were all sucked in.

It's funny, it took me the paranoia to kick in, my world to flip around, for me to actually hate, and to care, simultaneously.
You need to be a psychopath to be a savior.

So I developed my means of putting an end to all life. 
This meant I had to delve into the philosophy of the beginning and the end, and know the name of God, and the names of Satan, especially the name of nothing.
This is what it all symbolised, the nothing that would be the saving hope of an eternal future with no pain and no risk of hell.
It meant I had to make robots to hold the universe apart, for if it contracted again, it would reset this whole mass of matter, and allow for the possibility of us all over again.

So I made these machines, these robots, to hold the universe apart, so being would always never be.

I know some things. One of these things I know is what the people love in a leader. They’re not the qualities I love in a person, so I’ve never been a public leader. 

However, this go round, I’m born squalling and shitting myself with the knowledge of 1,000 years and I’ve had enough. I’m not drinking the breast-milk kool-aid. When the doctor smacks my tiny ass, I’m dreaming of his death.

By 8th grade I was class president, captain of the football team, making straight As, and pretending I gave a damn about EVERYONE.

Senior year in high school I was voted “Most Likely to Succeed” while maintaining class Presidency and a 4.0 Grade-Point Average.

I attended Harvard Law, graduated Magna Cum Laude, Class President, 4.0. I interned in Washington, D.C. for Congressmen and Cabinet Members. A few short years later I had the presidency.

I had a wife, a home, countless acquaintances, and one of the most powerful positions in the world. And I could finally fucking end it.

I went on live TV one day, like this:

“My fellow Americans, and any other citizens of the globe who happen to be watching. I’d like to say thank you for providing this opportunity to me. It has been a wonderful journey, and I am glad it has come to its conclusion. What I propose is a solution to all of our problems; quite literally an end to all suffering. I’ve lived in countless bodies, journeyed countless paths, and if humanity as a whole compares to the journey of repetition of life, which I assure you it does, then the conclusion I’ve drawn is this: it’s time to cash in the chips. Throw in the towel. Have you ever come home from a long day’s work and loved your bed more than anything? It’s time to go to sleep. Rest well, everyone.”

And with that, I detonated nuclear warheads around the world, smiling.

I checked the data for the fourteenth time this hour. The bombs were still in place. It's not easy, hiding hundreds of bombs beneath the Earth's crust so that they could all detonate and destroy the planet. It took a lot of time and a lot of money. Luckily, I had both to spare.

I'd been alive for, oh, about four thousand years. I can't seem to die. Well, that's not quite right: I die just fine, I just don't *stay* dead. Every time I die, I wake up not five minutes later, as a baby, to a new set of parents in a new life. Sounds like a neat superpower, right? Not after the first thousand years. Can you imagine how exhausting it is to have to re-learn how to walk and talk for the hundredth time? You'd think it would be easy, since I already knew how, but half the time my new parents are speaking a language that's new to me, or one I'd totally forgotten after multiple lifetimes. I've had to re-learn Chinese over a dozen times. And walking? Baby legs *suck*. Even with all my practice, it takes more than six months. And even then, I'm still a baby. Most parents won't let their baby get on a plane to a Swiss bank (where I keep my impressive fortune) for at least a few years.

Well, I'm tired of it. After dying before my second year *three times* in a row (damn mosquitoes), I decided enough was enough. There's only one way I could think of to break the curse: eliminating all life. Can't reincarnate if there's no one to reincarnate into, right?

It took a few lifetimes, but eventually I had the power to do it. I have contacts in pretty much every government in the world. I'm pretty sure that there's no one in space right now, at least that any official governments are aware of, so once the bombs go off, every living being of Earth will be destroyed. Myself included, if all goes well.

*Let's get this over with.* No sense in dragging it out, right? The longer I wait, the greater the risk that someone will notice a massive nuke under their feet and raise the alarm. I'd checked the calculations a hundred times, the bombs should be enough to shatter the entire planet. What more was there to do but die?

I pushed the button.

After a few extremely awkward seconds where the command buffered, and I wondered how badly I'd screwed up, the entire Earth was completely destroyed in an enormous nuclear fireball.

My last thoughts, as I was utterly disintegrated, were, ""*Finally.*""

Dying this time felt a bit different. I'd been disintegrated before, but this felt strange. Was I heading to an afterlife, finally? I felt a bit worried at the thought. After killing every living thing on Earth, I was probably about to be sent straight to Hell. Maybe killing all the mosquitoes would balance it out?

Then I felt a familiar pull. *Shit.* It couldn't be. That was the pull towards a new body, a new life. No way, it couldn't be that. No, no, no, I must be mistaken, who could I possibly be reincarnated into this time?

My spirit was forcibly dragged up towards the blinding light, which looked quite a bit more reddish than usual, and with a sickening *pop* that I felt in all six of my legs, I snapped into a—

—Wait, what? *How* many legs? I did a quick rundown of my new body. OK, four arms, six legs, green skin, and my new... mother?? staring down at me looked like a cross between a giant grasshopper and a pile of wet snot.

I mean, it's not like I forgot how to walk when I get reborn, it's more like my body cannot work with the commands my immortal mind gives it.

So, that part was extremely sucky. But, in any case, I can never forget how exciting it is to enter a new life, and make another mark on history. It's fun to be reborn and hear people praise your past life. One of the few good things about being reborn.

The bad part of it is when I run into friends from an old life. I instantly feel trapped in my old body and almost call out to them, but I stop myself. After the first time I revealed my power, terrible things happened. But, to save time, I'll just say this. Maybe WW1 was caused because an old friend from a past life learned I was reborn and I was killed by the Austrian who's death started it all.

So, it's best that I give them their time to grieve. Because I always have time for that. My true mother died of cancer shortly after birth, and my father made a demonic contract with, well, a demon. He wanted to be forever bound with his lover, throughout the afterlife and rebirth. And, he needed something to pay the price for, because you can't be reborn without a soul. So, he sacrificed my ability to go into the afterlife to be with my True Mother.

Too bad for them that the deal didn't make them fall in love every time. I've seen them before. They never recognize me. But I do. I can tell because there's a dullness in their eyes that tell the story of a thousand lifetimes. And no matter how they end up, they will always be together, be it in marriage, in crime, in hatred, in death, in whatever. But the feelings will always be mutual.

Anyways, back to the main topic. I've lived countless lives. Some good, some World War instigating. But, I'm tired. And bored. Of everything.

The people all look in act the same, except with a different tone, like an Instagram photo. The places all get worse and worse over time. And the destruction, death, and chaos are so... Enticing to us. For a couple of lifetimes, I ended up doing terrible things, because I thought if I made myself bad enough to go to hell, I would never have to open my eyes for the first time. Again.

It didn't work. So now, I send this to everyone on the planet. If you're wondering how, I like to pick up some skills and work at them for several lifetimes to really become the best. Including hacking, painting, dancing, and surprisingly, killing.

Sorry, I get off track easily. When you've said something once, you've said for eternity, am I right?

In any case, I'm sending this because I've hacked all the weapons of mass destruction in the world. Nukes, missiles, even the Heat ray the Russians were building in space to strike down America. Good for them, doing my job for me.

So, I'm killing all of you. Every single one. Including me. And if you survive, know that when you have a kid, I could be it, and if you let me grow, I'll kill you. And if you just kill all the kids, you'll die out anyways. It's a perfect plan.

Unless I end up reincarnating into another Species, in which case, fuck me, am I right?

So, to finally end this message, humanity is doomed today, so just make this easy on yourselves and end it now. For all my immortality, I am not a patient guy.

Everything is set in motion, it took generations of, ""myself"" to orchestrate the necessary mechanisms to get humanity to this point, but we are here, finally. It all ends today.

&amp;#x200B;

I write this letter to whoever remains.

Many of you will die, and over time, will continue to do so. You will not know who among you is me, but as long as someone exists, so will I. And I exist to extinguish you. I take this action, not out of a hatred for humanity. But out of a deep, crushing intangible love for it. And that love, has destroyed me. I am possessed by my will to end my own suffering. Unfortunately the price for this release, is the death of us all. You could not possibly understand why i take this action. But I suppose you could say, I am in a way, the accumulated pain of humanity unleashed. And the guilt of the action i will take, forces me to, i suppose, clear my conscious, by telling you, who i am, and why i will do, what will be known as the begging of the end.

&amp;#x200B;

You will find this hard to believe, but among humanity exists an immortal. That immortal is I, and I have been many people. A family man, construction worker, prophet, psychologist, farmer, politician. The list would be a saga in of itself. However those lives, and the details of how I came to be are of little importance on contrast to what will come. Suffice to say I was once just a man, much like any other. I was born, raised, loved, had a family, grew old, and died. In the end, I came to accept this journey from nothing to nothing around my first death. I was content, satisfied and made peace with my regrets. We are born alone and die alone. I was ready, and i did, die. But then i was reborn, again, and again and again. This you must understand, is no ""gift"". A persons heart, psyche, soul, cannot handle the cumulative pain of endless lovers, children, brothers, sister all dying, and yet, it isn't only the pain of their loss, that haunts me. To a greater degree, it is their life. The sights of my new born children, their warm smiles, the intimate kisses of my various husbands and wives, their warm cheeks and sweet embraces. Even as i write this, their faces enter my mind and the sensation of their touches linger on my skin. All of it and remains, and the pain of their memory sends me into an unfathomable hell. You may argue my pain is selfish. But how could you understand? I do not expect you to, and in time, you will need not worry.

&amp;#x200B;

But, you at the least deserve an explanation. It goes without saying, that you cannot be more susceptible to pleasure without being more susceptible to pain. The more your heart is open the more it is vulnerable and it aches at the loss of the experiences it has had. And I, have had many experiences. For a time I learned to shut myself off from pleasure, so as to avoid the eventual infliction of pain. However this is akin to a death in of itself. An emotional death for multiple generations was no remedy. It only allowed me to ""function"" as a walking corpse. My heart has callused, and nothing remains but the hardened skin. What am i to do? The soul was never ""designed"" to suffer for this long. And It has driven me madd. You must understand, It is a cruel purgatory to be an immortal. I must have done something terrible to have deserved this. But i have stopped looking for signs. I've attempted to speak to all the gods, done every ritual to find some salvation for my soul, and now I am done. I've seen no signs, received no messages. Maybe this was my purpose. And if it is, then I am fulfilling my destiny. Absorbing the cumulative pain of innumerable lifetimes has destroyed what ever humanity used to exist in me. And now I am death itself. Do not fear me. For I will be your friend, and when I extinguish you, I will try and do so gently. But know, I do this not out of hate, but out of envy, for the release that i cannot have.

After living for a millennia, you decide there is one solution: End all life and with it your unfortunate plight.",504707,"A thousand lifetimes, a thousand deaths, a thousand births. I have seen this world progress, through the agricultural revolution, lived as every race and gender. I have been both powerful and poor. I have died in wars and to disease. I’ve died in a bed surrounded by children and grandchildren. And it is all meaningless when you alone experience it repeatedly. 

Over the centuries, I have had my ups and downs. I killed myself in all sorts of creative ways and I hold within my head knowledge that historians would love to get their hands on, but I can’t exactly show my sources so I can’t point out how wrong they are translating those hieroglyphs or how Caesar really died. And yet despite everything I kept learning and trying new things to try and stave off the loneliness that comes with seeing everyone you love die or to die and be taken from them and unable to reconnect in new life. 

Not long ago, at least by my standards, I saw a chance to end my suffering once and for all. I was so close when I manipulated the Soviet Union to putting nuclear warheads in Cuba, but Kennedy managed to defuse the situation on me. I made sure he got the release I deeply craved and for what it’s worth, I now regret it. 

One thing that being constantly reborn does do for you is make you really good at playing the long game, and as the Cold War went on without death coming to everything I saw a new avenue emerge. Computers would be my salvation, but I needed them to be more sophisticated. I have invested and researched over multiple lifetimes now and now my new plan is almost complete. My mistake was trying to destroy everything. Humans are too tenacious, and though I can bring them to the brink, every time they manage to pull back. So the solution was to not destroy them, but the change them. 

In this life, I am Robert Starling, CEO of Future’s End Enterprises. Our latest product? The revolutionary positronic Android body. Just upload your consciousness into the android body and leave your frail, aging body behind. And we provide them absolutely free of charge, only charging for later customizations. Building the customer base, is what I told the board. Once they have our bodies they are dependant on us for parts, but at this stage I don’t really care about profit. 

Already as the population shifts over to life in machine bodies, birth rates are dropping dramatically. Who needs to create new life, when the planet is filling up with the undying (and gloriously sterile) machines. As far as they are all concerned, there will always be time as we also hold DNA samples for creation of eggs and sperm, but once we reach the critical population limit, those systems will mysteriously fail and there will never again be any new babies born. 

Humanity fought to stay alive at my every attempt to destroy them, but offer them the chance to live for as long as they want, and they will line up to shed their bodies. I’ll upload myself too when this body reaches its end, and see my work concluded right at the head of everything. Who knows, maybe when everyone I know lives right along with me the centuries will be bearable. But if not, when I shut down the mechanical body, with no one to be reborn as, I will finally be able to rest. ",zbeauchamp

After living for a millennia, you decide there is one solution: End all life and with it your unfortunate plight.",504707,"The thought first came to me many lives ago. I dismissed it then as boredom. Now, hundreds of years later I seized upon it again, knowing it was my only way out. How many lives had I lived now? The years had blended together, my life a swirl of memories with no structure or sense to them. In what life was I the Duke? My 10th? Or was that when I was the Doctor? I certainly played golf with that German general when I was the physician...or was it an Austrian Prince when I was the chemist? 

I was immortal, true, but my memory was still as fallible as a mortals. If they could forget what they did on a certain week only ten years ago, how was I too remember what I did 400 years before that? All these memories, all these lives crammed together in my head. How often had I whispered the name of a long dead love, as I lay next to the women I called my wife at least for a short while. Soon she would be dead, and be but another memory. Her golden hair would become brown as I recounted her a hundred years from now, her blue eyes turned green, her warm laughter remembered as a playful giggle. 

The only way out was to end a it all, for me and for everyone else. But I would need more time. My body was past its prime, to old to carry out the task ahead of me. I would need a new one, a new life to properly execute my plan.

“I’m sorry,” I whispered to the sleeping form next to me, “Goodbye.”

I rose from the bed and walked from the room, into the kitchen. The knife I had used to carve the turkey for dinner still lay on the table. I took it in one hand, turning it so the point rested on my chest. There were worse ways to die, I knew.

“Another life,” I whispered, “One more life, dedicated to ending my torment.”

I closed my eyes and pushed. 

I feel to the ground, expecting to hit cold wooden floors, but instead felt a terrible wrenching force pull me back, a force I dreaded feeling every day for the past millennia.

Suddenly I felt my consciousness be ripped from my dying body, one memory at a time. The pain was unbearable, seemingly never-ending. I tried to cry out, but had no mouth to do so with.




And then I opened my eyes, and my scream of pain became a babies cry.

“A boy” I heard a voice say. 


One last life. I would end it all.",fintanconlon

And, there's literally nothing added with the last sentence. An immortal giving up and trying to kill everybody and/or themselves is a far more common trope than this specific method of immortality. 

In fact, the last line actively hurts stories. The prompt without it would allow for all kinds of stories. A story about experiencing the world a thousand different ways and fully understanding humanity in a way that's not possible for anybody else, or a story where they use their unique situation and abilities to act as mankind's protector or guide, ooh, a story where they find someone else with a similar condition, and they spend each life trying to regain contact with each other. See, lots of stories that are fairly unique to this specific type of immortality, and the interesting part is exactly how the character interacts with their past and future lives. In the ""kill the world"" story forced by the prompt, there's limited opportunity to study that interaction, so not only is the prompt limiting creative opportunity, the one OP chose is generic and bland, and straight up gets in the way of fully realising the potential of the prompt.

Sidenote, I just realised the prompt without the last, bad, terrible, line is basically a Dog's Purpose.",jansencheng

After living for a millennia, you decide there is one solution: End all life and with it your unfortunate plight.",504707,"I have been rich, and I have been poor.  I’ve been black and white, tall and small.  I’ve died many times; from poison and violence, age and disease.  I’ve been born into families of all varieties; so many that I have forgotten most.  I cannot recall my first mother’s name, or even what she looked like.  I don’t know what is wrong with me, or how many more out there are like me, but in all my lives I have only ever met two.

I guess I should explain my condition a bit more… or at least what I understand it as.  Have you ever heard of reincarnation?  Not the Hindu kind where you come back as a worm or a tiger depending on the actions of your past life, but more like souls being reused.  When someone dies someone else is born with that soul.  The consciousness of that soul is usually wiped clean, all memories of a past life erased for a new experience to be created.  For me, for whatever reason, the erasing process stopped.  Every new life I am reborn with all my previous memories… at least all the memories that I haven’t forgotten.  After a while everything fades away and is forgotten.

I can’t remember in any kind of detail what my first life was like.  I don’t remember family or friends, faces or places.  I do remember being reborn for the first time with all my knowledge and memories from the last life, and I thought it was a blessing.  I was going to be a genius who shot through his schooling and understood the world at a young age.  I was excited like this for the first several lifetimes.  I was going to explore all that this world had to offer.  I did too.  Playing instruments, exploring wilderness, you name it and I’ve done it.  I’ve done everything as a man and a woman.  I used talents to rise to fame for entire lifetimes.  Eventually though, eternal life caught up with me and it all got boring.

When world events and conversations started repeating across lifetimes, the boredom got to me.  I panicked and went on a suicide spree.  I was hoping that I had a finite number of lives, which I could blow through them and be done with it all.  I don’t know how many suicides there were before I gave up, but I became very good at dying before I could walk, despite any baby proofing efforts.  When I realized that my existence was eternal, you can say I fell into a depression.

I didn’t want to exist, but death wouldn’t help me.  I began sedating myself, hard drugs became my blessing.  Occasionally I would overdo it and overdose.  New bodies meant I had to wait a while to get more drugs, but they also came without any tolerances.  It was at a drug den that I met the first of the two people who suffer from the same fate I do.  We were both trying for a way to drift through existence as unconsciously as possible.  You might imagine we became friends, sharing a common curse and all, but after the amount of time we both existed you don’t make friends anymore.  What we did do was realize a better solution than drugs was a lobotomy.  I spent the rest of that life brain dead, and when I was reborn eventually I realized I’d probably never find whoever that was again. 

I would be born, build up my strength, and eventually sharpen a stick and jam it into my nose then swirl it around until everything went away.  I would wake up in a newly born body, and do it all over again.  I really thought I had a good system going here, but then the law of averages caught up with me.  I was born to the second person I ever met who had this fate.  In actuality it could have been that first person over again and I wouldn’t have known.  I would describe his mind as snapped, but this is coming from someone who lobotomizes themselves.  When I was a child and unable yet to speak, he would describe his infinite existence to me.  He thought it was religious.  A god was blessing him with eternal time to spread his religion as a prophet.  His followers followed his lead in a mass suicide as some sort of way to awaken them.  For their sake I hope it didn’t work, but I can’t honestly say I care.  All I know is that he left that life without ever knowing I was like him.  Sometimes I wonder if his religious zeal was because he had lived fewer lives than I and hadn’t completely given up yet.   I wonder if I ever led a religious cult back when I was actually living these lives.  If I had it didn’t work and I had forgotten.  What he did make me realize however, was that I was lobotomizing myself hoping to fast forward through the rest of time.  There was no guarantee that time would ever stop, eventually I would have to return to existing again consciously.

The thought would have been unbearable if I had the choice.  I needed to work to end this somehow, and eventually a possible solution came to me.  I had only ever been reborn as a human, as I stated earlier.  If the entire species was wiped out, then hopefully so would my existence.  I governed territories and led wars.  I committed genocides and have been described as the most evil person who ever lived several times over.  Despite my best efforts, the human population keeps on growing, but I at least have a goal and something to live for now, even if I’m existing only so one day I can exist no more.

He was reborn after his first body failed, but only regained his memories in his life's final flash. After a time, he came to remember mere seconds before his death; but not nearly so quick as to do anything about it. Being tied down to rail posts and watching the bright shining light approach in the chill midnight was only enough to almost balance out his elation against the oncoming shrieking terror of the train's howl. A few seconds of that wasn't any good.

After a few dozen more, or a thousand--he could hardly be bothered to remember his first thousand lifetimes--his memories came back up to a minute before his impending death. Far better than the countless times he had opened his eyes and seen only a smashing club or a rapidly approaching stab. He at least got to take a breath, once he had gotten to a minute.

Even still, a minute wasn't anything near enough time to do anything about his death, though. They had all seemed so unavoidable at the time. That hadn't stopped him from trying, though. Each time he had remembered, the situation had been unique enough to trip him up, and like a tiny puzzle piece that hides underneath the desk, instead of with all the rest of the puzzle like a good piece is supposed to, each lifetime had withheld some tiny, crucial piece from him that would have let him escape. Some crucial, missing link, that would have let him live. 

But something seemed to learn with each birth, and something was retained. After the first hundred thousand times or so, his memories seemed to come back sooner and sooner. But each time, the unavoidable death was just as unavoidable, just as deadly, and he--

Of course, it could be worse. He could just wake up one day and not remember who he was. 

Who would I be then? He wondered, and shuddered, even as He watched the countdown to midnight.

He held up a drinking glass, half-full of best bourbon money could reasonably buy within a twenty four--no, he was up to twenty-seven, now--within a twenty seven hour time period, and looked through His reflection in the glass to the city below. He had seen one of his previous selves minutes before, and had tried to save him, but whether he was responsible for the car crash or not--

""No profit in that line of thinking,"" he said, ""and no better way to kick off a new year."" 

He laughed, and toasted the rising dawn.",irollnothingbut20s

“It was around 500 BC, my name was— is really, Vulca,” Fritz told Fredrick, “I was an artist, working for the last Roman king, Tarquinius.”

“I was tasked with sculpturing the Apollo of Veii, a life-size terracotta statue, in what is now known as Italy,” Fritz was now leaning on the console that held the perilous button, his back turned towards it. This made Fredrick more than a little nervous.

Fredrick knew some details about the Etruscan artist, Vulca, it was only rumored that he had built the famous Apollo of Veii. Fritz went on to describe some of the finer details of how he had sculpted the statue, the tools he used and how his works had been received. Curious, indeed.

“The king was so impressed by my works, notably the Apollo and Jupiter statues, that he sent a powerful Priestess, to *bless* me with immortality, Laelia, I’ll never forget that name,”

“A fine gesture, and a great honor, to be sure. But to my dismay, it worked! I’ve been great kings, unknown plebeians, poets, lowly thugs and everything in-between, and it all started on that accursed day!”

“From time to time, I go to the National Etruscan Museum and look at the Apollo of Veii, back to where it all started,” 

Fritz pointed knowingly towards Fredrick, “If you survive this day, Fredrick, always remember that greatness brings with it, its own perils. Instead of becoming great, aim to become unknown, lest the Gods should grace you with their *blessings!*”

Fredrick nodded carefully, he was now seated in one of the brown-leathered chairs, a mixture of uneasiness and nervousness flooded his senses, “It’s strange how you could know so much about the way the statue was built, you have piqued my interest. Still, it hardly proves you’re immortal,”

“But Fritz, ahem, *Vulca*— if what you say is true, your version of immortality seems ideal,”

“There’s nothing ideal about it, Fredrick!”

“Like a phoenix, you rise from the ashes, blessed with renewed youth! Most men and women would do just about anything to have such power.”

“The mind was not meant to retain the memories of multiple lifetimes, you fool! I didn’t think you’d understand…” Vulca glanced at the red button.

Fredrick panicked internally at the scene, “Ah! But please, won’t you sit down? You promised to tell me your stories, and you’re making me nervous, standing so close to total annihilation!”

Vulca sighed, “Fine, Fredrick, I will. But please don’t try anything stupid, anything you can think of doing unarmed against me, I can do better.”

He sat down in the other chair and placed himself opposite to Fredrick, “In my next life, I truly believed I had become a God, you see…”

After your second century and third reincarnation, everything becomes a gray, soundless circus with poorly articulated performers, which you are forced to watch over and over again.

I don't expect you understand, I don't expect anyone to understand, for some things can only be truly grasped by living them. You will nod at my words, convince yourself that immortality is a burden, and you will doubt if you really want eternal life after all. However, the truth is you will only understand a shard of the entire broken glass.

Immortality is not a burden, but an endless curse.

I apologize for what I will do. I truly do. You are not guilty of my condition. You are not guilty of what will happen. You are just living your life, trying to make it as bearable as possible. 

But life is as fragile as a dry leave under a boot.

Knowledge is not always a good thing. It all depends of the mind who has it, and the use that mind gives it. Unfortunately, throughout my life, I came across an eerie idea by sheer coincidence.

At first, it was no more than a simple rumor. ""Did you know they create artificial diseases capable of extinguishing the whole life in laboratories?"" They said, and shook their heads. But it was a simple rumor, and nothing else, the crazy sayings of an old lady who spent perhaps too much time with her cats.

Truth is, I obsessed over that rumor, and I chased it for the last two centuries. At last, I confirmed the rumor was a blatant lie.

But that didn't stop me from studying, and creating my own disease.

The moment I finish writing this, the disease will be released.

I'm sorry. I don't expect you understand.

But it was the only way.

One small capsule. Break it on the ground, and in a few months, I would finally be able to rest. I just hope that when my time comes, it will be as painless as it is for everyone else.

I close my eyes, and-

*White all around. Nothingness, as far as the eye can see. I am lying down, but if it’s the ground or a floor or what I do not know. I look around.*

*A small child sits, sucking on a finger and looking around too. I walk over.*

*“Hello?”*  
*She looks up, her eyes bright and curious. She cocks her head. “Are you God?”*

*I laugh. “What? Why would I be God?”*

*“I don’t know. I always thought God was tall, and looked a little sad. Maybe it was you.”*

*I shake my head. “I’m not God.”*

*“Are you here to give me something?” She points.*

*Behind me is a small flower, barely breaking free from some unseen root. It is growing quickly, its stem elongating and its petals blooming. It is life.*

*“Yes,” I say, kneeling down. “I can give you life, an endless amount, more than any of us are ever supposed to get.”*

*“What do you mean?”*

*“You’ll live, over and over again. You’ll be a kid, you’ll be a teen, you’ll be an adult, you’ll be old, you’ll die, over and over again.”*

*She seems to think this over. “I can’t be a kid the whole time?”*

*“No…you can’t.”*

*“That’s too bad. Then I could play tag and jumprope all day, and watch tv and movies with Mom and Dad every day.” This hurts me, cuts deep like a knife would in the side that you never saw coming. I think of the first time, the very first time, when I was just a manager at McDonald’s and it was enough, coming home every night, going for walks with my wife, going to Dodger’s games with my daughter and watching her cheer and cry, and how she’d fall asleep every time on my shoulder on the drive home…*

*“You won’t be able to do that either. I mean…you will, but…”*

*“Did someone give life to you too?”*

*I think back. “I don’t know.”*

*“I don’t know either. What should I do, mister?”*

*I look at this girl. I honestly don’t know…*

His superior, Fritz, had somehow managed to override the security measures by himself, and was one push away from erasing humanity, permanently.

“If you press that button— if you open Pandora’s box… that’s it, we don’t get a second chance.”

Fritz sighed deeply, “I’ve thought about it… a lot, it may seem absurd to someone so fragile,”

Fritz turned to face Fredrick, a determined look coloring his face, “It’s the *only* way,”

Had he completely lost his mind? Fredrick couldn’t believe that this was happening, the fate of life on Earth was to be decided in this small stuffy room, in a battle between reason and insanity. He resolved to stop Fritz at all costs, he needed to buy some time, leverage, anything!

“How can you say that, Fritz?” Fredrick began, “If you wish to die, and I mean if that is truly your wish—”

“I wish it with all my heart,”

Fredrick moved a couple of steps towards Fritz, placing a hand on a large mahogany desk, “Why destroy everything along with you? What gives you the right?”

“You don’t understand, Fredrick, how could you? After each death I am reborn, my memories remain, and I am cursed to live another meaningless life from beginning to end,” Fritz studied the ugly and pronounced veins on his osseous right hand, “to watch all your strength fade, to come undone, and then do it all again!”

“What are you talking about, Fritz? Immortality… Have you completely lost it?”

“I’ve lived many lives, my dear Fredrick. I’m sick of it, I am always reborn as a new human being, you see,”

“…an idea came to me, Fredrick, if no more human beings existed, my curse would be lifted, I’ve tried everything else!”

Fredrick stopped edging towards Fritz, perhaps he could reason with his sick mind, humor him?

“You must agree, Fritz, that this all seems quite unbelievable. Let’s sit down,” Fredrick gestured to the two large brown-leathered chairs that sat by a small table, in the corner of the room, “Tell me the stories of your past lives, if you are being truthful, you should have no trouble convincing me,”

“Look at me, Fritz! If you are being truthful, if this is your only answer, then I will make you see that your suffering is justified!”

Fritz was silent for a long time, Fredrick considered bolting towards Fritz to incapacitate him, but before he could make his move Fritz nodded. He appeared almost amused, “Alright, Fredrick, the fate of the world is in your hands,” he remained standing next to the button, “If you can convince me that I should not end it all, I will never attempt something like this again,”

Fritz gave Fredrick a wry smile, “Let us begin, then… from the day I got cursed,”

You either die a hero or live long enough to become a villain.*

*Hah, I wish I could tell you how true that was. I have lived countless lifetimes. Over and over. However, it’s not the romanticized immortality. No. I age, my body decays. Sometimes i’m murdered. Sometimes I die by accident in childhood. You see, I am born over and over. The moment my body dies, my mind is transported into the next babe to be born. It was interesting. Fun even the first few times. Oh, the wonders I could tell you about living in the age of enlightenment, or being at the forefront technological advancements. Amazing really. But then there were things like the atomic bomb, the countless wars, the hunger, the disease.* 

*I’ve been all those people. I’ve been male, female, black, white, Native American, Indian, Chinese… I could go on and on. I remember each lifetime. I remember each detail. The people I’ve loved. The people I’ve killed. I remember everything.* 

*You would think being reborn with all these memories you would be able to change the fate of humanity. I’ve tried. I really have. At one point I even considered myself a prophet or a god. But a god could change things. And I haven’t been able to. I’ve given up. On myself. On humanity.*

*Let me tell you a story. About a hero. Long ago, in a world so different from today, that it seems like a fairytale. But it’s not. It’s my first life. I remember an old shaman woman granting me the gift of life. So that I may live when others would die. Hah. Oh, our people were at war with another tribe, can you imagine? I went into battle, a young man full of life and more than eager to prove myself. Ran into battle, protected by the shaman’s magic. I believed in magic then. You know what happened? I was run through with a sword before I even killed my first enemy. The blood poured, and oh, the pain. It was awful really. And then, warmth, and light. I supposed that it was alright that the shaman had been wrong. I had died and gone on to the afterlife. Until, I was born into the world moments later. I had to grow up, laughs in the tribe that my first had been at war with. I saw how they were just trying to get more food. How neither tribe was actually in the right.* 

*And it went on. Over and over. The same stories. The same problems. I tried so hard to fix them. I really did. But they persisted.* 

*Sigh. I don’t want to do this. But I have to. The shaman didn’t bless me, no, she cursed me. And now you all have to suffer. If I can’t fix humanity, I can surely end it. The weapons that at first disgusted me are now my saviors. This plan has been lifetimes in the making. You could never have known. This is the first step. I know I won't succeed in killing you all in the first go, but here's the thing. I am going to die too, but I’ll be born again wherever you are. You will never know if you can trust your child. I could be him, or her. And I will continue to wipe out the remnants until at last I can rest. I can die. If there is an afterlife, I know I will suffer for what I’ve done. But, I cannot continue this existence any longer.* 

*I wish I had died a hero.* 

The man stood, and turned off the camera. He uploaded the video and sent it to every news agency, to every social media site. He spread it far and wide. Quicker than even he suspected it was everywhere. He laid down in his bed. Tomorrow, he would detonate the bombs and then the real work would start.

You see, in most occasions I'd be born in overpopulated, poor parts of the world where most people live. At first, ages ago, I'd try to explore, see all sides of life, absorb all cultures. However now, when I've been born on all continents, in most countries and nations it came to my understanding that living poor gives you no advantages whatsoever. So first thing I'd do when I relearn how to walk is to use my just tamed legs to walk of a cliff, in front of the moving carriage or just plunge head first down the stairs. Sorry mom &amp; dad, at this point I don't even care. 

Using this strategy I don't loose much time and at certain point I'd pop up somewhere I see more suitable &amp; perspective. In the past I had tried many professions, had learned many skills and tried many crafts. However my knowledge in history is...random. there's no preferred area I'd know more about as often I would be just a peasant and how would I know about different royal twists. Granted, I've been a king once, a princess twice and more often than you'd think I could get good scholarly position simply for knowing maths (which never really changes) and grammar. 

Centuries later I'd find a paragraph about myself in a history book and that would keep me entertained for a few hours. 

So yeah, it's always weird reading about yourself. 

As I mentioned, one thing which doesn't really change is maths. It's constant, solid structure gives me a nice retreat when I feel like it. Sometimes I'd even calculate probabilities of being born in a desired place and would try to kill myself when being born there is most likely. Once it actually even worked! 

Recent passion of mine is science. Physics, mainly. I'm good with maths and, by killing myself a few times I'd sooner or later get to a good place to start my scientific career. Funny thing - usually I can easily find and refer to my publications from previous lives. 

However recently I came to a conclusion that the path of scientific progression humanity has taken can end in two ways: we would either be extremely lucky, successful and proceed to a new era of discovery, or we would  wipe ourselves out using newly found techniques. As for me, I consider both scenarios as a win: I'd either see vastness of space &amp; time not being bound to this boring planet, or I'd see the fall of humanity as one of the last humans. In both cases I'd like to be in a first row. That's why I tried hard for the last few lives to progress science even further. And now we are close to the end of a first stage...

Someone knocked on my door, ""Professor Oppenheimer, Sir, we are ready for the test"". 

""Yes, coming"", I answered. I even know what I'd say if test succeedes: now I am become Death, the destroyer of world... funny, I was the one to say it first. In another language, in another life, ages and ages ago...",Vapor_Steak

I finally took a birth in an ultra rich family in a first world country. After waiting a 100 lifetimes to be born into a powerful family to be able to end this curse, I am finally here and i must say that I now i can see myself do it.

Sure, I didn't get the best of looks or health or friends, but what i had learnt from all the previous lives is that I didn't need those, just the riches and connections of my family. 

I still remember how I used to plan the end of the world while my parents and Dr. White thought that I was a psychopath. But never mind them now in my greatest moment, when the whole world knows my name and i am finally about to do it.

I enjoyed a lot from my position and power here and did all sorts of crazy things in the past few months just feeling out how far i can go with the crazy decisions and hilarious speeches. But it is time for me to do what I was born to do, end this world and with it my curse.

After living for a millennia, you decide there is one solution: End all life and with it your unfortunate plight.",504707,"I knew I got it right this time. The alliances, the backroom deals, everything. Just as I planned. Just as I slowly dreamed, watching the world change, becoming more connected, until the inevitable political cracks spread over the surface of the earth dooming it to shatter with just the slightest touch. And, hopefully, taking all of humanity with it too. 


What glorious technology. Machines that could flatten a squad of men without a pause. Explosives capable of vaporizing cities. Deadly gas that seeped into your pores, killing an entire room of people in mere moments. Now or never. 


I wrapped myself in a long black coat, hat tipped low over my face. Despite the heat of summer I couldn't risk anyone recognizing me. I worked too long, thrown all my skill and cunning into getting this position, and to throw it all away simply by being recognized by a passerby? No, that wouldn't do at all. 


Nervously, I glanced at my watch, forearms coated in sweat. He was late. The alley was empty. I peered out into the connecting streets but saw no one who looked like my contact. Patience, I told myself, no reason to fall apart now. 


There! A man was walking towards me, dressed in a simple shirt and slacks, much younger than I expected. A thin mustache hung limply on an angular face, he looked tired. His eyes, as I surveyed him I was sure he was my contact. His eyes were dead, hollow. The planning, the certainty, the soullessness, and most vividly, the violence. All there in equal parts. He was ready to kill. 


""Princip?"" I asked, lowering my voice. ""Gavrilo Princip?""


He stared at me, unblinking. ""Da. I am."" Silence. He wasn't a talker. 


I slid an envelope out of my jacket and placed it in his hand. Not looking down, he opened it. 


""The wife too?"" 


I nodded in confirmation. ""Yes. Both of them. In public. Use a rifle.""


He sneered at me, the yellow, broken teeth betraying his poor upbringing. ""You don't order the Black Hand. You give location and time, nothing else. We take care of the rest."" 


I stared back at him as he took a packet of matches out of his pocket. He lit one casually, bringing a cigarette to his lips as he did. With the end lit, he used the dying match to ignite the thin paper. We watched as it browned and curled within itself at our feet. With the paper reduced to ash, he took another long drag on his cigarette. 


""The Black Hand thanks you for this information. You'll see your trust was not misplaced."" He said to me, turning and starting back down the alley. 


I watched his thin silhouette recede. He hadn't done much to reassure me that the plan would be followed through. All that time, all that effort, all those years of painful life after painful life. He didn't realize the scope of his future actions. None of those fools in the Black Hand did. Worrying about borders and territory, political nonsense. Their obsession blinded them to the chain reaction about to unfold, with all of humanity to suffer the consequence.


It would not be just the war to end all wars, it would be the war to end all life.

"[WP] A comedian sets up a joke by saying ""Stop me if you've heard this before..."" but the man on your left shoots him with a revolver. He hands it to you and says ""Yes, Belgium, 1871. There are two more immortals on your left. Run!""",Ajreil,"I took the revolver as it was thrown at me, and just then the two people left of me looked at me with an eye of panic. I looked at the shooter’s location only to see that he had run into the crowd gathering on the bustling New York street. In a snap judgment, I gauged that following the shooter’s request to “Run!” was perhaps the most reasonable choice of action due to the eeriness of my panicked neighbors. I started chasing in the direction I thought the shooter had gone in and just as I began moving the two men to my left changed posture and began chasing me.

I ran through the busy street passing a newsboy talking all about the Kaiser’s new push into Russia and how the battle of Minsk lasted only a few short hours. I kept running past the people who accepted that my running was probably not unusual as I was probably late for work. All the while, I kept looking for the shooter.

Most of the way down East 14th Street, I finally pinned the shooter out of the crowd due to his odd hat and took off after him into the backstreet behind the church. I tried to chase him down that path only to find him waiting for me. I walked slowly down the alley behind the church and, hoping *my* chasers were not able to find me as easily asked him what that murder was all about.

“I really hate people talking about me…” the man said.

Completely confused I got closer and drew the revolver on him, asking what he meant.

“The punchline to his joke was, Étienne de Gerlache. He tells it every week and hopes that no one remembers.”

I asked what the whole comment about 1871 and Belgium had anything to do with that name.

“February 10th, 1871 was the day that Étienne Constantin de Gerlache died. The day that *I* died; at least according to the history books. As you can see I did not, it was all a clever play, I did the old switcharoo.”

I asked what he meant, but now I was feeling warier of the street that could easily see this encounter if they tried.

“You see those men that were chasing you, they hunt people like me. Now, I think that’s just because they’re elitist and don’t want anyone else sharing their blessing, but I’ve never been able to engage one in conversation to confirm. You did shoot them, no?”

[WP] Young deities are troublesome and misbehaving. Sending them to reincarnate and live a normal life on earth is a remarkably successful correctional method.,CaskMA,"Okay, so, first of all, it's not my fault. Second of all, as the son of Hermes, what did they expect from me? Third of all, you're probably sitting there confused, so let me tell you what I'm talking about.

So me and my cousins were running through the markeplace of Ancient Greece, playing pranks on the people, flipping up the skirts of the maidens, and things as such, when the words, ""You cowards! I bet you wouldn't do that to a true goddess!"" rang out to my ears.

Now, one thing you never call a son of Hermes is a 'coward' and you *especially* don't bet them.

""Don't do it,"" one son of Athena, the goddess of wisdom said to me when I told them later of what had happened, and what my plans were. ""But when you do it"" he added, ""don't do it to my mom.""

""Or mine"" ""Or mine"" ""Or mine"" my other cousins called out in chorus, which like I said, is precisely the type of incentive a son of Hermes needs to do exactly that.

But one of my cousins, knowing me well said, ""I bet you're too coward to flip up Artemis' skirt.""

There were those words again: *coward* and *bet*. 

I boiled, but a son of Hermes never loses his cool. ""Very well,"" I said sagely. ""It's a bet.""

Artemis was the Goddess of the Hunt, and also a virgin, so there were no whiny cousins of mine to call out, ""Or mine"" at the suggestion. 

To make a long story short, I did it, got caught, got exiled for a million bajillion years (which only feels like a super long Monday to a god; sheer *torture*), came back and proceeded to flip up Artemis' skirt again in spite, which got me exiled again, but this time to the modern world, which seemed to have done wonders for other mischievous family members of mine.

To make an even longer story shorter, I continued my escapades in my determination not to let them break them. But well... while running away from the principal one day - his toupee in hand - I happened to cut across the football field. Some fool thought that the toupee in my hand was a football, and tried to tackle me!

Of course, being the son of Hermes, means being swift-footed and I easily evaded his and his cronies clumsy attempts to take me down.

The school's track coach had happened to be watching the spectacle I had created that day and, seeing my potential, coaxed me into trying out for the track team.

Of course being the son of H-...you get the point; I easily broke not only the school record, but later went on to break the world record by several seconds, which catapulted me into instant stardom.

But it was the track coach's belief in me that really provided a stabilizing influence. He never gave up on me, despite my antics, and genuinely cared.

[WP] Young deities are troublesome and misbehaving. Sending them to reincarnate and live a normal life on earth is a remarkably successful correctional method.,CaskMA,"Time loses all meaning during transition between bodies. I’ve ridden this light highway thousands of times and it never ceases to amaze me. I lose all sense of time. There’s no such thing as long or short, near or far. Sometimes it feels like only seconds but when I return to earth I wake up to a hundred years having gone by. Another peculiarity is that when I’m human, I can’t remember anything about who I really am or what I’ve experienced in my other lives. It’s only during this transition where everything comes flashing back to me in a kaleidoscope of memories. See, only inside the tunnel am I able to look back on the past and ascertain where I’ve gone wrong or right.  Sometimes it hurts to remember all my relationships, the fathers, mothers, wives, husbands and children that I’ve been and had. You would think that memories of death, torment or abuse would be the worst to recall, but it’s actually the memories of love that hit me the hardest with bittersweet nostalgia. 

Hold that thought. 

Something’s different about the light around me, usually there’s a distinct sensation of moving upwards --- I’m not being routed back to earth. There’s a strange familiarity brewing inside me as I see the light at the base of the tunnel opening wide. At the end of the tunnel I see a room full of white-robed figures seated around a stone table. Before I know what’s happening, I feel myself being incorporated into existence at the end of the table. Particles of light cling stubbornly to my body before slowly winking out.

“Welcome,” I hear a shrouded voice announce. 

The room is solemn, but welcoming. The table is bare but the walls are decorated with huge reliefs depicting the rise and fall of civilizations in lands familiar and foreign. 

“Where am I?”

One of the figures at the end of the table raises its hands and pulls back its hood to reveal a beautiful golden-skinned face of perfectly symmetric features. The wisdom of a million universes resides in her eyes. In a voice of sweet lilac, she speaks. 

“You are at a crossroads. You’ve lived a thousand lives as a human. You’ve learned enough to ascend to the next kingdom of life. Where you go next, hunger and pain are unknown, only joy and comfort await you. Your companions will be gods.”

“And if I don’t want to frolic amongst the gods?”

“Then you will reincarnate as a human once again. You will be locked into another cycle of a thousand lives,” she responded. 

“When I left, the world was fraught with suffering. I saw death, decay and destruction everywhere. Greed and desire obfuscated love.”

“Such is the lot of humanity.” 

I looked down for a moment. Was I really considering to go back? I let out a determined breath.

“Can I choose where to be reborn?”

The figures looked at one in other in unspoken conference.

“We will make an exception for you.”

“Send me to India and let my parents be of royalty. I will leave this life behind to show others the way home.”

And so it was that I was reborn as Gautama.

""It appears so, Captain.""

This was troubling news for Captain Flotur. It had been decades since the Galactic Federation had dealt with a connected intelligence. It had been a campaign that Flotur knew from near-personal experience had come with a great deal of failures on the behalf of the Federation, though they could hardly blame the Snargle captain that had been leading the campaign; at over three million nodes, the Zimbari Hive was far more massive than any other connected intelligence the Federation had ever dealt with before, and that's not even to mention the technological advances the Zimbari had over the average hive.

But Flotur was a capable Captain, one of the finest in all of the Federations Interstellar fleets. He would not make the same mistakes as his mentor had.

""Alright, give me the numbers, Lieutenant.""

""The Amanda Hive is far more advanced than any Hive we've ever seen before. They reached the Atomic Stage around twelve cycles ago, and there's heavy evidence supporting Doctor Tury's theory that they once used weapons of that class on themselves, though we're struggling to find a reason that a Hive would attack itself.""

Interesting. Perhaps the Hive was inherently unstable? Or maybe it had been at one point? 

""Strange. I'm sure the boys in the lab will be busy getting to the bottom of that. How many nodes are we looking at?""

""Early estimates place the node count at approximately seven point one billion, sir.""

""I'm sorry, but did you say billion?""

""Billion, sir. With a 'b'.""

Seven and a tenth billion connected individuals, each one identical to the next. The Zimbari were massive for a Hive at their three million; the Amanda was a class all of their own.

""Incredible. When can we get communications established?""

""We have a comms drone on stand-by, sir. Just say the word.""

""Let's get it done with I suppose.""

Within a minute, the viewing screen on the ship's bridge was live, broadcasting a live feed of the Hive Queen.

Ms. Kotsonov was just as cheerful today as any other day. Her smile invited the class to open up with her even after the bell rang, and that's why she had always been my favorite teacher. I knew she would happily write me a pass for my next class and I knew she would love to read my poem submission for our library event. I just had to overcome the butterflies that kept me glued to my seat. Me, the 265 pound star linebacker terrified of a sweet old ladies opinion.

She held one hand out to catch the ball and never even glanced in it's direction, and pulled out a set of false teeth with the other hand. When the ball bounced back, perfectly into her palm she threw it again at the light switch leaving me only a split second to see that Ms. K wasn't an old lady at all, and I was beginning to doubt that she was really an English teacher.

I had accepted it, it was a lot of space and I needed it. I couldn’t live in another apartment, I had suffered with claustrophobia for the last ten years, living in places that were close to campus and that had to be shared to keep up with rent. The hospital was generous though, and I could finally live somewhere comfortable, even if it did have its faults.

The most unique one, not necessarily a fault, was Sabrina

Sabrina was the older woman that I lived next to. She had been the first neighbor to welcome me to the neighborhood, the only neighbor to do that actually. The rest of the street could be filled with empty houses for all I knew, I never had met any of the others, even on my days off. But Sabrina had brought me cold lemonade the day I moved. 

It had been pleasantly bitter and sweet, and had distracted me from the smell that I now knew as Sabrina’s. It was distinctly the odor of someone who lived with over twenty cats.

She was kind, but peculiar, as well as her cats themselves. They were all black with green eyes. I asked her about them once.

“They just show up. Cats talk to each other, they can hear each others’ thought. I think my first one, Shadow may he rest in peace,” She paused every time she talked about one of her deceased cats and I had just accepted it to be polite to also bow my head with her a little every time, “just told all the other black cats around that I was a safe haven.” She was chatty. 

That could be a fault sometimes, when I would come home tired from a shift at the hospital, Sabrina would always insist that I come up to her porch for a glass of iced tea and to help her bring all her cats inside. I didn’t really mind, Sabrina was quite different from anyone else I encountered in everyday life. She treated her cats with complete respect, as if they were human, and then turn around and berate them for going out in the dark even though she was the one to leave her doors and windows always open.

Sabrina loved her cats, she tried to give them the most comfortable life she could. She was widowed, and her first cat had been a gift from her late husband. His love of animals and cats had inspired her to continue taking care of any cat that came to her with complete devotion. I was pretty sure she would do it for the rest of her life.

For some reason, I couldn’t refuse any of her requests for company and help. She was too kind and fragile. She made me think of my late grandmother who had no one but me to sit with her during her final days. The rest of my family had died from chronic diseases and accidents over the years, they were the reason I had become a doctor. My perfect health, a miracle in my family, had inspired me to bring life to others.

My late grandmother was also why I had settled in Glenbrook, my first few months here had been spent with her. I had tried to be with her as much as my hospital time would allow me in my final days. And then she had passed, leaving me with enough money to comfortably move to a better neighborhood, a larger house. 

Five years later, I was still here with the loud pipes and the crazy cat lady next door. I didn’t hate the house, and Sabrina was extremely hospitable as a neighbor. She would speak to me until late hours, effectively making me tired enough to fall right asleep as soon as I got home, every night.

Except tonight, we had gone out drinking in celebration of a doctor’s engagement. I was dropped off my the sober colleague who had asked me if my house was haunted. 

I had promptly stumbled out, too drunk to come up with a witty comeback. My house was a little worn down on the outside and the grass overgrown, that’s why rent was cheap for the neighborhood. The owner had let it go even farther ever since I moved in. The interior of the house was fine, the outside just had peeling white paint and a few broken railings. I never had any guests however so it didn’t really matter to me. Keeping up appearances was expensive and something I didn’t feel like complaining about when I already had cheap rent.

I stumbled into bed, not bothering to even take off my socks. I’d deal with it in the morning.

\--

I woke to an immense thirst. I hadn’t drunk enough water at the bar and was rewarded with a pounding headache. 

The house was still dark, I probably hadn’t been asleep for very long. I fumbled next to my bed for the bedside lamp and flicked the switch.

I froze. 

There was someone standing above me. A tall skinny woman, dressed all in black, with black hair and claw like finger nails. She was hovering over me, like she was getting ready to tuck me into bed, but she froze too.

We made eye contact, her eyes were blood red. They were nothing less than terrifying, set in a ghastly angular face, cheeks so hollow she looked like she could be dead.

“BE GONE!” A familiar voice shouted from the doorway to my room. 

We both looked to see Sabrina, her long grey hair flying widly, green eyes bright, and flanked by her ever-growing number of cats. Frankly she looked as crazy as the lady who was hovering above my bed.

The lady hovering above me hissed, I looked back, not sure I had ever heard a human make that noise before. She lunged for me and I closed my eyes tight, expecting the worst from her talon like nails.

A bright light flashed, I could see it even with my eyelids closed, and then there was stillness.

I slowly opened an eye to see Sabrina standing over a pile of smoking black ashes. Her cats were rolling around in it, making a mess on my floor. 

I was too stunned to shout at all of them to stop.

“What just happened?” I asked the crazy haired cat lady from next door. She sighed, helping her cats make a mess by stomping around to spread the ashes.

“You just saw your first vampire. You’re usually at my house when they show up.” She pointed at my bedside table. It said 12:01 AM.

“What do you mean usually?” I said, ignoring the pounding headache. I had definitely had too much to drink last night.

“Vampires, ghosts, whatever feels like passing though the Veil in your house at midnight.” Sabrina said in her usual matter-of-fact manner.",ejpxtd

"[WP] After weeks of trial and error, you figure out that you have the powers/skills/abilities of the last video game character you played...",vectre,"Dear Diary... Lol, diary, this is really a journal for me to record my thoughts fairly unfiltered so that I have a reference to figure this thing out, but 'Dear Diary' sounds more informal…   
   
   
It is March 5th and this has been happening for a couple of weeks now. Well, I say it has been a couple of weeks, but it is possible that I only have noticed for the past couple of weeks..   
   
   
It happened when my friends and I visited the gun range. When we got to pick our weapons I realized that I understood.. Actually, that is not a strong enough word, I don't know if there is a strong enough word to express this, but I knew.. I knew every weapon, every part, every bolt.. I knew that I could tear down, repair, rebuild, and maintain each one without exception, without question or hesitation... I knew each type and caliber of ammunition, how to use them to best effect, even how to make and reload each..   
   
   
At the end of our little exercise the owner of the range came up to us and remarked that I had scored at the level of an expert marksman. That really surprised my friends since even though I am familiar with guns I am, or was, no expert, training or practice with them was something I had never really had time for. I blew it off, told him and even convinced myself it was beginner's luck..   
   
   
A few days later we went out for a paintball war. Once again it was like it was a part of me, positioning, marksmanship, strategy, group tactics all like it was second nature to me.. We had a rough start, but after they started listening to me, it was a route, they didn't have a chance..   
   
   
This is where it broke, after this things calmed down, we took some time to relax. The next week I went back to the range by myself and found it was gone. At least everything was more in line with what I would have expected from my life experience.. I could recognize a few guns, had to ask for the right ammo, and my performance while ok, was nothing to write home about…   
   
   
As I put things away I searched my mind, my heart for all that I felt was lost, and found something else. I found swords, spears, axes, and bows. I found how to forge daggers, armor, swords, knowledge of lycanthropes, vampires, some magic, and the seemingly useless knowledge on how to slay and dress a dragon....    

Magic isn't something I wanted to experiment with, but this was the night I happened to be accosted by some muggers.. It felt so good to repel them with just my voice..   
   
   
At this point I started to make the connection, Call of Duty, Battlefield, Skyrim, etc… A friend of mine is wanting me to play Kirby and if I am right about the connection no, just NO….   
   
   
May 30th:   
Well Diary, is has been a couple of weeks of trying new things.  I could seem to only hold on to one at a time, but it is still amazing.   
   
   
Breaking bricks to find money, double jumps, wall jumps. Finding money and items in pots, well lets just say I am banned from Pottery Barn…   
   
   
After a while it seemed to get stronger and I would have access to the basic equipment from the game.. Being able to teleport around and pull weapons from holsters that keep getting new guns teleported into them was nice, but I don't want to think about when that might be handy in real life. But being fast enough to dodge or catch bullets to throw them back has other interesting uses..   
   
   
Now I have a bit of a problem, having the ability/power/curse where time only moves when you do makes it hard to change powers. Unless I can figure out a way to pause it or turn it off I may die with the world stuck between seconds, wish me luck…

“Donnie I haven't taken it off I'm going to be fine.” 
“You don't know my parents how are you feeling? Anything tingly? Burning?”

“Look they are incredibly insensitive. I know it's going to be one of those nights.” You take your hand off the steering wheel and reach for hers. You can feel the engagement band on her finger. You look directly at her. Her green and purple lava lamp like eyes glow gently and the darkened car. “If they say anything that hurts you we leave, kay?”
She gives you a small smile and leans in. Her hot lips brush against your earlobe. “Of course Donnie but remember I'm not that delicate I can take it. If we're going to get married we have to be able to deal with each other's families. You dealt with mine at Thanksgiving. I deal with yours tonight.”

The wind whistles ominously, a high-pitched eerie sound that shatters the silence of the night.  Trees shroud me from the outside, an unseen silhouette against the darkness.  I'm tense; I never quite liked the forest, and every twitch and crackle of the leaves and twigs strewn causes me to recoil from the staggering boom it presents. Eventually, after a long and arduous trudge through the blackness, I come across the crossroads.  I've heard the legends.  I'm probably crazy and stupid for even thinking this would work, but I'm desperate.  My life has fallen apart by my own hands, and there's no way to make things right.  No way but this.

First, I take out the jar of freshly slain lamb's blood.  I had never killed anything besides ants before, but desperate times, right?  I place it in the exact center of the road, and then take out a family heirloom--a watch worn by my father and grandfather. I place it on the ground as well, then take out a knife.  Streaking it across my open palm, I then invoke the spell that will bring the crossroad spirit forward.  It's in an archaic form of Hebrew, so I struggle at first, but the reply is immediate once I finish speaking.  A ring of fire forms on the ground, the embers low and struggling against the wind.  With an unnatural flare, it encircles the offerings I presented and immediately closes, incinerating them.  As suddenly as this occurs, it ceases without leaving any evidence that it had ever been there.  

I hear the sound of twigs snapping, and turn immediately.  Before me stands an astonishingly beautiful woman.  She's everything I've ever dreamed of--her hair goes down to her shoulders and shines with a lustrous golden gleam despite the darkness, and she's dressed in a plain, simple t-shirt and jeans but the contrast only accentuates her qualities.  She struts yet stalks me, and I move back reflexively as she approaches.

""Well well well, I didn't expect a suitor so soon.  What's going on, handsome?""

I steel myself and take a deep breath while closing my eyes to refocus.  Opening my eyes, I calmly state, ""I'd like to make a deal,""

Smiling, she says, ""Oh?  I would never have guessed.  Let me guess,"" she says as she begins to circle around me, studying me critically, ""you're the type of guy that would definitely lead a nice life before invariably screwing it up.  Am I close?""

I let it go, the blow not as bad as I'd thought.  This was just what I'd expected.  She wanted to get me emotional, so that I'd lose most of my rational thought and agree to something without fully understanding the terms.  ""Yes.  I'd like to reverse everything I've done for the last 3 years.""

At this, her eyebrows jump up in shock mockingly, and she says, ""3 years?  Wow, you must really be some kind of psychopath.  How many people did you torture with your presence that you need the last 3 years reversed.""

""Can you do it?""

""I'm not sure, 3 years---that's a lot.  Might be beyond me.""

""Can. you. do. it?""

At this all pretense is gone, and her eyes narrow like a hawk soaring towards its target, ""The standard deal for most requests is about 10 years.  This is a bigger request.  No, I'd need something more,""

""What would it be?""

""I don't know. Show me the SoulFax,""

I'm dumbfounded.  What? Huh?  What in god's--

""Your SoulFax?  Hello?  Did you not bring it?  You look like you had a lobotomy.""

It takes me a moment to compose myself, before I say, ""What?  Are you like pulling my leg or...""

She sighs, hair unmoved by the wind, ""People these days.  I swear, what is the point?  People want financing options, souls on layaway I mean--what's a demon to do?  How am I supposed to vet these people when they can't even provide me basic documentation.""

""I'm really lost.  Like, this wasn't in any of the local myths or legends.  No ghost story ever ends in, 'Yeah no, my Soul report was pretty trash so I couldn't quite get access to genius-level piano talent.  I did score a couple of free lessons to start me off and then it's like $50 bucks a month'.""

""Well, they should.""

I went through all of this trouble just to deal with some prima-donna selective-as-all-hell demon.  Calming myself, I say, ""Alright, how do I sign up?""

""Do you have the VPN for purgatory?""

""...No? Why the fu--""

""Ok, so you can just google that.  Once you do that, go ahead and register at soulfax.he.ll.""

I have the most generic powers, enhanced physical capabilities, such as super speed, strength, and endurance, among other things, but despite it being the most generic it's rediculusly powerful if anyone puts effort into it, but they rather have their genes spliced to get something else... So much wasted potential...

""We've always had our differences, but please listen to me! You can't beat him! We couldn't, what makes you think you can?!""

I turned, activating my power to let off a bright purple aura around my body, and with a twisted smile, I replied

""Because I'm willing to kill him""

I've never gone full power before... It hurts... I feel like my bones are shattering with each hit... But they're just... Rattling? I'm not sure, but it's the worst pain I've ever felt...

#""AND NOW, I SHALL BANISH YOU TO ETERNAL TORMENT!!""

Everyone looked at me, and for a split second it was possible to hear the pounding hearts of the defeated hero's and the terrified civilians, but the silence was broken by a deafening sound... The hardest punch I've ever thrown... Not much is left of him... Maybe it was over kill, but I couldn't risk him getting back up... But... It's over...

""How... How could you...""

I turned around to properly look at them, and through my exhausted and hoarse voice, I croaked out my response

""Because you fucking couldn't""

I woke up in a hospital, and apparently while I was out the hero's rebelled against the registration bullshit... Not sure I'll be let back out though... Guess I'll have to hope my powers have come back enough to survive this fall... Yeah, I'll be fine, if I wake a couple weeks to regain my strength at least...

Once again, if any one of your multiple species suffers an extinction event, this will reflect poorly on your passing grade, even *if* you have multiple cultures under observation.""

""Be forewarned, active study has a tendency to produce unforeseen variables when leaving them to their own devices. If you go to sleep, they may not be the same when you wake up.

&amp;#x200B;

For eons, human kind has searched for life outside our own. Extinct microbes, barren rocks, endless voids are all we ever found in the *Milky Way*, and so, we turned to the example of God. Long had we shed divisive ideology, replacing it with arrogance long warned against. We took upon us the mantle of creation, and violated it.

&amp;#x200B;

We perverted every spiral arm with the seeds of life, tending to and guiding evolution along an accelerated path to life. Human kind had taken its time to evolve and prosper, mastering the tools and sciences allowing us to conquer our little slice of the universe. Barely a millennia passed, and life invaded the galaxy. Humans were no longer alone, but to our surprise, we were unique. Intelligent life took many forms, and defied our understanding of it.

&amp;#x200B;

None took the form of man. The creatures we had created took the forms of crustaceans, reptiles, insects, arachnids and even fish. Few were bipedal, fewer were humanoid in any capacity. So, we did what humans do in the face of the unknown, we conquered it. We subjugated it. We hated it.

However, when he discovered earth, he imagined that it would be powered be the same basic runes as all other planets, but earth only had vox, the rune of life. 

“Surely there must be some other rune here, perhaps there is a cloaking enchantment, or a sigil of disturbance.”, but no matter what he or his team did, there were no other runes to be found.

“Well if I can breath here, there must be some artificial means of runic sustenance”, said Sv-3, “perhaps there is a titan here.” When the two warped to earth, they did feel a presence of something powerful, but not a titan. Something else, something more intelligent.

“Maybe if we search this planet we will find something”, and so the two warped out of the field and onto the top of a New York skyscraper.

“Well this certainly proves that there must be more runes here. I mean if there weren’t, how could other species manage to construct such massive shrines?” Said Sr-1. “And there are so many of them, how many titans do they worship here?”, and then he saw them below, humans...

//ABSTRACT:

A civilisation of intelligent creatures (sentience, gifted with soul) that despite having highly developped social structures lack any and all knowledge of Thaumaturgy. It has been noted that their home planet ('Troin-III' under FGS designation, or 'Earth' under local designation) is notably lacking in any sort of fields. It is plausible that it constitutes a Dark Spot in between planes, hence the difficulties of access.

Their civilisation has somehow developped without the use of thaumaturgic methods, by the study and application of mundane methods to a degree we did not think possible; they dub these disciplines 'Science' and 'Technology'.
  
While much more roundabout than the simpler application of thaumaturgic forces to an end, their methods allow them to reach similar effects - using the mundane phenomenon of 'induction' or the combustion of gases to heat food, for instance, or using propelled constructs to circumvent their inability to use portals. Particularily notably, they have recently been creating constructs to mimic their consciousness (dubbed 'AI'); the similarity to homunculi should be noted, but these 'AI' appear to be entirely mundane, built using interactions between the 'fundamental elements of matter'.

There is much to discuss with this race should we enter open communications - their profoundly alien methods and thoughts may enrich the Federation greatly. Care should nevertheless be taken as these primitives appear to be quite warlike.

"[WP] Aliens are shocked when they discover humans; not only are they the only intelligent species incapable of magic, they also have this strange thing they call ""technology"".",LordJac,"Sower Sarax stared at the scroll. He had completed a few flybys of this world they found. Species call themselves ""humans"", and they live in the system called ""Sol"", on the third planet called ""Earth"".

Earth... was a death world. Sarax had seen one such a world before. Full of disasters, dangerous beasts, and lots of extinctions.  
But this Earth had been tamed. And an intelligent species was living on it. Spreading. Growing.

The thing about death worlds is that those worlds do not have an Aethir Tree. They die when planted there. The worlds themselves block any influence of Aethir somehow. Even Sarax felt his power weaken here in orbit, barely able to move his roots or branches.

And so, these worlds are always skipped, and, until now, never had intelligent life. Perhaps tourist destinations at best for the more... visceral types who enjoy the sight of beasts brutally murdering each other. Or killing those beasts themselves, for sport.

Aethir Trees are an ancient, intelligent plant species, intelligent beyond measure. Revered as gods. These Trees are capable of spreading life on planets, enhancing this life with the ability to manipulate reality, allowing that life to tame the elements on their homeworlds, and then spread through the stars, always on a holy mission to spread the Seeds of Aethir to other worlds. A symbiotic relationship. The Varaem Forest, of which Sarax was a designated Sower of, was the largest of them all, having Planted over ten million worlds with the Seeds of Aethir. There were other, smaller Forests, sure. But they split off from the original Varaem millions of cycles ago. Different cultures, but the same ancestry.

Earth had been a known anomaly before now. They discovered it about 66 million cycles ago. And they found trees on this world. Other deathworlds had plants, sure. But not many. Especially not big ones. Shrubbery and algae. Mostly deserts and water otherwise. They tried making contact with these trees, but the trees were unresponsive. There were beasts there as well. Brutal meat eaters, or tree eaters.

So, an anomaly, but not worrying. A couple of rebellious pure-sap Varaem Sowers didn't like this abomination, said that trees should only be Aethir, or not at all, so they threw a large rock at the world. Last time we checked, the world was covered in ash and dust, hopefully killing it.

But they heard... signals from here recently. Earth. It seemed green, so, it still had trees. But no Mother Tree. And the trees were still deaf and dumb. But now... Earth had these humans. An intelligent species, somewhat similar to what Aethir Trees create after being Sown, but incapable of the Aethir powers. They still managed though. They do not have telepathy of the Aethir Mind, but they cleverly use lightwaves to transmit messages almost instantly all over their planet. They are not overly strong, but they have ""machines"" to do the heavy lifting. They can not create Starpaths using the Aethir Lines, but they travel across the stars manually, using large city-ships travelling at near light-speed (often taking decades, if not centuries of travel to another world). It all seemed primitive, and they were helpless in the Void. But the ""technology"" they develop, is a replacement to the Aethir powers. So, in Sarax' mind, they could be equals. Different, for sure. Perhaps a bit uncivilized, considering they are killing off Earth, and themselves, from time to time. But nothing that can't be fixed.

Sarax was still debating making contact. So far, any first contact was always made about five thousand cycles after Sowing the Seeds of Aethir, introducing the new species into the Varaem Forest, which was their destiny from the start. Often bringing new spells to the Forest, allowing it to grow and expand further and faster across the universe.  
But this... this is first contact with something that is not supposed to exist. 

But Sarax also knew that making first contact now, would mean he would tip off the Aethir Mind... a subconscious entity. Sarax, like all other Varaem, can block it for a while, except with strong emotions. And making first contact, well, that would make it impossible to block. And through the Aethir Mind, news travels fast, which in this case would be undesirable. The Puresaps would certainly come around to finish what they started millions of years ago. After all, this was a cursed death world.

No... Sarax looked at the humans, and would leave them alone. He would notify that, somehow, the Death World's influence has grown, so a wide berth should be taken. For if you would approach too closely within a couple lightcycles, you would become rooted where you stand, incapable of movement or Aethir powers. 

But Sarax saw something, far away. A presence, something unnatural. A machine, travelling further and further. He opened a small Starpath to it. ""Voyager"" it said. A golden disc, coming from the Humans. Sarax smiled to himself, because he now had a plan, and put a Seed of Aethir in it. And a message to explain his plan. For if Humans were to become part of the Varaem Forest... they needed to be family. So that the Puresaps would have no reason to exterminate them. And the ways of the Aethir are beyond comprehension. Perhaps Humans can be taught how to use the Aethir powers... merge with them somehow on a world that is not Earth. And then, certainly, through the Human's technology, the Varaem Forest will grow too.",Xolarix

"[WP] Aliens are shocked when they discover humans; not only are they the only intelligent species incapable of magic, they also have this strange thing they call ""technology"".",LordJac,"The station was empty, except for two people. The moon cast a pale light that joined with the warm yellow of the hanging halogen lamps. Martin Prince slumped on a metal bench and stared at the distant track. He was on his way home from his brother's stag party, his vision swam, and his head was on the verge of splitting. A second person stood on the same platform; skulking with buried hands. Martin played limp and pretended not to notice the shortening distance between him and The Stranger. The scrolling information sign said that the train to Bournemouth was due in five minutes. 

'Evening.' The Stranger said. 

The Stranger went by the name Harry. He was easy enough to forget; you could walk past him every day of the week and not recognise it as the same person. He was not particularly handsome, nor ugly. Everything about him was moderate; the way he moved, spoke and laughed. Martin regarded him with washed-out eyes. 

'Or morning, depending on how you look at it.' 

'Ha.' The Stranger moved closer and extended a hand. 'I'm Harry.' 

Martin didn't reciprocate. 'No you're not.' 

'I beg your pardon?' 

'You're not Harry. You're not even human.' Martin said. 

Three minutes until the train. A winter wind cut through the silence, and The Stranger smiled at Martin. 

'Are you feeling alright?' 

Martin returned the smile. 'Everyone and their Nan uses a disillusion spell.' 

The stranger blinked. 

'It means we can see the shell, or ""Harry"" as you called him. It also means that we can see what's underneath.' 

'I think that you've had too much to drink.' 

Martin staggered to his feet like a half-finished game of Jenga leaning into the wind. He closed his eyes - which made the swaying worse - and muttered something under his breath. A shudder rippled its way through his muscles, and each passing second improved his balance. 

'There. I've killed my buzz for you.' Martin said. 'And what do you know? You're still not human. Why are you here?' 

'*Magic*.' The stranger hissed. 

'That's not a secret. And, even if I didn't use magic, I would have been able to figure out you weren't human.' Martin said and withdrew his phone. 

A flash joined the moonlight, and Martin tapped away. 

'Can you see that?' He said and turned the screen to face The Stranger.

It was like discovering a new species. The Stranger cocked his head and drew close to the phone. 

'Technology?' 

'Well yeah, but that's not what I'm trying to show you. Look at the ""No Results""' Martin said. 

The Stranger slid forward and snatched the phone. Martin, even in his poised-state, couldn't react fast enough. 

'Thanksss.' 

The human shell crumpled, it fell like an abandoned towel and lay in a crumpled pool on the station floor. 

'Great.' Martin said over the rumble of the oncoming train. 'Could have just gone to a shop and stolen a phone, but no, you chose to steal mine.'

He turned and acknowledged him with a nod and returned his view to the glass wall and through it the planet below. 

“Most curious” he said gesturing to the vivid ring of colours circling the planet. “One of the largest coronas I have ever seen and the inhabitants seem unaware of it.”

He closed his void eye and turned to the starfairer. “Can we go closer?”

“Commander says no.” He points to a small bright spot that could be clearly seen without the distracting colours of the void energy.

“A satellite? But how? Are they void aware after all?”

“No maester.  The scriers say there are no signs of structured void usage on the surface or in orbit. Some low level random flutters of energy they think could be attributed to a rare innate ability for telepathy or natural necromancy.”

“So they got something in orbit how?” The maester said before muttering a form that would help his vision stretch the distance to the bright object. He was no scryer but his natural sight was good and he could stretch it further than most.

“As you can see it is big enough for people to live on. They are on the verge of becoming a star fairing planet.” He reached into his robe and pulled out a crystal sphere with a series of runes carved into its silver cradle.  “The scriers bade me show you this” 

The maester took the sphere a twin to one of their larger crystals used in the main guiding temple for the star city. The visions it flitted through were incredible. They could do things only magic should be able to achieve using complex and intricate devices. He went pale as he saw a flash of a vision box which seemed to mirror the purpose of the sphere he gazed into. The star city was clear on their box. 

The people of the planet below were aware the star city was here and he could think of no way to reach out to this void null race. “I must speak to the commander at once. I foresee trouble.”

"[WP] While going through a downtime in your life, you go to pray for guidance and mispronounce your deity’s name and an ancient long forgotten deity by the name you spoke shows up to help.",OddeTee,"Whatever business the old lady had with Selesisen, it had been concluded. She left the temple in a hurry, with a brisk gait which belied her stature. Maybe she had asked for a spring to her step. Selesisen often granted wishes of the unimportant variety, which was part of the reason Damien chose him today.

The temple was now silent and, more importantly, empty. Damien felt his anxiety surge up as the moment he'd been waiting for finally arrived. With no people around, he could try praying out loud.

'Sheleshishen, pleash aid me in my hour of need.'

It felt liberating, to not hear snickers of contempt down the aisle. Maybe he had a very bad lisp, but what would that matter to a god?

'Sheleshishen, please aid me in my hour of need.'

He managed to squeeze the 'please' just right this time. It felt pretty good.

'Sheleshishen, please aid me in my hour of need.'

That was that. Now he was supposed to wait, and the deity would choose whether or not to appear to him. So he waited.

And waited.

He was just about to get up and run home, his eyes watering, but that was when the ground began to crack. A wave of nauseating dark escaped the granite flooring, and coalesced before Damien.

**The ants forgot me for millions of years. Now they call me back? Now? The rest of the pantheon have stopped inviting me to parties. Do you know how bored one grows over time? Do you?!**

'I-'

**I assume you're my head priest now. Is this our temple?**

'I-'

**No, it belongs to that weirdo Selesisen. I can smell him.**

'I-'

**You're not a brash sort of guy, are you? I assume you want a wish granted? Go ahead. I have enough power for a thousand wishes.**

Damien closed his eyes for a moment, to try to process what just happened. He didn't get it. None of it, in fact. But this guy was offering him help. Did it matter that he was a contorting mass of black goo?

The thin partition walls between changing rooms begin to shudder.  I stop wrestling with the slacks and stand as still as I can, steadying my breathing.  The sound of rolling gunfire splits the quiet pulse of ambient music coming from the speakers.   Footsteps are thunder.  Hand shaking, I pull back the curtain a little.  Through the small gap I see the fuzzy smoke of discharged weapons and an arm here, a leg there.

"[WP] You have had an increasingly agonizing headache all night. Just as you are dialing 911, something frees itself through your nose, taking the headache with it.",TrickyV,"The tapping inside his head was like a marble bouncing inside a glass. The sound was erratic, but like a rattle. His head was rolling between his shoulders. In his reflection on the computer screen he thought he saw something flash -- like a lid -- over his eye. The cubicle walls around him were getting smaller – at the Capital One office, in the IT department. *Damn damn damn mutherfucker.* Karthik pressed his fists against his forehead, banged it. *Damn damn*. The sound of the marble rolling in the glass, rolled in his head from ear to ear.

He could also hear the sound of his heart beating. The volume was unbearable. At five o’ clock he dragged himself out to the parking lot, after a day spent doing nothing but staring at his screen and slamming his head – and googling his symptoms, banging his fingers so hard on the keyboard it was like Bach. In spots during the day he would see blood in the world, like fire burning through film stock. He dragged himself to his car, got home and crawled into bed. *Keep increasing the pain*, he thought, in a marbled, drunk voice. *I can’t take anymore pain.* He shoved ten advils in his mouth that he crunched with his teeth and swallowed dry. Karthik slid his body on the floor, over carpet, over the laminate floor, to the bottle of vodka. He crawled on all fours back to the bed his head beating like a drum. He pulled the blankets over him. The lights were all off. Karthik could feel something in his head, but he had no clue what it was -- or if it was just his imagination. He pressed his hand against his forehead and felt a small river of skin. When he touched it the thing vanished and his skin deflated. *Fuck fuck fuck* he whispered out loud through gritted teeth that were powdering. He gurgled and swallowed more vodka.

*Was it minutes or hours*, he thought, but could not answer. When the pain reached its zenith, he pulled himself up on his sink and looked at the mirror. Before he could unlock his phone to call 911 it fumbled out of his hands and cracked on the floor. When he looked back up there was – an appendage -- dark green, bumpy, wet – sticking out of his left nostril. It was scaly. Karthik felt his blood pressure rising, his heart going insane and erratic like a madman trying to break free from his strait jacket – and the heat of his skin was suddenly feverish. He could not believe it. He felt the entire thing like a clot all through his brain pressed against his skull. He pulled. The thing was like a leg that shot back up his nose. Then it started crawling back through his mouth -- smooth like. He felt its head slapping against the roof of his mouth. Then he felt it on his tongue.

Karthik opened his mouth now – everything felt so good suddenly -- the pressure in his head was dimming, dimming….a creature leapt from his mouth into the sink where it slid and then stood up – eyes ablaze like Hannibal Lector, soft-tissue arms and legs welded to a pickle body – the creature exclaimed, *I’m Pickle Rick bitch! Hell yeah!*

The thing jumped onto the toilet, flushed and jumped in. It swirled away. *FUCK YEAH* it yelled. Karthik vomited on the floor, rested his head on the lip of the sink. *Need to stop smoking the loud.*",Don_coyote2020

This was it.

A level 86 trader screamed ""WWWWWWWWW"" as he stood still in front of my very slow crusher.

It isn't easy being a minion guarding a miniboss, especially when that miniboss is in the tutorial. I had no idea why this dude thought to replay the tutorial when he was already ranked 7 on the world leaderboards, maybe he hit is head or switched bodies with a baby? Anyway it brought me satisfaction to se his armor first getting crushed and the the satisfying sound of bone crumbling, as the richest man on this side of the great ocean of Aggrowichia died in my measly trap. When it was done all that was left was a bloodied mess and for some reason all of his stuff was without a dent even though I clearly saw his armor breaking. Whatever i was RICH. 



So i may have found a problem in my reasoning that i was rich which is who would ever carry 5.7 milion gold on them but apparently this dude is a superhuman, because he did that. I think his backpack might be magic since i threw a rock in last week and i still havent heard it hit something.


Okay I have found no way out yet, but the adventurers all come out of here so it must exist


3 people have gone through the tutorial only this hour but they just seem to dissapear after fighting my boss, so i see no other way out than to fight him i guess.

Okay my plan did not work and now Boris is angry at me, luckily i still have that dudes armor and weapons.

I have decided to do it, if I do not come out even from this, well i will be dead anyway. The crusher must be the only way out for me.

[WP]In a fantasy world where levels and even evolutions are granted by killing strong opponents you were born as one of the weakest monsters. Then one day a powerful adventurer trips and falls on your weapon.,boa_con,"I couldn't believe it, I scored one! I never thought that I could gain even a single experience point, but here I am, still alive. Usually whenever a human comes by this part of the ravine, my kind are slaughtered with little difficulty. Us Xerodeks are some of the weakest monsters in the biome, making us easy targets for new adventurers and even other monsters. We're quadrupedal, relatively small, and have lackluster stats. While we try our best to fight back, we are just simply outmatched in every category, leaving most of us to flee for our lives. While so far I've had success with fleeing, I've seen plenty of my kind harvested for easy experience, there was nothing I could do. Until he came along.

It was another day in the ravine, and I was out at a nearby river. I dunked my head into the water to get a big drink, and when I lifted my head out, I saw a horrible sight. About 20 feet away from me was a human. The sight of a human was enough for my kind to run, but what made it worse was what was above his head. Hovering over his head was his name and level:

**HERACLES lvl. 137**

I couldn't believe it, his appearance alone was enough for my stats to drop drastically. He was a hulking behemoth with bronze armor and the heaviest-looking mace that I've ever seen. Judging from his life bar, he seemed to have gotten into one heck of a fight before hand, it was flashing red with him looking worn out. I figured that he must had been out of health potions, and that he was out here to find ingredients to make some more. The local vegetation here are key ingredients to brewing up potions, so it wasn't uncommon to see people picking flowers and cacti and what not. It was at that moment that I remembered a horrifying fact. Xerodek scales are used to boost a potion's effects, and he seemed like he needed whatever he could get.

Heracles looked right at me. I tried to blend in with a nearby rock, but it was already too late. He raised his weapon and charged right at me with lightning speed. There was no way I could outrun him, so I instinctively curled into a ball and raised the spikes on my back. I didn't expect it to do me any good, but it was the only thing that I thought of at the time. Taking a peek in front of me, I saw Heracles close the gap between us. I saw him ready to swing his weapon and smite me. I saw him slide on the wet sand and lose his balance.

I felt my spikes penetrate into something.

Looking up, I realized that my spikes ended up going into the helmet's visor and into Heracles' eye socket. Unfolding myself, I took a look at his health bar and saw that I got a critical hit on him, reducing his health to zero. I was in shock, I managed to take down someone with a level that I never knew could get that high. What happened next caught me by surprise. His body disappeared, leaving a bunch of colored orbs behind, similar to the ones that monsters dropped when they were slain. The next thing I knew I was being smothered by them. They escaped from the now empty armor and completely covered me. I felt a surge of strength course through my body, I never knew that this much power existed. It was as if the gods themselves granted me this feeling. Suddenly, it ended. All the orbs left behind found their new host, and I rose from the ground.

Not knowing what just happened, I scurried over to grab another drink from the river. It wasn't until I saw my reflection in the water that I realized what happened. I evolved. I didn't know that Xerodeks could evolve, but there I was. I had hands, my teeth grew sharper, I could stand on two legs, my body grew more beast-like, my scales became rougher, the changes were numerous.

Looking back at where Heracles once was, I picked up his armor. Despite it being meant for a human, the armor fit like a glove. The mace felt right at home with me too. For all my life, I had to watch my kind be ruthlessly slaughtered by others. Now, it doesn't matter who shows up here next. If they want to get to my friends, they would have to go through me first. For now on, the Xerodeks will no longer fear for their lives, I'll make sure of it.",H-Desert

Then one day a powerful adventurer trips and falls on your weapon.,boa_con,"I had never hoped for success. I was a ""mob"", after all. Just trash in the way of the powerful. Just an introduction to combat. I had managed, barely, to survive until now (Cowardice is underrated) . That is, until the lv. 99, shining, plate-armor-covered man appeared in front of me, probably seeking to blow off some steam by killing some easy prey. I fully expected to die.

Until he fricking tripped over a fricking rock, falling with his neck, the only part of his body not covered by that impenetrable armor, on my miser dagger. This could not be happening. Was it some kind of trick? Some twisted deity trying to deceive me for easy laughs? It seemed so.

It was not. Alas, when the light faded out of the brute's eyes, I felt it. Evolution. I, a mere skeleton given consciousness by the All-Reaper, was evolving! 
The bones that constituted my form grew, dark flesh covering them. After the flesh, a black, metal-like substance hardened my grey skin, encasing me in armor. My meagre dagger turned to ashes, from which rose a glaive of the same substance as the armor, a dark-blue mist slowly rising from the blade like vapor, covering its surface. A cape of darkness descended from my shoulders, covering my armor.

I could feel things I had never felt before. I now know how it feels to have flesh covering the bones, to have lips, or a tongue, vocal cords, internal organs. A brain ready to learn and expand. Eyes not made of magic. A beating heart. A face.

I never had any of those. I was one of the skeletons not taken from the ground but created by sorcery, magical particles coalescing into bone, who coalesced into a human form. I had no name, no life before my creation. I was never buried, and I was never alive.

Until now. I approached the lake I ""guarded"" (I was often too busy hiding behind some rock in the dark cave to properly do my job) deep below the earth, the only source of clear water in a very wide area, and looked at it like it was a mirror. I could see it. My reflexion. My long hair, black as the magic that birthed me. My pale complexion. My eyes unlike any human ones, black were they should be white and grey where they should be green, blue, brown or red. My muscular frame covered by dark metal, covered by dark cloth. I was quite like the man I had just killed.

I looked into the reflexion of my eyes, into what some humans mistakenly call the ""heart"", what I know is called the Abyss. And an abyss it was. It was a fitting name for my ""heart"". And it would be a fitting name for me.

I buried the adventurer the proper way, knowing how to do so because my brain was created with knowledge of the world within, knowledge about things I had never seen but whose secrets I now knew. I buried him like I never was. He would rise to the lair of his gods, taking his seat in the table of the Deity of War, like all fallen warriors. His immortal soul would forever feast and sing his glories, unburdened by his humiliating demise, for all death in battle is glorious to these men and women, and knowing his mortal body would be forever safe in its tomb, deep below the ground.

I walked to an exit I now knew existed, worrying solely about what delicacy would have the honor of debuting my palate. And I remembered currency was not one of the things evolution granted. And so disappointment was the first emotion to be shown in my face.",Aishio

"[WP] you’ve had the necklace since birth. It was a gift from your mother. It’s small, gold, and has the number 100 engraved in it. As far as you know, it’s just a normal necklace... until you wake up one day to the necklace reading 99... each day it loses a number...you don’t know why",kalad18,"You weren’t sure what was happening to you.
The necklace, which was once a reminder of your mother’s love for you, suddenly felt heavy against  your skin, its metal unnervingly cold. You hadn’t checked whether the number had changed today . But right now, you couldn’t bring yourself to care. You dragged yourself across the wooden floor, your legs having given up a few minutes ago. Eventually, your trembling fingers grasped your phone, and you quickly dialed 911. The operator was a lady whose voice started to panic when she heard what was happening to you. You felt annoyed, weren’t you supposed to be the scared one? Must be a newbie, you scornfully thought. But you wheezed out replies to whatever the lady asked, and eventually she told you that the ambulance would reach your house in a few minutes. Once the call was over, you pulled the necklace from around your neck, turning it around to look at the number.
0
You started to wonder why you hadn’t told anyone about the necklace, but you got the answer immediately.
The necklace was private. It was a stupid reason, but it was true, especially considering the fact that your mother gave it to you.
Suddenly, out of nowhere, a memory resurfaced in your brain, a memory of your dead mother.
“Sweetie, one day you will find love, and God knows whether I’ll be there with you when that happens. This necklace, it’s been in the family for ages. It’s how I met your father. It brings you close to death, but we have to sacrifice to find love. Its unfair, my dear, but then again, most hereditary curses are.”
You were close to blacking out when you heard the door burst open. Paramedics rushed into your living room, all but one wearing a mask. The one who was not wearing a mask picked you up, and you tried to focus your sight on him.
You might be suffocating with pain, but damn that guy looked good. He also made you feel all warm and fuzzy, which was idiotic, as you had just met him. 
As he picked you up, you wondered whether that memory had actually ever happened. After all, your mother had died in a car crash when you were two, and you couldn’t possibly remember something from that long ago. 
Maybe the memory had never happened when your mother was alive, maybe it wasn’t supposed to happen when she was alive. Maybe it wasn’t even a memory. But honestly, all you wanted to do right now was fall asleep in the arms of the hot paramedic carrying you to the ambulance, 
preferably in a situation where death wasn’t chasing you and he wasn’t saving your life.

*I never really should have drank so much.* 

""I'm not some figment of your imagination. I am you. No amount of shaking your head will change that,"" he says to me, hate in his voice. 

""Why? What have I done to you?"" I say, opening my eyes.

""It's not what you've done. It's what you are. Your very existence threatens mine. And I have had a hard life to reach here. I'm not going back to the lab. I'm not going back on ice.""

""None of this has anything to do with me, mate. Just... just let me go,"" I stammer out, pleading for my life. 

""It has everything to do with you. You are why I exist. And you are why I can't run away and start a life somewhere else. Are you not getting it? Someone cloned you. Someone made me. And they used me, tortured me, made me do things that... Listen. I'm done. I want out. And you're my out,"" he says, as he waves the gun at me. 

My hands begin to shake as he moves closer towards me and forces me to my knees. I feel the coldness of the barrel of the gun on my forehead and I wonder if this was to be the end. To be my end. My eyes shut tightly and my lips murmur a prayer to a deity I don't believe in. 

Then I hear a 'pop' sound, like that of a bubble bursting. 

A wall of air slams into me, and I hit the back-wall of the alleyway with a tremendous force that causes me teeth to rattle in place. It takes me a while to get my bearings as my body hurt but when I look up to the place my doppelganger was standing, I let a gasp escape me. 

*He's gone? What the hell was that?*

Dropping my brush I backed up against the wall of my bathroom as my reflection moved forward. It pointed at me, and my vision blanked as I was hit with a wave of vertigo.

Suddenly, I could see again. My reflection was no longer pressed up against the mirror, it was back standing like it had been before. Was this a dream? I spoke out loud, but to my surprise heard nothing. I tried to look around but found I could only look forward, and watch in horror as my doppelganger spoke. “New Year.

[WP] You left the house to get a pint of ice cream. Instead you got involved in a major government conspiracy.,ryanoat,"You’d think that keeping pace with a motor vehicle on a bike wouldn’t be the easiest thing to do, but maybe this driver was just lost? Whatever. Whoever this was at least had the courtesy of sticking to the backroads instead of clogging up the thoroughfares. *Maybe he’s on his way to the car wash?* I thought jokingly. Either way, we weren’t heading to a residential district anytime soon, so I decided to make a hard left and head to the nearest store.

Just as I was holding on to my brakes, the truck felt like speeding off into the distance. The exhaust was thick enough to the point where I had to squint in order to not collide with a parked minivan. Yet even while the smoke was only starting to dissipate, I could faintly make out an anxiety-causing sight in the oncoming lane: the blue and red lights of a police car. Of course, my feelings had been conditioned from receiving tickets in the past, but as I was not doing anything out of the ordinary, I figured I was out of the woods. My instincts told me that the officer was probably after the truck since it just looked like it failed its smog inspections.

How wrong I was! The car sped right through the double yellow lines in the center of the road, shining its headlights directly into my pupils. Reflexes would have told any sane person to jump, but I was preoccupied with the blinding lights, meaning that all I could do was cover my face like an idiot and scramble into a direction. Instead of backing away from the car, I body-slammed the officer’s hood in my visionless state. I grit my teeth in agony as the shiveringly cold metal hood made hard contact with my left shoulder. The officer seemed compassionate enough to stop the car, which led me to fall backwards and have my legs pointed up in the air at the front bumper.

Then, a figure wearing a black ski mask emerged from the driver’s side with a black object in his hands. I was too hurt to open my eyes all the way to actually try to recognize the device. I heard an electric whirring, and then it all faded to black.

* 	*	*

By this point, everyone in the car knew why Stan previously refused to accelerate past 15 miles per hour, despite Steve’s incessant protests. Metal kept clanging upon metal, and the henchmen’s tactical gear kept rubbing into one another. Lee somehow was able to avoid any injury and instead condescendingly observed the trials and tribulations of the others. 

Everyone tried to listen as hard as possible when sound could be heard pulsing out of Amy’s speaker again.

“The threat has been neutralized for interrogation,” a voice faintly reverberated through the truck. “I will rendezvous with you once you arrive at Senator Abrams’ location. Use the alternative route in the meantime,” spoke the officer, as the audio cut out once more. Stan veered into the left lane to adjust to the plan, causing Jim and Steve to crash right into Lee’s stomach as he began to cuss them out.

“We knew he had family living out here, but who would guess that an agent so highly reputable would risk himself by hiding in the most obvious location?” wondered Stan. “Perhaps he figured that we would never believe that he’d be staying with his family,” replied Lee. He thought for a second and then asked Stan, “Speaking of which, who are we going to have to make an excuse to for his disappearance, if his loved ones reside here?”

Stan tilted his head as he sat in thought for a few seconds. “Well, he has a-” Stan placed his palm on his forehead as he leaned his head into the back of the truck. “He has a twin brother.”

“Oh my God,” muttered Lee. He then spoke into a Bluetooth speaker of his own, “Hi. Can you have my secretary look into the protocols for civilian exposure to classified activities?”

“Oh come on!” scolded Jim. “What kind of bozo would just trail us for two miles straight besides the real deal?” Lee spoke with disappointment, “Without any form of bodily protection, and with the most obvious style ever? Definitely not Oswald.”

Stan pulled into the parking lot of the office complex and inconspicuously picked a corner spot. The police car was already parked in front of the designated building. Amy hopped out of the passenger seat and pried open the sliding van door. One by one, the whole crew jumped out, grunting as they landed on the rough pavement. Stan went to have a word with Jim.

“I know that you’ve never put a bullet into a man, but today you get a lucky break. Take Mr. Sleepyhead in the police car to our Los Angeles branch. Then uh...” Stan hadn’t formulated his plan completely, “have one of our psychiatrists convince him that he went into oncoming traffic and hit the car.”

“You sure he’s not Oswald?” whispered Jim. “There’s no way in hell,” assured Stan. He ran over to the rest of the “task force” to catch up. Lee had already loaded his rifle. The police officer gave a quick assuring glance (and the keys) to Jim as he also began to gear up. 

Jim sat in the seat of the police car as he adjusted the mirrors. He started to speak out loud to himself. “Well,” he sighed. “I sure hope he still recognizes my voice, even with my disguise.” As he reversed out of the lot, he continued to speak, but this time with his head aimed at the knocked out man laying in the back seats. “I knew you loved ice cream since we were kids, but I was skeptical that even *you* would go out of your way to chase an ice cream truck at the age of 35,” chuckled Oswald. Being a double agent in an organization this corrupt required a lot of personal sacrifice, even if that meant putting a sibling’s life on the line.

Oswald spoke into his own headset, “They took the bait. Set the trap in motion on their alternate exit route.”

The angel managed to slay the demon, but devious as he was, the demon managed to summon her kin. In response, the angel invoked Heaven's forces. Civilization crumbled in 2 months. Now we all live wherever we can trying to survive this war.

My name is X and together with an expedition group we are trying to find a solution for mankind. The solution is to find the lost city of Atlantis to learn the secrets of gods of old. 

We arrive at the temple of Chtulu and see here, dusted and ragged on a marble pedestal the Book of Ancient Divination. Our linguist starts translating the text and a few hours later the ritual to awaken Chtulu begins.

The incantation is over, silence floats like a heavy mist in the chamber. Suddenly a loud snap sends us all to our knees, ears bleeding and dark smoke appears from thin air. We all crawl away from it in fear but as sudden as it appeared, so it disappeared. The chamber was again silent. Nothing happened.

I look around trying to distinguish something through the darkness but see nothing. I try to light the torch that was blown off by the loud snap and barely manage to do it.

Suddenly, a siluhete starts forming in the corner. I was expecting to see something great but the siluhete revealed itself to be an old gentle man walking to us. 

The old man raises an eyebrow and studies each one of us then speaks: 

"" So you are the ones who completed the final step. You have broken the last seal of the Apocalypse. That which says when mankind will turn away from God, then the final judgment shall begin ""

"" What?... "" I say panicked. "" This is impossible "".

The old man smiles at me and says "" Oh, it's as possible as it can be . As real as me, Michael, standing in front of you. ""

Tears start running down my cheeks. I don't know if I am sad we failed or happy this will end one way or another. Michael walks towards me lifting his hand towards my head.

"" You shall be the first sent to be judged "" 

I close my eyes. Suddenly, a large boom fills the room. I open my eyes to see Michael layed on the floor trying to get up. As I lift my head upwards I see a foot on his back, a ferocious creature sitting it's foot on Michael's back completely overpowering him. He smiles and pierces Michael in the back.

"" I am Chtulu and it's my turn now. Rise scared ones and follow me in the greatest battle you have ever seen """,MunsoonX3
"[WP] The war between Angels and Demons has begun, and earth is their battlefield. With so many innocents caught in the crossfire, humanity is desperate. They turn to those who were here before both the angels and the demons, and ask for help. Humanity has recruited The Great Old Ones.",yap2468,"Violence is more than a cycle, it's an addiction. A habit that forms one day, justified that you are 'right' you strike out at the world, only to find that someone else now feels justified to strike back. There will be no war to end all wars, just as there will be no cigarette to end all cigarettes. You can't feed an addiction and expect to satiated. You also can't reason with an addict. They will find a reason for the next one. What other excuse did humanity need besides the heavens had descended on to the earth for their ""final"" battle.

The fallen morning star Lucifer had erupted from the earth to charge into the skies only to be met with a torrent of light. From the broken earth and the cloudy skies, rushing to meet each other was a horde of soldiers. Whether they were clad in light and fire, or darkness and mud their purpose was the same; to fight and punish the enemy for the transgressions that their side perceived. Only there was another side.

Not innocent in the practice and understanding of war the humans found themselves nevertheless to be at a large disadvantage. They knew war of human to human but the celestial and infernal arts were largely unknown. The tactics of humans were subtle curiosities in the eyes of the higher beings; quaint reminders of other life not unlike ants during many of the historical skirmishes of humans. A detailed and thorough accounts of the war in the heavens could be forgiven for leaving out the details of human involvement. 

In the past humans had struck out at their enemy and been noticed. Had been even feared. The creatures of Earth had learned to leave humans largely alone, but the devils and angels left them alone for other reasons. In the great scheme of the universe and its fate the human was insignificant. A fact that humans had learned, as the ancient creatures of their myths and religions ignored the attacks and laments of the surviving people of Earth. When their gods had shown indifference to the humans they looked for something that would react. One that might be listening, that was not benevolently avoiding the interaction but instead waiting.

In the great wisdom amassed by humans in the short time the have read and written their secrets, they delved for a solutions. To end the war of greater beings. To end the fighting on the Earth that had once been theirs. Foolish hands led the way to find leverage against the myths. 

The solution came when called. It was not the abrupt expulsion rom hell nor the quick deployment from heaven that humans had seen. It started slowly. An angel behaved erratically or a demon stared off during battle. It was spread trough the ranks of above and below. A madness. A madness of knowing. Madness had been written about as the expression of the limits of mankind, to describe an unknowable horror. But humans did not find themselves alone in this fragility, when the old ones came. Tentacles stretched from else where. Space sounded with the madness of that heralded the arrival. Abominations walked the Earth.

The landscape of war had altered once more. Humans could interact with the great old ones just barely. And they in turn had an effect on the guardians of the afterlife. A fact the people of Earth would regret. It's hard to fathom what the plan was. Defeat heaven or replace hell with eldritch horror. Surely the loss of heaven and hell would only leave another uncaring horde of madness inducing monsters. Have all lose? and be left with quiet remains of Earth was to optimistic. The humans were addicts though and you can't reason with addiction. There was no peace for the humans till the end. It is unknown when the last died in hiding from the greater terrors that it had learned to know of. ",baugatwork

"[WP] You live in a haunted mansion and you can't sleep at night. Not because the ghost are scaring you, but because they keep partying in your house til 4 am.",yeahlte,"1:20 AM. I still couldn't sleep.

They were right behind the wall beside my bed, and no matter how many things I tried: ear plugs, earphones, and ear-covering, I still could hear them. I'd tell you, if there was ever a more annoying thing than ghosts partying in your home, it's probably ghosts partying ALL NIGHT in your home. I bought this haunted mansion because I didn't want anyone to bother me, but it took, let's say, an unexpected turn.

Turning on the light and trying to read did not help. Their loudness prevented me from getting into the story, so I closed the book and put it back on my bedside table. Maybe the right thing to do, for me, was to go and party with them. But I hated parties. I hated them so much. It seemed like the only solution, but not only did I look like shit without makeup, but also there was no way I could dance in my pajamas. My hair was undone, and my last shower was the morning before. How could I even have done anything with those merrymakers?

Finally, I chose to get out of bed, and listened. Their music wasn't that shitty, actually. It was nice. I went to the bathroom, where two of those revellers seemed to be making ghostly love right above the bathtub, and washed my face, then reached for my eyeshadow palette. Gone. There would be no eyeshadow tonight. I noticed all of my makeup was gone, except for eyeliner and bright red lipstick. That would be fine. Once I was done taking care of my face, I brushed my hair and added some spray, before putting some scent on and dressing up. It would probably change my mind a little bit on parties, who knows?

The couple of ghosts who seemed to have no shame about publicly fornicating seemed to notice me.

""Oh, look"", said the man. ""She's finally coming.""

""Who?"" I questioned. ""Me, or your wife? It seems like you're giving her some good pleasure.""

He laughed.

""No, really, us ghosts were waiting for our living lady to join the party. That's why we prevented you from sleeping.""

""Oh.""

I walked out of the bathroom, and went through the lounge door, as a wall of sounds and welcomes swept across my ears.",Chernushka
"[WP] You decide to sleep on the night of NYE. When you wake up the next morning, something is strange.",AJP14699,"So I’ve never really been the sociable type. I’ve always felt more comfortable dealing with people from a certain….distance. That was partly why I liked to live with the nearest neighbour a couple of miles away, that and the house was cheap. And when New Years Eve 2018 rolled around, it really was a night much like any other for me. All of my friends in the area had gone to parties, and I was at home playing some online games with a gang of people I’d gotten to know over the years. I know what you’re thinking - reclusive neckbeard. Well, fine, be like that if you want, but this is what I like and I’m not hurting anyone.

So anyhow, I’d been having a bit of a losing streak so when it came to about 11pm I decided to head to bed. That and I’d started drinking just after lunch and was catching up with me. Come to think of it, that may also have contributed to the losing streak online. Anyway, off to bed I went. I can’t remember what time it was that I woke up in the morning, it was so long ago now, but it was probably at least 9. I don’t recall having a hangover, guess I was just fortunate on that occasion. Morning routine, check phone and the home internet and 4g connection were down, which was a pain in the ass but not unheard of given my rural location. The power was working so after a quick shower and breakfast, consisting of half a stale bag of chips, I decided it was time to go and get some groceries. Again, at this point everything seemed pretty normal.

The very first thing that was odd was the car I found as I was driving into down, it had come off the road and hit a tree. Not seeing any Police tape or anything around, my initial reaction was along the lines of ‘oh shit, I’m first on the scene here’. I pulled over and ran over to the car, which was somehow still running (evidently hadn’t hit at a particularly high speed), to find it deserted. So the driver had fled? Ok, perhaps a drunk who didn’t want to be found and breathalysed, but the thing that stuck out, was the seatbelt - the drivers belt was clipped in place as though someone had been wearing it. After a minute of looking around to see if there was anyone in the immediate area who needed help I decided to go into town and use the phone there to report it, since I couldn’t get any phone signal at all, not even the emergency only network.

Driving into town and the detritus of last night’s parties was everywhere, all over the streets as though nobody had even attempted a cleanup of any kind. It was only when I parked at the small grocery store I noticed all the phones. Not just one, I must have seen at least a dozen just lying around, as if dropped. All these phones had been lost? And none picked up by a passer-by? I was going over this in my head as I walked the few feet to the store entrance, in my own little world, so much so that I walked straight into the locked front door, banging my head against the glass and making myself look like a total idiot. Rubbing my head and swearing, I double checked the sign in the window, and it was as I remembered - ‘Opening from 8am on New Year’s Day’. My watch said it was almost 11. Looking around, I finally realised - where the hell was everyone? I hadn’t seen a living soul all morning. 

I just started wandering, sorta aimlessly, partly just hoping to find someone. I tried some of the businesses, the bars were open, but deserted, with everything set up for last night’s party. It was as though the staff and revellers has all been plucked from the room by an invisible hand. There was just….silence. Walking for a while all I heard was a dog barking somewhere in the distance, so I decided to head in that direction. Had the town been evacuated in a hurry? Was I the only one left? As I came to the end of main street and towards a more residential area I saw them, two small figures, about a block away. That was the first time I ever laid eyes on them. And the feeling was….indescribable.

I prompt to ask him if he enjoyed it, however a grin appears on his face. Red tears flow down from his eyes onto his cheeks. Before I know it, he bursts out laughing uncontrollably. I get up quickly.

Me: What’s so damn funny!?

DEMON: You call this garbage literature!? This has to be a joke. You don’t know a damn thing about us!

Me: I did my fair share of research!

  I look at my computer that still has the “How to summon  a demon 101” page on Wikipedia open. The demon turns to look but I throw my phone at my screen. My phone broke through the screen and got stuck.

DEMON: Porn?

Me: No!

  The demon looks at me again. He holds up the book and then looks back at me.

DEMON: You know. I can take this right back to hell and this will be a hit there.

Me: It will?

DEMON: Hell yeah! This is the kind of thing the folks down there need! A good laugh!

  The demon starts to laugh again. I get annoyed, but before I can say anything, he bursts into flames. All that remains is a scorch mark on my floor.
  I fall to my butt. In shock of what I’ve heard. I take a moment and then jump up with rage. I grab my phone out of my computer. I furiously look up on Wikipedia, “how to go to hell” and find a page.

The demon laughed, and then causally slapped my papers back down on the tan desk that held my computer and books. I sat by my dimly lit pentagram, surprised it had even worked at all.

""Where'd you learn all this nonsense about us demons anyway?""

I began to speak, but the demon grabbed one of my books (a tome on mystic creatures), flipped it open and interupted me.

""Let's see here: *Demonology and other Forbidden Lore*, published 1878. Hmm, and what about this one?""

I felt the warmth come off of his glowing red arm as he reached past me and took another book in his hand.

""*Revelation's Climax*, published 1982.""

He flipped through the pages briskly.

""A curious publication for sure,"" the demon remarked, ""but it's all wrong too.""

He paused and looked at the manuscript again, then back at me.

""You know, there is some potential here, but your problem is all your information is off base. It's all stories based on stories based on stories based on something someone once said or thought they saw long ago.""

He paused for a moment, thinking.

""We demons could use some better press. People are always 'damn this, damn that,"" like it's such a horrible thing to be with demons, though really it's not all that bad. A good PR guy among the living could make quite a difference. Let me take you there and you can see for yourself. If you're lucky you might even get to meet the big guy himself!""

Before I could protest, the demon clutched my arm and pulled me with him back into the pentagram and into the fiery gates of hell.",Phantom_Engineer

Also I'd suggest ""take another piece of his"" instead of ""kill"", as it'd show the disparity between game and life. (Especially in light of the sentence before).

We were happy for a time, as I served my country with pride and distinction, but the world grew in its dangers. I chose to step up, volunteering to be the among the best soldiers in the country, and my wife supported my decision... at first. 

The training was intense, the knowledge I gained was invaluable, the skills were essential. But my wife and daughter glowed with pride, smiling each day I came home and filling my heart with ease. I had chosen the right path, I told myself, and I believed it. Graduation, a beret and smiles, glistening eyes and firm handshakes, as I was welcomed to a brotherhood that lasted for a lifetime and beyond.  And then it got hard.

Deployments to combat zones to put out grass fire wars that “never were,” shooting down enemies that no one knew existed. Child soldiers, raised by brutal regimes that churned out these pawns from villages of raped mothers, and I was fought my way to ending those regimes, over a mountain of bodies. My wife could never hear of this, I couldn’t look at my daughters friends the same.

Fissures opened in my marriage, in my family, but I had a commitment. I had seen what the world would throw at my family and I CHOSE... but did I choose right, I couldn’t afford to ask that as I signed away my family.  As I pushed my soul into defending them against the violence that was beyond our borders.

I found myself fighting in a jungle, when it happened. A team of us sent to eliminate a high value target, only to walk into an ambush. Machine gun fire ripped through the underbrush and slammed into my torso, like a train striking my chest, but I lived long enough to see the enemy driven off.

‘System calibrating,’ these are the words I am awoken by, as my vision clamors from darkness to surreal colorations. My eyes adjust and the world transitions to a more comfortable pallet, but I’m unable to move. ‘Calibration complete. Releasing motor control to user.’  And in that moment, my limbs shudder and move freely. I swing free of the table I lay on and look into a mirrored wall, only to see a faceless humanoid shell staring back.

Security got me to just in time to watch me squeeze his eyes out and crush his skull. In their shock I walked towards the door, their shouts to stop meant nothing to me... Until one of them shot me...

""Which of you pulled the trigger?""

They both froze... I forgot I looked like a walking robotic corpse...

""You better be damn sure the next shot kills me""

After walking out I began making my way to another place, the home to that black ops asshole that killed those civilians I tried saving... Ruthless asshole...

Apparently it's been ten years since I was frozen, but he's still here...

*knock*

""Come in""

He didn't seem to notice it was me... Maybe he's expecting someone...

""Agent...""

He turned in horror... But he seems to know what I want...

""I've seen your file, agent... I'm amazed you weren't dishonorably discharged on day one... You kill with no regard for any life other than your own, you've gotten your own squad killed, and that's not even mentioning the war crimes you've committed... But Ader isn't here to protect you... So once I kill you, it will all be released, with no one to stop those pencil pushing dickheads at DC from releasing our files... And I'm looking forward to that day...""

I hung his body by his feet and put his head on a desk... Maybe I'll get Ader's friend who's been turning a blind eye to this guy, and allowing the two of them to do the shit they've been doing...

Or a partner in crime behind me? Oddly, the killer's the statement seemed purposefully directed at me..."" Matthew said to himself, as an uneasy feeling starting to envelope him, skin tingling. Something seemed unnaturally different.

&amp;#x200B;

Now squinting his eyelids together even harder to better focus on the viewing, Matthew slowly rotated clockwise, stopping at his 6 o'clock to obtain a visual of who the killer was talking to. Although difficult to see in the darkness, there was enough ambient light from the street to see no one else was in the room, just broken furniture and books scattered across the floor.

&amp;#x200B;

""That's very impolite to remote view someone and not introduce yourself....."" the killer's said. His voice clearer, albeit calm.

&amp;#x200B;

Matthew quickly panned around back towards the killer who is now standing and facing him, barely a few feet away. He couldn't believe what was happening. Every previous viewing was always under tight control. Everything was predictable because the event already occurred. It was simply re-watching the event from another angle to pick out more details. Matthew was sweating, his hands ever tightening around the laboratory chair arms. Matthew had a job to do. To collect as much information as possible to solve a murder: about 6'2, athletic build, wearing a hoodie, hat, sunglasses, 5 o'clock shadow, torn right sleeve with a bloodied forearm revealing an eagle carrying a trident, and, and a tattoo of a soundwave right below it.

&amp;#x200B;

""Matthew...You're heart rate and EKG is rising,"" said Dr. Halsey worriedly. ""What's happening, what are you seeing?"" Even without seeing the event unfold, she could clearly tell something was wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

His body slightly shaking, eyes still tightly closed, Matthew responded, ""The killer. He..he...can see me! And, I think he's communicating to me telepathically! I'm going to....""

&amp;#x200B;

Before Matthew could say anything else, Dr. Halsey interjected in an alarmed voice, ""Detective Johnson! We must abort the remote viewing immediately before.....""

&amp;#x200B;

""You know Matthew, remote viewing goes both ways.” the killer stated, still in his calm demeanor. “I recall one remote viewer who unfortunately encountered an entity on the back side of the moon. Needless to say, it ended up costing the remote viewer their life. I won't kill you, but I certainly can't have you continue remote viewing me either....this is REALLY going to hurt.""",TheWhopper858

As you're describing what happened, the killer suddenly turns around and seems to look you straight in the eye. ""I know you're watching"".",Pokitore,"He looked over his shoulder. Suddenly, the face of a hardened killer melted away and became that of a child's.

&amp;#x200B;

""Why did you leave me, dad?"" the boy asked.

&amp;#x200B;

I did not remember having a child.

&amp;#x200B;

""Yeah, of course you wouldn't remember me. Mom was right. You never cared,"" he said.

&amp;#x200B;

What? I didn't say that out loud.

&amp;#x200B;

""Didn't say what out loud?"" he asked.

&amp;#x200B;

I was bewildered, but kept a cool face. I looked to the detective to assure him everything was normal, but he wasn't there. Instead, I saw the crime scene as it was on the day of the murder.

&amp;#x200B;

I was *in* my vision.

&amp;#x200B;

""It's about to get much worse,"" a familiar voice said.

&amp;#x200B;

Much worse?

&amp;#x200B;

""When did it start getting worse?"" I asked, readying my pen.

&amp;#x200B;

He stared at the ceiling as he thought about it.

&amp;#x200B;

""It was probably when he said he couldn't remember me after he had spent an entire decade raising me,"" he finally said.

&amp;#x200B;

I nodded, jotting it down. We were finally making progress.

&amp;#x200B;

He looked at me. ""By the way, did you finish that dig yet?""

&amp;#x200B;

I grinned. ""The boys and I skipped breakfast to finish it by noon. Wanna see the rocks we dug up?""

&amp;#x200B;

He raised an eyebrow. ""What rocks are you talking about? You're getting married.""

&amp;#x200B;

Of course I was! How could I forget?

&amp;#x200B;

I looked at my beautiful wife and removed her veil.

&amp;#x200B;

""I cheated on you, Phil,"" she blurted out.

&amp;#x200B;

The room went quiet.

&amp;#x200B;

As quiet as a club could get, anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

After we spent half an hour dancing, the drinks finally made their way through my system. I excused myself to go to the bathroom.

&amp;#x200B;

Next to the door, I saw a sign that said ""You're never leaving this place"".

&amp;#x200B;

""Ha!"" I laughed. ""That's a bold claim,"" I said before heading inside.",rooftop_enthusiast

Why did these things always seem to happen in the dark?  It certainly didn't make the use of his ability in these matters any less unsettling.  



It was as if he was standing in the transition between what would be the small apartment's living room and kitchen.  Drawers had been removed from the desk and their contents turned out upon the carpet.  The entertainment center doors were ajar.  Books laid strewn about, having been pulled from their stacks on the shelves.  Kitchen utensils laid on the floor with a pile of eclectic stuff that could only have come from the junk drawer that everyone seems to have.  The only undisturbed area in his view was the dining table, set for two.  The lingering smell of some sort of fried food hung in the stagnant air which wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't overlaid with the sharp metallic scent of the pool of blood beneath the young woman on the floor near the dining table.


His gift had only manifested several years ago.  He had become quite used to the variances of information he would receive but this was the first time he was only able to see a scene after the fact with absolutely no lead in as to the events that lead to it.  What dim light there was came from the good bulb of the two in the stove's range hood.  From where the body had fallen on the other side of the kitchen island, it was hard for him to count how many stab wounds there were.  He knelt down next to her, instinctively taking care not to step in the blood, even though he could not affect it.  There were defensive wounds up and down her arms; clearly she had put up one hell of a fight.  He shook his head sadly, glancing up when a movement from the bedroom doorway caught his eye.

A masculine figure in a dark hoodie took a few steps out and leaned against the wall.  The killer's right hand left a bloody print upon the paint as he stepped out into the main room.  In the low light, a long knife was visible in his other hand, the blade clearly stained with more than one color.  The figure looked around the room and then walked over to the woman, placing the knife on the table next to one of the plates.  As he leaned over, a bottle of Axe shower gel fell from the pocket of the hoodie.  He reached for it and then suddenly stopped.  The killer's eyes darted around and then looked directly towards the kitchen island.

""I know you're watching.""

Sirens sounded in the distance.  The hoodied man grabbed the shower gel and ran towards the window to access the fire escape.  Just before he crawled through to make his escape, he turned once more towards the kitchen.

""This isn't what it looks like.""

He donned his battered and dented armor, this very armor had saved him on multiple occasions; once during a battle against a Minotaur, the enchanted breastplate caught the edge of the beasts great axe. He prayed that it wouldn't fail him again.

The smell of sulfur attacked his senses, fires burned brightly as he stepped on to the battlefield. The dead lay everywhere, men he had knighted, friends and family were sprawled around him. Then he saw them; hulking creatures, their piercing red eyes cut through the darkness. *This is how it will end. Fitting as my life was bloodshed.* He gripped his curved longsword tightly as one of the creatures charged. He reflexes were slow and dulled with time, the claws tore through his armor like paper. *Light, let me rest.* He became aware that he was bleeding into the ground, the pain in his side was gone and he felt at peace. The creatures roared triumphantly as they looked past him, charging the castle. *Forgive me...in the twilight of my years, I've failed.* His eyes closed as the end washed over him.",Unaspiring_writer

Everyone says, ""But I can build you one better.""

And you say, ""Yeah!""

But of course, like the impatient Millennial Luddite you are; you decided to forgo all of that and just order one off Amazon with that sweet, sweet, credit card you've just been itching to gain some debt on instead.

Feels good man.

Go figure however that the thing quits working right after only six months. Now you're stuck trying to figure out who you know that you can take the thing to, so you can enjoy sitting through that classical four word speech you've heard from teachers, friends, significant others, and your parents alike.

""I told you so.""

Fun times I tell you.

But you know you're not a completely bad sport about the whole thing. You offer the usual things to placate the person responsible for fixing your favorite render hog. Alcohol of their choosing. Maybe you pay for something they need done in return. Fix something broken of theirs in return, because it's your specialty for once.

Or take it to some local shop and sign away an arm, a leg, and your first born for a repair.

No. You refuse to do any of those things. You've got the internet to help you diagnose this problem. If you want things done right, you do it yourself. Because dammit, that's what everyone else in your life does. So why not you?

After a month of beating your head against the wall studying how to fix it yourself you finally pry open the thing to find-

Ants?

Ants??

And, wait, what's even going on in there? You've got to tell someone about this. And-

A text message.

""Greetings Human.""

""New phone, who dis?""

""King of the Ant Tower."" Someone sent.

""Funny.""

""No human, I assure you. This is the Ant King.""

""Is this some sort of joke?""

Then the unthinkable. The computer seems to spool up on its own. Way faster than you've ever seen it run. Faster than any computer you've ever seen run for that matter. It's incredible. 4K is nothing. The frames per second. The RAM. The OS.

It's. It's beautiful.

Another text message.

""Very simple Human. We of the Ant Kingdom thought your lovely domicile to be the perfect place for shelter and nourishment. And we figured since we stayed the summer, why not stay the winter?""

There's no way that this is possible. At all.

""We would like to rent from you Human. Your computer as our home to inhabit. In return we grant you the world.""

The world? What did they mean by that? While you didn't want to exactly get too close to the ant colony dangling on the inside of the computer case, you had to marvel how they seemed to harness the setup you ordered.

It looked like... You didn't have a real way to comprehend it. Did they have a monorail? Did they discover world peace?? Was that ant that buzzed by your head on a jetpack?

""The world? How.""

""Human, we have complete control. Your primitive internet bores me. But with it we shall provide you with reward.""

""How so?""

""Have you ever heard of data mining or cryptocurrency?""

""Only on the news.""

""Give us sugar water and that stale cereal you left on the fridge three months ago. And we'll get down to business.""

Your phone beeps with a message. The ants want to negotiate rent.,RJwrites,"  Littles beads of water slap the concrete outside Sam’s window. The sound of the rain hitting his roof reminds him of the good old days. He lays awake in his bed. The clock reads 11:34pm

                      SAM
I haven’t gone to bed this early in a while.

  Sam turns and looks at his old Macintosh Desktop.

                      SAM
Ever since it took a crap, I’ve been having a lot more free time... maybe I should take a look or take it in to get repaired.

  Sam closes his eyes. The sound of the rain soothes him.

  Suddenly there’s a flash. Sam wakes up.

                      SAM
What the hell?

  Another small flash comes from under his desk. Sam slowly gets up and walks over to the electronic corpse. He can see lights flicker and flash. Sam gets a closer look inside through one of the air vents. To his surprise, an entire ant colony had moved into his Desktop!

                      SAM
Woah! This is insane.

  As Sam admires the beautiful architecture the ants have made with his old pc parts, the ants begin to notice a heavy warm wind blowing inside. 
  Sam gets up and runs to his bed. He unplugs his phone and runs back.
  Somehow, the ants are gone. They all dropped what they were doing and left.

                      SAM
Where’d they go?

                      Queen Ant
Hello Samuel Mesia.

                      SAM
Who said that?

  The voice sounded distorted. As if it was being said through a microphone. Sam looks around until something flashes in his eye and catches his attention.
  A Queen ant is on a small Led light. Her servants are carrying one of his monitor’s  speakers.

Your phone beeps with a message. The ants want to negotiate rent.,RJwrites,"I wrestled the lock with clumsy fingers numb from the cold, coffee and purse balanced precariously in my left hand, and tried to ignore the buzzing coming from my ass.  Dry heat hit me in the face and cold coffee ran over my fingers as I shouldered my way into the apartment. I let my burdens fall where they may, dried my hand on the leg of my jeans, and fished my phone from my back pocket. Three missed calls. One new text message. All from Gav, of course. ""What's going on Lizzy?! You haven't been on in days. Are you okay?!""

""I'm fine,"" I typed quickly. ""My computer's just screwed up. It won't even turn on. I'm going to look at it today."" 

His response was instant. ""I'm coming over.""

There was no point in arguing. He lived just two floors up, and he never listened anyway. I shrugged out of my jacket and pulled my stained apron over my head. Ten minutes later my oldest friend came crashing into the living room, man handling the stuck door like an old pro. ""What is going on?"" he demanded, striding past me to the bedroom where my computer was set up. ""The guild is going crazy, Liz. Nobody knows what the hell happened to you. And that douche bag, Faulx, is pushing for a vote to elect a new guildmaster. I think he wants the job for himself."" 

I rolled my eyes, shrugging off the drama I'd missed during my three day hiatus. ""Let him have it,"" I said oh-so-nonchalantly, my voice rising an octave in the failed attempt to feign disinterest. 

Gav knew me far too well to fall for that. He looked up from the tiny set of tools he was unwrapping to glare at me knowingly. ""Right...."" he said as he dusted off the ports and checked the fan vents. ""Did you spill anything on it?"" I shook my head no. ""Has it been overheating?"" 

""Don't think so. It just stopped working all of the sudden. I came home Friday, after the pest control service was here and it wouldn't turn on."" 

He signed dramatically and began unscrewing the front face plate. I flopped back on my bed, exhausted from waiting tables all weekend, and waited for him to work his nerdy magic. ""What the hell?"" I heard him whisper. 

""Come on, it can't be that bad,"" I said, laughing. 

Gav was fumbling around in his tools. He grabbed a little flashlight and pointed it into the box. ""Lizzy, you've got to see this."" 

I sat up with a groan, fully expecting some kind of childish prank, and leaned over his shoulder to peer into the belly of my computer. “Holy shit.” Inside the case, circling the hard drive, marching in and around the tiny avenues of the motherboard, was what can only be described as a vast and advanced ant civilization. I'd never seen anything like it. There was none of the frenzied scurrying of the anthills I'd loved to observe as a kid. These ants were different, measured and purposeful in their movements, as they worked together to rearrange the internal workings of my computer before our very eyes.


Gav and I jumped at the sudden buzzing from my phone on the desk. I grabbed it and opened the new message from an unknown number. “Hello Lizzy, I see you have discovered us. It's about time.” I dropped the phone as if it were on fire. 


“What?” Gav asked. I just pointed at the phone until he picked it up. “No way,” he breathed, his thumbs already typing out a response. “Who are you?” 


“We are the ants,” came the reply just as my monitor turned on. I jumped. Gav laughed, seemingly thrilled with the bizarre,  sci-fi turn our day had taken. On the screen was what appeared to be some kind of contract. Before I could exam it my phone buzzed again. “I am general Krirto. We were forced to flee our home three days ago. We set out, carrying our queen, in search of a safe haven from the toxic air. We were finally able to seal off this bunker, but only a few survived. Our queen is weak from the journey and exposure to the poison. But we have an offer for you. In return for allowing our people to settle here, we can offer you speed, memory, and graphics the likes of which you can only imagine. The details are all in the contract.” 


At this point I was feeling faint, though Gav seemed ecstatic as he read the contract aloud. “Lizzy, this is incredible!” he gushed. “Seriously, this is some next level shit. Look at these numbers!” 


After the shock wore off it became clear that this was an incredible opportunity. I signed the contract, agreeing to provide safe lodging, weekly food and water supplies, and, most interestingly, new colony habitats every month. And that is how our business began. Gav does the basic set up and brings it over, so when the little guys are ready to start a new colony it's all ready to go. They just move in with their new queen and get right to work, making their magic. 


You wouldn't believe what these rigs sell for. Of course we can't tell our customers that they're filled with ants, but we found a work around for that. Gav designed a removable hard drive that's filled with food and water. The customer installs a new one every six months, to “update” the system, then ships the old one back to us. The ants empty out the supplies as needed, and the new colony bunkers down in the empty drive for the ride back to my place, where Gav has their new habitat all set up. 


And that, kids, is how the internet works.

[IP] Flamenco,Syraphia,"There wasn't much for Kat to do, save for reminiscing of times long past, at the things she may never be able to do again. She was fairly certain she would regain her sight, but it was out of her control! It was even out of the control of the doctor she had gone to two days ago; what, would the doctor give her brand new eyes of metal and glass? She highly doubted it.

The current bit of nostalgia Kat was nursing was dance. She had enjoyed the practice of dancing ever since she could walk. She never enjoyed parties, but she always enjoyed dancing. Dancing now wasn't impossible, but there was certainly more effort; she had to worry about walls and things she could trip over, and her balance wasn't what it used to be; without her eyes she was much more tippy.

Kat was currently enjoying a daydream where she was dancing in the ballroom of the Baudilaire estate, back when she could dress in fancy red gowns, and had hair. She wasn't sure if the memory was quite accurate; what was she doing dressed up like that all alone, and did she even own a dress like that? But the thought was pleasing as she sat in the bedroom, listening to Genevieve hum while sewing.

Kat stood, and swayed to the melody, slowly so she wouldn't hit anything. She picked up her walking stick from where it had fallen, and walked over to Genevieve, still dancing.

""Hey!"" Kat said, waiting for Genevieve to stand as well.

""Good afternoon."" Genevieve didn't look up from her sewing, Kat could tell. ""You sure slept in.""

""Lot on my mind."" Kat swayed side to side.

""Shall I ask what's on your mind?"" Kat could hear Genevieve setting her sewing down.

""Can you stand?""

""That's what's on your mind?"" Genevieve stood.

Kat pressed herself into Genevieve, dropping her walking stick to hold her closer.

""What are you doing, Kat?""

""I'm going to talk, but very, very closely.""

Kat could feel Genevieve smile. ""Alright.""

""I want to go to the monastery.""

""Why?""

""To talk to a monk that lives there. He's also blind. I want to see if he has any advice, to make it easier... If... It's permanent.""

""It won't be.""

""Not, it won't be, but if it is-,""

""It won't be, Kat. It'll be fine.""

""So... Can I go?""

""To the monastery? How would you get there? There isn't one in town, so where even is it?""

""It's miles away. I'd have to go to the chapel in town and ask for a guide. I would be gone for maybe a day?"" Kat tried to hold Genevieve closer still. She wanted to be Genevieve.

""I see no problem with... Kat, stop.""

""Stop what?""

""Kat.""

""I have no idea what you're talking about.""

""You're simply childish. God willing, we'll be sixty and you'll still be fondling me like when we were fifteen.""

""I see no problem with that.""

The front door creaked open and Dill rushed in. ""Mommy, mommy!""

Kat was most certainly not paying attention to anything but Genevieve, and almost leaped out of her skin. ""Dill! You scared me half to death! Please-,""

But Genevieve was already pushing Kat away and moving over to Dill. ""Ignore your other mommy for now, what is it?""

""There's strangers in the back yard.""

""Alright. Stay here with your other mommy for now, I'll be right back."" Kat could hear Genevieve briskly walk to the bedroom, and pull her old sword off the wall.

""Wait, I should come with you!"" Kat tried to move to the door following Genevieve, stopping when she felt Dill's grip on her skirt.

""You should not, I'll be right back."" Kat heard the front door slam.

Kat stood a moment, then picked up her stick. ""So Dill, what happened?""

""I was playing with Clegg, and Marta, and Rolo, and... Um..."" Dill paused, trying to remember his other friend's name.

""Kilo?""

""Yes, him to. We were playing outside, playing knights, and I saw two men stomping about out back. They had swords...""

""Here, let's find a chair, oop, there's one. Push that up against a window, tell me what other mommy is doing."" Kat helped push the stool, and helped to lift Dill on top of it.

""They're just talking.""

""Anything else?""

""Nope.""

In a few minutes, the door creaked open again.

""What happened?"" Kat walked over to where she thought Genevieve was.

""They're just treasure hunters. They heard about some ruin or other not too far away, and wanted to camp for the night somewhere that they weren't likely to be eaten by spiders."" Genevieve brushed past Kat to put her sword away.

""Oh."" Kat tried to follow Genevieve. She didn't suspect them to be bandits, why would they let themselves be seen if they were thieves, but adventurers? Genevieve should have invited them in! They've probably walked halfway across the southern kingdoms by now, and deserve a little hospitality!

""I know what you're thinking, and they declined. If you would want to go and ask them, however, feel free to."" Genevieve sat back down with her sewing.

""I think I will.""

""Don't spend too much time out there.""

""Why?""

""Don't want you getting any ideas.""

""Alright...""

But Kat was already out the door, clattering along with her cane, Clegg weaving between her legs as she eventually made her way to the adventurers.

She talked to them for hours. She learned their names (Vivo and Serko), and how they met, and what they planned on doing when they finally found their big haul, the adventures they had already had. And Kat told all of her stories, up to when she explained what happened to her eyes, and finally got some praise for daring to hear what the thunder said.

As the day passed, she couldn't see the sky begin to darken as night eventually fell. She heard the two adventurers make their campfire, but didn't know what time it was until she felt Genevieve's hand on her shoulder. ""Are you going to come inside? Dinner's ready.""

Kat was startled a moment. ""Oh, of course. Vivo, Serko, do you want to dine with us?""

But they assured her that they were fine, and so Genevieve lead Kat back to the home, where they ate, before Kat put herself to bed, lying awake, dreaming of adventure, Genevieve sleeping softly beside her.",DocDophersonPHD

Since that first toddler stumbled into mud

Now they are bound to the water

Their gifts passed to every son and daughter

&amp;#x200B;

He drifts along in his boat

As he fishes, he makes a mental note

To brand this image on his mind

This beauty of such a unique kind

&amp;#x200B;

The trees curve like an embrace

They twist with adventure and grace

Their leaves smother the lake

He reaches and chooses one to take

&amp;#x200B;

When our fisherman gets home

He opens the door and sees he isn't alone

There, he finds his wife and son

Who comes at him with a tumbling run

&amp;#x200B;

""Look at this leaf!"" says the fisherman

His son looks at it with wonder, puts in the palm of his hand

And then he asks if they can keep it in a book

So any time they want, they can have a look

&amp;#x200B;

That leaf was passed through generations

Over centuries and across nations

Now I look at it with wonder, put it in the palm of my hand

And wonder, ""How can this exist in a treeless land?""

&amp;#x200B;

So now when I walk the polluted streets

And get some deep-fried fish to eat

I remember my grandpa, the fisherman

And try to fish whenever I can",ReadWriteAllNight

My dad was a serial killer. My mom was a psychopath. My grandparents on both sides a were mass murderers. I see everyone with struggles like depression and a rainbow to cheer them up and I see people with money  with a homeless person following them. Everyone has something that helps them. Other than me I have though about why for a while because I am homeless, a parent of a handicapped kid and I don’t have any help. 

I never knew why but then I was being mugged by a guy and a familiar.  I’m pretty sure this guy just wanted to mug people. But I don’t know what caused this to happen but a blue flowing beam of energy streamed from my chest in to the sky and disappeared in a flash of light then a musty figure appeared in front of me. It was really blurry but it seemed to move their hand and the mugger just disappeared in a cloud of dust. Tried to convince the misty figure to not do that to me. 

The figure said, “I would never hurt you master, I am your familiar.”

You have 5 tattoos left...,Techanda,"I returned to the tattoo parlour as soon as I could, there were so many questions in my mind, but I honestly had only one request for him.

The place was as familiar as it was alien, thick incense still filled the air, and artworks still filled the walls, but this time I noticed the figures and animals in his drawings moving and dancing. My exposure to his tattoos must had changed me somehow, there was no way I could have missed out these vivid details happening around the three walls.

And the man himself, he was on the stool, facing the door, facing me, as if expecting my return. For a tattoo artists, he was bare of his arts, he wore no sleeves nor long paths, and also kept himself bare footed. I had always thought it’s strange for a tattoo artists to be voided of tattoos, now I wondered.

Before I could speak, he gave a quick scan over my body, and smiled broadly upon noticing the absence of the tiger on my left arm.

""I hope he had served you well,"" he merely asked.

He had no idea, maybe he did. There were so many to say, that I did not know how to start.

“I… I want to have another one,” I said in the end, sounding like a kid asking for more treats.

“Yes, I can do that. Another tiger?”

I had five tattoos, after the usage of a tiger, I was terrified what would happen if the blue whale, pirate ship and shooting star came alive as well. But ever since the tiger saved my life, I could not stop thinking about my fifth tattoo.

“No,” I spoke firmly, prompting him to glance back at me with a grin. He knew what I wanted the moment I stepped in. I rolled up my left sleeve, and exposure the bare patch of skin to him.

“Another succubus.""",BlueSingingKettle

You have 5 tattoos left...,Techanda,"The first time it happened, I thought it was a glitch in the matrix type of deal. I was drunk at a party, and singing something, wishing I had a guitar. The next thing I remember is playing a guitar, and everyone singing along. Then I woke up the next morning, and found one of my tattoos had changed. The one on my rib cage. Before, it was a guitar with a background of musical notes and colors. Now, it’s just a tattoo of musical notes, no guitar.

I stare at my reflection in the mirror a lot these days, wondering if my memory is warped from all the experimenting with drugs in my teen years.

But yesterday, I know that was real. Hell, it made the news, everybody knew. But few knew how wild it truly was.

After a long day of shopping, I was walking to my car. I meant to leave before dark, but inside the mall it was hard to tell how late it got. This mall was in a slightly more dangerous part of town, but the deals were fantastic. Unfortunately, a woman alone with shopping bags in the dark parking lot must have been what these guys were waiting for. A young man approached me, carrying a baby seat that was covered with a blanket. He said he was having car troubles and needed help with the baby. Then I noticed a van parked and running nearby. After politely telling the man I couldn’t help him, I picked up my pace. He cut me off, asking again if I could just watch the baby for a minute or two while he fixes what’s “probably just a loose gas cap.”

Then someone grabbed my shoulder from behind. I saw a hand with a cloth reaching for my face. My forearm tingled, right where I had a tattoo of a tiger. In a flash, ribbons of orange and black were streaming out of my forearm, forming the shape of a large tiger standing in front of me. A bone chilling roar seemed to bring it to life. Suddenly, it was a real tiger, and it was protecting me. This beautiful, muscular creature tore the man’s arm off in one pounce. His hand fell to the ground, still clutching a chloroform soaked rag that was now stained with his blood. The fierce beast only snarled at the other man. He dropped his empty baby carrier and ran to the waiting van, which quickly sped off.

My forearm felt warm, and I looked at it in disbelief. The previous tiger tattoo had become a paw print with tiger stripes.

I had to talk to police, journalists, and news reporters about how a stray tiger saved me, and got a criminal’s DNA.

Staring into the mirror, I study my remaining three tattoos. Turning to see the one on my back, what catches my eye is the tattoo on my calf... It isn’t how I remember. But uh, this doesn’t make any sense. I must be remembering wrong.

I stumble backwards and fall onto the bed, where I clutch my leg to look closer. I had gotten a tattoo of my brothers's tombstone, with a skeleton rising up out of its grave in front of it.

No, I don’t look at my calf that often, I must be remembering it wrong. Nothing else would make any sense. 

The tattoo is simply of my brother’s tombstone, with an infinity symbol instead of his death date. That must be how it has always been.

I think the real idea is to tell a story inside a story. Like an advanced form of show not tell you are giving a meta narrative where the reader picks context clues from what the narrator is telling them to pick up on things that are not directly told.",ThreeDucksInAManSuit
[OT] Sunday Study - Unreliable Narrator,brooky12,"Plenty. You have the standard lying as a part of indoctrination. The Brave New World and 1984s play this straight, and I think it would be a decent taxing exercise to try to toe the line on various subtle indoctrinations that can and prob. will permeate our near future society.

You can also lie to protect someone else. Is the narrator involved with the other characters in the plot? What if they are a family member of a main character, say a son digging into his true family history?

There's also lying for fear of the truth. Cue trope for android trained think as if it was human.",pokerchen
[OT] Sunday Study - Unreliable Narrator,brooky12,"I love unreliable narrators. In my opinion even when people are trying to tell the truth they end up lying in subtle ways.

Anyone else have some quick ideas on what kinds of motivations can exist for an unreliable narrator?",Llamia

"[WP] Your grandmother left you a recipe book in her will. Upon making one of her recipes, you discover they do something magical",calebb22,"""What are all these random ingredients?""

Grandma's recipe book was something of a cryptic read, as none of the recipes seemed very straight forward; 2 buttons of Mycena? What the hell is Agric powder and Bollen Green...? And since when does a chocolate cake have so many strange things in it?

Luckily she had a hand-written glossary at the back...

No clarity was found in the glossary, as the descriptions were equally abstract;

Ivy Clove - Tier 2, Tray 2, B3

Spire Musk - Tier 2, Tray 4, G8

Curd of Bythe - Tier 4, Tray 1, A8

There were pages of these strange referenced items, but not where to find them!

""Mum, can you help me with nannas cook book, what are all these things?""

Mum came downstairs after having some alone time. She got a emotional when I showed her the book and asked to look through it later. My curiosity got the better of me though and she seemed comfortable to join me now. 

""Hmmm, this looks like her plant collection. She organized her workshop to collect all the seeds and materials from her 

garden. I guess we still have to sort through all that.""

I remember as a kid grandma never let us go in there. She said it was too dangerous for children and always kept the door locked. One time I peeped in the door when she was she was working, but I don't remember what was in there. A bunch of tools and containers? Nothing interesting to a 7 year old girl anyway. 

""Maybe we can go there tomorrow, go through some of her collection?"" Mum suggested. 

The two hour drive was familiar to me, every holidays we would make a trip to Nan and pops, I'd stare out the window to all the cows and sheep grazing in the fields. Wondering if anyone lived out in all the bushes up the mountains. Knowing that nanna wasn't going to be there made the drive much less exciting, but I have a growing curiosity in her workshed now, she did spend a lot of time in there and we never spoke much about it as a family. 

""I remember she was always fond of gardening"" Mum reminisces ""She would find and collect rare plants from all over the world, getting seeds and cuttings mailed to her. I think she kept seeds in the workshop? I didn't go in there too often either.""

It was a solidly built timber workshop at the bottom of the sprawling garden, with a quaint stone pathway to the heavy wooden door. Mum struggled with the keys and eventually creeked open the door. It smelt earthy and spicy, like grandmas workclothes. Inside the workshop were boxes and trays and glass containers meticulously arranged and ordered. 

I went up to the bench and noticed the arrangement matched the glossary. With a number of small containers, on trays arranged onto tiers. I looked at my hand drawn notes for the chocolate cake ingredients and found the corresponding containers. Mum seemed fascinated by a wall hanging which depicted a campfire under the moon, and I had to wake her from her daydream. ""Mum....mum.....MUM!"" she snapped back to reality. "" I've got the ingredients for the chocolate cake, let's get baking!""

Once in the kitchen I opened one of the containers labelled: Bollen Green. Inside the small jar were about 10 dried leaves. Wrinkled and dark green, they had a unique tropical smell. ""Wow, they smell amazing."" I held the jar under mums nose. 

""Oh wow, yum."" Mum agreed.  

Next were the Mycena buttons; a jar of 5 or so muchroom heads, small and dried. 

Finally, the agric powder. It was a light brown powder with a pungent chemical smell. 

""Honey, this doesn't smell very edible."" Mum sounded concern and putting this in the recipe. 

""Why else would nan put it in a recipe for cake then?"" I was adamant to follow the recipe properly. 

""Alright, but if the cake smells like that, I don't want any!"" I smiled at her response. 

We followed nannas recipe perfectly, adding all the standard cake ingredients and the jars from her workshop, I even got the gourmet dark chocolate to ensure it would be extra special. 

We pulled a nice moist cake out of the oven after about 45 minutes...and it smelt delicious! None of the argic powder on the nose, but a light sweetness from the Bollen Green. 

The cake cooled down, so I sliced and plated it up with a dollop of fresh cream. 

""Here you go mum."" I placed the cake infront of her. She looked so pleased at me. 

I sat down and we got started. 

It was absolutely delicious! After the first bite, mum and I looked at each other with that Oh-my-god-that's-so-good face we would sometimes do, The first slices went very quickly, so we had a another one each, I was so proud to be recreating nannas food, it felt very special. 

""I think I need a nap after all that!"" I laughed to mum as I lay down on the sofa. 

After a minute or so, I started to feel very odd, like my whole body was heavy and becoming loose. I felt my head sink into the cushion and my weight bearing into the sofa. Then I started to feel a bit nauseous as I felt this motion in my head, like my brain was sliding around. ""MUUUMMM!"" 

Mum stumbled in with a shocked look on her face and quickly fell onto the adjoining sofa. ""Oh Lara, I feel dreadful, are you ok?""

I wasn't. 

At this stage I couldn't see, and felt extremely cold, I tried to answer mum but was completely unable to control my voice, my movements...I though I was dying. 

Stuck in a cold abyss, frozen. It was terrifying that my mind was still switched on, but I was completely paralyzed. I couldn't guess how long I was there but it felt like eternity. A cold, empty abyss, alone. 

 That was until I saw a feint light. At first a shimmering distant star, it rapidly grew into a warm, glowing fire. This fire was tremendous and warmed my whole being with an intense, satisfying glow. I guess my eyes closed as I writhed around enough to regain sense of my body, and when I opened them, I was sat next to a fire, with mum, under a full moon. 

Mum was staring at the fire, and after seeing her there, I felt and urge to do the same. We stared into the fire which felt so full of life and warmth, it was beautiful and comforting. A rising feeling of another's presence became apparent, in the licking and rolling flames of the fire I saw nanna's face forming. Soon I could see her image smiling at me from the fire, with the same warmth radiating out towards me. It was the most incredible experience of my life, with mum and nanna, by the fire, under the full moon. 

""Are you okay honey?"" I woke up on the sofa with mum holding a wet towel to my head.

At this stage I felt terrific, as if I had just had the best sleep possible. 

""Yeah, I feel great, what was all that about?"" I asked. 

""Did you see me at the fire?"" She asked me.

""How did you know that?"" Curious how mom knew my dream. 

""I was there too, didn't you see me?"" She queried. 

I was amazed at our shared experience ""What was that place?""

""I should've have prepared you, I should've warned you."" She looked so distraught. 

""Warned me about what""

""I should've warned you that grandmas chocolate cake recipe is straight fire!""

"[WP] You're currently surrounded by vampires inside an abandoned building, and the only thing keeping them at bay is the sun shining through a window onto you. It's just past noon and you need to find a way out of this mess.",ckay1100,"No matter what, I cannot curse. Of all the archaic instructions Wendell had taught me, this was the one he made sure to drill into my head. His time weary voice still echoes in my head in his endless drone.

&amp;#x200B;

""Never curse Tabitha! I don't care how cornered you are, how tired, how dire; **never curse**.""

&amp;#x200B;

I check my revolver once again in futility. Practically trying to *will* a full cylinder. The single silver bullet stares back at me, glinting in the noonday sun. My eyes wander up, past the snapping, writhing heap of vampires crowded just outside of my illuminated rectangle, and out into the reaches of the great room. Darren's corpse remains sprawled out on the floor, his cross laying on his chest as the only barrier between his still warm blood and the pack of Vamps. Of course, laying scattered on the floor were the remainder of my bullets from my now torn ammo belt.

&amp;#x200B;

He had never had the stomach for this job. We all knew it; even he knew it. Bloodlines are a coveted thing though, and nowadays the Order needs all the warm bodies they can get. I don't imagine Darren's father will be terribly distraught over his son's ultimate demise.

&amp;#x200B;

""At least I'm the one who did him in."" It's the only thought keeping me sane as I search for an escape. ""No time to fret. Darren won't be coming back. So I need to get out!""

&amp;#x200B;

One ear splitting screech rises above the din created by the mindless monsters at my feet. Immediately the roar of starved evil quiets and I can hear the steady fall of a cane and shoes on the worn floors.

&amp;#x200B;

""Tabitha."" It's voice is as smooth as velvet, and chilling as a winter wind.

&amp;#x200B;

""You have dispatched several of my companions.""

&amp;#x200B;

Olm emerges from the deep shadows. Its lips pulled tight in a disapproving smile. My eyes do not stop searching the room as I reply. *It* wants my full attention.

&amp;#x200B;

""Well they kind of killed my buddy Darren over there, Olm. So how about we're even?""

&amp;#x200B;

A low thunderous noise emanates from the beast. Vampiric laughter is terrifying, and never let anyone tell you differently.

&amp;#x200B;

""You poisoned my farm, girl. There is no even.""

&amp;#x200B;

""Funny enough people miss their family members. Most don't take kindly to having loved ones sucked dry over the course of a couple years. Doesn't sit right with most decent folk.""

&amp;#x200B;

Olm's rolling laughter rattles in my chest again. I swear that if I ever get out of here I'm retiring. One interaction with Olm ought to have been enough to make me quit. The third is sure as hell going to be.

&amp;#x200B;

I wince involuntarily as Olm's ears perk at my thoughts.

&amp;#x200B;

""Feeling a little stressed?"" It's voice slides across the room and creeps into my very bones.

&amp;#x200B;

""Only in my thoughts Olm. Don't get too excited.""

&amp;#x200B;

Something akin to a pout is the only response, but I am done giving Olm my attention. I have a plan. Without hesitation I whip my revolver from its holster and take aim. Olm's fangs protrude in a freakish grin.

&amp;#x200B;

""Do not be foolish girl.""

&amp;#x200B;

The shot rings out. Piercing the near silence with an explosive burst of fire and metal. My bullet tears through the air and collides with Darren's cross; pulling a chunk of flesh from his sternum in the process.

&amp;#x200B;

All of the beasts are worked into a second frenzy by the gunshot, but I wait. Slowly, the scent of fresh blood fills their nostrils, no longer protected by a crucifix. As one mass they flock to Darren's corpse. As soon as I see the last creature turn in flight, I sprint towards the nearby dining room.

&amp;#x200B;

In a frenzy I clamber over the tipped dining table and lunge for the silver cart. As I turn back towards the entryway, my eyes fall on Olm standing in silent amusement. A knife whizzes past Its ear. Followed swiftly by another. I know I'm not going to hit It, but I don't need to. As my barrage of cutlery continues, I grab a silver platter in my left hand. I tuck it under my arm, wrapping my rosary around my knuckles in the meantime.

&amp;#x200B;

Wendell's voice drones on again in my head, ""Unorthodox Tabitha. Let's see if it works.""

&amp;#x200B;

With a guttural cry I sprint once again towards the light I had come from. Olm waits until the last second to lunge at me, but I do not strike blindly. My fist makes contact and It releases a howl of pain as the rosary does its work. I don't have time to revel in my temporary victory as I make a dash for the ray of sunshine, which is now moving ever farther from the door and closer to the dining room. As I reach the patch of saving warmth, some of the Vamps have begun to return their attention towards me. The howls of their master have brought them swarming back.

&amp;#x200B;

""Come on Tabi."" I mutter to myself. ""Time to work some magic.""

&amp;#x200B;

I scramble and manage to use some of available debris to construct a makeshift stand. Using my coat, I wipe as much grime as I can from the platter and place it on the stand. It works! A faint beam of sunlight now cuts across the floor and leads directly to the front door. Without so much as a pause for breath I begin army crawling across the dust covered planks towards my salvation.

&amp;#x200B;

The howling has stopped. I am halfway to the door and an alley of gnashing fangs and black, lifeless, eyes surround the pale passage I have fashioned.

&amp;#x200B;

""Get her now!""

&amp;#x200B;

It is the first time I have ever heard Olm scream. I can't say it was very pleasant. The wretched beasts begin to heave themselves at me, but I crawl on. Even as the stench of burning corpses fill my nostrils, and their claws tear at my clothing I struggle forwards toward freedom. At long last my hand reaches out and feels the cool sensation of a gilded doorknob, just as I hear the clatter of the falling plate illuminating my path.

&amp;#x200B;

My head whips back for a moment. My bulging eyes briefly catch sight of Olm grinning Its terrible grin as they twirl their cane that had just placed me in renewed danger.

&amp;#x200B;

With a desperate tug the front door is ripped open. Vamps claw at me and one manages to sink its teeth deep into my calf as I tumble down the marble steps and into the light of day. I kick the now scorched and wriggling Vampire from my leg, and quickly wrap my belt around my thigh as a tourniquet. As the vampires continue to howl and screech inside the ancient manor I lie still and try to catch my breath. Eventually I manage to pull myself to the car, and issue an alert.

&amp;#x200B;

I think it's unlikely that the Order will be able to respond before nightfall. Olm and Its pack will be long gone. But I survived, and from the safety of my car I release a torrent of all manner of profanity. After I have decompressed and purchased coffee from a terrified gas station teller; I feel renewed and refreshed. After medical leave who knows, maybe I'll take another crack at it.",GreyBritches
[WP] You're a fortune cookie writer. After watching the news it becomes clear to you that all the fortunes you've written have come true! You lay awake that night horrifed. Your last batch had been written in anger at the company for going back on their contract…,elismyer," 

I work as a fortune cookie writer. It’s not a job that I would ever have imagined myself taking in the past, but after months of job searching after flunking out of college, I was desperate. The job wasn’t that bad though. Sure, it was boring, repetitive work, but the pay was enough to cover my rent and the hours were decent too. I felt fairly content. Until the company decided to backstab me by going back on my contract with them. I was informed by my boss that I was being let go in one week. So, for my last batch of fortunes, I decided to deliberately fuck up my messages. Petty, I know, but I was furious and I didn’t give a damn about the consequences. I started off small.

“You will meet misfortune in the workplace.”

“You will lose a family member before the year is over.”

“You will never find true love.”

Then, as my creativity start flowing, the messages gradually started becoming more fantastical and ridiculous.

“You will give birth to a baby rabbit”

“Your home will torn apart by werewolves.”

“Your first born child will be devoured by a dragon.”

“Your family will be carried away by demons into Hell.”

And so on and so on. I went to bed that night, feeling somewhat better after my act of sabotage. In the morning, I awoke to a world in chaos. As I scrolled through the different television channels, every single one of them was reporting on the strange supernatural events that were happening throughout the state. Giants smashing into buildings, undead creatures roaming the streets, vampires and demons kidnapping human beings .... My blood ran cold. These were all things I had written in my fortunes. Had my messages actually come true?

And then, in horror, I remembered the last fortune that I had written: “You will die from a atomic bomb at the beginning of World War Three”. Suddenly, I heard a loud explosion in the distance. I turned to my window, only to see a massive mushroom cloud slowly rising above the horizon. Fuck.",Letteropener52

Nervously, I spoke. ""W..what does that mean?""

""Now, where do I begin?""

I swallowed my fear and pointed to the closet. It never closed fully, leaving a sliver of blackness I could just see Him through.

The bear sprang from my bed sheets and launched itself through the closet, and with a few grunts and cracking the closet door inched open a bit more.

"[WP] After receiving thousands of misaddressed Christmas letters each year, Satan has finally decided to deliver on these wishes.",gfunk777,"I wasn't really sure how to gauge the man standing before my door.

It's not that I wasn't used to people at my door, for some reason my street was like a magnet for marketers and proselytizers, but this guy didn't seem to be either of them. To be sure, he was polished enough to be a marketer, and while he didn’t wear the normal Mormon or Witness uniform, he could probably pass as one of the more put-together Iglesia ni Cristo people. But for some reason, I could intuitively tell he wasn’t either one of them. No, something told me he had something for me. 

I realized I hadn’t opened the door and he’d knocked twice now. *Goddammit, why am I like this.* I hastily opened the door, offering greetings and apologies for being on the other side of the house.

The right side of his mouth lifted into a wry smile. “No you weren’t. You’ve been standing there for 30 or so seconds, trying to figure out what I wanted from you.”

“Oh, uh, I guess I was.” He’d caught me so off guard, I didn’t even bother asking how he’d known.

He chuckled. “Sorry, I get like that. Not good at this interpersonal communication thing.”

“Hah, it’s fine.” He definitely had a charm to him, subconsciously convincing you to let down your guard, let him take control. Or maybe I just found him hot. That was definitely true, I had a thing for tall men with dark hair and a swimmer’s lithe-yet-muscular body. but the abstract charm was there too. Fuck, I’d started staring at him again.

Thankfully, he cut off the awkward silence. “But no, don’t worry. I’m not trying to take your money or convert you to anything. I’ve got something for your daughter, actually -- uh, Astrid?”

“Yeah, that’s her.” 

“Cute name. Cute kid. Spotless handwriting, I gotta say, especially for a middle schooler -- you must’ve taught her well.”

“Thanks? Wait, did she send you a letter?”

“Yeah. Well, sort of. See, she was trying to send something to Santa, but it must’ve autocorrected to Satan, and, well…”

I went from being taken by him to not being able to take him seriously in an instant. “And it went to you? So, you’re Satan?”

“Oh, not *that* Satan -- my name’s Nicholas Satan. Suh-TAHN. Common enough name where my parents came from, in a rural bit of the Philippines, but not so much anywhere else. See, I’ve got an agreement with the people at the North Pole. Well, not the actual North Pole, the one in Alaska. You know how all the letters to Santa go to a Fairbanks suburb called North Pole? God, I’m rambling, I’m so sorry.”

“No, no, it’s fine.” The charm was back.

“Anyway, I made an agreement with them a while back. My family’s one of the richest in the Philippines, and I love kids, so I told them, if any of them accidentally went to Satan, ship ‘em to me and I’d deal with it. And, well, Astrid’s did.”

“Oh, wow, that’s really nice of you! What did she ask for?”

“Well, it’s, uh… You know what, is she home? Could you go and get her? I kinda wanna show it to her and you at the same time.”

I went back to get her, and while it took a bit of coaxing to get her off of her laptop, I managed to pull her outside. God, she would spend all day in there, playing around with things like Photoshop and Inkscape. She was getting good, though, so I didn’t mind too much.

We came out to see him lugging a couple boxes out the back of his van, a dark black Ford. He laughed at my questioning face. “Figured a stranger inviting a little girl into his van would be kind of sketchy.”

In all, there were about three boxes, all moderately-sized. My daughter was ecstatic to find out the first had a full acrylic set, the second a brand-new computer and a chromebook for the road, and the third a watercolor set, dozens of brushes, and some money -- “only to be spent on art supplies, you understand?” She nodded vigorously when he gave her that directive, and he smiled.

I was smiling, too, the whole time. Started tearing up once he gave her the computer. We weren’t poor, but we were closer to it than rich, and I and my wife had barely been able to afford some clothes and a (much lower quality) acrylic set. Times are tough for two teachers in California, and Astrid was gracious enough, but knowing that she got all this, things that that saint of a girl deserved -- I couldn’t speak.

“Thank you so much, Satan!” She cried, and I laughed through the tears.

“But wait,” she said, sobering up just a little bit, “what about the other thing?”

Nicholas’s smile faded. “Don’t worry, kid. They’ve won't be bothering you anymore.”

She hugged him, and I wasn’t sure how to take it. After she went back inside to start organizing all her art supplies, I asked gently, firmly, “what did she mean, ‘the other thing?’”

His face steeled. “She’s been bullied at school. Racists from the eastern suburbs, calling her a chink, a mongrel. Especially after they found out she had two moms -- ugh, they had a field day. She never wanted to tell you, said you’d always called her her strong girl and didn’t want to give you a different idea.”

The tears came back up again, for a different reason. Tears of anger. “How did you deal with them?”

“Kids are fine, don’t worry. Probably spooked, but not hurt. Given a hard lesson on tolerance and acceptance. Their parents, the ones who taught them these things… They were dealt with too. Bit different, especially after I learned they’d organized something of an impromptu San Diego KKK chapter.”

I nodded. I knew I should’ve cared to know exactly what happened, to know if he’d really hurt them, to know who he really *was*, but I didn’t. My daughter was happy now, and she’d be happy at school come next month. As long as that was true, I was happy.

----

The truth of what happened to them didn’t surface for a couple weeks, till the local news reported on six adults from out in Lakeside going missing overnight. Gone without a trace, save a couple bits of unidentified sludge on the furniture. What made it newsworthy, though, was their kids’ stories.

They all said the same insane thing. “Our parents went to hell!” “Demons took them out of their beds!” “Satan himself took them!”

That last one stuck with me. The boy reporting it, a tall, pasty, freckled kid named Enoch, said a dark figure had walked out of a dripping black hole in the wall, picked his parents up by their arms, and pulled them back through the hole, just as it had come. “I couldn’t make out much of it,” he said, eyes bulging, “but I know, man. That was Satan himself.”

I believed him. Apparently, Nicholas wasn’t all he’d said he was. No, he was more.

But hey, at least my daughter was happy.",fathomless_tundra

"[WP] After receiving thousands of misaddressed Christmas letters each year, Satan has finally decided to deliver on these wishes.",gfunk777,"""and a Pony, and a Barbie doll house, and a...""

Since Christmas began, every year I get these damned letters from hopeful boys and girls. They must be dumb if they confuse the North Pole with **HELL.** Yea yea, I get it. Saint Nick wears red and I'm red so we MUST be the same person. These letters always arrive around the birthday of my dear old nephew, and it's absolutely absurd. I'm the King of Hell and I'm not going to let these letters come in between me and torturing the souls of the damned.

""I think it's quite funny actually"" says Asura, the demon in charge of filtering requests of vengeance, revenge, and curses.  ""Some of these are so funny to read. Like this one is asking for a baby brother"" she said. ""Should I give your cousin Cupid a call"" she laughs. The voice angelic and charming, almost let's a anyone see past her face distorted by centuries of torture and fire. Almost.

""I almost pity them. Sending their wishes and desires to a stranger hoping for an answer."" Yet the truth was, I didn't pity them. Always since my arrival I've been seen as the Icon of *Evil* and *Sin*. The only time anyone ever speaks to me differently is in these letters, even if they're not meant for me. I sometimes even look forward to this time of year. 

""I'll have Moloch take these to the furnace. I can't wait to feel the disappointment of these children on Pine Tree day"" Asura said to me. 

""It's called Christmas, after my nephew. You'll do well to remember that"" I scorn at her. Maybe I shouldn't have said that. Rumors are already spreading of me getting too old and weak to rule the Kingdom of Hell, this might push some to believe them.

""Since when do you care so much about your family. They cast you out to a pit of fire and despair if you don't remember."" She had a point. I hated my Father for years for casting me out. All for a petty sack of meat he loved more than me. But at the same time...

""I never intended to stay here for eternity you know."" I retort. My heart stopped. Well, if I had one it would have. Even in Hell I felt my palms go cold. I can't believe I said that. 

""I only stayed here because I had no where else to go. I had nothing else to do. But what if there is something else."" I said. Asura has been with me since the start. There's no other being in the universe I would confide in more than her. But this might have been too much, even for her to still be loyal to me. Maybe I should tell her I...

""I know Lucy."" My chest sank. What did she know? Is she going to try something? 

""I know anyone can only handle so much chaos. Maybe you do need a change in scenery."" I couldn't believe what I was hearing. She agreed with me?

""What makes you say that?"" I sneered at her ""Do you think I'm weak."" I felt my body tense, ready to defend myself if she decided to try to take my Throne from me.

""No"" she said ""I'm just so tired of the same thing over and over again. Maybe some time doing something else will clear our heads and let us do our job. Hell needs you in order to not fall into complete chaos, but not with a clouded judgement. Let's clear your head for a while."" I never thought someone could ever look at me in anything but disgust if I went about with it. Yet she made me feel so confident in the decision.

""Asura, have Orias and Velefar meet me in the great hall with their legions in an hour.""

"[WP] After receiving thousands of misaddressed Christmas letters each year, Satan has finally decided to deliver on these wishes.",gfunk777,"I'm not quite certain when I decided to take matters into my own hands. It may have been some 2000 years after the Crucifixion, give or take a decade or two. In all honesty, I spent too many centuries creating new tortures for a wide range of sinners; you tend to lose track of time when you're being as creative as my subordinates and me.  


Whatever. The timing isn't important to the story. What is important is that I came to the surface, completely unprepared. I had dressed in typical fair - red shirt, slicked back hair (covering my horns, of course!), and black pants. I was dressed for the occasion.  


I was NOT dressed for the cold. Dante himself was wrong in that regard- the coldest circle of hell is more or less directly in the middle. The deepest circle is actually quite warm, more in line with Milton. It's amazing how the human authors get their details mixed together.  


I digress. As I mentioned, I was NOT dressed for the cold; the hellhounds dragging my chariot into the real world thundered out into gusting zephyrs, throwing white flakes of snow around.  


""Him-Damnit,"" I muttered. It would be best if I could handle this on my own, without invoking my old boss. Knowing him, this was the set-up for a joke - ""Let's see how long Lucifer stands the cold after being in his own oven for MILLENNIA! We'll have a Satancicle tomorrow, Jesus!""  


I gasped, pulling the list out of my pocket. ""Let's see...first place to hit is...here. One Ally, aged 8, requesting a replacement brother. Let me see..."" I began rummaging through my carefully packed bag, eventually tossing a human doll over the side. I urged the hellhounds on, hearing the familiar disappearing scream-and-splat as we rocketed across the globe.  


""We have one Brendan, requesting money for his mommy,"" I said, before promptly tossing a bag of thirty silver denarii overboard. I heard the familiar tinkle of silver as the bag split upon impact.  


""Four more houses and we can wrap this up! Hurry, you fiends! The faster we do this, the faster we return to the furnaces!"" I crowed, cracking my whip above the hellhounds' heads. They roared, speeding faster and faster around the globe as I tossed bag after bag over the side.  


""We have ONE last place to get! This one's for...Nikolai, and he's gonna be in the coldest part! Let's go!"" I shouted. The hounds sped forward, one last time.  


This house, though, was different. Instead of the usual brightly colored fairies sporadically glowing, it had twin sets of red lights flashing. There was a straight approach, leading to the front door...and no way to toss my gift over my shoulder and speed back into the fires of hell.  


""Him-Damnit,"" I swore. ""Alright, boys, we're going in! I'll sneak this in and make it quick!"" The hounds began to slow their pace, lining us up in between the red lines. ""Steady...steady.... LANDING!"" I cried. The sled bumped up against the powdery white flakes, the hounds slipped, and we rolled. My bellows were silenced by the hounds barking and yelping.  


A light went on in the house as I dragged myself up to the sled. After inspecting the damage, I swore loudly.  


""Now, now, Lucifer,"" a warm, kindly baritone enunciated. ""There's no need for that language. Come in, come in, and warm up. Bring your dogs! Rudolph and Comet could use the company.""  


I looked up, into an elderly man's face. ""You... you know me?""

""Why, yes,"" he chortled. ""I know every one. Come in, come in! Quickly now, as I believe you have one last delivery to make.""  


""Well, yeah,"" I started. ""Wait...are...are you Nikolai?""  


""Ho ho, yes, I was Nikolai. I go by another name now, as do you. Please,"" he said, gesturing one last time into the warmth. ""Please call me Santa. I do need to thank you for your help tonight, Satan.""

For a moment, he panicked, thinking it was another fallout drill but the lights weren’t red and the alarm sounded suspiciously like...


The windows error sound? Hark stared in disbelief as the screens in front of him filled with a single error. He slammed the snooze button for the alarm and squinted at the screen.


Error 9Ad3: Simulation crash


He frowned. That was new. Never in all his thirty years in working at JUSA had the system crashed. In fact, he couldn’t remember if the Simulated Solar system had ever crashed at all since it went online seventy years ago. There were numerous fails safes, and software engineers worked around the clock to fix bugs.


Hark was hours deep in the crash reports when Len walked into the room.


“What asshole thought it was funny to use the windows error sound for an alarm?” He demanded. “We heard it halfway across the compound.”


Hark snorted. “You’re picking that fight with dead people, my friend. But,” he said, “look at what I found.”


The man looked at the main screen and whistled.


“Yikes.”


“Something tripped the sensors. Maybe the seals are broken?” 


“I doubt it.” Len frowned. “The mech team is busy with the latest launch site though.” 


“I know. Let’s just take a peak to see if our baby’s okay,”    he replied.


Both of them suited up and went through the numerous sealed rooms leading to the SS.


“That was fun,” Hark said as they made it passed the final gate. 


“Holy shit,” Len replied.

“What?” 


With trembling fingers, he pointed to a marvelous anomaly. 


The Simulated Solar System took up most of the room, with the asteroids of the outer ring floating close enough for Hank to touch. He followed the line of his friend’s finger to the silver object on his left side. 


Holy shit.



Nowhere in the project was there anything related to this. He reached out and closed his hands around it. It looked like a metal satellite, obviously fashioned by intelligent beings. The design was obviously primitive compared to the spacecrafts of JUSA. He turned it over in his hand to reveal words so small it was barely legible. It was surprisingly written in the common script.


Both men looked at each other.

David Banksy was still wiping away guacamole from his mustache (remnants of the burrito he had brought into the lab for lunch) when he noticed that the systems simulation had come to a halt. He put the burrito away and rolled closer to the 9 computer monitors, all layered on each other in a grid, his bespectacled eyes bounced from one monitor to the other, reading the errors trailing at the bottom of the screen and rolling to the top, red in lettering. 

David burped and nearly gagged, but he held it down. 

""What the hell is it this time?"" 

He grabbed hold of a computer mouse and darted the cursor across several of the screens, looking, and wondering what had brought the simulation to a screeching halt. 

**SEGFAULT SEGFAULT SEGFAULT**

""Jesus,"" David said, ""alright, fine, fine fine fine, let's run it back, yeah?"" he muttered to himself in the lab. There weren't any others around him. It was New Years Eve, and they had all taken the day off. 

*Not like anything is going to happen to them if we're out for a day,* Ricky had told David, giving him a hot slap on the back, *Come on man, come out and get a drink or two, it'll be fine.* 

David didn't appreciate the way the other lab workers treated the simulation. They looked at the simulation as if it were just simply a tub of Sea Monkeys, just a child's plaything, just a little experiment that would get tossed out at the end of the year. 

But not David, he saw the importance of the simulation, or maybe he didn't? Even he himself would admit that at times he felt like he had been developing a bit of a god complex when looking in on the simulation, zooming in and examining how far their technology had come along. 

It was still nowhere near where they were at, and that was done on purpose. The last thing that David and the other scientists wanted was for these little guys to develop their own simulation program. No, by keeping their technology limited to just before that by imposing ""laws of physics"", there shouldn't be any instances of them figuring anything out. 

The experiment would be kept clean. 

David rolled back the timeline of events, looking and wondering what had caused the segmentation fault, eventually narrowing it down to a satellite that had exited the borders of the simulation. 

""You little shits,"" David whispered under his breath, ""when did you guys launch that?"" 

He traced the trajectory of the satellite and saw that it had been roaming through space for two hundred years, before it eventually collided with the border of space, entering an ""out-of-bounds"" area in the simulation, triggering the segmentation fault. 

David huffed, then rolled over to another set of computers. There he changed some start-up parameters, increased the dimensions of space by a few fold, then he found a point in time to restart the simulation, to get it back up and going. 

David rolled back over to the 9 computer monitors and typed in a reboot command, and after a few whirls and grinds, the simulation was back up and running, set 200 years back in the past, right before the satellite had been launched. 

""There, you assholes,"" David whispered. He waited and watched for them to launch the satellite yet again, this time it would take millions of years before it would hit the edge of space. David had made sure of it with his parameter change. 

But the satellite launch never came about. 

""What the hell is going on?"" David muttered to himself. The simulation should've ran itself in the same path like it had done before, but now there were different results. The people on this little planet weren't launching their satellite like they had done before. 

David pinpointed the original coordinates of the satellite launch and zoomed into the launch facility, wondering what they were doing, what were they changing? He saw the satellite still there, but he saw that they were working on it, tinkering with it further. 

""Why are y'all messing with it?"" David muttered. 

He fast forwarded another ten years, still targeting the satellite as his point of reference, keeping it tagged until its coordinates changed, and then it finally launched, but this time it was travelling multiple times faster than it had before. 

""You buggers!"" David yelled, watching as the satellite quickly cut down space and reached the border yet again. ""How?"" 

He watched in awe as the computer monitors filled with red error messages and SEGFAULTS all over again, and yet again, the simulation came to a screeching halt. 

David had to reboot them all over again, but this time, he noticed something different. 

There were still lingering error messages, still something wrong with the simulation. 

""What is going on?"" 

It seemed that some of the data from the previous failures had been kept and it had overlain the new simulation, old code from the previous runs lingered and mixed with rebooted original code. No matter how many times David rebooted the simulation, the corrupted code loitered, causing cascading errors, catalyzing a chain reaction of red errors. Filling up the monitors, the errors mounted. 

The corrupted code started affecting the citizens’ base properties, their aggressor properties seemed to have increased by tenfold, no, twentyfold, *what is this that is happening*? 

Eager to save the simulation, David rolled the timeline back even further and rebooted it back in the Stone Age, but now he was seeing different paths unfold. The Dark Ages? The Crusades? It was the first that David had seen of these horrible times. He watched in awe as they raped and pillaged each other over and over. 

""They're set back, what happened to them? Why are they set back so far? What are they doing to each other?"" 

He rolled to another computer screen, and monitored the Seed data, the code that had been used to create each and every individual human. It had somehow become corrupted. 

""From the reboots?"" David asked himself. 

He rolled back over to the monitors, and saw them now in what they called the ""Modern"" age. They had increased their use of fossil fuels by a thousand fold, ""Why are you all still using that? What is going on?"" They were still going to war, meaningless war, launching missiles at each other, poisoning each others food supplies, what are they doing? 

David watched in stunned silence, the clock there in the laboratory slowly reaching midnight, bringing on a new year. 

""It's all ruined,"" he muttered to himself. ""We'll need to start from scratch."" 

He rolled over to a single monitor that had been sitting in the corner of the lab. He entered a handful of commands and slammed the ENTER key. 

The 9 monitors went blank. He had cleaned the slate. 

Agitated beyond belief, David scheduled several commands that would be issued in a week, recreating the simulation from scratch. He didn't want to look at it until he had a week to cool off and figure out what had happened. 

Until then, they could remain in the darkness for seven days.

It wasn’t the end of the world, but someone took that and interpreted it as all systems would fail, full stop. After that the sensationalism only compounded. 

There are encryption algorithms which will spit out plaintext dumps of their cryptographic hashes if entries exceeded certain size limits.  

One famous one was a windows XP bug which would log in a computer if the password box had too many characters in it, since there was a limit on the largest computable password but no limit on the number of characters you could enter. 

SQL injection relies on characters that correlate to certain commands in SQL allowing you to print malicious code into the server command terminal if you don’t tell the server to reject these characters at vulnerable inputs (things like search bars).

An upcoming issue is that some system architectures cannot represent dates beyond y2038 as a 32-bit signed integer, leading to wrap-around (where the system defaults back to 0). The Linux kernel has the same issue with y29B and windows runs into this problem at y28k, but as systems advance we’ll probably be able to kick this can down the road indefinitely. ",torchieninja

""No, that's impossible,"" Johnson murmured to himself, his gaze flicking over the different screens as his fingers flew over the keypad. 

He ran the numbers again. 

His brow furrowed. It didn't add up. 

He'd sped up the simulation by a factor of five, but there was no way it would've progressed rapidly enough to allow for technology robust enough to travel that quickly. He'd simply gone out for lunch. He blinked several times. 

67 minutes. He'd been gone for a mere 67 minutes. 

He dug back down into the logs, scrolling through the last five minutes. The satellite had only been created in the last three minutes or so. Sent out exactly two minutes and fifty four seconds ago. He ran the calculations in his head. They'd only sent out Voyager 1 in 1977, and it had left their own solar system in 2013. Almost thirty years. But this universe, this solar system, was only a couple hundred of years old. Civilization had only started a mere 142 minutes ago. That's why he'd thought it would be okay to leave. Because at that stage, the most intelligent species were akin to apes, just learning how to use tools. 

So what changed? 

Johnson leaned back in his chair, the skin on his arms prickling with goosebumps. This civilization had progressed at almost a hundred times that of humanity in terms of technology. And if it did then, what did that mean for their real universe, infinitely vast with infinite solar systems? 

Johnson shook his head, chuckling. This was no time to worry about that. He shut his eyes, massaging his temples. Staring at the code too long had messed with his sanity. Aliens. It wasn't something he had worried about for the last 46 years of his life, and he wasn't about to start now. 

He glanced back at the screen. 

Then froze. 

How could he have missed it earlier? 

&amp;nbsp;

*Time: 13:35:33* 

*Planet: 2A463R* 

*Event: Satellite named Crown originating from city of Klorn, Ascad has left the planet moving at 60,000 miles per second.* 

&amp;nbsp; 

Another planet. With another satellite, moving at a third of light speed. Johnson gulped, scrolling down. The time of the crash was 14:42:24. But besides than the other satellite leaving later from planet 84ABR, there were no other relevant logs related to outer space travel. He ran the numbers, calculating the distance from 2A463R to the edge of the solar system, his foot tapping furiously on the tile floor. 

He stopped, his head jerking up. The dark reflection of himself--his disheveled hair and shadow of a beard--on the turned off monitor loomed back back him, showing him his own stricken expression. 

The first satellite was traveling fast enough to leave the solar system before the crash. 

So where had it gone?

It had been a green at one point in time, but not since 2007. I hadn’t been able to afford an upgrade since grad school.

The computer beeped at me, unassuming in nature but crushing in reality. It had literally just crashed.

“What’s wrong?” Melanie, my lead research assistant (RA) came running in. The door hit the edge of the couch, hard, there hadn’t been enough room to fit it anywhere else among the shelves, computers, and desk in my office. She sat closest out of my research assistants and had probably heard me.

“Professor?” Another head popped up behind her, Ji-Hoon. He was the doctoral candidate I was advising, but also a pain in my ass. This semester I had started off with a bunch of undergraduate research assistants interested in working in my Solar System Evolution Simulation (SSES) research, only to have most of them quit the second month of working when he revealed he had a girlfriend. Nice guy, but denser than a supermassive blackhole. “Did something break?” Maybe he wasn’t that dense in all matters.

“My- my computer,” I pointed at the sixth computer in my office, set up in the far corner. I tended to neglect it a little since it was my smoothest running SSES, going strong for six months twenty-seven days straight with no error, and it had punished me.

“I’ll look into it.” Melanie, my star student, said with confidence. She had been with me the longest and was my best RA when it came to debugging crashes. She could usually figure it out a month or so.

“Professor,” Ji-Hoon came in and put a knowing hand on my shoulder, “Want some of my whiskey?” I nodded numbly. As dense as Ji-Hoon was, he knew when to be generous. He disappeared for probably only a few seconds. I heard the sound of a drawer opening and closing from outside, where the RA desks were, “Here you go.” A half full bottle of Bulleit Bourbon appeared in front of my exhausted eyes.

“Make me an old fashioned, would you?” Melanie asked from the corner, that sounded unpromising.

“Is it that bad?” She made a nondescript noise at Ji-Hoon’s question, also not a good sign. She was cryptic when she didn’t want to upset me, which upset me.

“I’m an adult! Tell me!” I whined, quite unlike the thirty-four-year-old I was. A generous glass of whiskey showed up in front of me. I was too down to ask if it was clean before taking my first gulp.

\--

“Analysis report for crash 128, the first round of analysis revealed . . .” The team, four grad students, two undergrads, and myself, were sitting in a conference room in the mechanical engineering building to discuss the debugging of last month’s crash. We would use the physics building conference room, if it didn’t constantly smell like mildew and sadness. The mechanical building had just been redone last year, and no one else had Sunday night meetings on campus, there was no harm in using another departments perks. They actually owed me, my research could one day help them figure out what to build for long-range space travel.

I was a little tired, the last few weeks had been tough trying to figure out what had happened to the machine to crash. Later, I found out another research experiment in the room below me had also experienced a crash around the same time. Maybe it had all just been a power surge. Maybe some higher power was telling me to give up on this whole thing.

SSES. My life’s work. I had been working on this program and the subsequent upgrades to the system since I was in undergrad, and so far I had been doing okay. There had been some break thrus, nothing I would call science breaking, but steps towards really understanding how far we would go as a planetary system. The last two years however, I had brought very little new information to light. The system kept crashing whenever I went beyond four months of running the program, approximately 10,987,998,052 years into the future.

I resisted the urge to put my forehead to the table and fall asleep in front of my team. My pity party last month had been pathetic and longer than socially acceptable, I had slept on my couch four nights in a row, too plastered at the end of the night after drinking with Ji-Hoon to drive home from the nearby bar.

“Follow up on the outer edges of the system as seen in Figure 2-C in the packet, has shown that a 6 ton object, around the size of a military grade satellite was trying to exit the planetary system within 0.0001 seconds of the crash.” I lifted my eyes to the smart screen Melanie was reading off of.

“What do you mean? There’s no way there’d be a satellite 15 trillion years into the future.” I asked. Her analysis had to be wrong. She couldn’t be blamed, she had just finished her doctorate two years ago, that eagerness to assume answers had plagued me my first few years too.

“I understood that and ran additional tests. It doesn’t make sense either. It says the satellite needed to have been launched from Earth two months ago from last Saturday to make it to the edge of the universe in 15 trillion years.” My eyes widened, SSES had a major bug and I had been running it for over a decade. I put my head in my hands, feeling more hopeless than the day SSES had crashed.

“Uh, Professor, there’s something else.” Ji-Hoon spoke up from next to me.

I looked over at him, numb. Nothing he could say could startle me more.

“The satellite that crashed the system matches the specs of a satellite that Russia launched two months ago to go explore Neptune. Everything from the mass, dimensions, to the material.” I furrowed my brows. “The system was running right, we were inputting everything that was going into space just as protocol, and it assumed all calculations from fifty-percent error to ideal.” Ji-Hoon handed me a picture.

It was a grainy picture of a satellite, in space. There was nothing around it, not even stars in the distance. The satellite was bright on one side, as if the stars were only to the direct right of it, not above or below. 

“Why is the satellite cut off?” I asked, bad quality photos were normal when printing from the SSES, but not corrupted photos. It looked like half of the satellite was just cut off, surrounded by pitch black.

“We don’t know. My assumption is that half of the body managed to leave the system before the SSES crashed.” Melanie said.

“But there are contingency programs for that, it’ll just lead to the next system that our program knows is adjacent.” Another bug, how lovely.

“The crash didn’t originate from that point, Professor.” Melanie pulled up another slide. “Almost right after the satellite started to exit, the Sun collapsed.”

It was another picture from the simulation. A time marker at the bottom left of the picture read **(0.000001 seconds)**. This was the last possible timeframe the SSES had output before failure, and it was a picture of the sun in white and black.

Except, the sun usually was all white with no other features. The picture quality of the program meant that you could usually tell it was the Sun from the lack of any other features on its surface, and the location stamp **(0,0,0)**.

The sun in this shot had black in its center, an amorphous black spot that had grown to over two-thirds the size of the Sun.

“We think that the force of something exiting our planetary system may potentially create a black hole.” Ji-Hoon said, immediately following up with the calculations he had run.

I didn’t care. *This* was my big break.",ejpxtd

I start scrolling through my social media, Instagram, Reddit, Twitter. The bus is meant to be here at 1:10AM and it's only half past midnight.

I catch something in the corner of my eye, in my peripheral vision. Two men in the front of a car, driving slowly past. Both are staring at me, in black suits. 'Shit, do they know?' I think to myself. 'No way, only my friends know. Anyone would stare at a 17 year old standing in the rain in the dead of night.'

They drive closer, slowly and then the driver rolls their window down. 'Hey kid, want a lift?' He says in a stiff but nice tone of voice. 'Nah thanks, I'm fine.' I reply quickly. 'I think you should.' His tone quickly changes to threatening.

Either they don't know who I am and just want to kidnap a random kid, or, most likely, they want to use me.

I start sprinting down the road and hear the driver shout something. I look behind me and see the two of them chasing me. 'What do I do? What do I do?!' I shout at myself in my head.

I dart into the road and start running across. I look behind and see the two men, gaining. I get to the end and-- I trip on the curb and fall flat on my face.

They start walking me to the car. The back to be precise. The boot opens and it is empty except one thing. Tape.

Quickly, the hand over my mouth is removed and I start shouting again, 'Help! H--' But tape seals it shut. 'Get in the trunk.' One commands me. I don't comply and murmur with the tape over my mouth. 'Do it now. Or I will have to do something... not pleasent.'

"[WP] You are a slave. One day, an opportunity to improve your life occurs.",Chikumori,"“Was I a good man?”

I blinked at the question. There were many definitions of “good”. One may surmise that any that possessed slaves would not be considered good. Even the most benevolent of masters still owned another human being. They may use sweeter words of warmth but they still hold the bitter iron cold chain holding dominion over another. 

“You....were as far as I know,” I replied softly. No chain hung from a collar around my neck. I was not bound by metal or by rope, but his mark was still upon me. A torc is just a fanciful collar without a lock after all. 

Yet I did not lie. My mother, may she Rest In Peace until we meet again, raised me to be honest and true despite the circumstances. My words certainly earned the displeasure of others, I was almost put to death by one ill named master. If my current one had not bought me then I would have died. 

My master laughed, a weak one that faded into coughs. He had been a strong man in body and mind but his body had failed him in the end. He lay upon his bed, skin pale and waxy, his breathing labored. Yet his eyes still shone with intelligence, missing little even now. 

“Ah, still honest to a fault. I’ve always liked that about you.”

I bowed my head slightly. “For that this one is grateful, as is my neck.”

Another weak chuckle. “That would have been a terrible waste. Fools are plenty. The intelligent are a rich resource, even those with foolish tongues.”

A smile rose on my lips reluctantly. I found myself genuinely depressed at his passing. He had been a good man. Fair, stern, generous when appropriate, harsh when needed. Like a father I imagined I could have had. 

A wasted hand beckoned me closer and I finally sat down beside him. “Listen to me,” he whispered. “Time is short for me and I must make arrangements.”

An eyebrow rose on my face. “I thought your will and estate were organized?”

He nodded. “For the most part. One final task.”  His eyes closed and he coughed again. “I spoke with the rest of the slaves and the staff. Those that served me well were rewarded. Those that did not were not.”

It was true. He had forgiven the debts of some of the indentured, paid for others. The more troublesome slaves were sold to others. The loyal and the hard workers were given latitude. 

His eyes opened and his clear blues pierced my brown hued. “I offer you a choice and you must make it before you leave.” He waited. 

“I...understand,” I replied with hesitation. 

“First: I offer you your freedom. A portion of the estate is yours to do as you wish. You have been my most loyal servant and I call you friend.”

My breath caught in my throat. Freedom? True freedom? I dreamed of it when I was younger, any slave would. Yet as he years went by I dreamed less. I learned that dreams were ephemeral, unable to sustain the body. A place to sleep, food to eat, and the promise of another day were far more tangible things. “Wh-what is my other choice?”

He laughed again. “A stutter? I’ve never heard you do that before.” His hand clutched mine and though the muscles were weak, his grip was strong. “Your their choice is to stay. Stay in the house. You will be first, in charge of the others and for all to come. Your portion is yours despite your choice, but the influence of the house and its resources would be at your will.”

“But... I would remain a slave.”

“In name, but your influence and strength would be unmatched by any other with the same name.”

A wry smile grew on my lips. “The choices seem uneven. A free man of modest means. Or a rich slave. Why would I make the other choice?”

A sound traveled beneath the closed door. A pattern of feet, the shy unsure shuffle of one waiting. A sniffle, suppressed and sad. Both our eyes looked to the door and mine lit in realization. 

“Yes,” he whispered desperately. “I worry. I am afraid. Please, I realize how selfish I am by asking this off you. But I beg you. I will accept either choice, but I would rest far easier with a specific choice.”

My dreams screamed. My mind howled. My heart ached.  A heartbeat, a moment, an eternity passed. I looked down at the drawn and haggard face of my master. And I spoke. 

His features eased and for a moment he looked like he did those many years ago when we first met.

Many years later I watched her lay the flowers on her father’s grave. Her head bowed, her hands clasped, she whispered to him. She told him of her day, of her plans for the festival, of the house’s business. She kissed the marking stone and rose, hiding silent tears I pretended to not see. 

We left the grounds, her ahead with my gentle reminder. She walked so much like him. Her kindness already legendary. My torc sat easily around my neck, no longer as restrictive as before. ",WokCano

The radio squawked as I closed up shop. This wasn't something unusual. Adventurers come through this port town trying to best the demon tower close by. By the protocol being activated, something from the tower comes. 
The guards and adventurers from the guild down the way rush pass me, but only a few pause. An old Baker, outside in this mess of a summons? How odd, but the pay often pushed them further to their goal, or rather their doom. 
This old man has seen some odd things in his day. Bread from cursed grain didn't cut it against fighting and becoming somewhat of a demigod, but I had fallen into legend, a myth that mothers tell their children. I had liked my simple life, but as I walk through the throng of others, these youngsters so willing to die if it meant one more gold coin in their guild account, I felt the pains of my youth. 
I was Eligard, a humble Baker by those who brought their grain to my shop, but to only one other, I was so much more. 
A hand in my arm turned my head from the bloodbath the green stick fighters were getting into. I turned to see a smaller figure, the one of my old partner, Lord Henry of the town of RainBourgh, Parton of the Guild. 
""So this is what it takes to get you out of your hole, eh?"" He joked. I kindly chuckled.
""It was either this or hide, and I dont think I could hide from your giant ego."" I pat his head.
""Ready for one more song?"" He pulled a lute around to his front, tuning it slightly.
""If I have to hear a song from you, it will be too soon. Let the gods' dice control our fate-"" I went to a hatch next to the front stoop of my shop.
""But let us be the ones to roll the dice."" He strummed and the magic flew around him like he was 20 years younger.
""Heh"" I blew away the dust from full plate armor and slowly put it on. The oil from the storage barrel made it harder, but the years on my body made it worse. 
""Are you sure you are ready to the task?"" Henry looked down the lane to see several droves of men being flung into burning buildings. He whistled as one fell not fifty meters away.
I snickered as I unsheathed my blade, glowing purple in the harsh fire that was spreading from the beast. I set my helmet on my graying head.

I was never told what would happen, but hearing this phrase started hundreds of times, I started to believe it.

Today I walked home with my date, gently swaying our hands together and smiling. Over all, the date went well. We had gotten some coffee to keep warm this morning, gone to the movies, and just a few moments ago, we had gone to the park.

I kissed my date on the cheek, laughing as she blushed and looked away from me. God this woman was adorable. I smiled before saying good bye, turning to leave before hearing her call out for me again.

I turned to her to see her smiling and keeping her front door open and smiling at me.

""Come in with me, we could get some tea and talk for a while,"" she says softly, smiling happily at me.

I couldn't help but melt into her touch as she held onto me. She was so warm and it was freezing outside. I should have realized what was going on.

It's cold down here, any and all warmth is gone. Besides her. She comes by every so often, right when I feel like I would freeze to death. She'd hold my face in her hands and warm me up before eventually leaving, taking the warmth with her.

I wouldn't dream of leaving her though. As long as she has me, no one else will get hurt right? As long as she has me, we'll both be okay and no one else will get hurt.

He could still hear the banter of all these young men echoing through their barracks. Once he reached the grave for Pvt Smitty, the storm clouds enveloped his thoughts. All he could see was Smittys dead stare, not his perfect smile, not his contagious laugh or is perfect whit; all of it stripped away in an instant by a single NATO round to the temple, fired from a captured american gun. Stu could never reconcile whether he had more hatred for the gook he gutted that night, or the pansy son of a bitch who lost his rifle to him weeks earlier. With angry, shaking hands Stu took another gasp of oxgen from his mask, and tightened the grip on his cane. To call it a thousand yard stare would do injustice to the miles in his gaze, the screaming in his head, the blood fueled rampage as he went from tunnel to tunnel slashing throats, gouging eyes, and crushing skulls. The base had been right underneath them the whole damn time, and Smitty was the first to know. A medal of honor was draped over the top of his cross, and with a single salute, Major Stu Powell departed.  
Later that night, he fell asleep without his apparatus and passed peacefully away.  
  
The Pearly gates opened, and he walked fourth unhindered by aching joints, breathing the fresh air again at last. There just beyond the entrance awaited a massive angel with a very long scroll. The angel peeked over the the rim of his half moon glasses and tonelessly addressed him, ""Very impressive, Stewart... 1432nd place."" Stu cocked his head and said nothing, and the angel paused his relentless inscribing and leaned closer, ""I believe that entitles you to a minibar."" and then he continued writing. Stu continued looking baffled, and was about to walk away, but instead asked, ""Sorry, but 1,432nd place in...?"" ""Kill count, Mr. Powell. Though you might be disappointed with your rank now, believe me, that's good placing in the big picture.""  
""Kill count? Are you trying to tell me that's what life was all about? Kills? I served my country with distinction and honor, to defend the constitution! I wasn't some mindless murderer!""  
The angel rolled his eyes and stepped down from his podium. ""Listen, of course you don't have to kill to get into Heaven. Of course that's not what life's all about."" The angel put his arm around Stu's shoulder and lead him onward into the clouds before continuing ""There are *many* leaderboards, and you need only get onto one of them to arrive here."" The angel gestured toward the sky, and Stu could see vaulted ceilings clad with gold reaching as high as space. Upon the ceilings were written things like ""Good Deeds"" and ""Distance Travelled"" ""Patents filed"" ""Epic Roasts"" and all sorts of other seemingly unbiased leaderboards. ""This is yours."" From the ceiling, a word lit up and from it descended an impossibly long scroll. ""Your chosen discipline, out of all things, was killing. You were very good, too. I normally don't give private tours after all. A lot of these people have no clue why they're even here. See that man over there?"" The angel extended an arm and pointed from his draping sleeves to a disheveled looking man pacing around heaven completely bewildered, tearing out his own hair as it immediately grew back. ""Yeah, what's his deal?""  
""He lived the life of a degenerate pile of shit and has no idea why he isn't in hell. He thinks he's here by accident.""  
""So... what makes him so great. Why is he here?""   
""He got third place on the number of Fleas leaderboard."" The angel smiled with the corner of his mouth, admiring the man. ""He's my favorite though. Number 2 just really likes fleas and number 1 is super weird.""  
Stu shook his head in bewilderment. This Heaven place made no sense. ""Okay. Fine. Who the hell am I on the leaderboard with then? Criminals? Warlords?""  
""Oh not all of them. First and second place certainly aren't, at least""  
""WHAT?! You're gonna just stand there and tell me that Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin aren't Criminals or Warlords? Are you insane?!""   
""Hitler and... Stalin, was it? Hmm..."" The angel yanked down the scroll fast, as miles of it pooled at his feet. His eyes darted through the names as they whizzed by, and then he caught it again. ""Ah, yes! They are on this list! Not high enough for heaven, and much, much lower than you I might add... but man! Would you look at those team assists! You weren't kidding! Yowza! I Ought to make a new category for that!""    
""No, don't... make another list..."" Stu needed to change the subject before Hitler made it to heaven. ""Who the hell is number one then""  
The angel raised an eyebrow, ""They don't talk about that on Earth? Weird. Well, see for yourself."" The angel nodded toward the end of the scroll which rested at Stu's toes. He leaned down and picked it up.   
""Thomas Ferebee? 149,021 kills? Who the god damn fuck is this? I never heard of the guy!"" he exclaimed as he hit the parchment with the back of his hand.  
""You've never heard of the man who dropped the bomb on Hiroshima? The man who had over 60 other bombing runs? The infamous real estate agent and family man who killed over a hundred thousand people? Huh...  Well then. He has a mansion here if you ever want to meet him. Anyway, enjoy heaven!"" With that, the angel walked away, and Stu stood there, clutching his leaderboard and wondering what the hell just happened.",GregoryGoose

"[WP] The world ended, every living being destroyed in an instant as they were engulfed in flames. Strangely enough, you woke up right after it. The morning before the destruction.",Mutetails,"Screams, as you'd expect.

Panic, not that surprising either.

Sirens, not that they could keep up anyway.

More notifications than would fit on my screen, it was broken in the first hour anyway.

Calls from my mother, of course.

Calls from my brother, of course.

Calls from my sister, of course.

Calls from my father, of course not.

Groups of friends, or strangers, people just liked to be together.

Stillness, more of a twist before the flames came.

Fire, the bringer of end itself.

Blackness, but I'm still alive. This I didn't expect.

Dreams, they come as fleeting moments. But I'm sure it was real.

My alarm, blaring as always. It wakes me up.

The date, more confusing than ever.

It's the same, I stop and I stare.

Again? A question in the air.

Again. It didn't seem very fair.

"[WP] You're not sure how long you've been in this room, but all that's changed since you got here is the shape and colour of the stool in the corner. Your author has writer's block again.",Psypherus,"I wanted to yell, I wanted to scream in frustration, but of course the words would not - could not - come out, just an impotent growl of annoyance as I paced around the stool.

I distinctly remember that I had been captured on a mission to obtain proof that the Russians had sabotaged our newest Nuclear Submarine, the USS Santa Fe.  I had just obtained the USB flash drive from the locked vault in Gdansk when I felt the cold steel of a Glock 19 pointed squarely at my temple, and then the almost blissful blackout caused by an injection of something.

&amp;#x200B;

So, a stool.  It had been black and three legged, now it was wooden and four-legged.  But that was it.  There was space for a table nearby, but no actual table was there.  In a pale, whiteish room with several bright lights, mostly shining at that damned stool.

I was going to be interrogated.  I knew based on instinct.  And history - I had been captured and interrogated with alarming regularity on my missions, it seemed.  I knew the routine by now.  Reveal nothing, get beat up a bit, end up in a cell, and then figure a way out.  I knew the script.

&amp;#x200B;

But the... the unspeakable author!  He had lost the script!  Worried about minutia like the color or material the stool was made of?  Just give me a couple damned Ruskies that I could be a smartass towards before they beat me a bit, that's all I wanted now!  But no.

How long would it be?  Last time the story just paused like this, it seemed like years.  The Author had decided to work on a children's book instead.  Imagine that, a spy novelist trying to write a little story about some rabbit girl with three daddies and a hamster or something.  Well, OK, I don't know actually, I never read it of course.

&amp;#x200B;

I wished there was something to read here.  Or to eat.  Or do.  I would just have to wait.  Until the Author got off his lazy ass and typed the next word in.  If only I could escape this place, and give him a piece of my mind!

""You mean, give *her* a piece of your mind,"" a voice thundered overhead.

What?  

I considered this new information for a moment, and realized... it changed literally nothing.  I was still stuck here.  Possibly forever.  I really wanted to give *her* a piece of my mind.  


And that's when the blinding light appeared...",Dhen3ry
"[WP] You're not sure how long you've been in this room, but all that's changed since you got here is the shape and colour of the stool in the corner. Your author has writer's block again.",Psypherus,"(I stuck with the major idea of a self aware book character but didn't use the stool scene.)

I remember the first time I began to suspect something was truly wrong. I was walking home from school, as I did every day, listening to music and watching the sidewalk when I was just... Suddenly inside my house. Not just outside it, but inside, staring down at the pale blue tiles in our entranceway. I brushed it off though. I was always quite the day dreamer, and I felt that it was just a case of me not being aware of my surroundings. Not long after, though, I came home from school again, and was almost immediately sat down at the dinner table. I didn't even get a chance to drop my backpack, but it wasn't with me when I sat down. The table was set with four places, which I thought was odd, since it was just me, my mom and my little sister.. I asked my mom who was joining us for dinner, and she looked.. Confused. ""No one sweetie."" She said with a bemused laugh. Then this guy.. I swear I had never seen him before, entered the room. He wrapped his arms around my mom and kissed her, before making his way towards me and my sister. He planted a kiss on each of our heads, and I wanted to pull away. I wanted to get up from that table, grab a knife and make him go away. But I was frozen in place, smiling even. ""Hi daddy."" I said, my voice tainted. Twisted. My father had left a long time ago, and though the memories I have of him were foggy, I knew that this man was NOT my father. 

My new fake dad stuck around for a week, and then he was gone. No one noticed. Not even when I asked my mom, ""Where did Rob go?"" All she could say was, ""Who?"" Over the next several months, my mom died, came back, and was diagnosed with cancer. My sister was replaced with an older brother and then came back on her own. My new older brother was a drug addict, then a soldier, then a shut-in computer nerd, and briefly, a closeted transexual. I felt like a stranger in my own home. I couldn't trust anyone in my family, I couldn't even trust that my house would be the same as I entered and left rooms, let alone day to day. It was when I tried to write down my experiences that everything clicked... I felt like an author trying to chart a story and completely changing my mind several times in the process. Just writing about the changes in my life, I imagined how my little character would feel as I erased parts of their life and rewrote them. 

I decided to test this theory. In hindsight, it was a stupid, STUPID idea. But I was at my wits' end. I needed to find out, one way or another. Either I was a character in some half baked story, or I was insane. What was the worst thing an author could do to a main character at the beginning of a story? Kill them. I tried to kill myself three times, just to be sure. The first time was simple. Swallow a bunch of pills from my medicine cabinet. But when I got to the cabinet, it was empty.. Not even a Flintstone chewable in sight. When I asked my mom, she said that she read an article about suicide and wanted to lock up all of our medications. She went from dying of cancer to a super health freak overnight, by the way. The second time, I decide to take a bath with a toaster. Real old movie style. But just as I was about to drop the toaster in the water, we lost power... A freak snow storm in TEXAS in SEPTEMBER. My final attempt was a desperate one. I simply grabbed a knife from the kitchen and tried to slit my throat. As I brought the blade to my skin, it was gone. And I was sitting up in bed, covered in cold sweat as if I'd had a bad dream. 

It's been a few years, as far as I can tell. I can go months with nothing changing. That's how I know my author is uninspired. But when they're active... My life is hell. See... My author has a penchant for writing Horror. ",SiphonCipher
"[WP] You're not sure how long you've been in this room, but all that's changed since you got here is the shape and colour of the stool in the corner. Your author has writer's block again.",Psypherus,"Green. Today it was green. Wonderful. I let out a sigh as I stare upon the now emerald barstool, my hand moving out to catch the top of it, to feel the cushion that has been attached to it. A decent firmness to the material, it seemed. I soon took a moment to enjoy that seat, leaning back as I felt the sudden arrival of a backing to it. Now it was more like a restaurant's seat than a barstool. Far more comfortable for me to do my own brand of thinking while the man above worked his way through it.

&amp;#x200B;

My name is Ardyn. I am the Archivist for my fair city, the keeper of all the stories within this world. Though, which city am I speaking of now? Am I within New Ultas, preparing to bear witness to the Crimson Generals as they plot to destroy my boss' home? Perhaps I am in the ruins of Themis, getting ready to enjoy some time within the bar's ruins? No, it could even be Novia, dear sweet Novia, and my Archive's personal chair. I could almost imagine it again, the rows upon rows of books just waiting for that man to walk up and do his due research.

&amp;#x200B;

Another change, the chair turning a deep brown, morphing beneath me and becoming shorter, though far more comfortable. It seemed to have some proper support for once, providing relief for a back that was aching from having to stand for so long. It seems like he's thinking of Novia again.

&amp;#x200B;

The true master of this world, the Author....I have seen this world vanish on multiple occasions. His ability to stay on task is rather horrible, if I am to be critical of my creator's style. Never able to keep on one idea for two long, constantly working to fix his old 'mistakes' before resetting everything once more. There are some aspects of it that remain. He may think that no one would ever notice his constant, rampant destruction of the world in the search of perfection. The changing of those who have been my friends. No, no one will ever know the truth of those worlds that he's created.

[WP] When you were young you wished that you would be a fairytale princess. The next morning you woke up in a royal castle. Now you're learning that being royalty in a fantasy world is more difficult than you thought.,RetroN404,"'Wake up this very instant!' came a shout from the bedroom doorway.

In a flash she was up. The newest Princess in the land of Nearest and Farthest, Corelle had only checked in three days ago to the Royal Caste, but it had felt like forever and an eternity.

In those three longest of days she had been kidnapped, dangled from a cliff, rescued, kidnapped again, nearly been eaten by a dragon, and been rescued once more. This was all rather terrifying for a 14-year old girl from suburban Australia, but none of it came even close to the terror of the woman at the door.

'Look at you', said the woman, 'Never have I seen a girl less fit to be a princess.'

She was quite large, some might have even described her as rather ""blob-like"". When she moved, everything wobbled and quivered, and every fleshy part of her seemed to tremble furiously. She waddled over to Corelle.

'Do I make myself clear?' she asked, standing over the new princess.

'You...haven't asked me anything', came Corelle's reply.

The woman snorted through exceptionally large nostrils.

'Exactly as I thought. Too lazy. Too fat. Not even remotely pretty. Next time you get kidnapped, please do yourself a favour and stay kidnapped.'

She shuffled back to the doorway and did not turn back when she said, 'Your breakfast went cold. We fed it to the dog, terribly sorry', and slammed the door behind her.

Corelle buried her face in the pillow. She had always wanted to be a princess and this was far from how she had imagined things to be.

Now you're learning that being royalty in a fantasy world is more difficult than you thought.,RetroN404,"“I’m going to run away, and become a princess and I won’t have to live with you,” Madeline shouted. She pulled the forlorn braid from her brother’s hand, dodging the jab he made with the scissors in the process. 

Her brother scoffed. “Yeah, good luck with that,” he said. Madeline screamed in response and stomped off to her room. She locked the door and threw herself on her bed. Her fingers felt the frayed ends of the severed braid, then moved to the place it should have been on her head. 

She stifled a sob, but realized that was pointless. She let loose a wail. She kicked her feet against her headboard. She screamed. 

“Now, now,” a stern voice said. “That is no way for a princess to act.”

Madeline gasped and jolted upwards in the now lumpy bed. Her head spun as she took in the new room. Her walls, which she had fought so hard to be painted Unicorn Pink, had been exchanged for slate gray stone. Two small slits stood in for her windows. An older woman, clothed in a dress, stood before her. 

The woman tutted, moving closer. Madeline tried to slide away, but her arm was caught and held by the woman. “What did you do to your hair? There’s no way you will be presentable now.” The woman looked out the window and sighed. “I guess it is not too late. Come.”

She gave Madeline no choice as she dragged her out of bed and into a plain room adjacent to the one the girl materialized in. A tub rested on the floor, steam coming up from the water. The woman let her go. “Well?” she asked. Dumbly, the young girl stripped her clothes and climbed in. She let out a cry as the water touched her skin. 

“What did you expect?” the woman snapped. “The servants just brought it from the kitchens.” She grabbed Madeline’s arm and began scrubbing, taking layers of skin with each pass. 

“I must cut your hair now,” the woman said, handing the washcloth to the girl. “There’s not much time before the party arrives. The servants have already laid out your traveling dress and cloak.”

“The party?” Madeline asked. “Where are we traveling to?”

The woman sighed, taking the scissors off of the table next to the tub and giving it a few test snips. “I told Queen Esma to not hinder your education, but your father would have none of it.”

She grabbed Madeline’s head, and the girl heard the scissors come together close behind her ear. “Yes, the traveling party, you daft girl. Do you forget your betrothal tomorrow? King Nepthis of the land Farthen asked your father for your hand in marriage. His first two marriages produced no heir, so he is hoping your youth makes a difference.”

Madeline whimpered. She brought her hand to her head, to feel the missing braid, but was slapped away. “Why do you cry? It is a great honor,” the woman said. “Because of you, the two most powerful kingdoms are allied together.”

Madeline began to cry, carefully keeping any noise down. She closed her eyes for a few seconds, but nothing changed when she opened them. She tried again. Still nothing. 

“What are you doing? Stop that,” the woman scolded. “Get out of the tub. You are a princess, not some common girl. You must face your new life as such.”

The young girl walked to her clothes, and wondered why she ever thought that this was a better life. ",PeacefulParalian

Things ain't so bad.",RexReaver,"Once Washington D.C fell, it was done. The world had fallen. Now, the entire Earth is under the rule of one man, one government. We all remembered books like The Handmaids Tale and The Hunger Games, and assumed the worst. Things changed, a lot changed, but they said it was for the benefit of humanity.

They were right.

I walk to my nursing job at New World Hospital in Centrus. The capital of the world, built on the ruins of Honolulu, Hawaii. I remember the old Honolulu, I do miss it, but Centrus feels so much more... vibrant, and bigger. Definitely bigger. I open the door into the local cafe to get my daily coffee. 

""Good morning Jacqulynn, same as usual?"" Gerard, the barista, said.

""Yep, could you also get me a couple of lemon macaroons too? I promised Rose some after she covered my back at the bar once."" Gerard nodded and went to get the macaroons and latte. I pay and continue walking towards the hospital. I walk into the hospital and spot Rose at the receptionist desk.

""Hey Jacqulynn! Do you have the macaroons you promised?"" Rose said eagerly.

""They're right here Rose, and how's your husband doing?"" I reply.

""He's still got another 3 months in Kinshasa. I wish he didn't have to stay that long away from home, but at least the government is paying us well."" She said.

""Well you take care."" I say while walking towards the center of the facility. I go into the break room to finish my coffee and put my lunch in the freezer and turn on the TV.

""Breaking news, Power outages in Africa causing deaths as population continues to rise in numbers and social class. The biggest power outage is centered around Cairo, Northern Africa. In ligh-"" The TV then shut off, so did the rest of the lights in the break room. I open the door to see the rest of the lights are off too. Doctors and nursing are running around and people are yelling instructions. I run to one of the nurses to ask what happened, he just shrugged. I take out my phone and try to turn it on. Good, it's just a power outage. I try calling my sister. Nothing. I try calling her wife. Still nothing. I go outside to see what's happened. Cars still work, but I can see no lights are on. I'm suddenly reminded of the New York power outage in 2003. I was only a baby at the time, but my mother clearly remembered it. Saying how scared she was and how everyone thought it was terrorism. Is this also terrorism? I try to go to the news app on my phone. No internet, damn it.

It was almost two hours until the power came back on. Turns out, we weren't the only ones affected. The Africa power outages were warnings until The Big One came. It hit the entire world, until it didn't. The people were scared, the people were angry. The people wanted answers. The government had none, until someone else came forward.

""People of Earth. We are the Bastion of Humanity. The new government has erased our identities. American, Chinese, Indian, European. They leveled our cities to build their own. You make think you live in a utopia, but you're not. Not yet. Join us, to finally build one.""

I've rewatched the video 5 times. I recognize him, he looks familiar. Until it clicks. There were 5 people that tried to stop The New World government. Only 4 bodies were found, but we were sure he was dead too. He was dropped into the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. How did he survive? I hadn't seen him in person, but their ""debut"" in Paris gave us a bit of hope. We all saw their faces, until they were stopped in Shanghai. Everyone saw it, it was tragedy. Until it was celebration. It was clear to everyone that the coming of The New World was the best thing to happen to humanity, so why is he trying to stop it?

Things ain't so bad.",RexReaver,"Yorn walked up to a glistening slab of stone and sat down heavily. His armour, however durable, was often a nuisance to carry. The interlocking plates around his neck allowed him some movement, but not the full range of motion he would like, and the multiple plates and weaved layers weighed heavy on his shoulders and knees.

“This is stupid. There’s no one out here.” said Sheen. She’d been grumbling for hours now, as they walked across the forest, among endless trees. “They’re all gone. We’ve won, it’s pointless.”

“If intel says they’re out here, then they’re out here. Focus up, we’re in their domain.”

“THEIR domain? We’ve won! They don’t get to claim ownership over all this any more.”

“It’s not about claims...”

“Yeah yeah, it’s just the reality of how they work. Just being in the forest makes them stronger. They see things we can’t. Yada yada yada. I’ve read the handbook too.”

“Then act like it. And eat something. We’re off again in ten.”

As they walked further into the forest, Yorn couldn’t help feeling like he was being observed. His early warning system didn’t agree with him, but he felt as if eyes were just hanging from the branches and peering into his back. He gripped his rifle tighter and forced himself to breathe. Relax, he told himself. It’s just ghosts of a war that’s over. And as if someone wanted to prove him wrong, a shadow dropped to his side and a silver dagger planted itself in his left shoulder pad.

“CONTACT! Drop and take right!”

Sheen dropped to a knee and swung her rifle over their right flank. As she did that Yorn let his left fist swing upwards and outwards. With a thud, he hit the elf that had just tried to stab him square in the chest and sent it flying back. Another elf leaped out of the foliage at them, glowing white sword in hand. Sheen’s rifle swept around and placed several rounds straight into the elf’s figure. The first few seemed to melt into colourful fireworks as they came close to the elf, but eventually one went straight through the lean body and the elf dropped to the ground.

The first elf screamed, and jumped back at them. As it flew through the air, its mouth murmured some enchantment and its eyes glowed. Yorn opened fire but once again the bullets just exploded into a thousand bright lights before they could get to the elf. As it landed on Yorn, a second knife appeared in its hand and its blade flashed in a flurry of stabs, trying to penetrate his armour.

“DIE! Just DIE, you monsters!” it cried. Its voice filled with anguish and terror and hatred.

Yorn struggled, and rolled on the ground with the elf. The smell of the elf’s earthy breath filled his nostrils. It was as if rain had just fallen into a patch of grass and his face buried in it. He started thinking about just laying on the grass, and letting that smell fill him. The idea of nature enveloping him invaded his thoughts and the glimmer of morning dew on leaves filled his eyes.

Just as Yorn was being taken over by ideas of nature and death and greenery, Sheen planted the buttstock of her rifle in the elf’s right cheek knocking it out.

“Snap out of it, old man!” she said as she shook his body with her hands.

“Alright, alright! Stop it. I’m ok.”

“You sure? Not thinking of letting trees eat you any more?”

“I’M OK! Just didn’t have time to put on my face-mask that’s all. Help me out here, I want to interrogate this beast.”

They took the elf’s unconscious body, bound it with metal wire, and splashed water on its face to wake it up. Its body shook awake and a stream of words started spouting out of its mouth. It sounded eerily song-like, but so high-pitched and in such a shrill tone that it made it uniquely unpleasant to hear. Yorn pushed the elf against a tree trunk and kneed down to face it.

“Where’s your nest?” Yorn asked “Where did you come from?”

“We came from the earth, demon! Our lair is the planet.”

Yorn rolled his eyes and stood up. “Oh spare me the we-are-connected-and-green crap! Where. Did. You. Come. From?”. He punctuated each word with a kick to the elf’s chest.

“You can’t intimidate me, human.” The elf said, spouting the last word as if it were a curse. “I will gladly die before I allow you to spread your scourge to my brethren.”

“Scourge?! You call this” he pointed at himself “a scourge? We live better than you! We have warm food. Houses. Transport. We can share knowledge over vast distances. We don’t die of disease or hunger or cold. Our young don’t need to scour the bushes for food.”

“A scourge and a blight! At what cost comes this luxury of yours? You poison the waters, spread disease in the air, kill the animals and the trees and the land. The stones themselves crack and wither at your passage. You are misery, demon, and the last of us will die before you take over what remains of the great lord’s gift. Ithril comes, and shall rid us of your darkness. The magic He brings is stronger than you, and shall overcome your evil ways.”

“Really?” Yorn scorned “And how will he do it? By making more factories collapse with their workers inside? Or by destroying dams and flooding whole cities?”

“Every one of you who dies is another leaf that doesn’t get trampled, human. Dying is the best thing those monsters ever did for nature. And Ithril will bring that destiny to you all.”

“That’s going to be hard on account of Ithril being dead and all.” Yorn said as he placed a boot in the elf’s chest and a bullet in its grimacing face. “Turns out magic can only stop so many bullets.”

Lord Velax continued to kneel as his would-be assassin fell behind him.  He continued to hold his sword, now red with the assassin's blood, out with a straight arm.

Anyone observing from behind him would think his position was for style.  Anyone looking at his face, drained of color and with wide eyes, would realize he was just as surprised at the outcome of this dual as anybody.

Time and sound returned to Velax, and he stood.  He flicked his sword, scattering some of his opponent's blood across the cobblestones.  He pulled a hakerchief from one of the pockets on his all black uniform and began to wipe the blade.  His black cape fluttered in the winter wind.  He shivered in the snow; half from the cold, and half from the recent reminder of his own mortality.

The stars shown overhead, the snow around him sparkled, and in the distance a church bell rang.

The bell rang as the church burned, as the last city to oppose him burned.  Even here, on a hill several miles away and overlooking the shattered outer walls, he could hear the crackling fires and the screaming of the people unfortunate enough to side with his enemies.  

At long last it was over, the kingdom was his. He turned to the man he had just killed, the last of many.  He knelt again beside the corpse and looked at the empty eyes on the assassin's face.

""You hated me, I know, and I understand why you did."" He spoke to the corpse, it continued to stare at nothing. 

""To be honest, I deserved that hate. God knows I earned it, but for you and me that is over.""

The bell in the distance ceased ringing as the fires around its tower caused it to collapse.

""This I promise you: all the violence, all the suffering will be worth it one day. I am sorry you will not be able to see it.""

With that, Lord Velax closed his enemy's eyes.  He stood up and saw a black rider approaching.

""My Lord, the City is ours!"" The rider said as he saluted.

""Very good.  Send a message to the troops: 'Provide assistance to the civilians and put out the fires.' also, any man caught looting or harming the townsfolk in any way will answer to me, and it will *not* be a pleasant experience.""

""Yes, My Lord!"" 

The rider saluted, and spurred his horse back towards the city. Velax knew that some would continue to loot, and that some would get away with it.  He also did not relish the coming executions for those Soldiers, his Soldiers, who were actually caught.

Still, with the fall of that City, and with the lucky swing of his sword, the war had ended.  Peace had to begin somewhere, and this was how peace was supposed to begin.

He was a warrior, he was a conqueror, now he was a ruler.  He silently promised the man he had just killed that he would be a good one.",robulusprime

I'm not sure I've entirely adjusted to their eternal reign over the planet, honestly, but I've got mixed feelings. When you see the legions of terror march over the sands of the Earth, you know what's the last thing those warriors are thinking about?

Health insurance. 

Most of their premium comes straight from salary, and their deductible is easily reachable when you occupy yourself with raping and pillaging the armies of civilization. I know a guy, Kzondur, he's the nicest flesh thrall you've ever meet. He got an arrow in his shoulder during the Siege of Fort Hope, and his family didn't have to worry about a thing. All of his hospital bills were covered by the state, and he even got a compensation package that helped his wife finish her associate's degree in marketing while he was resting.  Three weeks later, he's back out on the battlefield, defiling the corpses of countless innocents. The times we're living in.

Universal healthcare for everyone, and they tell me that all I have to do is pay a little more at the grocery store? I call that a solid deal. I don't know how these guys do it, but I can't complain.

We had t’ salute the old guards, didn’ we?”

Pip rolled her eyes. “Yeah, and they didn’ take our ‘eads off if we didn’, did they?”

“Bet they would’ve ‘f they could.”

Knowing more than a few of them back then herself, she had to give him that. Mean lot, the lot of ‘em, wanting nothing more than to hear their own voices and use the pretty notepad bought on the people’s taxes. Not that she or Ferly had ever paid a tax they could dodge, but, if they were proper members of society, they would have rather the money was spent on something more useful to maintaining public order, like another drinking house. Nothing in the world maintained public order better than locking the disorderly behind a door, after all.

“I say, I say, so ye canno’ say anythin’ bad ‘bout the guy—wot’s that t’ me? No skin off my back, eh. I ain’t met ‘im. Better thin’s t’ worry for, ain’t there?”

“Then you say one night down the pub: maybe the taxes are a bit high. Next thin’ you know, i’s your head on the block and everyone’s cheering.”

Ferly shrugged. “Canno’ blame them—who doesn’ like a good chop?”

“And y’ve missed the point entirely,” Pip said, the words coming out like a long sigh.

He waved her off. “Nah, I ge’ it, I do. The thing is, he needs muck like us, righ’? Canno’ run a-narmy on black cloaks and glowers now, can ye? So, keep t’ the farms and the fac’ries and don’ talk abou’ taxes or tariffs or anythin’ but the waitress’ arse and we’ll be fine, won’ we?”

“Tha’s wot I bin saying all along. So everythin’s a bi’ drab and gloomy, a’least i’s not some garish yellow or sumin’. Could be a lo’ worse.”

Pip looked from her mug of ale to the window, night outside peppered with lamps and stars, no moon to be seen. “Yeah, and thin’s could be a lot better too.”

“No’ for us.”

Things ain't so bad.",RexReaver,"While the battle to end all battles takes place in the swamps of Weirdvale, the Dark Lord and the Boy King meet atop Redwood Knoll.

The Boy King wears a pair of breeches given him by the good elves of the Mistwood. An enchanted tiara graces his noble brow. He wields the sword of Parrendir, vanquisher of evil. It is the will of the kings and queens that he prevail.

The Dark Lord’s eyes burn redly within the blackened hollow of his hood. His black robe obscures his form. The robe’s tattered edges wave in the gale force winds that streak across the knoll. He carries no weapons. Only his mailed hands present a threat.

They clash like a hurricane makes landfall. All is the slash and jab of the sword of Parrendir. The blade shears off strips of the Dark Lord’s robe without contacting anything substantial. It is as though the Boy King attacks a sheet carried by the wind.

“Leave off, boy,” the Dark Lord says.

The Boy King slashes mightily. “Spare me your words, evil one. There can be no common ground between us.”

White teeth sparkle within the Dark Lord’s hood. “So be it.” When next the Boy King lunges, the Dark Lord’s hands flash out and catch the sword of Parrendir. The darkness that is the Dark Lord coalesces into something solid, and he heaves the blade from the Boy King’s hands.

Lightning strikes a nearby redwood.

“That’s not possible,” the Boy King says. “Only the noblehearted can touch the sword.”

“Legends have much in common with gossip.” The Dark Lord flips the sword of Parrendir and catches it by the grip. “They all start somewhere. That one happened to start with me.” He looks the blade over from pommel to tip. “A fine sword.” And he swings at the Boy King.

The blade enters the Boy King’s torso where his neck meets his shoulder. The blade, driven by the Dark Lord’s immense strength, passes cleanly through the Boy King’s chest. It emerges through his hip.

The Boy King collapses in two pieces.

“Very fine,” the Dark Lord says.

Without a second look at his fallen enemy, the Dark Lord makes his way to the edge of the atoll, where he has a fine view of the battle far below.

Even without his help, his forces appear to be winning. The Blights of Dunheim have snuck round the Shieldmen of Heavenvale to take the good elves of Mistwood by surprise. His wolf cavalry lay waste to the Hipposh Horsemen. Only his necromancers have met their match in the Sorcerers of Surry.

The Dark Lord pauses to take in the extent of his achievement. For two thousand years, men, elves, foment, and centaurs have owned the land. Only through feudal rule have they maintained their way of life. Through it all, the commoners have suffered.

Now, at long last, the Dark Lord is on the cusp of ushering in a new era, one of goodness, respect, and shared leadership.

He focuses his attention on the sorcerers of Surry. To their rear he spies the noble white head of Archmage Magorian. With a mighty heave, he hurls the sword of Parrendir.

For long seconds, the blade soars. It describes a beautiful arc along the side of Redwood Knoll. Finally it comes to rest inside the Archmage’s pelvis. It takes a moment for the sorcerers to realize what has happened. The Dark Lord can track the information's passage by the way their heads turn. His necromancers take advantage of the distraction. Their black lightning spreads among the sorcerers.

The Dark Lord takes a deep, calming breath. “There’s the beginning of their end.” He takes another. Through the scarred sky overhead, he makes out the pale shape of the emerging sun. “There’s the end of my beginning.” He leaps from the knoll, his robe flares around him, and he flies down to join the battle.

The Dark Lord was poolside, engaged in conversation with two bikini clad women. The ensuing splash drenched them. Everyone, including the Dark Lord, laughed merrily at the jest.

It was awkward at first, to party with with their sworn enemy, but once the humans got to know the Dark Lord and his orc army, they discovered they are quite an amiable bunch. They enjoyed the pleasantries of life like any other creature. The Dark Lord in particular was a joy to be around. He was surrounded by an aura of good vibes which elevated all who met him into a mood of ease and enjoyment. He made everyone feel good about themselves, and laughed with the utmost of sincerity at any joke.

After defeating the armies of good the Dark Lord took his enemy's survivors into his protection. He was aware of the propaganda set against him, and his first order of business was putting his newly conquered subjects' minds at ease. He invited them to his victory party and his new guests were well taken care of and didn't want for anything.

Edgar, a private in the armies of the good, was enjoying a fresh watermelon, the first he had ever tasted. ""Can you believe this?"" He said.

""It ain't so bad"" said Chuck, hiding his true feelings.

""'ain't so bad?!'"" Edgar retorted ""This is bloody amazing! Look around you! the drinks! the food! the crowd, and the women Chuck."" The two attractive women who were talking to the Dark Lord now walked by the talking men. They waved and smiled, the Edgar waved and smiled back, but Chuck purposely adverted his gaze in contempt.

Chuck still had his reservations about the Dark Lord.  ""This is some kind of ploy. I can feel it.""

""To what end?"" said Edgar laughing. ""To fill us with food and drink then skewer us onto the spit when we least suspect it? I think not, the Dark Lord is sincere, anyone can see it. Besides, there are provisions here for a party five times the size.""

""I'm not sure what he is up to, but I intend on getting to the bottom of it."" Chuck was a typical soldier of the armies of the good. He was devout and steadfast in his duties to the Chosen One. Even after the Chosen One's death he prayed hourly, practised complete abstinence of drink or smoke, and swore off women to harness his focus without distraction.

The Chosen One taught duty, honour, and dedication. Flaunting of any kind was looked down upon, and the party in which Chuck now attended would be something utterly forbidden.

Edgar struck up a conversation with a group of friendly orcs, and Chuck excused himself citing his need to pray. As he walked away from the pool, the Dark Lord caught his eye. Perhaps it was that he detected some doubt in Chucks mind, but the Dark Lord approached him and put his great muscular arm around Chuck's shoulders.

""Enjoying yourself Chuck?"" The Dark Lord had a knack for remembering names, and had shook every human's hand as they entered the party--all 2000 of them.

Chuck cleared his throat. ""Yes sir.""

""Sir! Ha!"" said the Dark Lord with his pleasant baritone voice.""Please, call me Gary.""

""Very well...Gary""

""Where are you off to?"" he said with an easy honest smile.

""To pray for the chosen one""

""Ah I see"" Gary suddenly took on a more sinister and black look befitting his better known title of Dark Lord. His arm tightened around Chucks shoulders a little tighter, and he leaned in close to the man's ear. ""You don't like me Chuck? You think I'm set against you?""

Chuck stood frozen afraid to tell his enemy that he thought he was a snake.

""You don't need to say it."" said Gary ""I can see it in your face.""  Gary pulled him in even tighter with his huge arm. Chuck fought against the crushing grip but was forced to listen to the slimy words which came next. ""Well Gary it's true, we're going to fatten you all up and skewer you on the spit!""

Chuck struggled out the Dark Lord's mighty grip and made to kick him. He would rather go fighting than on a skewer. But the Dark Lord, and everyone around was laughing hysterically. What was the joke? thought Chuck. All the humans were laughing as well--including Edgar.

It was Edgar who finally piped in between fits of laughter. ""We got you good Chuck! We got you good!""

Chuck blushed, he wasn't accustom to practical jokes and especially not the butt end of them. Gary now recovered from the laughing, handed him a Mai Tai and padded him on the back.

""You're all right Chuck.""

Chuck nodded and managed to smile a little bit.

""Are you hungry?"" asked Gary before doubling over in laughter once more.

[WP] You’re an evil super villain with extraordinary power. You are now sure that the hero that has been trying to get you to turn from evil has fallen in love with you.,Sigma3737,"The Cafe was a rather unique place for the two to meet. The tiled floor was light gray brick with a smooth surface bordered by marble columns with a Corinthian flare that at some point added class. The tables were evenly spaced apart and complimented by black wire-frame traits and solid wooden seats. The lack of cushioning pressed into Plague Doctor's back, if not for the cushioning of his long black coat it might have been solidly uncomfortable. That discomfort would have added to his predicament. When he cleared his throat he could hear the echo resound throughout the room and into infinity. At times he looked to the side to look at the other white marble tops, at times to the ceiling made of the starry void. The Cafe that he sat in was in an exclusive address. One beyond the wall of sleep. He looked anywhere except for the black haired super sorceress who sat across from him.

""I'm so glad you were able to find time for a date,"" Miss Sorceress said with a cheery disposition. Her soft fawn cheeks were a touch red from rouge. At times she wore a performers waistcoat with black tights and heels. Tonight, she wore a pale orange kimono with a splash of red. As she noted when they first met, ""I'd like you to see the real me for our date.""

Plague replied, ""This isn't a date. You said you'd hand me over to the Judge's Guild and their prison if I didn't meet you.""

""And so you came! I'm just glad we could get away. Not be busy with work, not trade spell attacks in a back alley somewhere. Just a quiet evening, the two of us,"" She said as she kept a firm grip on him.

If it had been earlier in the year, the two would have traded spells. Miss Sorcerous, Machiko Noguchi, stood on the side of the justice. While Malcolm Frey stood, well, he didn't see it as villainy. It was true, he dealt in the dark arts of super alchemy. He also sold his talents often to crime bosses and the like, the pay was good, the questions were few. He did have a few codes in how he operated: No women, no children. That thin line was what allowed Frey, or *Plague Doctor,* as both his name and his costume to get by as being a step above the true anarchists of the world. Still, what he did constituted a violation of the law. Thus the spell-slinging in the alleyways. The team-ups between the Guild and those criminals he mingled with. But every time they thought, she would often beat him.

""I ordered a noodle dish, what would you like, honey?"" She asked.

""I'm... uhm... noodles sound fine,"" Back in the present, Frey noticed the translucent figure that vaguely resembled a humanoid. The cafe was staffed by psychic elementals. They said little, it was not like they needed to be friendly or work for a tip.

""So, what were you thinking about?"" She asked as she beamed at him.

""The past, I mean, our relationship- not that we ever had a relationship,"" He replied.

""Been giving some thought about switching sides?"" She asked.

That was the usual line, even after they battled. No matter how many times they battered their defenses and one cornered the other, she would remind him that it was not too late to join. Become a hero, instead of a villain. He shook his head and said, ""Not really. I've been laying low since our last battle. That arcane dart spell strained my back muscles.""

""It could have done a lot worst to you. In case you were wondering,"" She noted. It seemed as quick as they ordered their food had arrived, their drinks had refilled. She had begun to eat as he watched her. The way her yellow eyes at times seemed so friendly, yet a hint of menace shined within. Like a cat pleased for the moment.

""Why did you ask me out here?"" Plague Doctor finally asked. He felt his cheeks redden as it seemed that the question echoed, though there were no walls to echo from. Between the columns were the stars that floated around the tiled deck.

""You know what I like about you, Malcolm? Do you mind if I use your secret identity? Or would you prefer me to call you by your villain name?""

""We're not on the clock, I guess we can refer to each other by our names,"" He said.

""I dated Black Knight from the Judge's Guild. He's a good man, a little bit moody and all. Plus his rogue's gallery is full of psychopaths with guns and fists instead of spells. Is your food okay?""

Malcolm had taken a few bites. It was savory, a touch of spice bit at his tongue. The meat appeared to be beef. He nodded and she continued, ""So, we broke up. I started fighting you... and I noticed something. That sort of quiet manner you conducted yourself. Your words were often grim through your mask when you dispatched your employer's enemies but when I saw you outside the costume you could seem so quiet and calm. I figured I'd like that in a boyfriend-""

Malcolm felt his throat spasmed as it closed involuntary around a piece of beef he was eating. His hands hit the table with a loud slap that sent a shockwave through his palms. He nearly spat his food to the ground when he said, ""What do you mean boyfriend?""

""I mean simply put Malcolm: Ever since we started to spar, at first my plan was to reform you. Now I'd like to date you. There are many things that could sweeten this offer but if I may be frank, the fact is I can break you magically without pausing for a breath,"" she took his pale hand into hers. He should have pulled away at that moment. He had no idea what she could either read or take off of him and in the world of the arcane, even a sliver of skin or a piece of fabric from his coat could spell trouble at some point. They were sympathetic connections she could use in her spells.

""I think I'd give you a little pause,"" He countered. He had brought her shields down before when they had fought.

""I'd break you, Malcolm,"" She nodded with full confidence, ""I don't want to break you, you've always been cute in my eyes. But let's not go further without me assuring you that I've been holding back. And, after tonight, either we're walking out of here hand-in-hand as boyfriend and girlfriend, or I will break you in the waking world."" She paused for a moment to order dessert. He declined with the shake of his head.

""So, are we together?"" She asked.

He looked into those golden eyes. That brief flash of energy, that gentle morph from a rounded, Human pupil to a serpent's narrow eye. She tilted her head to the left as she continued to smile at him. He nodded slowly and said, ""Yeah, sure, I'll... date you.""

""Will you become a good guy for me, Plague Doctor?"" She asked with a soft simpering voice. He thought he could hear her purr a little as her hand continued to stroke his.

""Uhm... we'll see about that,"" He said.

She shrugged her red silk shoulders and said, ""Well, I guess it's just something to work on.""",boddynock_stotch

     I’m baffled. His hair is quaffed, and his face is astonishingly shiny. His eyes are piercing through my soul, and suddenly I see it. 

“Are you wearing makeup?” 

“Am I wearing...makeup- no. I’m not...wearing...”

“Are you sure? Because your eyes have never been so...”

“Yes?”

“So...”

“Yes??”

“So blue before.” 

“...oh. Yeah. Well I’m not-“ 

“You’re wearing eye shadow aren’t you?” 

“Look, does it matter?” 

     He’s shaking. His hands are profusely sweating, leaving handprints all over his baby blue shirt. 

“Also, what are you wearing?” 

     His shoulders sink. I know he wants me to bite. He wants me to forget the years of torture he’s put me through. 

“I put you through,” he shouts. 

     Shit, I forgot he’s a telepath. This isn’t nearly fair.

“Do you always avoid current topics, or are you just now uncomfortable because I told you how I felt,” he asked.

“Can I like...think in peace here?” 

     I’m not gonna lie here, I’m super uncomfortable.

“Knew it.” 

“Will you stop? Please? I’m trying to have a moment.” 

“Yeah so am I-“

“With myself...please.” 

     How could this have happened? I thought it was a mutual hate. I thought it was a ‘battle to the death’ thing. Like, he dies or I die. Like Shredder and Master Splinter, Zod and Superman, my fat aunt and sugar.

“Oh come on man. That’s low dude.” 

     He’s offended?

“Jesus, shut up...for like two minutes. Let me ponder on this, huh? Also...that’s your line? Diabetic jokes? I’ve killed like- whatever...you and your standards.” 

     He’s pacing nervously. Or am I pacing nervously? Maybe we’re both- wait why am I pacing? Am I actually considering this? Am I actually-

“I hope so...”

“If you say...another word. I’m going to actually kill you.” 

      He rolled his eyes. Did he...

“Did you just roll your eyes at me?” 

“Maybe.” 

     Why am I engaging in this? I’m the most powerful being on the planet-

“Second.” 

     Oh no he didn’t.

“The hell did you just say to me?” 

“Second most powerful being.” 

“First off...I’ve defeated you like a dozen times. Secondly...if this is EVER going to be a thing-“

“Wait are you saying there’s-“

“No. No...I’m just saying cut the telepathy shit out. It’s not endearing.” 

     Did he just smile at me? Is he becoming more attractive? Listen, I’m not- you know what doesn’t matter. 

“Listen, I don’t roll that way. I’m not privy to your...likes.” 

“You’re not gay. I get it.” 

“See you...get it- then why did you tell me?” 

“I’m not gay either.” 

“To be honest, that’s a confusing statement.” 

“How is it...what? I just like spending time with you.” 

“What? We fight, like constantly.” 

“Yeah but...it’s the highlight of my week when I get to see you.” 

     His face is mesmerizing. His smile is...it’s smoldering. 

“You...like spending time with me?” 

     Nobody’s ever told me that. Nobody. I mean...you know, classic upbringing: mother died, dad drank, aunt has diabetes-

“Dude.”

“Sorry.” 

     No one has ever cared enough to tell me they want me. And then this...man...stands in front of me after-

“Yes. I’m standing in front of you after everything we’ve been through and I’m telling you that you mean a lot to me.” 

“Incredible.” 

     We’re mere feet apart now. I don’t know when that happened. It’s like my body’s telling me something my brain doesn’t want to admit to: that maybe I’m actually feeling- 

“The same?” 

“Is this weird for you?” 

     He senses my hesitation. He has to...he can read minds. Am I actually doing this?

“Yes...you are actually doing this.” 

     Everything tells me this is right. Maybe I can find even the simplest form of peace with him. Maybe I can finally stop this madness. 

     I reach out and touch his face. It’s inviting me closer, and now my hands are around his waist. His eyes are so beautiful in this sunlight. 

“Is this going to work?” 

“It has to,” he whispered. 

     He grabs my hand and it feels like a lightning bolt just struck my body. My eyes look to the sky and that’s when I realized what this feeling was. 

“You just put me in shock bracelets didn’t you?”

“Yep.”

“Yep. Ok.”

“This is like 6th time you fell for that.” 

“Yeah well, I’m an emotional wreck.” 

      I hate this dreamy bastard.",freelancer756

"[WP] Shortly before dying you commited a sin, damning your soul. Why? You wanted access to the ultimate forge, the fires of hell itself.",Swiftster,"“And why the hell should I?” Satan said from where he sat behind his desk, book in hand. 

“ Because I asked nicely,” Clay responded through gritted teeth. 

They stood in Satan’s personal study in the last  ring of Hell. Well furnished and well air conditioned it was much nicer than it was advertised to be. Satan himself was exactly the same.

He sat leisurely sipping tea behind his neatly organized desk, reading Dante’s Inferno, of all things. The crimson skin and horns were true to form, the tailored suit and slender frame were not.

Satan shook his head, and put down his book. “You mortals love to assume don’t you? I usually think it’s funny,” he continued patting his book with emphasis,”but not this time. I may be a bit of a philanthropist when the mood takes me, but something tells me your not a charity case.” 

Clay looked down at his blood stained combat fatigues. The demon had a point. There was nothing redeemable about his motives. He sought revenge, plain and simple. 

“So I again I’ll ask you,” Satan began again with his face breaking into a toothy grin,“What’s in it for me?” 

“ I get the feeling you run a tight ship,” Clay replied looking around the perfectly ordered room. “ It must kill you to know he’s running around up there, causing issues. Azazel isn’t exactly known for his subtly. You must have seen what he did to my family, my town, and the next one, and the next one.”

Satan began to pace anxiously, arms folded behind his back. Clay could even see his eye beginning to twitch. 

“I mean it must really reflect poorly on you, for one of your dogs to run loose, causing problems for everyone else. Why don’t you let me take care of that for you?” Clay finished with a smirk.

Satan abruptly stopped and glared at him, eyes flashing blood red. If looks could kill, well....Satan’s probably could if he was angry enough.  But just then the Lord of Sin burst into laughter: Pure, boisterous laughter. 

“So you want to make a deal with the devil?” Satan continuing to chuckle. “Alright lets get started.”

With a wave the office disappeared to be replaced with a smoldering forge. There were no bellows, there was no fire. There was only a flow of molten lava next to a gigantic anvil, and a vat of what was obviously blood. 

“What kind are you looking for?” Satan asked over his shoulder, now dressed in a Smith’s apron, and reaching into the lava with his bare hands, “ Something old fashioned like a knife or a spear?” 

The demon placed a pile of molten metal on the anvil, and immediately afterwards an ornately carved black, iron smith’s hammer appeared in Satan’s hands. 

“ No something more modern. An Ak-47, or a M16?”

Clay’s mind whirled. He was proficient in firearms and melee combat. Obviously a gun would provide range, but there had always been something satisfying to Clay about getting up close and personal. 

As Clay thought, Satan began hammering the mass of molten metal into something resembling a weapon. Just as Clay decided on what form he wanted his weapon to take, he realized that Satan had already started making it. 

The craftsman truly did know what  was best for his customer. 

Supernaturally fast, Satan finished his work . Then he turned back to Clay,” So here’s the deal, take it or leave it. You get exactly two Earth years to fight through Azazel’s army and  kill the bastard. No more no less. If you die again, that’s it, no do overs. Do we have a deal?” 

Satan finished this by producing a ceremonial dagger, and holding it over the bucket of blood. Without hesitation Clay stepped forward and slashed his own hand, letting his blood flow into the bucket. 

Satan’s grin became distinctly devilish as he said,” Good”. Then, with a flourish, he quenched the weapon in the bucket of blood. “ Great decision by the way. Very stylish,” he finished, handing the weapon to Clay.

Clay rolled the sword over in his hands marveling at the anguished faces carved in to the crimson surface of the blade. Gripping the hilt, Clay fingered the activation rune and the chainsword’s silvery black teeth whirred to life. 

“Don’t worry about gas. It’s fueled by your burning hatred for Azazel. Affordable and eco-friendly!”

Clay didn’t even say goodbye, he simply disappeared. Back to Earth. Back to revenge.

Satan only looked upwards with the same faint grin on his face,”Go get em killer.”

Sweat gathered on my brow as I carefully looked over the runes that I had inscribed into the floor. If even a single one was drawn incorrectly, the spell would fail and then, I would be doomed to suffer in the Pit for all eternity. Finally, after about five minutes of careful analysis, I took a deep breath and I walked over to the center of the bloody circle that I had painted on the floor. I pulled out a knife and steeled my nerves. Even though I had been planning this for weeks, a small part of me still doubted, still screamed out to me about how insane this entire scheme was. But my desire for vengeance overrode my fear.  With one sharp thrust, I drove the blade into my own throat. I fell to the floor almost immediately, doubling over in pain and choking on my own blood. As my vision slowly faded to black, the last thing I saw was red flames rising up from the circle to consume my body. Despite the horrific pain, I managed a small smile. It had worked.

When I opened my eyes again, the first thing I saw was clouds. Or at least it looked like clouds until my vision cleared up and I realized that what I was actually seeing was a layer of smoke so thick that I couldn’t even see what was the other side. I rose up from the ground, the pain in my throat magically gone, and I gazed in wonder around me. In the red barren desert that I had appeared in, there were massive spires made of black and red stones that reached all the way to pierce the smoky sky. But what really caught my attention was the lake of fire in the distance, burning with blue flames. Hellfire. Perfect. The spell had successfully taken me to a deserted part of Hell where no one could interrupt me. Still, I had to work fast. According to my texts, demons could smell dark magic from miles away and they would be converging on my location within minutes. I ran as fast as I could to the lake with my materials in my satchel. Most of the ingredients I had were fairly ordinary, things that had existed from the early days of the world. Steel, obsidian, titanium, gold, silver and tungsten. But I had other special ingredients that couldn’t be found in Hell. A vial of holy water blessed by the Pope, lighting in a bottle, a piece of a meteorite that had fallen from the heavens and most importantly, the sin that had gotten me here, a halo taken from the corpse of an murdered angel. I threw it all into the lake of fire and I watched as a sword slowly emerged from the flames. As I grabbed it by its hilt though, the hellfire clung to the blade, giving the metal an unearthly gleam. I gazed over my new creation in rapture. It was a literal flaming sword, a perfect copy of the ones used by angels to defend the Garden of Eden. 

Before I could look over my sword more thoroughly though, a loud screeching interrupted my thoughts. In the far distance, I could see three scaly creatures flying towards me rapidly. I pointed my blade towards them and said one simple command: “Burn”. Agonizing screams of pain filled the air as the three demons burst into blue flames, their bodies dissolving into ash before they even hit the ground. I lowered my sword and smiled. First, I would kill Satan and take control of his armies. And then, my eyes turning toward the smoky sky, I would wage war on God himself.",Letteropener52

But let’s just start it like this, if you can’t go up, it’s time to go down. My soul had taken the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune before Shakespeare was a thought of man. I tried to rise, I thought the prize of this life was to hold court with God and be judged fit, I pushed through hardship and malaise, like I needed 6 days and then to rest, and repeat. When I got close to the seat with my soul He’s pushed me back just to let me take the toll of life a few more times, now in my mind since I’ve thought anything He’s has his palm on the top of my head. 
So instead, 
I decided right then to go down. Down to the very bowels of Hell to find Satan’s tell, and look Him in the eyes. My plan would compromise of one of the most heinous crimes written about through the annals of time with the most despicable contempt. 
I decided to kill the Earth.

"[WP] Shortly before dying you commited a sin, damning your soul. Why? You wanted access to the ultimate forge, the fires of hell itself.",Swiftster,"*CLANG clang* The hammer sounded through hell. 

*CLANG clang* It took a long time to get to this point. But I've had an eternity.

*CLANG clang* I had a plan before I died. Learn blacksmithing, bring the required tools, smith my revenge.

*CLANG clang* But there was a change of plans. Everything I needed burned up instantly.

*CLANG clang* But with my time I've come up with new plans. I can build everything I need.

I lift my project to eye the curve and the edge. I place it back in the lake of fire to heat up again. Any sane person would have gone crazy long ago. The torture and pain here is beyond imagining. Nerves constantly heal just to be broken wounds reseal so they can be issued again. A sane person would have gone crazy but I wasn't sane when I died.

Sufficiently heated the project returns to my makeshift anvil.

*CLANG clang* Sarah, do you remember buying me the Divine Comedy? You asked me then how much I loved you.

*CLANG clang* I said I'd go through hell to save you. And you didn't seem happy, but sad, and scared. Did you know?

*CLANG clang* It's taken me too long Sarah. Much too long. But he'll pay.

*CLANG clang* But don't worry. I'll remember to thank him for give us our daughter before issuing the justice he deserves for talking away your happiness.

*CLANG clang* Then the one who ""saved"" him, letting him live out an eternity of joy he doesn't deserve. 

*CLANG clang* Sarah after you ... left. She turned. I couldn't help her Sarah.

*CLANG clang* I couldn't help our baby. Some monsters like him, they killed her.

*CLANG clang* But it's ok. I already got them. I brought them here myself. 

*CLANG clang* Sarah, did you know you can bleed infinitely here? More than enough to quench a blade in?

The project goes back into the lake. 

It's taken a long time but I've got things ready. I've subjugated thousands of demons. Tomorrow I'll kill the devil and take his place.

He reaches into the fire and pulls out the rod, shaft, and finally the blade. The metal burns his hands to the bone but they heal faster than they burn and he holds onto it tightly. He turns and drops it into the deep red liquid next to himself. The thick water splashes with the new item in the pool. The thick red water eventually settles, except for the occasional drop from his previous victims. Predators, now not even good enough to be prey.

He reaches in and pulls the scythe out slowly. The ore in hell is surprisingly weak. But angels and demons. They're some of the most resilient things ever. You can make fine weapons from their bones after you crush them and book away the imperfections.

Only to wake up in a reddish surrounding.

I could see blazing monstrosities my town’s greatest bards couldn’t imagine, flying over the molten sea with what looked like other races and my people burning in it, but not dying. Their screams echoing all over the place.

I was then approached by something, with gigantic wings. I could see it’s massive shadow. I turned around to see the devil himself! The legends were true.

He had a beard bigger than Urtel, the Warrior himself! It was... *magnicifent*.

„You foolish mortal, you have damned your soul!” He cackled. I think he was... well he. The warlocks should know probably what it’s gender was.

„Yes i know laddie.” I answered

„Oh.. glad you already know that, we can skip part 2.” He said as he shuffled the stack of papers in his hands.

„Sooo... why did you kill your neighbours goats? From the records it says you were a nice guy. A regular dwarven blacksmith.” He asked.

„Well you see.” I said. „I wanted to make better weapons.”

„For what?” The large, blood red creature asked.

„For killin’ elves lad! What else would i want other than the demonic forge of sad... thing?”

„Demonic Forge of despair...”

„Yeah that one!”

„Well...” Satan said, rubbing his glasses with a piece of cloth. „What will you give in return matters. I won’t just give you the forge for free. *Especially* Huggotgh.”

„Who’s Huggotgh?” I asked

„You don’t know him? Huggotgh the forge master?”

„No...” I answered

„Well... he’s that big, fat guy over there, see him?” The demon pointed across the land over to a large empty space covered in smoke.

I could see the Demonic forge. Smoke pumping out of it. It was... *glorious*

A fat being made of iron and flesh stitched together hammered at it with a large hammer.

„Yeah i see it.” I said.

„You’re gonna need to ask him for permission... or take it from him.” The devil said.

„I can do that.” I said as i started walking across the bridge to the source of the smoke and fumes.

„The foolish dwarfs come again.” The devil muttered to himself. Only to turn around and yell. „Wait what are you going to give in return! We forgot to discuss!”",Wouju

I had always behaved properly, serving my ever-changing lords well, for which many had started to see me as a steady rock in the turmoil  that is called politics.

Quite a following I had gathered, with hundreds of individuals visiting my body as it had been laid to rest, while my soul still lingered. I had expected this, just as I had expected to fly upwards towards the hall of the Gods - instead, my soul was dragged to the depths far beneath, even beyond the reach of the greatest miners.

Hell, this place, as hot as it may be, comes with a few benefits. Although you feel hunger, you may never starve. Although you feel the heat, you will never die from it.

As a sworn blacksmith, the heat does not bother me, and these hell-ish fires make for a damn great forge. Perhaps, some day, I can create the perfect weapon and fight my way out of here.

Until then, I am alone with my only true friend. My hammer.",Nachohead1996

From there I went into 2026. I made it all the way into 2700, to the advent of technological integration of the human mind into a machine. I learned about writers, about businessmen and women, what shaped American culture: for better or worse, I really only cared about my own personal gain.

I had a tallied list of what I could invent by the time the Androids drilled into my brain and implanted embedded sensors in my head. They uploaded all the information I researched, they stored it in what I assumed was a microchip somewhere in the skull. They put optics in my eyes so I could see. My stomach was dug out and retrofitted with a weird disposal system. My cologne was more of an irrigation system by the end of the surgery. 

When their drills broke apart in teal and green and orange and red, I understood the world to an alarming degree.

But instead of attacking you and your knights, he begs for aid against a far more dangerous foe.",Wedgwig26,"The doors to the throne room swung open, with a large gust of bonechilling wind blowing through. Something was different about the hallway outside of the door. The normal, red carpet going down the hallway was instead a deep velvet color. The normal suits of armour lining the walls were replaced with various paintings, each depicting very pale, stoic looking men with very pointed ears and soulless stares. Then the king realized this wasn't his normal hallway at all, and in fact matched a description of ""his"" hallway leading to his throne. Then the king noticed a cloaked figure standing in the center of the doorway.

""Guards!"" He cried out. But no one came running into his throne room. He realized he was alone as the cloaked figure began walking towards him. Stood from his throne, swiftly pulling out his sword and reaching for a vial of garlic oil. In an instant there was a cold hand pressed against his wrist, keeping him from pulling the vial put.

""Even if I was here to fight you, that oil your apocariths created would only slightly sting me."" 

The king looked to where the voice was coming from, and it was the hooded figure standing next to him, holding the kings arm in place. The king swung his sword around to strike the figure and sliced him directly through his torso.  But as his did the figure only seemed to turn into smoke.

""Please your highness, we have no time for these small squabbles."" 

The king heard the voice coming from behind him and spun around, swinging his sword again. This time the figure caught his arm and gave a firm squeeze, forcing the king to drop his sword. The king got a good look at the figures face. His long black hair was flowing down over his shoulders. Two sharp teeth coming down from the corners of his pale mouth and two bright red eyes peering directly at him. It was the king of vampires himself, Dracula.

""I promise you, I am the least of your worries."" Dracula released the kings arm. ""I am coming to you as a friend, Arthur.""

""You murdered my father, have tried to murder me multiple times, and have slain countless numbers of my citizens. You are not my friend."" Arthur pulled his arm from Draculas grasp.

""If I wanted you dead I would have killed you decades ago. I was simply trying to prepare you for the fight to come."" Dracula had now removed his hood and began to move to the doorway. ""Come with me boy, we have much to discuss."" 

""What fight? And you truly are mad if you believe I would follow you into your castle.""

""Then I will show you now."" Dracula spun around, and in an instant closed the gap between the two of them, firmly pressing his hands on both sides of Arthur's temples. Before Arthur could react, he found himself standing in the the town square, but there was no noise. There wasnt the normal hustle of merchants buying and selling goods. No children playing in the fountain. No songs being sung or music being played by traveling bards. The king looked around and only noticed shadows. But these shadows were three dimensional, as if standing in place of the citizens. One shadow turned into three, and then ten. Arthur noticed these shadows were all staring at him, and slowly surrounding him as they were coming out of alleyways and rising up from the ground. Through the group of shadows he noticed a man. This man had black eyes, and looked as if he was crying. But in place of tears, there was tar. Tar was also coming from the corners of his mouth, and his being looked as if they were filled with tar as well. Arthur looked closer at the mans face, and something was very familiar about him. The man stopped crying and turned his head directly to Arthur. Witch a sharp scream, all of the shadows began sprinting to him. Arthur fell backwards, and found himself sitting back in his throne with Dracula standing in front of him.

""Did you see him?""

""What the hell was that? What did you do to my citizens?""

""The man you saw, that is what is called The Void. And what you saw will occur if we dont prepare you further."" 

Arthur was confused. He couldn't make sense of what he just saw. ""That man looked so familiar.""

""He should. That man was you."" 

Arthur's head was pounding. ""What the hell are you talking about? I was looking at him with my own eyes.""

""You were looking at him with my eyes, from a vision I had years before you were born. The void has been waiting for you Arthur. The void wants to make you its vessel to eliminate all life in this world.""

""This must be another one of your tricks. What the hell is going on?"" Arthur was having a hard time catching his breath and everything began to spin.

""We have no time for this, we need to prepare."" Dracula snapped his fingers, and as he did the doors to the throne room closed, and then reopened to the normal hallway. ""I will be back in 3 days, get your rest. I will send my warlock in the mean time to better explain the situation, and help prepare you for the training.""",hobochomsky

His white cloak billowed behind him majestically as he directed his aids where to clean and where to dig. His supermodel wife sat behind him bikini clad, tanning in the sun. But Mrs. Laura Laurason-Jackson was not just a pretty face, she was also a elite martial-artist and biologist, and accompanied her husband on all his adventures.

Dr. Jackson had been unable to decide between the traditional *keffiyah*\--the loose cloth the native men wore to protect themselves from sun, dust, and sand--and his usual straw safari hat, so he was wearing both. On most, the combination might look silly, but the stunningly handsome archeologist/anthropologist/street-fighter/weapons expert/cheescake aficionado wore it well.

Just then, one of the workers made a sudden exclamation in their native tongue which Dr. Jackson translated for his less arabic-apt colleagues.

“They’ve found something! A bone!”

“Great Scout!” yelled Mark Markson, Jack’s obese assistant. “This could be a legendary find!”.

“Astute as usual, Markey” responded Jackson. He might poke fun, but everyone adored the elderly nearsighted Markson, who had been surprisingly useful in several of their adventures.

It wasn’t long before the workers had unearthed the rest of the skeleton. Jackson bid them stand before the find for a group photo, with him in the front. There was a fair amount of grumbling at this, probably related to being forced to work for weeks for little pay for a weird psycho westerner in a even weirder outfit, but every great man has his dissenters.

“This’ll make you even more famous Jackson!” yelled Mark, “look at the bones of these two magnificent creatures”.

Just then a group Nazi/Communist/Terrorists attacked from over the rise.

“Your find belongs to us now!” Yelled their leader, who was memorable by his slightly fancier outfit.

Laura rapidly retrieved her Katana and dived into action, but being still mostly clothless was easily dispatched. Her husband readied his pistol,whip,rifle,dagger,sword,hatchet,boomerang, and cheesecake, but couldn’t hold onto all of them at the same time and dropped them. Mark wet himself.

The Nazi/Communist/Terrorists piled all three of the adventurers into crude cages, and then set about relishing in their victory. Little did they notice the glint of a golden scroll written with ancient warnings on one of the skeletal behemoths, and the tiny flame rising in its eye.

"[SP] ""It all started when I forgot to put my phone on Airplane Mode...""",arkol3404,"""Please fasten your seat belts by taking the clips shown here, and inserting it into the buckle like so."" Many minutes ago I complied with this instruction. When you move as far up the corporate ladder, jet setting becomes second nature. No amount of dealing with people however, could prepare anyone for this flight.

&amp;nbsp;

""Oomph, sorry buddy, could you move a little? I need to buckle up."" Adjusting myself, I tried to squeeze a little more room to enable my fellow passenger the ability to secure himself. A redundant effort in my opinion, as though his rolling mounds of flesh didn't already girdle him in between the armrests. Once I sensed the click I moved back. Of course the seat groove I worked hard on had to distort itself.

&amp;nbsp;

""Thanks! You hop between these two cities a lot?"" He asked, an unwanted attempt at inter-locution. ""Nope."" In business there are certain pieces of conversational advice, like asking open-ended questions to goad the other person into talking about themselves. Usually doing the opposite worked well if you wanted to end one. Except on him. Obnoxious crying from a nearby infant began to drown out the lard next to me, like some cruel Monkey's Paw trick.

&amp;nbsp;

""...I really like Westchester, got a lot of nice mansions, golf courses..."" I focused my attention on the lady up front, now strapping the mock yellow life-vest around her chest. Ever eager to show solidarity with the lower levels of the company, I eschewed the corporate jet two years ago and started flying first class. ""When I'm down there, I sometimes head to this pizzeria in Croton, that's where they have that nuclear...""

&amp;nbsp;

When we needed to tighten the belt further, accounting and I got creative. More money was saved by shuttling me from White Plains to Midtown Manhattan than paying the premium for landing in the city from one of our satellite offices. The only downside: No First Class, only all-economy jump jets. Once the crying quieted, he leaned over to me ""Where's the best pizza you've eaten?""

&amp;nbsp;

""I don't know,"" I responded. That was a lie, or rather, the proper response to a poor question. Best slice or pie? Pie. Where? The whole world? Answer: outside New York. Besides, I didn't want to give this guy any new ideas, he needed to eat less pizza. Pain seared in my spine as the punches of petulant crotch-fruit pushed against the back of my seat.

&amp;nbsp;

""**bzzt** Good morning everyone, we're waiting to get clearance on the tarmac, hopefully we won't have more than a short delay... **bzzt**"" I sighed.

""Oh man I hope we're not delayed. I remember one time we were stuck on the tarmac for two hours!"" Reaching into my pocket, I pulled two soft earplugs, and inserted them. Always be prepared.

&amp;nbsp;

""It all started when I forgot to put my phone on Airplane Mode! The captain made an announcement that their instruments..."" I leaned forward and hugged my pillow praying this two-hour one-hour flight didn't turn into a three-hour one because of the idiot next to me. An imbecile, who was flying back from his Martha's Vineyard vacation as though it was the first time.

&amp;nbsp;

""**bzzt** Prepare for takeoff **bzzt**"" I closed my eyes and smiled. Sixty minutes to New York wouldn't be as bad as some of the awful meetings I've sat through. The kicking in the back of my seat also went away as I felt the slight jerk of the plane moving.

Cutting through trees like candles of wax.

Till one day at least a furry orange hand
Grabbed hold of his arm and made this demand.

Do not chop down this innocent pine!
For these trees one and all I must defend
Even if your flesh I have to rend!”

Still the man ignored his warning,
Resuming once again his avaricious cutting.

At last he released the beast from its cage!

“You gluttonous fool!”, he cried and wheezed,
And the logger’s sharp axe he reached and seized.

“Let me show you the plight of the tree,
By chopping you down at your knee!”

The first one is always the hardest. Not in the philosophical way, but because they start you with the most similar timelines. So the first few are skilled killers, same as me. 
At first I don’t realise I’ve shifted. I’m in the same place. But then I notice that the walls are navy and quickly hide as I hear footsteps. 
I watch my first me enter the room. It’s surreal. 
She’s wearing my work out clothes, in my gym. I don’t like it. 
I carefully make my way to the viewing deck, trying to spot any other discrepancies. But there aren’t any.
I watch her – me – as she slips out of my clothes to reveal my swimsuit underneath and I see the difference. Navy walls and a huge uneven scar from my ribs to my hips. Interesting.
There is a splash as I dive into the pool, my head bobbing up and down as I begin swimming lengths. I aim the sniper at my head, and pull the trigger, watching the red billow out and stain the water.
That wasn’t very hard.

Four

Same building, it seems there are a fair few me’s that made it onto the radar and were recruited. I should be honoured.
I’m watching myself in the pool again, this is getting repetitive. I sigh and aim… and stop. There is some one else in the pool. He’s the first stranger I’ve seen. But clearly no stranger to number four. They meet in the middle and tread water, her arms go round his neck and his around her waist. I watch as her legs wrap around his waist and their lips meet.
I watch as his face is covered in my blood. 

I see him again in the timeline where my Grandad survived his cancer, and again in the timeline where I wasn’t an only child. Everything in these timelines is different, I live in different places with different jobs and different friends, nothing is constant, not even my hair style or music preference. But there he is – and it’s not just him. Everything about him stays the same. His hair, his tattoo’s even the clothes (when he’s wearing them) Every. Single. Time.

When I see myself with a pronounced pregnancy bump, hand in hand with him walking down a promenade I hesitate. I can’t help it. I look… happy.

But I pull the trigger, I have to. Every time I had killed myself with him there he’d fallen to his knees in despair, cradled me to him. But as pregnant me hits the floor, her skull in tatters, his head whips round to where I’m hidden, his eyes searching. 

That’s thirty. 

I am propelled back into my own timeline, and Val is standing over me with a bottle of water and packet of ready salted crisps.

“That was quick. I wasn’t expecting you back for another couple of hours.”

“What’s thirty head shots?” I laugh, “All in a days work.”

She shakes her head, a knowing smile playing in the corners of her lips.

“Only another thousand or so to go.”

I roll my eyes, like this doesn’t phase me and take the bottle of water.

Six hundred and forty seven.

He’s looking for me now, it’s getting harder and harder to kill myselves.
He’s cropping up more and more now. Each time I move to a new timeline I find I am looking for his familiar face rather than my own. I can’t use the sniper rifle anymore. I only have to look into the scope and it’s like he knows, and he’s dragging me to safety. I have to get creative. I have to be honest, I really didn’t like setting myself on fire. That one was… difficult. 

It takes months, and I’m exhausted, but finally. Finally. It’s done. I’m the only me.

Val is there again when I wake up, bottle of water in hand and an anaemic looking sandwich.

“All done.” She sings, beaming at me. I swallow and find that this doesn’t give me the satisfaction I had been expecting. For years all I have done is train for this, and now it’s over and I’m ready… I’m going to miss him.
I’m given my first assignment a weak later – jumping timelines really takes it out of you physically, and it took that long to get my body back to full strength.

I open the envelope. 

It’s him.",ImmortalEcstasy

[WP] NATO decided 100 years ago to build a massive copper wire around the planet that would remain stationary as the planet spun creating unlimited electricity. NATO scientists forgot about resistence. The earth has just officially stopped spinning.,klaffredi,"“Ahh...” the sound of exhalation, with a hint of crude bliss. King NATO was sipping exquisite tea, while perched on the apex of his forefathers’ greatest gift to the world, the Colossal Copper Current.

The Copper Current King was not on top of the cord itself of course. His wealth was used to create a base, heat resistant, on top of the copper construct. It served as the main base of operations for the distributors of infinite energy. Above the base was a far more luxurious flex of his success. A vertical, gold plated, star studded castle stretched far into the sky. It measured dozens of stories high, holding tall with solely the support of cord below.

“Look at it, Teabringer.” he spoke to his servant, Luther, “The sun will soon rise and shine brightly upon my copper kingdom!” King NATO had a tendency to call his servants by the duties they happened to be carrying out around him. This in spite of a previous lawsuit which made it clear that he had to stop addressing his employees as “Servant,” and more preferably refer to them by name.

“I have unified this world with this cord, constructed by my forefathers of NATO, and I now get the chance to harvest the ripe fruits of fame and fortune that they planted for me. ME, Teabringer! Speaking of...” NATO needed to say no more, Luther had already turned towards the tea pot, stationed out of range of King NATO’s nostrils. This setup was to ensure the only scent he would smell was his own filthy rich musk.

Luther, approaching the tea station, stopped a bit in “hesitation.” He turned his wrist up checking his watch, then remembered the date. “Ah, right.” He suddenly dashed to a nearby pillar, and braced himself. NATO’s attention was uncharacteristically drawn towards Luther’s sudden movement. “What are you do-”

There was a loud, deep bellowing snap that came from below them. Luther was jerked backwards, however kept his grasp on the pillar. King NATO was thrown backwards with the recliner-like throne he was sitting on, and skidded towards the far wall, colliding and stopping his sudden momentum.

The floor they were on was tilted diagonally, although was surprisingly in-tact. The lurch left King NATO dazed but, also surprisingly, in-tact. 

“I hope you know how incredible you are,” Luther slid down the slanted surface, landing close to King Nato, “You survived the lurch.” A confused face gave Luther all the information he needed. With a chuckle, he continued, “Incredible. I’m going to explain this to you once. Only once.”

“Your position, however irrelevant your perception of it, is most accurately described as a pawn. A Joker, crowned King in the castle of a failing nation. You were given this title in order to fall at the hands of the decisions of your “forefathers,” as you call them.

“The lurch we just experienced is the Earth, completely stationary thanks to this death grip that’s been labeled ‘Infinite Energy.’” Luther noticed the look of pure bewilderment on NATO’s face, “Listen closely. In the past, many years before the Copper Century, there was no centralized energy source in the world. Humans harvested energy from the sun, the currents, the waves, coal, even uranium that was dubbed as nuclear energy. There was somewhat of a balance between the warring ways to harvest energy, however someone decieded that we needed to centralized, for some reason. The problem was no one could pick between the energy transmitting methods. Many parts of the world required different energy supplies based on their geographical locations. Which would make you think, ‘OK, this is working, let’s not rock the boat,’ right?

“WRONG! Someone, some absolute buffoon, with a charisma level as excessive as the very copper cord that doomed us, convinced the world to toss away their current energy levels and invest all resources to build a copper cord that covered the equator of the Earth. You already know the details about friction and transmitting that energy all over the planet. I know you’re aware of the taxes and profit from such a system. What nobody, NOBODY seemed to be aware of for the past century is that friction would stop the Earth in its tracks, as it does to most notably everything else.

“This isn’t your fault, but it’s your problem now. You ignored the signs as well. Days getting longer, reports of disruptions in our magnetic field. The Earth was dying before and I guess humanity decided how we’ll go. The surface exposed to the sun will get uninhabitably hot, and the same insufferable cold will occur to the other half of the planet. Not to mention overexposure a torrent of other diseases and problems caused by a halted planet. This is a worldwide event, with people looking worldwide for someone to blame. You, NATO, will take the fall for all of this. However fair it might seem to you doesn’t matter. It doesn’t change the fact. It doesn’t change the mistakes made. It doesn’t change anything. And no rotation means no power, which means no way to get down from this tower. Problem after problem will arrive because of one past mistake, although incomprehensible failure is more like it. You are trapped on this tower like the damsel you are, and you will suffer nothing but distress as you try to sort out the catastrophic oversight of your ancestors’ past.”

King NATO was absolutely overloaded with information. All negative, as well as life altering for him. He might as well have gone into shock. It meant little though, as soon there would be mobs to the scale of armies charging the cord, and his “sanctuary.”",BlackNova476
"[WP] New year, new you! Literally: You're a skinwalker, and in order to avoid getting permanently stuck in a host, you have to pick a new one each year. Time to scope out the unlucky target for 2019...",lilyannah,"I liked the scent of Mary’s perfume, so I chose her. The elegant dress and necklace adorned with pearls sat prim upon the figure, while she feasted at her dinner table. After all, saffron was a delicacy and I had a craving for it that night. She was a delight, and it was just as delightful to kill her servants for the young to consume. 

I reveled over the dexterous hands of Peter, so I chose him. He was warped by Black Magic, so I became his wand and book and utterly consumed him. It was not my fault that he was caught, one of my nieces mistook an official for one of her cousins and tried to share a piece of meat. It did not go over well.

I enjoyed the distress of Jangheon, so I chose him. Tragic backstories have always been a favorite of mine, and being heir to the throne was a perk. It quite fun being a fussy prince and killing whomever erred in my directions, but certainly less amusing to get locked in a rice chest and only have a day left to find a new host. 

I sought after the camaraderie of Buhram and his cult, so I chose him. Surprisingly, there were many of us involved in that group of thugs, and it was a break from the normal. A breath of fresh air, one could say.

Years and years of new languages, new cultures, and new hosts have passed. I’m younger than most, but I feel like I have a better experience of the world compared to that one guy–yeah that one dude who’s been trapped in Zuckerberg for the past ten years. Can’t believe he got stuck with that host. 

I mean I barely made it last year, there were way too many politicians to pick from and I just went for the one with the most money. Poor decision on my end. Trump seemed to be a good pick at the time, but apparently running a country is not even remotely as easy as killing people is. Getting out of here would be one of the best choices I’ve made in a while.

I needed someone with less of an outrageous personality, a down-to-earth fellow who can slip under the radar of everyone if he wanted to. A quiet killer.

The clock read 23:50. I had ten minutes to make my decision. A flight elsewhere in the world would take too long. It had to be someone on the White House’s premises.

I pulled out my phone and clicked on the Google spreadsheets app. Addition to the Secret Nu... Appointments... Best Golf Buddies... Bills... Duties... Entire Staff List, there it was. 

Scrolling through, I found few candidates would satiate my desires. Too many of them had come under inquisition in the past year, too many of them had family issues. It was time to step out of the limelight and let the original soul return, and nobody seemed to match.

I lingered on the thought that I could maintain this persona, and quickly dismissed it. I did not want to waste away with this reputation or this hair. 

As I reached the T section, an idea formed. The perfect ruse, the perfect guy. Employed with a solid salary and only needed when called. Close enough to form connections with the FBI and CIA if needed and to access all the records if I wanted to go off the grid. 

I grinned and pressed the button to call Timothy. 

Nobody would expect the butler.

No. No thats a bad idea. She'll think I'm crazy. Who the fuck sees the dates of the last time we meet above peoples heads. The fuck is this some shitty ""shinigami eyes"" knock off.

No point in talking about it. He tried multiple times and the only result was the same, dull look from his therapist who scribbled in her notebook when he spoke to her every week. He was locked into passive slumber, allowing each flickering light of minutes walk by or get off the bus a few stops before him. 

&amp;#x200B;

He looked away from the window and into the bus around him, the dim yellow light of everyone's number throwing a sharp contrast against the cold white lights of the bus. His eyes caught the gaze of the older man in a seat opposite of the aisle. The brim of a weathered hat softening the glow of the yellow haze above his head as it cast down on his dark suit, lost in the dark color of his face and flecks of grey in his beard. John froze. 

&amp;#x200B;

He had to be in his eighties, aged well but clearly a man of a dying generation. The seconds ticked into minutes which ticked into hours and ticked into days... months...…….years. He hadn't seen a number this high in a long time, and the only number that came close was his wife's who was still 20 years out. 

&amp;#x200B;

Bashfulness escaped him, ""Excuse me, sir."" John grumbled, coughing as he spoke for the first time in a while today, ""If you don't mind, how old are you?""

&amp;#x200B;

The man peered under his hat's brim toward him, his expression a clear snuff at this young man's forwardness, ""Why?""

&amp;#x200B;

John leaned forward, ""You.... look so young."" He awkwardly stumbled for a reason, a compliment but then realized how foolish it was. He felt the rush of blood to his cheeks as eyes flicked toward him and the man.

&amp;#x200B;

""I'm 85, turned yesterday.... Thanks, I guess."" The man turned his gaze toward the window, trying to ignore John.

&amp;#x200B;

John cleared his throat, ""Are you.... sure?""

&amp;#x200B;

No answer, and John wasn't surprised. He kept staring, surely appearing crazed and irritating to some on the bus but his eyes were fixed on the number above the man's head. 30 years...?! This man didn't appear to even be able to make it to five years and the numbers on the head's never lied. These 10 years past his wife's numbers, a comfortable 20 years into the future John knew he had with his wife still. 

&amp;#x200B;

The man turned back to him, cold stare met with John's fixed gaze, ""I don't know who you are, but don't talk to me.""

&amp;#x200B;

The bus braked to a stop and the older man rose from his seat and sidled down the aisle toward the front. John called out but he ignored him, and John rose, fumbling with is briefcase and following. As the older man exited the bus, he quickly turned and walked down the street, people surrounding and him mingling into them.

&amp;#x200B;

John had to hurry to keep pace, he hit the concrete hard as he hopped off the bus and he turned to follow, calling out, ""Sir, please.... I just have a few questions!""

&amp;#x200B;

As John was pushing past the small group of people, he heard the scream first. A young woman, falling to her knees and crumpling forward onto the concrete, the puddle she landed in splashing and soaking into her clothes quickly. John was standing above her, looking down and he took a sharp breath.

&amp;#x200B;

The numbers on her head were still at five years but they were... slowing. He'd never seen this before! The lights flickered like a burned bulb, and he watched as the woman let out a breath, hard enough he saw the rippling water around her mouth. Her eyes turned to him, met his gaze and he watched as her pupils dialated but in those last moments, he saw the fear, the anger, the shock, and the pain in her eyes. She was trying to fight whatever it was, but then the lights flicked one last time and froze above her head, pausing mid change of the minute. John turned to look in the direction the man was walking, who now stood opposite of the street from him. 

&amp;#x200B;

The older man smiled as the rain dripped down the brim of his hat, the flecks of grey in his bear burning from existence. John froze, the crowd around him began to press in on him and the woman, some trying to help her and John found himself quickly in the middle of a outburst of voices and movement, but he watched the older man. Next to him stood a young mom and a boy next to her trying to hide under her umbrella. 

&amp;#x200B;

""Stop!"" John yelled.

&amp;#x200B;

That was the day that John learned something new about the universe. 

&amp;#x200B;

Points weren't fixed.... 

&amp;#x200B;

Numbers weren't written in stone......

&gt;Hey Cam, please keep this quiet.

&gt;You know the new guy, Jeff ? There's clearly something wrong with him but I can't quite put my finger on it.

&gt;Not trying to be rude, but have you taken a good look at the guy ? Bulging eyes, never seems to blink. I know it's not enough to fire a guy, which is why I'm mailing your private address - but it is creeping me out. Anything you know about that ?  All I can think of is 'The Shadow over Innsmouth'.

&gt;Then there's the drinks. I don't know where he gets it but every lunch breaks he comes over with what I want to believe to be red wine. And the way he bends his arm whenever he tries to drink gives me nightmares.

&gt;The way he keeps creeping at the edge of my vision isn't helping either.

&gt;What I'm getting at is, can you look into his case unofficially, or at least have him moved away from my cubicle ?

Sorry Laura, out of my field.

"[EU] Instead of finding the deathly hallows, harry potter finds an infinity stone.",sajeno222,"The benches were arrayed in the field in front of the Weasleys’ home. The songs of birds and the laughter of friends filled the air. Ginny emerged from the house. Music began to play, but the whole world seemed to go silent. She looked stunning.

Ron clapped Harry on the back. Hermione beamed at him. In the front row Mrs. Weasley was a bawling mess. Ginny approached and stared deep into Harry’s eyes.

George stood next to them in a magnificent purple robes. His golden replacement ear glittered in the sun. After their vows had been said, he turned to Harry. “Harry Potter, do you take this woman to be your lawfully wedded wife?”

“I do”

“Ginevra Weasley, do you take this man to be your lawfully wedded husband?”

“I do”

“Righteous.” George clapped his hands. Above them a massive explosion sent rose petals gently drifting down. Cheers and applause rose up from the gathered crowd.

Harry moved in to kiss Ginny. When he touched her he could feel that something was wrong. She took a step back. Her loving gaze had turned to one of terror. “Harry-” she started. Her body began to crumble. Before Harry could respond her whole body had turned to dust, drifting away and mixing with the rose petals in the breeze.

“GINNY!” Harry yelled. He grasped at the dust, desperately hoping he would feel her there. He was vaguely aware of people screaming around him, and more bodies turning to dust. Around him, his friends were decomposing. Ron and Hermione ran towards each other, arms outstretched. A moment before their hands could meet they both dissolved into ash, their remains swirling together. Harry stared in horror. He prepared for his own immediate demise.

A split second later a ring of sparks formed at Harry’s feet. Harry felt the lurch in his stomach of free-fall, then felt the jolt of hitting a wooden floor. He found himself splayed on the floor of a well furnished mansion, albeit one that appeared to have recently survived a meteor strike. Surrounding him were ancient artifacts of all sorts. Harry sprung to his feet, wand in hand.

“I am Wong” Harry whirled around to find a plump Asian man sitting cross legged on the ground next to a plush chair. He was wearing what appeared to be monk’s robes “Hogwarts class of ‘95. I completed my post-grad abroad though”

Harry’s heart was pounding in his chest and his eyes were full of tears. “WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH GINNY?!” he choked out. Harry’s wand was leveled at the mans face. He knew that the unforgivable curses would come to him easily.

“Listen to me Potter. We don’t have much time. I am on your side, but I need your help. An alien being named Thanos has acquired five infinity stones. These are the most powerful objects in the universe. With all six, he is unstoppable. They each control an aspect of the universe. Mind, Soul, Time, Reality, Power, and Space. Thanos has made it his mission to acquire these and use them to destroy half of all life in the universe. Are you following?” Harry gaped at this man, completely dumbfounded.

Wong went on. “Thanos believes he has all six stones. But I know the truth. For Eons it was believed that the Soul stone was accounted for. But at some point in its history it was replaced with a twin. A stone of equal power, yet of different form. You should have been master of death. But your powers were pretty lame considering.” Harry was completely lost. The confusion momentarily drowned the pain. He lowered his wand slightly. This stranger knew things that he should have had no way of knowing.

The monk continued to rant, scarcely stopping for breath. “I hear you were only able to summon ghostly impressions of dead people. With all three Deathly Hallows, you should be able to give true life to the dead. I believe you never possessed all three Deathly Hallows. We discovered that you in fact had the Soul stone. We preferred to allow you believe you had mastered death. When you so negligently ditched two of the most powerful items in the multiverse without taking any security precautions, we safely recovered them.” It was only then that Harry noticed the Elder Wand and resurrection stone sitting in a glass case behind Wong. “Thanos is temporarily weak. He possesses the resurrection stone, and thinks it is the soul stone. He already believes himself invincible. If you can steal the resurrection stone from Thanos, you will be the master of death. You should then be able to kill him and restore life to the universe. As the owner of the Cloak of invisibility and the master of the Elder Wand, you should have a chance.”

Harry’s legs gave out. He fell to the floor sobbing. The ramblings of this deranged monk were making very little sense, but they sounded like his only hope. “This will let me save my friends?”

“Haven’t you been paying attention?” Wong snapped.

\*\*\*

Thanos emerged from his hut. A beautiful vista stretched before him. The ache in his soul from his lost Gomora was still still fresh. It would always be fresh. At least now he could rest, knowing that his life’s work was complete. He looked down at his gauntlet, acknowledging the beautiful stones embedded within.

“Expelliarmus!” A voice rang out. His gauntlet flew off. Where a moment before there had been nothing, there was now a scrawny Terran.

\*\*\*

It was shockingly easy. Presumably Thanos should have been alerted to his presence, but the Cloak of Invisibility is powerful. Thanos should have been able to defend himself, but the Elder Wand has never lost a duel. Harry sent a stunning hex at the now disarmed Thanos. He turned his attention to the gauntlet. With a muttered charm the stones dislodged themselves from the gauntlet and began to circle the Elder Wand. They then embedded themselves deep into the wood at each ridge. The stones pulsed in his wand with a dull glow. Clutched in his left hand was the true resurrection stone. About his shoulders hung the great invisibility cloak. Harry was now master of all three Hallows and all six infinity stones. He could see all of the beings that ever lived and ever would live. He was master of the living and the dead. He could feel the pain of all. There was so much pain. The pain would not even stop with death. Harry saw the barren infinity of death awaiting himself and all those he loved. Even the master of the deathly Hallows could not postpone that fate forever. Harry would do what Thanos was too weak to do. Harry would cleanse both the plane of the living and the plane of the dead.

He waved his wand.",TheLeaningTower

Unexpectedly, she is the one who goes down on one knee and asks you to marry her...",9spaceking,"I nervously clear my throat, the lights twinkling around us as we eat. I managed to get a table at our favorite café on what seems to be the busiest day of the year, but it was all worth it: this was the day I first met her, both of us finding shelter from the rain outside here, huddling with our mugs by the heater. Giving me a goofy smile, she had joked about the weather, remarking that it was “raining cats and dogs” outside. I awkwardly replied that it was a good thing I liked cats and dogs, to which she giggled the cutest giggle I had ever heard. For the next few hours, we forgot about the world around us, sipping our drinks and talking about ourselves, our dreams, and how we saw our future. Now, four years later, I see my future sitting in front of me, sipping her drink and looking out the window at the rain. My hands shook slightly around mine, but my face was flushed with heat. The small box pressed against my leg left me anticipating the moment I had planned for months now. Although I spent hours prepping and finding the ring and rehearsing my proposal, knowing it was about to happen filled me with both excitement and fear. However, I knew that this was the perfect moment. Steeling my nerves, I slip my hand into my pocket and take a breath.

“You know,” she smiles, breaking my train of thought, “it rained today 4 years ago.” 

“Yeah, it is! I thought you didn’t remember.” I laugh, mostly to hide my shaky voice. There goes my plan to surprise her with that. That’s okay! It’ll be alright. I can still surprise her with the proposal. It’ll still be perf-

“I’ve been thinking a lot lately, and I know this may be kinda sudden, but I wanted to ask you about something. I don’t know how you’ll feel about it, and I’m sorry if it’s not what you want, but I need to let you know how I feel.” She looks down at her mug, taking a deep breath and letting out a shaky sigh. I’ve never seen her this nervous, and it makes me feel the same. I suddenly rethink my plans, the proposal, everything. Am I rushing things? Is she ready for this? Am I?????

“Is everything okay?” Looking into her eyes, my shaking hand slips into hers, which she has released from her mug. Her other hand is snugly inside her coat pocket, something she only does if she is nervous herself. Our combined nerves make the atmosphere tense, and I release the box in my pocket to cup her hand in mine. “Is something wrong?”

Her eyes meet mine and, to my surprise, seem shocked. “Oh, no! No no no, everything is amazing! You’re amazing, I-“ She cuts off, shaking her head and laughing softly. “I just can’t get the words I want to say out. It’s hard to say, and I don’t want to spring anything on you.”

My nerves are replaced with confusion, followed by shock, as she stands up and kneels down on the ground, pulling out a small box. Giving me the same goofy smile I’ve fallen in love with, she looked up at me.

“Will you make me the happiest woman in the world and marry me?”

I choke up, both relieved and excited at her words. My words come out in a mixed jumble of laughs and sniffling as I hug her tightly. “Of course I’ll marry you, my love.” She hugs me back, the café around us collapsing into a mix of applause and lights as we fall into our own little world. Pulling away, she gently grabs my hand and pulls out the ring.

“Wait wait, one sec.” She looks confused as I pull my hand away to rummage through my pocket. “I have to give you yours, too.” She gasps as I pull out my own box, tears falling from her eyes as she joins in with my laughter.

“Were you... of course you were,” she giggles and wipes away her tears. “I guess we think alike, huh?” She holds my hand and smiles as she slides the ring onto my finger, and tears up again as I slide my ring onto hers.

“I wouldn’t want this any other way,” I laugh and pull her to her feet, bringing her into my arms. Meeting my lips with hers, the same twinkling lights and rainfall that brought us together surround us, and everything melts away.

I've got it.'

Fluffy mule slippers sliding over the linoleum, my wife Irene shuffles for the door and disappears down the hall.  When she comes back, she is clasping a handful of envelopes.  They are all different colours but I know their purpose is all the same.  To wish me happy birthday.

'A telegram from the Queen!  My, isn't she looking good these days?'

She has already ripped open the envelope of the first one.  Turning it around, I see Queen Elizabeth in her patented pose.  She must be nearing her mid forties now.  Her third reign has by far been her best, according to analysts.  

'Here you go.  From Bob, Katrina and family....everyone at The Atherton....The Grimes family...'

'Hmmm,' I grunt.  Every muscle in my body feels as though it's contracting.  I am retreating in to myself.  I look at my watch; an hour to go.  Then I am precisely one hundred and thirty years old.

'I'm going to go and make a start on the sandwiches.  Everyone will be here in about fifteen.  Happy birthday, Ken.' She leaves a kiss on my head.

'Not yet,'  I manage.  When she is gone I pick up the cards from the couch.  At the bottom of the pile is one, left unopened.  An act of serendipity.  Because it was the one I have been waiting for.

My fingers are stiff with arthritis and so I resort to using my teeth to tear at the envelope.  Shaking it until the card is half put, I employ the same method to take it out.

'Kenneth, happy birthday my love.  You'll be fine.  I could tell you not to be scared, but you will be regardless.  When it's all said and done and we're both young again, it will be worth it.  I can't wait to see you again.  All my love Flora.'

I slip it down the side of the arm chair.

Soon the guests are here and a camera crew from the local news.  Not every day a de-aging occurs.  Everyone sits around me and we wait.  It is the quietest party I have ever been a part of.

It occurs to me as it's happening;  will my insides regenerate?  Will my organs by refreshed, arteries cleared, muscle strong?  Or will they be the same ones spun back a century?  When I was 100, I had a kidney transplant.  Irene's left kidney nestles in my abdomen.  Without it, I wouldn't be here for this milestone.  

Something wooshes past my ears.  It grows more defined;  the metallic clank of pennies falling into a money box.

Irene's face is growing blurry.  Like a canvas of paints swished together.  Everything is growing dark.  I think of Flora as everything fades away.

X

'Is it happening?'

Irene turns to the doctor.  He puts two fingers again Ken's neck and looks down at his watch.  Everyone wants for him to surface.

'His pulse is racing.  Something's happening.'

There's a muted cheer but no one wants to make too much noise.  No one wants to be the one to disturb what is happening.

'Ken?'  Irene says.  She can't wait.  She shuffled forwards and outs her hands on his knees.  His eyes are flickering.

'He looks like he's having a seizure,' she mutters.  'Ken?' She barks, snapping her fingers in front of his face.

'Leave him,' the doctor advises.  

When they have waited half an hour, people begin to drift off.  

'Surely he must be almost done?'  Petunia sits down beside her and crosses her legs.  She hands Irene a drink.

'I don't know.  This is all new to me too.'

Irene looks at her husband and sighs.  

'He doesn't look real,' she says softly.  

'How's it going to work, then?  Between you two?'

'We haven't really talked about it.'

'You're seventy next year;  he'll just be hitting puberty.'

'I know, Petunia,' Irene says sharply.  She reaches up and takes Ken's hands.  His fingers are like shards of ice.  Irene places one on her cheek to try and warm it.

'Mrs. Christie,' The doctor chides.  He sits next to Ken and feels for a pulse again.  And again.  And again.  But it's not there.

Tom Dithel leant against the fridge door. 

'Move Tom.' His mother said.

Sarah-Leigh didn't have time to put her face on, and her hair stood at odd angles as if made from bent paperclips. She didn't wait for Tom to move; instead, she gripped the fridge's metal handle and batted him away with one, groaning, swing. 

'This is never going to work.' Tom said. 

'And why is that?' 

'Because of... well... it's just absurd!' 

Tom watched his mother struggle with a Jenga-stack of meat and cheese. She backed out of the fridge and darted to the kitchen counter - only dropping one pack of salami. 

'That's not a reason.' Sarah-Leigh said. 'Grab me a plate.' 

Tom stood on his tip-toes, reached for a shelf and at the moment of plucking the top plate his mum spoke up. 

'Not that one!' 

'I know why th-' Tom started, and paused to his stretch. '-this won't wo-' 

'The one on the end.' Sarah-Leigh interrupted. 

'-won't work.' Tom held a plate that wasn't quite one you would eat off. It was egg-shaped, and more of a platter. Tom thought about telling his mum that she should have asked him to get a platter. The *platter* had a bird, mid-flight, that would absolutely not be covered up by the meat and cheese. The bird, a swallow, would also absolutely not be facing the wrong way. *Birds don't fly upside down Thomas.* 

'Think about it mum,' Tom said and handed over the platter. 'who are you trying to trick?' 

'I'm not tricking anyone.' Sarah-Leigh said straightening up. 

'Adding some extra candles and changing his birth certificate won't help anyone.' 

'We are celebrating his birthday. *As it should be*.' 

A platter worth of food later, and Sarah-Leigh ordered Tom to prepare the surprise. Tom ducked into the kitchen and learned the tedious art of lighting candles. The first candle was half the height of the last, and the chocolate cake was gradually being iced with wax. 

Tom danced the cake into the living room; *one-two, one-two, pause, one-two*. Close and distant family padded the room. Tom continued his careful steps and placed the burning effigy in front of his grandfather. Arthur was ninety-five, but legally he was one-hundred and thirty. He coughed and spluttered, extinguishing one of the candles and adding another layer to the icing. 

Sarah-Leigh swept the room, making eye contact with every family member and then started singing.

*Happy Birthday to you!*

At the end of the song, Arthur blew with a listless breeze. The candles waved hello, and not goodbye. Tom inhaled, feeling a strong urge to help. 

'You've got to blow harder Dad, or everyone will think you've got a lot of girlfriends!' 

A few people laughed out of obligation, but Arther continued blowing. A lisp like sound escaped his pursed lips. The candles continued waving, although it had turned into a flicker. All eyes were on the candles and not Arthur's smoothing complexion. In one, mighty, huff of breath, all of the candles waved farewell to the old man.

[IP] Let me in...,Ink_Savant,"The telltale twin thumps reverberating softly through rough wooden walls woke young James from his sleep. He'd promised himself that he wouldn't drift off again, but it was so hard to stay awake sometimes. He scrambled up and out of his blanket, wiping a line of droop from his chin. His little feet carefully navigated through the sleeping bodies around him. Over mother, father, and his brothers he carefully stepped. They'd never woken during these nighttime visits, but best not to step on someone and test how deep this sleep really was. Lights were safe though.

He clumsily pushed against the light switch, and the bulbs snapped to life with a sharp click. Outside the window, two eyes reflected the light, appearing as twin metallic orange orbs. He flicked on the exterior light, illuminating the shadowy figure. James pressed up against the window, smile plastered across his face, and waved to his friend. The cloaked woman outside raised a hand in response.

She watched him struggle with the stiff old door for a second before descending from her perch on the rail and shouldering the door open. A small puff of powdery white snow rose from where it'd caked up in the frame, descending onto the pair. ""Hello!"" Jame said excitedly, tripping over the raised threshold in his hurry.

She caught him and stood him back up, gently sweeping the snow from his shaggy hair. ""Hello James."" A dry tongue flicked out over her cracked lips as she looked him over. His toes were squirming in the shallow snow, slowly turning white from cold. He was trying hard not to start shivering.

""Did you steal anything tonight?"" James asked. Icy dry wind cut through his sleeping clothes like they weren't even there, but he clenched his fists and smiled tightly. He watched her take one step carefully away from him, strutting like a bird, before gracefully leaping back up onto the old steel railing.

""No,"" she said. ""Not tonight."" She picked at the underside of one black talon. Another breeze went through James, carrying eddies of wispy snow off the balcony. ""How is your father?"" She asked.

""He's good."" James said. ""He said that..."" James paused to think. ""He said that Mr. Wreed was going to give him more things to do at the mine."" He grinned. His father was always talking about wanting more things to do. When he got more work, James sometimes got a treat, like a piece of chocolate. ""Maybe I'll get a chocolate!"" He said.

""That's nice."" She smiled at him, cocking her head. She was fingering one feathered end of her cloak. She saw James gently rocking back and forth, one hand twitching to his back every so often. His eyes were wide and excited, fixed on her. ""Do you have something to show me?"" She asked. Her tongue darted out again, and she smiled.

James nodded vigorously. ""Yep!"" He said, and reached behind his back and grabbed the little doll that was tucked into his waist band. It was a small black bird, and made of a material like felt, with a beak of shiny metal. He held it out to her, beaming proudly. ""I got it!"" He said.

She reached out one hand, and he deposited the small doll into it. She held it up into the light to inspect it. The beak reflected a spot of the weak lamp bulb, and the eyes of the doll, two small glass beads, glimmered orange. ""Well done, James."" She said. Her smile grew as wide as his. ""Did you have much trouble getting it?""

""I almost fell!"" James said proudly. ""But I grabbed a branch and climbed back up.""

""Was it too high for you?"" She asked.

James shook his head. ""I thought it was, but I tried anyway and got it.""

She bobbed her head, handing the little doll back to James. ""Keep that safe, James."" She said, ""It's your token. And well done.""

James shivered involuntarily and clutched the bird tighter. The cold was eating into him, seeping up from his feet and bare hands. ""Will you teach me now?"" He asked.

She nodded to him. ""Of course I will."" She outstretched one slender hand to him. ""Come on.""

James took her hand and was swept off his feet. She cradled him in one arm, apparently without much effort, and turned to face the world. James saw the Factory rising into the sky across the river, spitting thick black smoke into the clear sky, even at this late hour. He wrapped his hands around her neck, clinging tightly as he saw the ground far below.

She patted him on the back once, reassuring. Her smile hadn't dimmed in the slightest, fueled by the pride she felt. The Morrigan would be happy with her new pupil, perhaps even more so at his unusually young age. ""Watch closely."" She whispered to James. ""See if you can figure it out."" She was sure he would.

The woman straightened and a sudden breeze blew out her feathered cloak. The article seemed to grow and unfurl, stretching out into the night air as she stepped daintily from her perch. James held her tight and fought the urge to hide his face from what seemed an inevitable plunge, but he watched despite fear. What he saw, instead of the ground rising swiftly to end a terminal fall, was the branches of the trees whipping past and the world speeding by.

The woman's bare feet seemed to barely touched on any one surface as powerful legs launched them through the top of the small stand of trees. Her cloak grew larger behind them, stretching out until she took one final leap off the highest branch on the tallest tree. Shiny black wings heaved and flapped, carrying the pair up and into the sky, James giggling in exhilaration the whole way.

James felt, under his hands, no longer an old tattered cloak sew with feathers, but rich warm plumage. The hood was gone from his friend's head, replaced by a long mane of chestnut hair, shot through with more feathers, that billowed in the wind. He tightened his grip on her neck, retreating from the freezing air, as he watched the town below vanish into the distance, replaced by a landscape of white dusted evergreens.",tainted_mojo
[IP] Let me in...,Ink_Savant,"One day the boy left his home. He told his parents he was going over to his friend's house, they gave him the usual parting of ""Be safe."" 


As he gets into his coat and closes the door behind him, he feels something is off. He stopped and scanned his surroundings. 


There was no one. 


The evening chill bites his face as he continued down the stairs. The odd sensation hits him again. He would swear the patter of his feet weren't the only sound he heard, but when he stopped again there was complete silence. Off the stairs, he makes his way down the street. Although it has since stopped snowing, the sidewalks are still blanketed in crunchy white snow. As he plants his boots into the frost an echo of footsteps comes from behind him. The startling sound causes him the halt dead in his tracks and whip his head around. 


There was no one. 


He is sure he heard someone following him, but there's nothing. Now that he notices it, there is no sign of any other person on the block. As he looks for any sign of life the ""Vrooom!"" of a passing car nearly scares him out of his boots. He tries to get a look at the driver but they pass him before he could. He feels that the face of any other person would put him at ease right now. He almost wants to head back home and hug his parents and call the whole trip off. The boy gathers himself and continues to his friend's house, shaking his head at how irrational he's being. At his friend's front door he knocks and informs them who it is 


""It's Kevin. Let me in."", but they don't answer. 


He glances behind him, there is still no one, but his friend's parents car is parked outside. They've never been known to not answer when they're in. He knocks again, a little harder and more urgent, he yells his name louder. Looking into the front window he sees it's dark inside, but the black interior looks warmer and more welcoming than the frozen street. He wishes he could be inside the house safe and sound playing Nintendo with Billy, instead of cold and alone outside. Or was he alone? He tries one more desperate knock on the window before turning back home, walking briskly and determined. 



Kevin stares straight ahead, refusing to look behind or around him. Afraid of what he'll see. The sounds he could mark up to his mind playing tricks on him, but Billy and his parents was an odd circumstance that he couldn't make up. The echoing still fills his ears, but he knows if he looks behind him there will be no one. He wants to run back home, but he is afraid whatever is following him will do the same. Now it's not only echoing he hears, but the chilly air is carrying the sound of the wind and there's a whisper on it. A voice with a familiar rasp is haunting the icy breeze. Kevin reaches the stairs and can't help himself from running up the steps. He tries to outrun the echoes and the whispers and the fear. He feels fingers grasping at his coat, it's going to catch him. Just as he feels the final pull, he gets his hand on the doorknob and stumbles inside, slamming the door against the wind. His frightened parents enter and ask him what's happening.

""There was no one."", Kevin tells them. ""There was no one at Billy's.""

Later that night as he lies on his bed lost in thought, he starts to get cold. Getting under the covers fails to bring him any solace. The chill is getting through the blanket, through his pajamas. 
He can feel the air in his lungs and through his bones. He leaves his room and follows the cold to the living room. The door is closed and all the windows, but the wind is being carried from outside. He can hear the whisiper again, this time he hears the raspy voices words clearly. He reaches the closed window and outside he sees the owner of the voice, his cold red eyes staring into the warm house. The familiar voice continues. 


""...Hey, Kev...Let me in..."" 

Kevin's mouth opens with no immediate purpose, he then utters. 


""Mom...brother is back.""",JDSadinger7
[IP] The dragon and the girl,LadyLuna21,Awww. I love it! What a happy family!,LadyLuna21
[IP] The dragon and the girl,LadyLuna21,"""Eldor! Wake up!""

Lucy scrambled up to the momentous rock and skidded to a stop just inches from the nose of the great dragon. She then tapped it above its cavern of a nostril and whispered, ""Boop.""

*Frantic snort.*

""Finally! You're awake. Are we going to go on an adventure today? Or are we just going to lie here and sleep? Will we tra-""

*Growl sounding suspiciously like clearing one's throat.*

""Right. Yeah,"" Lucy said sheepishly.

""But what are we going to do today?""

Eldor slowly drew himself up and Lucy craned her neck in awe. She never got past just how *big* he was. How had it been so recently as her parent's time that he had been a mere pup, whimpering and flapping his stubs of wings?

As he sat upon his rock, Eldor growled in Dragonspeak. Lucy wasn't fluent, but she thought she got the gist of what he said most of the time. ""Food sounds like a good idea. Do you know if we've got enough?""

*Faltering growl.*

""Eldor?""

She rushed to the stream that ran at the edge of the cave.

""Eldor! You ate all of the venison? And the berries? And- even the shrubs? Wow. I can't believe it. Why were you so hungry?""

*Playful growl.*

\*""\*What?"" Now anger was starting to sink in. They would have to hunt today instead of having fun! Even though it was kind of cool to watch Eldor swoop down and snatch an animal from deep in a valley and then rise with a triumphant screech, it was still a chore for Lucy.

Eldor leapt down from his perch and sank down so he was eye-to-eye with Lucy. He quietly asked her a question.

""No, I don't know what day it is today? Why?""

All was silent for a moment except for the dripping of water. Then Eldor gave a short growl.

""It's my birthday? IT'S MY BIRTHDAY? I'M 12?"" Her shouts got louder and louder, and she jumped around in pure joy while the old dragon smiled at her. It wasn't just the fact that it was her birthday. When Lucy was young, Eldor had told her that she could ride him when she was 12. It was a rule that her family and their dragons had adhered to through the generations.

*Barks of happiness.*

At that moment, Lucy's parents finally woke up. ""I guess the birthday girl's gotten her gift?"" her mom asked as she ruffled Lucy's hair.

""Yeah! Can I start training right now?""

""First, how about we go get some breakfast?""

""Fine."" It was the first time Lucy had been disappointed when she was going to eat. She turned to Eldor and said, ""Speaking of food, why *were* you so hungry?""

*Joyful roar.*

""You were making a surprise? Where is it?"" The dragon took flight and bit something hanging at the edge of the cavern. Then he flew across and put the end of something on a hook.

It was a banner, probably meant to say Happy Birthday, but instead had a neat H and a bunch of scribbles.

""It's the best birthday present I've ever gotten,"" tears welling in her eyes while she smiled.

....................

""It's the best birthday present I've ever gotten,"" tears welling in her eyes while she smiled.

It's six years later, and Lucy is eighteen today.

""So what do I do? Just read this book and then I'll know how to train him?"" Lucy asked, with a look toward her new little dragon.

""Pretty much. Although they're a bit evasive on how much these things *poop*,"" added her dad.

""Just like babies.""

""At least those don't breathe fire,"" said Lucy.

Her mom laughed. ""Oh, I don't know. You were pretty feisty. Just like this little guy. I'm sure you remember that dragons are matched up with their owner's element, and you were both fire.""

""But wouldn't all dragons be fire?""

""Didn't you pay attention in Dragon Studies? Some dragons spit water, some sprout plants-""

""And all breathe air.""

""*And some breathe powerful blasts of air,*"" her mom said, jokingly gritting her teeth.

""I'm glad that this guy breathes fire, and that Eldor does as well,"" said Lucy, turning her eyes to her parent's dragon. He had gotten older and was resting more often- but it wasn't like he didn't enjoy a lie-in when Lucy was younger.

*Confused grunt.*

""Oh, we were just saying that you breathe fire like this little guy,"" Lucy said amiably. Eldor's eyes flicked to the younger dragon, who was trying to breathe fire but only succeeded in making a little smoke.

*Incredulous snort.*

""Don't be mean!"" Lucy scolded. ""You weren't born breathing fire!

*Downtrodden grunt.*

""Hey, don't worry, pal. You're still my best friend ever. This guy is a close second. Although,"" and now Lucy felt a little bit sadder, ""I assume he'll soon move up to first-""

*Insulted growl.*

""I know you've still got a lot in you, buddy, but really-""

But Lucy didn't get to finish her thought, because Eldor had risen up into the sky with his wings spread out, giving a mighty roar. He then spewed out a fountain of flames, which the young dragon responded to by puffing out a tiny flame and unsteadily floating above the ground.

""Hey, little guy, you're doing it!"" Lucy cheered.

Eldor swooped down to meet his tiny apprentice and reached out a claw.

""What's he doing?"" asked Lucy nervously, but her parents were smiling.

The little dragon stumbled in the air into the big dragon's claw and relaxed on its side.

""What's *he* doing?""

Then Eldor took flight. They were the little dragon and the big dragon, twirling in circles, roaring with happiness.

""I can't believe it. I can't believe- hey, wait for me!""

Eldor only stopped for a moment on the ground to let Lucy join before continuing his flight.

They were the little dragon, the big dragon, and the girl, twirling in circles, roaring (and shouting) with happiness.",ReadWriteAllNight

First thing I'd focus on is making the characters feel distinct in their dialogue. Right now, they all read as if spoken by the same person.

One way of doing this would be to describe actions before/after their sentence, or perhaps adding some hint as to who is saying it. For example:

&gt; ‘I’m very real just like your parents, and what bagels?’
&gt; 
&gt; ‘The bagels falling out of the sky.’

With a bit of tweaking, we would get:

&gt; ""I'm very real - just like your parents"", Michel cried out. ""And what bagels?""
&gt; 
&gt; Pointing a finger upwards, she replied: ""The bagels falling out of the sky.""

“Tina, there’s nothing on the wall. What are you swatting at?” Sara joked at her roommate, Tina. 

“Spiders, I’m catching the spiders on the wall,” Tina said absentmindedly. 

Sara sat on her low, dorm room bed that evening watching Tina move around the room chasing the spiders and centipedes that only Tina saw in her mind. “I’m starting to think you need to see someone—a professional of some sort,” Sara concluded. 

“I’m fine, I’m always fine, Sara,” Tina murmured, humming as she busily captured each and every spider and put them in her spider jar. The jar was really just a collection of odds and ends, paper clips, buttons, spare change. 

The two girls met a year ago, as assigned roommates and incoming Freshmen at Michigan State University. Not long after the first semester ended, Tina started to hear Sara’s voice in her head everywhere she went. Sara would tell her that she was a God, Zeus, a super hero. Sara would taunt her with mind control, and scream that people were watching her and trying to kill her. Yesterday, Sara even snared that she herself would kill Tina in her sleep. 

“No, you’re not fine. You need to get your head checked, Tina. Seriously, you need to see a doctor, or I don’t think I can take being your room mate for another year,” Sara’s voice quivered as she pleaded with her friend. 

Tina slowly turned to Sara and said, flatly, “I’ll make an appointment at the health center tomorrow if it’ll make you happy.”

A wave of relief washed over Sara. 

“I don’t want to watch you like this anymore,” she said quietly and she laid down in bed, rolled over, and feigned sleep. 

A few hours later, Tina padded across the dark room and gingerly sat on the side of Sara’s dorm bed next to her sleeping form. She leaned over and plucked a paper clip from the spider jar, unbent it into a razor strait piece of metal as she contemplated Sara’s last words to her. *I don’t want to watch you like this anymore.* Her voice had spoken. 

Tina’s breath slowed, and she obeyed the voice. She pushed the paper clip into Sara’s left eye, pinning it closed. Sara shrieked and bolted upright, arms flailing in pain, the other eye flying open. Sara hit the light switch, and her thin screams intensified as she saw her reflection in the mirror with the paper clip impaled in her eye. 

A thin trickle of blood was pooling in the corner of her eye, and tricking down the side of her nose, as she screamed, “What in the actual fuck is wrong with you!” She unbolted the door and scrambled through the doorway.

Tina sat back down on her bed, unfurling another paper clip, hoping she had pleased the voice. ",CitrusKewpie

Muffled weeping.

“Claire, please talk to me.”

Blankets shuffled inside the room. Floorboards squeaked.

I pulled away as Claire opened the door and fixed her bleary red eyes upon me. She had been ugly crying. Seeing her like that made my heart hurt.

“Do you know?” she whispered, leaning her forehead against the doorway. “What you’re asking me to do?”

I swallowed. Did I?

“It’s murder, Mia. If they fix me, make me normal? You’ll be gone.” Another sob escaped from her. “You’re asking me to kill you!”

I rose from the floor and bit my tongue to keep the tears at bay. She was afraid of losing me. Hurting me. God, this was so far beyond my abilities. I wasn’t a psychologist. I wasn’t a therapist. Just a friend. I needed to approach this from her point of view.

Taking her hands in mine, I did my best to smile. “I just want you to be okay. And no matter what happens, whether or not I exist, my love for you is very real. I want you to get help because you are my best friend and I love you.”

Claire’s face crumpled and a few more tears rolled down her face and dripped off her chin. “I don’t want you to go.”

I pulled her into a hug. “I’m not going anywhere. Just please, please promise me you’ll talk to Dr. Hofstetter.”

A heartbeat passed. Then two, then three.

“Okay,” she said, face buried in my hair. More quietly, she asked, “Will you come with me?”

I hugged a little tighter. “Always.”",PineappleCircuit

 ‘She?’ asked Emily surprised.
 
‘yeah she was my childhood dog, passed away when I was eleven.’

‘Oh right, I’m sorry.’

‘So I kept screaming her name, until I screamed myself awake. I than went to get a glass of water and saw my roommate staring out of the window. She just sleepwalks sometimes. She said some random things about bagels falling out of the sky and went back to her bed. It was pretty weird, but I’m just to it because my little brother just to sleepwalk.’

‘I couldn’t live with a roommate like her. You know maybe it’s time to move in with me.’

‘You know we are good friends, and you know that I love you. Besides she doesn’t have really other friends except me, and if I would leave that would kill her. She is actually pretty funny, but she’s just …’

‘Has she ever tried to be you know physical with you with you?’

‘What no she hasn’t even touched me, she says that everybody is gross.’

‘Right.., but after finishing your bachelor you are going to move in with me right?

‘Yea I guess so.’

‘Michel, you guess or you are sure?’

‘After my bachelor I’m going to move in with you.’

The sun was quick to set that evening and Michel had to pay full price for his frikandelbroodjes. He came home to an empty apartment. This was weird because Olivia usually was always home. Just like a dog she just to wait until Michel came home and would be enthusiastic for a fair minute talking to him until the enthusiasm would slowly dissolve and she would find an excuse to stop talking and start watching a tv-series she had already watched a million times. 

Olivia is a psychology major, just like him, same school same everything. Every time she learns a new disorder she thinks she has it. First it was autism than it was anxiety than personality followed by depression. Every time she comes out for a new disorder I tell her to go to therapy and then she tells me she doesn’t need it. A few days ago she and Michel had a intro class to Schizophrenia. Michel spots after a good hour of sitting in his apartment a girl on the balcony. 

‘Oh fuck its Olivia.’ he tells himself.

He runs up to the balcony and drags Olivia inside.

‘It’s cold outside, what the fuck are you doing?’

‘I’m schizophrenic’

‘Oh no not this bullshit again’

‘This time it’s real.’

‘Olivia there are real people who are dealing with Schizophrenia who have actually trouble living because of it and you are not one of them.’

‘But I can proof it.’

Olivia slaps Michel as hard as she can in the face.

‘Michel agh what the fuck you fucking bitch.’

‘You see it went right through your face!’

‘No it did not you did actually hurt me.’

‘You are not real, my parents aren’t real the bagels aren’t real it all makes sense now.’

‘I’m very real just like your parents, and what bagels?’

‘The bagels falling out of the sky.’

‘That was a dream don’t you think? You’re just delusional or maybe actual schizophrenic. You need therapy.’

‘No I don’t want to go therapy. I went as a child and I don’t like other people judging me and maybe they are going to lock me away in some sort of asylum.’

‘Or you go to therapy and try learning to make friends and better your fucking pathetic life or I’m leaving.’

‘…’

‘I’m going to life with Emily.’

Later that night she was found dead hanging with a suicide note on the table.
It read: ‘Dear Michel, I’ve always loved you.’

"[WP] ""Did you ever think about the fact that plants are really explosions of life happening in really slow motion? Here. Let me demonstrate.""",Mockingasp,"There were nice things, I thought, about working at Home Depot. They paid okay, my manager was nice, and I liked getting to be on my feet all day. It definitely beat the conga line of call centers and retail outlets that had preceded it, at least. It was still a job, at the end of the day, but not one that I hated myself for having to go to every morning.

Regardless, watching a homeless man in a trench coat come into the gardening area and attempt to evacuate his bowels onto the potted cactus section made it difficult to focus on the positives.

""We have facilities, sir. *Please.* Don't put me in this position.""

He gave me a smile devoid of teeth, his pants down, holding himself in a full squat with an asshole presumably clenched in determination. He was having visible difficulty making it come out, but I could see him trying, and if I could avoid entering a timeline where I had a scrub a sixty year old man's shit off a concrete floor for an hour I'd do whatever it took to stop him.

""You heard me, didn't you? This is an *explosion*, Dennis. This is the creation of *life itself*. We are going to make magic together.""

""My name is Stan, sir.""

He rolled his eyes.

""That's the lie you've been fed, yes. But I'm going...""

He paused for a moment, farting. 

""...I'm going to show you that something exists *beyond* that. Beyond the formal titles of a one-dimensional society. You can start to smell it, can't you? That smell, that lovely beautiful smell of freedom. The smell of life. The plants, they understand. They know the smell.""

""...Sir, my manager just called the police. You can leave now, if you want, and they probably aren't going to follow you. Can I just -- like, as a person, as a member of whatever cosmic spirit species you think we're both members of -- ask that you don't shit on the table? Please? I know you're nuts, but just, *please don't shit on the table.* They'll make me clean it up. I don't *want* to clean it up.""

He looked at me for a long moment, farting again.

""...I like you, Stan. You get me, sort of. I know that you're angry, but one day you are going to be a bigger person because of this experience. I promise.""

It started to crown.

""Dirty hands, sure. But a soul cleaner than any can know. We first come to know plants through the *roots*, you see...""

He looked me right in the eye as it fell. I sighed.

""...But the logs are where we find true growth.""",teddy_teddy_teddy

You think she's cute.",Mockingasp,"Last night, I completed my last move. An older house. Nothing amazing. Built in 1892. Square, with a wrap-around porch on all four sides, the roof line extending out and held in the air by strained and bowed cedar posts, the house sat alone in the northeast Montana hills, on 125 acres of semi-wooded lands. Lots of issues.

The roof is asphalt shingle, easily twenty years past the time it should have replaced. But before that, it was cedar planks. The siding, while not rotted, needed a good scraping and painting. The foundation is battle worn from more than a century of spring thaws. I’m confident I’ll eventually have to jack this place up if I live long enough. The floors roll like the prairie plains. Years of add-ons hammered on, function over form, add an ugly, dynamic dimension, as if a creature evolved through the growth of mutated limbs rather than through natural selection.

And three ghosts. Known. Verified. Cataloged.

Matthew Larsson. Born 1845 in Sweden. Emigrated to the U.S. in 1869, a farmer who was deeded the land as part of governmental expansion. He lived on the property for 28 years, first in a log cabin, then in the house as the property (corn/cattle) began generating revenue. He never took a wife. Killed in 1902 by Elisa.

Marie Brodeur. Born in 1861 in France. Emigrated to the U.S. in 1865 with her father. No known history of her mother. She worked as a seamstress, staying unmarried her entire life as she was known to have a violent temper. Met Matthew in 1885, and lived with him for 10 years until her death in 1895, three years after the house was built. Killed by Elisa.

Elisa. No known birthdate or birthplace. At least, none she has yet to reveal to any of the paranormal investigators who have studied the property and documented the spirits contained within the boundaries of the building. Elisa, if that is her true name, is a verified unknown.

No one else has lived in the house long enough to be killed. Six months at the most.

The locking of the boundaries is a mystery. Our understanding of temporal/spiritual borderlines has increased significantly over the last two decades: salt lines, painted/carved symbols, hardened calcium lines, event plasma electrical grids, none exist (or have yet to be found) on the property.

The boundary issue has corralled all three spirits to the property, and it has affected the spirits differently. Matthew is confused most the time. He can be witnessed most mornings around 4:17 am walking into the space near the foundation of the original barn, where he swears and rages while hunting for cattle he believes were stolen from him. Marie confines herself almost exclusively to the front room, right side of the house as when faced from out front. She has never explained why to anyone. Some believe it’s the room she was murdered in, though no blood has been recovered (or any physical remains, for that matter) in the room. Others speculate she has created her own boundary to lock out Elisa. Regardless, she is frightened and refuses to leave the room. She is usually visible using a standard variation of the rod technique. By variation, I mean that one must use a standard UV blocking filter to allow the rods of the eyes to detect, from an indistinct angle, Marie.

Elisa, on the other hand, is different and she has full access to the entire length of the property. When she appears, at remarkable and truly random intervals, it is with impressive will. Her corporeal form has a rated 96% consistency, and when focused, Elisa can exude full force on physical objects. This rare consistency is what has allowed her to commit the murders of Matthew and Marie. Both murders were strangulation, at the early hours of the morning. The exact time is unknown, but Matthew, when able to focus, claims it was near the time he usually awoke, and Marie states it was “...long after the dark set, with hints of the sun on the skyline.”

Elisa, in form, appears to be in her early twenties. Dark hair. Wavy. Well combed. The exact color is unknown. None of the three spirits will reveal it, and the rods technique disallows for the determination of color.  Her height is estimated (using IF cameras) at 5’5” to 5’8”. She does not appear to be of indigenous Native American decent, but exhibits characteristics from southeastern Europe.

And Elisa is beautiful.

I became infatuated with the first artist rendition of Elisa I encountered almost 20 years ago, when I left the tech world for a career (and one can hardly call it that) in the paranormal. My wife and I traveled quite a lot because of my consulting work, and we fell into the habit of booking ghost tours at each destination. As the fun of the tours transitions to fascination with the genre, we moved from tourist to hobbyist. We “investigated” the local haunts, and after a series of unexplained events, we cleaned up our information and wrote a book.

At first, we were overrun by the daily deluge of packages, each containing some type of newly gathered evidence, and requests for assistance cataloging these phenomena. Ninety percent of the packages went into the recycling bin within a couple minutes of first examination. But a small package, postmarked from Livingston, Montana, caught my wife’s attention. The drawing of Elisa spoke to my wife, and for no reason she ever articulated, she threw the package into the pile of “to keep.”

Nearly a year passed before I made it into the package with the information on Elisa, Matthew, and Marie. I came across the package, opened it. When I looked at the drawing of Elisa, I stopped thinking for about fifteen minutes, only to be interrupted by my wife dropping a casserole on its way to the oven, and the string of profanity which burst forth.  I rushed upstairs, drawing in hand, and started laughing once I realized she was unharmed, physically. I admit now, not my best moment as a husband.

After a time, we began examining this multiple haunting, researching the history of the area, the stories already printed. We made phone calls to the authors of the package, apologized for the delay in reaching out. No one had been able to live in the house for the last thirty-five years. We booked flights and spent a week on site, and we left, nearly as empty handed as the others who examined the place and the residents.

Life happened over the next couple decades. On one of those thousands of days, I lost my wife to winter roads, a deer and tree. I stopped all investigations. I never drove that road. I couldn’t bear the thought of encountering my wife. I considered suicide, just to be with her, but in our time, we’d investigated too many hauntings created by suicides. Those were never pleasant.

During this period, my thoughts kept returning to Montana and Elisa. A decade later, I opened the Elisa file and taped the drawing, along with an IR photo, to our research board. I ran through the usual routes of study, and I discovered Elisa had been busy in the interim.

After three months of study, I put my house up for sale, and put in an offer on the property with Elisa and the others.  The owners, ready to be done with the property and the notoriety, sold well below market value.

Elisa spent the first night with my in my bedroom, standing still, watching me with unblinking eyes. In the morning hours, I’m not sure exactly when, at a time when sleep paralysis is greatest, I felt her press down on top of me, the weight of her spectral form fastening me to my mattress. She whispered to me words which faded like memories of a dreams. I felt no fear. She was offended at that, I think. She began shaking the bed, and I began to smile. Elisa fled the room with a screech that would leave my ears ringing the remainder of the morning. I sat up as the paralysis left me, and then I laughed. I relived that experience every night for a week. Then Elisa tried a new tactic. She talked to me like a mother berating an errant child.

I was washing the dishes from lunch when I heard a woman clear her throat. I turned and Elisa floated above the small, wooden table, her legs crossed as if mediating.

“Do you,” her words sounding labored, “understand how much pain you cause me?”

I stood there stunned and silent. After years buried in the paranormal world, a ghost talking clearly and concisely, without aid of any mechanical device, was undocumented.

“Do you?” Elisa asked again.

“How,” I asked, “am I hurting you?” Elisa, with effort, closed and opened her eyes.

“I am here,” she said, “and you should not.”

“Not to be thick,” I said, hoping to elicit a reaction, “but that means nothing to me.”

“I told you, already. Our talk. Our first talk. Our every talk. This talk. I told you. You hurt me.” I rolled my eyes and exhaled with exaggeration.

“Not a clue,” I said. I wished I knew some kind of disparaging or derogatory term I could use here, something from her period, but since I still didn’t know anything about Elisa the living person, I was cut off from using all those tools. “Also, I don’t care.”

A glimmer of rage cracked her calm, and I thought I saw her lips quiver. Elisa’s eyelids fluttered, and all the hair on my body hummed. I glanced at my arm to look at the rising hair. Elisa's closed hands around my throat. I coughed and laughed. She screamed. I felt my body hurled, breaking through the wooden screen kitchen door and bouncing off the porch into the backyard. I woke up a day later, hundreds of mosquito bites all over me. I could hear Elisa crying in the kitchen. I stayed in the yard until the crying stopped. Then I walked back in through the broken backdoor and made myself a sandwich. While munching away, I decided it might be best to give her a little space. Just wasn’t sure how, or where I should go from that point. Eventually, we made it work.",TrappedInWood

"[WP] The ghost has quite a grudge against the living. Her horrifying death fuels her undying revenge. She's killed so many, each more grisly than the last. She's completely unstoppable. You think she's cute.",Mockingasp,"The asylum wasn't expensive, but it was difficult to purchase. Enough had died on the property that local and state governments were involved. They wouldn't acknowledge her existence of course, but they would quietly make the process difficult. Title records went missing. Paperwork was held up. Tax liens kept being ""accidentally"" refiled.

But I can be very persuasive. 

Setting up the office was easier. No one had a problem delivering the furniture in the day. Then I just had to wait for the evening in the space I'd prepared. A comfortable couch. A small table. A bottle of wine. Two glasses. 

Her appearance followed all the usual signs. If I hadn't read up on her breathtakingly impressive resume I'd be disappointed. Lights flickering. An old radio in the corner turned itself on. My glass frosted over. 

In retrospect I should have brought a Chardonnay, not a Zinfandel.

She appeared in front of me as the descriptions had said; wearing the tattered inmate smock they'd found her in. Her mouth twisted in rictus her life ended in. Her eyes empty, gore-tinged sockets. Her hair a crazed bird's nest of tangles and matted curls.

I smiled and raised my glass ""Join me, will you?""

She moved in a flash, grabbing me by the throat in a grip of frozen steel and lifting me off the floor. An impressive feat, as I'd have had a full foot in height and eighty pounds on her in life.

A few minutes of that passed. Then I tapped her shoulder. ""You know, I think we'd both be far more comfortable on the couch."" 

She didn't register surprise if she felt it. She *did* register pain in the form of a horrific shriek when she rammed her hand into my gut and the salt inside me burned her flesh. I dropped to the floor as she appeared a few feet away, staring with her empty sockets at the scorched, transparent skin of her hand.

I retrieved and refilled my wine. ""Sorry about that, it's sort of all through me. Are you sure I can't pour you a glass?""

She lunged at me one last time, I assume ready to bear the pain to tear out my heart. She didn't shriek this time. Instead she wailed and her entire form spasmed and flickered as she inadvertently grabbed the cold iron spike lodged in my chest. Then she blinked out and reappeared in the corner. The same spot where they found her body all those decades ago.

""**WHO**"" Her voice was a ragged gasp that scraped across the sudden quiet in the room.

""Who isn't important, my dear. And it changes every dozen years or so. What. What is important. People wondered what for a long time. And tried all manner of..methods to dispose of me."" The festivities seemed over, so I sat back down. ""And what I am is beyond their ability to kill. And, of course, able to help you."" 

""**NO. HELP. NO ONE. HELPED.**""

""Yes, I know. No one helped you. No one kept you safe from them. And now you're here. But there's no one else coming here, is there? No one to punish for leaving you. No one to make suffer as you did for those three days. I think it's time you left this place to find them."" I smiled and leaned forward, finishing my pitch. ""You see, I'm something of a recruiter, my lady. I find talent. And you are one of the most capable recruits I've seen in quite a while. So I'd like to take you on the road. See what you can do on a world tour."" 

She was still, silent. I patted the couch next to me. The second glass was still untouched. ""Why don't we talk about how you can leave this place."" 

I waited, leaving the hook baited for another minute. Then she appeared by my side. I smiled, and we began discussing our work.

Necromancy, you see, isn't about control or domination. It's about trust. Sharing. Cooperation. Mutually beneficial work.

The red was soft, ebbing and flowing, as if it was a liquid that was pooling up and illuminating her every bump and crevasse of that beautiful black vixen. I softly ran my finger to where I knew turned her on, and let the tip slowly sink into her. A bright blue light screamed from her fans, as they kicked to life. Bliss washed over me as the monitors bathed me in their back-light. I love my computer. 

I had played SimCopter, SimCity, and the other games that came bundled with them frequently back in 2000, when they came out as a kid and had loved them senseless. But when they started to make the Sims games that put you in control of a household, having kids, and monitoring incomes of fake humans, the fun sounded like it left their simulation games. Well after the 4th Sims title sold so little copies, they couldn't GIVE it away at $5 a copy, it seemed clear that Simulation games were only as good as the simulation was real. And so the creators of the Sims set out to create a new game, that would bring popularity back to their title. 

They had been working for 14 years without a single peep. And then it was here. Sims 5. Using the AI core that is now standard in most desktops, or as a PCI extension card, the computer was able to realistically think for all of the NPC's as if they were just as real as you, and instead of having the Sims 5 be top down, as its predecessors had been, it was suggested to interface with your Neural Interface. Typically, the iNeurom, by apple, was the easiest to connect for MAC users who wanted to shift their consciousness to their overpriced, underclocked, laptops but to get the fullest out of this game, you needed a Paradygm NatroNeuro with a pretty beefy Artificial Intelligence Processing Unit and of course a GPU with at least 32GB of VRAM. *To Simplify the Tech jargon, If you put really high speed technology into your computer, you could use the chip in your brain to play the games with your thoughts.* 

I clicked no more than 5 times and climbed into bed. I opened the game and closed my eyes. It's a weird feeling, jumping into a computer. The taste of bitter almonds penetrated my mouth, as the computer began rendering my body, Nothing painful happened, but it could never get the taste of air quite right. I had the Sims for about a year and had been simultaneously rebuilding my real life inside of the game, but on my terms. In it, the world really did revolve around me. I could shift the stars in the heavens with a nod of my head. My house was built directly out of my memories, and my parent's old home was where I had decided to play at. All my old friends from highschool had their own characters and every one of them had a personality that was almost identical to theirs. I just had to import my text messages, phone calls, and some memories to the AI and it did the rest. I was 18 again, learning how the world works for myself, and growing up in my small town again. I smiled and walked into my room. It was just like I remembered it, with the mural of Disneyland painted on the wall above my bed, and the biplane kite that we never flew, hanging from the roof like a reminder of my early love of the outdoors. 

I walked out of my room, down the stairs and my family was there. **""I'm off to Justin's""** I warned. Parents nodded and waved, and sister ignored me. It was so real. I hopped into my 2008 Chevy Cobalt that had been flipped in an accident several years ago and drove it to my closest friend's house. I walked into his home, casually ignoring the fact that locks exist, and found him jerking it on the couch. **""GEEZ! Don't you KNOCK?! How did you get in here anyways?!""** the sprite, pixelated from the waist down, screamed at me, as I backed out of the room. **""So sorry, bud. I thought you knew I was coming over.""** I laughed. He checked his clock and blushed. After pulling his pants back on, we walked out to my car, pulled out a couple joints, and lit them, walking down the street and puffing while we talked.  This version of the sims was more of a chance to right some of the wrongs of your real life. I had been using it to relive my life from my memories, and see what kinds of changes that I could have really made. Many of my changes came from knowing the outcome of a certain action, and changing my action, resulting in the same outcome anyways, but every so often, something would budge. Something would change and then a tear would happen between the real world, and this digital one, where I was the god. As we walked, we passed a man, out for a stroll. I smiled and waved, and he turned to face me. **""YOU!""** he screamed, nearly charging towards me. **""Yo- Could you maybe let me hit that? I am having a really rough day. I feel like nothing is under my control in my life.""**

Peering into the darkness, I found a rather gruesome scene. People had bashed their own heads against the walls, someone had torn his own face off. Somehow, I just knew, this was my fault.

I stepped into the observation room, careful to avoid stepping on anything sharp. I grinned as I realized what I'd done to cause this. Making my way out of the prison, I let Apathy loose. A guard charged me, before tripping over his own feet as his brain ceased higher function. I detoured into the armory, grabbing a needler with a silencer, and equipping light body armor. I detoured once more, retrieving my cloak, mask, gloves, and knives.

Do you?

That first day in class when the teacher tests your ability to levitate simple objects.  Showing you how to gyrate your whole body to float a toy or book into your arms.  The squealing excitement at each success.

The dark abyss, gnawing at every failure.

By the end of that day, every kid had managed the trick, the most basic of that which we call magic.  Every kid, of course, except me.

&amp;#x200B;

My parents took me to a doctor, and they diagnosed me as having critically low thaumatic energy.  Said I'd never have the power to even light a faerie wand, much less levitate.  

&amp;#x200B;

I was mocked, of course.  Kids played pranks on me constantly, turning my hair unnatural colors (I once had it stuck as brown for weeks!), summoning frogs into my desk, turning my milk rancid while I was drinking it.  Oh sure, some of the worst offending bullies were punished, but most were not.  

And the bystanders.  The ones who had the power to intervene on my behalf, to defend me?  They laughed instead.  In my eyes, they were the worst of all.

&amp;#x200B;

I learned that no one would defend me.  So I would have to defend myself.  I poured myself into research, spending every free moment with a book in my face.  Arcane and obscure tomes from various magical theorists and arithmancers.   And I studied the mundane.  How did gravity work?  How did light?  What were atoms anyway?   And how did the mundane and the magical intermingle?    

&amp;#x200B;

Most people never get much past a few basic spells, really, when you think about it.  It takes a lot of energy to levitate something when you could usually just bend over and pick it up.  Making your hair as bright blue as it could be, well, that's just as easily accomplished with some hair potion as it is with a complex spell.  And it's easier to just buy an enchanted flying broom than it is to painstakingly craft one and enchant one yourself.  We peak.  We reach a plateau of our abilities, and see no real pressing need to stretch them further.

&amp;#x200B;

Me, I always had to stretch from day one.  I was fourteen when I first, finally, managed to focus enough energy to levitate a feather.  I couldn't be as free and wasteful with my energy as you could.  I had to be methodical.  Precise.  Efficient.  Every erg of power had to be purposeful.

&amp;#x200B;

Like any muscle, the more you use it, the stronger it gets.

&amp;#x200B;

Oh, in terms of raw power, I might now merely be average, if we're truly honest about things.  But I can focus 99.3% of my power through my index finger and apply it to a specific spot.  You, with your wild gyrations, are lucky to get five percent of your energy where you actually want it, the rest just becomes background chaos.  

&amp;#x200B;

And that, my former classmate, is why I am now 75 feet tall, and you are screaming at the top of your lungs while sitting like a bug in the palm of my hands.  Did you even realize you could change your physical size through magic?  It's amazing what you can learn when you actually read the books instead of just making them float around.  Now, you have a choice.  Be quiet and let me finish assembling this little class reunion, or you can become acquainted with a special bit of magic Sir Issac Newton discovered some years back.

Kait shouts as he wakes up from another nightmare. He feels the fear and panic of the dark dream recede, among with another feeling, hopelessness? Longing? A plea? Kait can’t grasp the essence of it.

He groans as the false pain from his nightmare passes and then he sits up in his bed. 
He looks at the antique grandfather clock styled digital timepiece on his wall and see the same time for the 3rd morning in a row. 

“2:00AM again huh?”

His sentence comes out as more of a wince than actual words. His hands were still in a little bit of pain so he quickly checked them and then rubbed his sore wrists. 

*No manacles and chains on them now.*

Kait thinks to himself. He looks to his feet and ankles too.

*That’s good, I’m definitely awake at least.*

As the false pain from his dream bleeds away he wonders to himself for the 3rd time about what it was that he was dreaming about. he is usually a very vivid dreamer and almost never forgets nightmares or dreams this intense.

But he can never seem to recall more than being tired, the chains or being strapped into or onto something cold and being unable to move. 

And the pain of course, that he remembers clearly. The feeling of being drained of his life, his energy and his awareness. It felt like blood leaking painfully from his wrists and ankles, while the rest of his body was paralysed with a dull ache. 

He shakes his head trying to leave behind the last of his fatigue. Silently hoping that the action shakes away the last of his pain too. 

Kait leaves his bed and goes to his balcony to take in the scenery like he has each time he wakes up from this dream. It didn’t help the last two times, but he was willing to try again.

As he approaches the circular large see though section of the wall that served as his western window, it begins to gracefully slide into itself like the aperture of an olden style camera, slowly opening.

The transparent wall finishes it’s precise movements as he arrives, becoming a large open circular hole instead.

He steps outside of his room towards the railing and shivers, partly from the cold and partly from the feeling that he gets from being so high up. As always the sight brings back good memories and brings a smile to his face. 

It is an impressive view. After all, this could be the only place in the entire city that is able to see almost every part of every district. 

His room is the second highest in the whole city and the tower he lives in is the highest building in the city. 
There are only a few buildings that could even try to rival The Great Tower and they are. 
The cities largest power station, The Great Generator. 
The most advanced school and university, The Great Academy. 
The largest scientific research centre and library, The Great Library.  
And the largest government building, The Great Council Chamber. 
Only these four could come close, and each was at least 100 stories shorter than the Tower. 

For around the millionth time Kait felt quietly embarrassed about the names of these landmarks. 

He silently cursed which ever one of his ancestors named them. 

Silly names aside he really did like his room.

*Being the eldest son of the City Lord comes with some impressive privileges too.* 

Kait muses to himself and grins

But his grin fades and he sighs when he thinks about all the troubles it sometimes brings him. 

“Okay, that’s enough brisk air.” 

Kait declares to himself. Trying to motivate himself into doing something productive, like trying to investigate these nightmares again. 

He heads back into his room allowing the wall-window to close behind him. Immediately feeling the warmth of his room now that the cold outside air wasn’t brushing against him anymore. 

He walks to the his room’s control pedestal, right next to his bed. Sighing he adjusts its hight so he can type easily while he is standing up. It is meant to look like a large rectangular podium that he can type and watch videos on, not a short high-tech square footrest. 

His pedestal has been slightly broken since the power went out a few days ago and now it keeps resetting its hight settings. 

Satisfied with his tinkering of its hight, Kait uses it to order himself a coffee and selects the clothes he will wear today from his wardrobe. 

When his room finished delivering the coffee through the opening at the top of his bedside table and his wardrobe had fully shifted his chosen clothes to the front of his wardrobe. He got changed into his academy uniform of dark blue and black long sleeved shirt and navy blue pants. He wouldn’t need a jacket today. Then he began his investigation. 

First of all, wrote down all the odd things that have happened within the past week. 
 
1. Painful nightmares.

2. Pedestal slightly broken.

3. Earthquake. 

4. Power outage. 

5. The suspicious deaths of 2 council members.

6. Father being much busier than usual.

7. ~~Step-siblings are jerks~~ never mind that’s pretty normal. 

8. Increased amount of threats from various extremest groups within the city. 

*Still, none of these happened on the day that my nightmares began though.* 

Kait thinks to himself.

*Father has been busy since the earthquake, which broke a few things around the city. That makes sense. 
The earthquake probably caused the power outage, emergency power worked fine and the city was only out of power for a few seconds. The outage was fixed in a day. 
And there has always been someone or another angry with the way things work writing threats to anyone they can get a message to. 
My pedestal probably broke in the power outage. Council member deaths are strange and I will have to look into things when I can.*

Kait didn’t think he was any closer to fining the cause than he was yesterday. And he certainly wasn’t going to tell his father about the nightmares unless he absolutely had to.Kait didn’t want to burden him with it and, more importantly one of his step-siblings would find out and would try to use it to their advantage. That could be dangerous. Especially if it was his younger half brother Aron. 

Aron was only one year younger than Kait but the twenty year old seemed to hate Kait with a hatred that had the essence of a hatred that has been nursed for over a century. 

*Father hasn’t named his heir yet, Aron hopes it is himself of one of his full siblings. I can’t hold that against him though, if I wasn’t born first I would probably try to be named the heir.*

Kait thinks to himself.

*Doesn’t matter, Aron is deluded. Even if I somehow don’t become the heir Aron isn’t likely to be a proper candidate, Diana would be next. Aron’s mental strength is lacking, too vulnerable to attacks. The Academy’s classes proved that. I am much stronger in my mentality. An inherited trait, father says. Aron couldn’t resist an attack from a fly. Diana is stronger than Aron though, smarter too.*

“Wait! A mental attack! How could I be such an idiot?” 

Kait nearly shouts to himself. He nearly doesn’t believe it to be possible, the only people he knew stronger than himself was his mother and father. But his mother was dead. And his father was too far to be able to be able to send something this strong to him, even if he had a reason too. 

Then euphoria from the revelation fades.

“No, that’s not it, the emotion conveyed doesn’t feel malicious...It feels frightened.”

 Kait realised to himself 

“A call for help... everyday at 2:00AM the day after the power came back online. Frightening images and large amounts of pain. Sent by someone very strong” 

Kait was forming a plan, the information held in his nightmare that has been waking him up for the past 3 days would be crucial in understanding why he was on the receiving end of these nightmares. 







I’ll continue this later if someone want me to, it’s actually almost 2:00am here and things are getting too meta.  

Also I’m just sleepy. ",PagliacciGrim

It's odd, knowing you're about to die. And I am alright with it now, and I'm not making an edgy joke. Because it means I won't be alone anymore with a robot. ""A robot?"" you ask. And I'd not believe it either, but after recently, it seems most probable. 


My partner and I, we have a code phrase and response to that phrase of sorts. It was a joke, saying we would use it if one of us is replaced with a robot or something along those lines. He seemed to be acting a bit... Different. 


For example, when we wake up, we usually do a little dorky ritual of ours. We give each other ""artist energy,"" which if such stuff was real it would be so that we stay inspired and productive as we work on our projects. One morning, he didn't do that with me. Bad mood I thought then. However, when he didn't do it again the next day nor the other, I was confused.


Also, he so happens to have lots of chronic pain, and troubles sleeping. Past couple weeks, no issues. He's had good days, but not weeks. 


As he was working on his latest project one morning, I was worried, so I uttered our phrase.


""Hey, wave at me real quick...""


If it were him, he would have flipped me off and waved his hand sloppily, keeping his eyes to his work. Instead, he looked up, smiled, and waved like a normal person. 


I don't know what happened to my real lover, but I sure do know the ""person"" sleeping next to me isn't him for sure... Maybe it's a massive elaborate prank... He does have a great poker face after all... I mean, robots like this don't exist, right? 


I think I need to leave. I think I hear a hard drive ticking right next to me. 


Or maybe I need to sleep. One more night. I'll ask him tomorrow. Maybe he finally breaks. 


Or maybe I'll never see him again. After all, his eyes turned red. 


Hopefully I am about to see the real him. 


Maybe I won't feel lost after I am snapped.


His hands are around my neck.


I think I will see him soon. ",emohipsterhippie

Doctor's face went pale. I impulsively left the clinic, running frantically to public library 3 blocks down. The library was my safe haven, my happy place. When there was too much of that voice, I'd find comfort in books. Thinking of all the possibilities, a comforting thought popped up, may be I'm not the only one, there are others too. But that is just one possiblility the other is far more horrific, that the doctor had something to do with that voice in my head, but what could that possibly be. Later in the evening, when I was strolling back to home, I felt something in my pocket; The pills. A shiver of cold ran down my spine. Just blocking every thought I opened the door and I say my father. It's been ages since my folks visited me. I wanted to hug him but something in me was stopping me, I wanted to smile, to tell him It was good having him but couldn't. We just stood in silence looking at each other and in a blink of eye he was gone, maybe I was put under some sedative but the image was too strong to be characterized as an illusion. Rest if day went normal, but I couldn't concentrate on anything except the pills, I should take them what more harm can it cause. I needed someone; to at least hear what I am going through but no one I knew would take it serious. ""It's all in your head"" of course IT IS AND THAT'S THE PROBLEM. They all thought I am making it up but the feeling that someone knows, and will probably understand was somewhat soothing. I will visit that doctor again. That night, the voice was really quite but at 4am, I jolted upwards from what seemed a horrendous nightmare. It was almost like some entity was physically present. All I could think of is being coerced to do something but What? After that there were whispers, then muffled cries and it all soon turned to screams. I already had consumed sleeping pills, antidepressants but this time they weren't dying out. 
I don't recall anything but waking up in OT and the only face that came into my view was of That doctor's. I couldn't move or feel anything and the voice was silent. I continued swaying in and out amd it seemed like a lucid dream. I'd hear bits and pieces of surrounding but couldn't separate the reality from fiction. The voice in my head continued reverbrating a phrase ""He has always been one of us"". I was too drowsy to actually register what they meant. After what seemed like eon I regained my senses I found myself in a familiarly unfamiliar place. I was still unable to move, not because of the accident but because I was tied to the bed. The doctor came in but this time their was something different. ""You'll get answers"" he said. With a tilt of head, I motioned for him to continue, not that he noticed it of course. His eyes were focused on the fireplace, ""you see, humans are not the only intelligent inhabitants of this planet there are numerous more, but their world is quite parallel to what you have. The concepts of time and space are redefined there. No, you aren't one of them. Your ancestors were chief of the tribe whose sole duty was to hunt them down and they were pretty successful only that this too much interaction with their race left them a gift; a curse. Ability to hear the voices you hear. Our minds are too feeble to get control of that so we try to stop these voices. I have been here since a long time identifying such individuals and curing them. They all just get rid of the voices and you were the only one that was skeptical about pills. I assume you lost them so I'll give you more"" as he reached out to a cupboard. ""What if I want to control it?"" I inquired in a croaking voice.


Couldn't complete it due to semester exams.

"[WP] You stare at the pills in your hand. The doctor taps his foot impatiently. ""These will really cure me of hearing that voice?"" you ask. The doctor rolls his eyes. ""Yes, you'll never hear her again."" You level your gaze on the doctor. ""I never told anyone the voice was female...""",SlowChurch,"""No, no of course not!"" The Dr smiled warmly, ""silly of me, I just assumed.""

He shook a few of the pale blue pills into his hand. ""Now these are just your standard first line treatment for schizophrenia. Should hush those voices right up and put paid to any nasty hallucinations too."" 

""I haven't had any, and I'm just hearing this one voice. Is that normal?""
My voice was steady but at the mention of possible hallucinations my heart had started to race. I have a terribly active imagination. Not to boast, but I'd bet my hallucinations would scare the shit out of your hallucinations. So I'm really relieved I've not had any. Yet.

""Perfectly normal, I've seen several patients like you and trust me, this treatment is very effective if taken correctly."" The Dr smiled again. He had a fatherly way about him. The sort of family Dr you grow up with, pillar of the community type. Someone you can trust.

'Are you sure about that?'

She was back. The sultry, sarcastic tormentor. I had wondered when she'd make an appearance. She'd been mercifully silent up til now. 

A few seconds had passed since the doctor last spoke, he stared at me expectantly. 

""Well thank you doctor, how often should I take them?"" I accepted the pill bottle and checked the label but could not read his scrawl. Do they all have a med school semester where they're taught how to write like chimpanzees?

She snorted at this thought. I'll give her that, she's a pain but she's got a sense of humour.

""You can take your first dose now, it's 2 pills. Down the hatch and you'll be better in no time!""
I wasn't expecting this, I feel I should know more about them before I start chucking them down my neck.
The doctor seemed to notice my hesitation, his beaming smile flickered for a second.
""There's some water for you on the side there."" 

'Have you wondered', her voice asked, slinking into my head, 'why a doctor is dispensing his own drugs, shouldn't he have given you a prescription to fill?' 

Damn. She was right. I lower the glass of water from my lips.

Something had changed. The doctor was suddenly uncomfortable, his eyes darting around the room.

'Maybe its not the best idea to take drugs to silence me. You don't seem very good at making decisons on your own.' 

Ding ding, she was dead right again. 

I can't believe I was about to take them there and then. The two pills were still in my hand. I dropped them.

""Please, please Sarah. Just let me take them."" The doc's voice was pleading, his eyes were filling with tears.

'No', it's her voice but this time it came out of my mouth.

I regain control. 

""What do you mean, let **you** take them?"" I gritted my teeth and managed to spit the words out, but I could feel her trying to wrestle back control of my mouth. 

He was sobbing. It was hard to look at, he had seemed so composed just a few seconds ago.

""You were always my ally. Ever since I was a child you were there, by my side."" 
As he said this I could see him at four years old. We were playing hide and seek. He was calling my name and I didn't decide to appear until the very last second, when he was crying the way he is now. Desperately, beyond all hope. Hide and seek was a very unfair game to choose, I had the indisputable advantage.

""I don't want you to leave, I really don't but when the voice in your head starts hearing voices of their own, surely that's not right?"" 

'He doesn't want you to have autonomy. Typical man.' She seethed.

""I'm scared Sarah. It's not like it was before. I think ... I think I need help"".

""But, I don't understand Richard. Nothing you're saying is making sense."" My head has started to pound. She's banging mercilessly on the door, insistent to be let out.

""You never remember anything. We've been through this so many times before"", he sighed.

He's wrong, as he says this I hear him say iterations of these same resigned words. I see my hands overflowing with blue pills. I am capable of remembering, it just takes a while to get things straight. 

'If you let me talk to him', she whispers, 'I can make him change his mind. He created you but you created me. Surely that proves you have surpassed being a mere figment of his imagination?'

I'm at a loss. She's not wrong but that doesn't change that my best friend is on his knees in front of me and I don't know how to help him.

I want to help him.

I pick the bottle back up off the floor.

I'm sorry, if I do this I'm pretty sure we will both cease to exisit.

'I know.' Her voice is different now, kinder and almost gentle. 
'Just so you know, we're on the same side really.'

I'm not sure about that, you're always coming up with some snide comment to confuse or torture me.

'Well,' she smirks, 'perhaps you just need to get used to being self aware.'






She's not some otherworldy voice. 


She's just ... me.


But I am just Richard and he is suffering so much. Now I look closer I can see this doctor's office is run down beyond repair. Of course, he lost his practice years ago, another thing I'd forgotten. A closer look at the bottle shows the prescription was made out to Richard Shanks. 

That's me too. That's all of us.

I take two pills and feel the weight of consciousness be lifted from me.


~~~~


I feel like I made her commit suicide. The guilt is sickening, she was the only person who was always there for me and I forced her to leave. I keep almost seeing her again, a dart of a shadow just out of sight. Then I look closer and there's nothing, just the absence of her.

I'm glad to be getting well but the cost seems so high. Maybe I'll call Jim next week and ask him if I can do some of that hospital porter work he mentioned. Good man Jim, all my other friends are long gone but at least one friend (and a non-imaginary one at that) from the medical community didn't shun me after that horrible episode. And he was so kind to get me that refferall to the private mental health specialist as well. 

That reminds me, I should really take today's dose now before I forget.

'No need, you took them this morning.'

Did I? Did I really ...

""Come on. We've all shown ours."", said Bernard. ""You promised. *You're* the one who wanted to do this in the first place.""

Elroy didn't know how to react, or why the light blue figure shown on the display didn't seem as hideous as it should. He paused for a moment longer, his only sounds being heavy breathing. 

""If you're embarrased"", said William as he filed his nails, ""just remember the hairline I showed not two minutes ago. I sure will: especially at night.""

Elroy began to speak, but he really did not know what words to use. Usually, this would be chalked up to a glitch or a poorly done scan, but this felt real. The picture felt real. It felt familiar.

""Give it here"", said Kathleen, as she reached for the Solid Light Screen, but Elroy swatted her hand away with an aggression that shocked everyone. 

""Wait. Just one moment"" he said in a stilted-yet-commanding tone. He was starting to remember things. Things he had not remembered for years. As the seconds went by, Elroy was overwhelmed by a sense of horrific nostalgia. He *had* seen something like that picture before. He'd seen many of them. Perhaps, even talked with them. Family.

But that wasn't Elroy's family. He had another one. His father was a columnist, his mother a butcher. They had lived together until Elroy decided to move town for a change of scenery. That was his real family, right?

But as the memories came flooding in, he realized that he knew more about this new, rough-skinned, sharp-toothed family. They felt so much more *real*. He could remember being respected; being honored; being chosen. Chosen for what? Elroy started getting strange tingles up and down his upper arms and began squirming in his seat. His shirt's auto-comfort functions were working at full capacity.

""Hey. Elroy. Are you okay?"", said William. ""Hey. If you're really not okay with showing, we'll just take a break. ""I'll make some snacks. The hydrator's done with the eggs, right?"" 

Elroy relapsed into ignoring those around him. Then he remembered a name: Ewlo-x. More names. Jenu-x, his father. Mqin-x, his mother. Pcer-x, his late brother. Their porous, crustacean-like faces were more comforting than anything he had experienced since...since what?

Kathleen spoke with a worried tone. ""Hey, Elroy. You should probably lay down. You're turning pale...no...blue?""
 
Ewlo-x didn't move. The memories kept coming. He had been selected not only for an important position, but for an important mission. He had been commended for his 'superior predatory skills'. He had slaughtered most of the competition, with the others forfeiting out of fear. 

""Elroy, you need to listen to me. You're skin's doing wierd things right now. It's seriously starting to look cerami-oh my god Elroy, are you on something? Your pupils are massive, dude.""

The clan elder had told Ewlo-x that he would need to look and act human for the plan to work. It would be deep cover: so deep even he wouldn't be aware until the very end. Ewlo-x stopped trying to find the change that was happening to his body. It felt right. It felt natural. 

""Will, Elroy needs help right now! Call someone!""

All the curves of his face had been smoothed and pores the size of interface buttons began to emerge. Ewlo-x was in pure euphoria as the spikes pierced through the flesh on the back of his hands. 

""We need to go! *Now*!"", said Bernard. ""We can't leve him here! He needs our help! He's in pain!"", cried William.

Ewlo-x's breathing became horse and the final phase of his transformation had begun. His human teeth were forced out by longer, pointier ones and blood started dripping down them onto the bottom of his mouth.

""I remember"", Ewlo spoke in his native tongue.

Then the feast began.",Cerb-r-us

Sure, people will say they are fair. To suggest otherwise tantamount to class warfare and borderline offensive. But as long as you come from a good house and have a clean record, you'll receive the benefit of every doubt.

The history of my own lineage was not strong, so I had a vague hope that an ancestry test would uncover something fortunate. I didn't need to be as prestigious as an Adam. Just something to make my scores a bit more believable. I knew my performance on the aptitude tests was incredible. The testers would rather believe the test itself was flawed, not that a title-less nobody outranks most nobles.

Everyone on the ship can trace their ancestry to just one or two classes. The progenitors, or original crew, were divided into several classes that served specialized roles. Since the beginning, people would rarely interact with, let alone marry, individuals outside of their class. And generally, the oldest classes were more prestigious and more capable than ones who weren't awoken from stasis until relatively recently. But there were a few exceptions, where a younger class satisfied a more important role than an older one.

So I was disturbed to learn that I had no human relatives. Specifically, the report said that it could not demonstrate a relationship between me and any other human on the ship. That shouldn't be possible unless I myself was a seed passenger awoken from stasis. But I feel like I would have remembered that if it were the case.

After seeing the results I spent nearly a hundred days studying. I lost count of how many practice tests I took and retook until I was acing the material. I was dreaming of orbital mechanics from days of practicing them. Yet when I took the aptitudes for real, it managed to twist the practice material in unexpected ways. Heaven beyond, I always practiced using my personal computer in the privacy of my apartment. There's no way the proctors could have anticipated my academic weaknesses.

I couldn't bear to study after that final, crushing failure. For the moment I was resigned, even after the waiting period completed and I was eligible to retake the tests, if I so chose. Nearly a year passed before I could convince myself to give it one more go. I found the testing facility and presented my identification. But when explained my intentions to take the aptitude test, I was given a simple reply: No.

Furiously, I asked what would have happened if I was an Adam. I demanded to know just how forgiving the tests where to everyone else. Everyone with a real lineage. She told me I would have passed. The audacity would have thrown me into a rage if she didn't continue.

I was never taking the same test as anyone else. I was a second generation Zyle, a class with no public record. A class that was, in the distant past, carefully curated for incredible intellect and relentless persistence. Too valuable to release from stasis until such abilities were needed.

But while the class was expected to yield the best and brightest, not all Zyles were expected to pass muster. I had already given up and thus, my halfhearted attempt to return notwithstanding, I was permanently cut off from that path to greatness.",the_understater

She was looked after only by her father and a succession of short lived nannies. Her mother had died of blood loss shortly after childbirth, her father had told her when she asked one evening. When she was a child, she had fallen very ill. She had problems eating and couldn't hold food down. Her father had taken her to this special clinic in Eastern Europe, and as a result she had been given a special prescription which was delivered to her monthly, along with instructions to take iron pills to remedy a blood deficiency.

A few years ago, she had a boyfriend, who was sceptical about medicine and at his instigation she'd stopped taking the prescription. Her relationship had ended a few nights later when she gained consciousness to find herself clawing him with her nails and biting him; she'd never had a relationship or failed to take her prescription since then.

[WP] We can’t run from it. We can only walk away and pray it does not notice us.,archer1359,"My mom always chided me for the slowness of my pace when I was a kid.

'You're never in a hurry, Lucy.  No no no.  Always at your own pace.  And your own pace always makes us late!'

I just sort of floated through the world on slow feet.  It wasn't by choice; in the same way some people have a bursting giggle, or a slow shucking  chuckle that builds and builds and makes other people laugh more than the joke, I had a slow walk.  I could quicken my pace physically.  There was no issue with my muscles or any other part of my legs.  But if I did it felt uncomfortable.  I began to feel although I was pushing through treacle.

'Goodnight Luce!'

I waved Kevin off as I turned to lock up the doors of Hot Coffee.  We'd both taken up the later shift on New Year's Eve so that we could avoid the early on New Year's Day.  Even though some of the night was gone, it was still only seven.  I could head to the bar, down a few shots and be all caught up with my friends in no time.

I wiggled the keys until the teeth caught in the lock.  Put all my weight behind turning it.  I won't that fight, as I always did; the lock ground shut and I wrestled the key back out.

Most other shops had already closed.  The strip of shops was a series of dark windows, my reflection catching on all of them.  Multiple versions of me pulled up the zipper on her coat and dropped her keys into her handbag, before starting to walk in the direction of the main high street. 

A whistle.  Slow and unrelenting.  The sound of a damaged animal.  I stopped and looked around.  Kevin had offered to walk me there before going home, but I'd politely declined his offer.  I liked to walk by myself.  An overhang from my mother's constant nagging.

As soon as I set off again, I heard it again.  It sounded closer.  Pitch raised.  A growing frenzy wanting my attention.

And so we carried on this way.  All the way got he outskirts of the high street, where people were already drunkenly stumbling from pub to club, burger joint to wine bar.  

'Lucy!'

Sofia, her heels in one hand, the other holding up the hem of her impractically long dress, came running full pelt towards me.  I giggled at the sight of this sparkly monster about to ambush me.

'Soph, slow down, you're gonna do yourself-'

The whistle tickled my ear.  Then it hissed right past and I saw it.  I couldn't describe the form right now if you asked me.  It had a shape but every time I try and think of it, it fizzles out of my head.  But it came for her.  As fast as she moved, it moved.

My joy turned to terror.

'Sofia, slow down!""

Once he, her...*it*, whatever it was, had caught up with her, it stopped.  There was no blood, no tearing or chewing.  Sofia, my best friend since the first day of High School, began to blur.  Her poker straight chestnut hair melted into her ten sweater.  Her bright blue eyes cooled down.  The glittery fishtail of her dress grew burnished.

'No!'

'What the fuck, man?'

A small group of men, trekking from one club to another, had seen the whole thing.  As I sobbed, my stomach swirling, one began to jog over to me.

And *it* began to move.  Again.  It swished at the same pace until the man stopped a few feet from me.  He'd heard it to.  The whistle.   This thing, this it, used that pause to keep going.  It rode the coat tail of the man's energy until it reached my would-be hero.  Before he could resist, he faded away too.

Just like Soph.

'Run.'

I know it's face was horrendous, but it is so superfluous in my mind now that I cannot catch a full rendering to describe.  It is nightmares and death and decay.  Foul.

'Run, Lucy.  Bet you want to run right now, don't you?'

'Give me back Soph, please...'

'Run.'

'No,' I heaved.  My feet started to move in their ever slow dream pace.  My chest was tight and I felt sick, sick at the thought of my beautiful friend.

I walked slow, slow as I always did right past him.",wharmpess90

[WP] We can’t run from it. We can only walk away and pray it does not notice us.,archer1359,"I saw the doors of the asylum directly in front of us, the corridor deeper into the place behind us.  Between us and the door stood a being that I can only describe as inhuman.  Its skin hung off its face and body in drapes, its skin paper thin and cracking.  Its bones stuck out at odd angles, its back hunched to form a spine so gaunt that it looked as if there were spikes protruding from its back.  It shuffled across the floor, moving slowly.  

My partner nudged me, putting a finger to their lips.  They leaned over to my ear, breathing *We need to move.  We can't run from it.  We can only walk away and pray it does not notice us.  We have to go back through the asylum.*

I looked at my partner, panicked.  

*But if we go back who knows where we'll end up.  We can't risk it.*

*And we can't kill it either, because it can't be.  So what ideas do you have?*

To tell the truth I had nothing.  I put one foot behind me, intending to back away while watching the thing.  My foot crunched under the peeling paint that had fallen from the ceiling, and the creature in front of us twitched, but didn't notice us yet.  My partner edged back beside me, looking over their shoulder every so often to check there was nothing behind us that was going to jump out.  As we got farther away from the creature, it didn't notice the sound of our feet so  much- that was, until an old cot caught my foot and I stumbled, the metal scraping across the concrete.  

The creature instantly whipped its head around, breaking into a sprint straight towards my partner and I.

*RUN.* They breathed, grabbing my hand and spinning me around, hurtling us into the darkness of the asylum.  We could hear the creature behind us, somehow graceful on its feet.  

It was closing in fast, it was clear we couldn't outrun it for much longer.  We needed a place to hide.  But my partner stopped in their tracks, pushing me forward and yelled.

*Keep going, I'll hold it off!  Stay safe.*

As I heard tearing ripping sound behind me, I sprinted into the dark.",mack_lynn

You ascend to Heaven to meet God, and are surprised to discover that He looks just like them.",bandastalo,"Everything was white. Everything was silent. Everything was peaceful. 

""I don't understand."" I muttered under my breath. It seemed but a moment ago that I had been drowning in a sea of those damn hardware appliances become sentient. And yet now all I could remember was that hot, searing pain which ran down along my back, shoulder-blade to hipbone.

...

I stood there a while, getting my bearings. What seemed to be white before I could now make out to be a glistening metallic tone. Curious. And a gate, almost geometric in design, stood erect on the far side of the space. Very curious.

Just as I rose to investigate, the gate squeaked open slowly, admitting a silhouetted figure. The figure stepped into the light.

My hand shot down to my hip, searching for my blaster. It was a trap. Somehow they had got me into this goddamn tin box of a room. How exactly, didn't matter right now. All that mattered was that I contact my team for back-up and get out of here alive. But... my blaster wasn't there. They must've swiped it off me the damn circuit boards.

Amidst my panic the figure began to speak. It was a glistening model of mechanical perfection, a man of iron. I had never seen one so flawless. It disgusted me. ""Welcome."" it spoke, in its robotic intonation. It drew nearer as I neglected to respond, placing a hand on my shoulder in a vice-like grip. ""Just do it already."" I spat out. If this was where it ended, I wasn't heading to a shameful end.

...

The AI reared its hand back. I'd seen what they'd done to those they got their hands on before. I wasn't about to let them turn me into the human equivalent of a Jackson Pollock painting just yet. I looked it dead in the eyes and let out a feral cry which told the story of an indignant man who refused to let those he loved come to harm. The story of a failure. But not this time. I gripped the arm outstretched toward me, and yanked it away with surprising ease.

. . . 

I think I just about ground my teeth to powder in those moments I spent gripping its arm. If you've ever tried to squish a pop can with one hand, amplify that same effort by about five times and then fill that can with liquid. And yet soon enough a satisfying pop heralded the river of oily blood-like substance that soon ran down its arm. ""Well, that wasn't very kind. Small wonder they let you in here."" it said in a distasteful tone.

""Well, never mind that. I suppose you didn't hear me over all that flummoxing about you were doing, eh?""

As it spoke, another tell-tale *pop* filled the air and I looked back over to the damaged arm of the A.I.

. . . Except. It was no longer damaged. And not only had it mended itself, there was no mark of the damage I had inflicted. I felt lightheaded. ""W-w-what is going on?"" I sputtered out amidst my confusion. I had lost my stony facade at this point, as you can imagine.

""That's better. My name is '\^@!($\*', or you may know me as, ""Allah"", ""God"", ""Zeus"", you get the point. Now I'm sure you've been wondering exactly where you are. So allow me to officially welcome you, to 'The Afterlife.'""

The sound of her voice sent shivers all across my skin.  It was like hearing the wind blown through fine crystal, the feel of sea-spray on a summer night.

""Hello Airlia. You haven't changed.""

""I know Charles.""  She smiled up from the water hands gripping the gunwale of my dingy. 

""Some things, like the sea, are nearly eternal.""

The gleam of the moonlight shimmered across the crown of her head.   The slick of lustrous blond hair a frozen waterfall down her back.  Her eyes were a luminous blue.  Like looking at the wake of an India-man in the Araby Sea.

""You won't ever die?""

""That's not what I said Charles.""  Playful disapproval in her voice. 

She pulls herself along from the bow, past the rowlock and along side where I sat on the stern-thwart. 

That makes me happy and sad.""  I feel the emotion as a deeper ache in front of the curl of my spine and below my drooping shoulders.

""Why would you be happy Charles?""

""Because a beauty such as yours should never be lost.  If I could, I would keep it forever.""

""Like all the other treasures you have had in your life?""

""No! Like something truly precious! Not to be frittered away like Spanish silver or eaten like island spice""

She cocked her head a bit the tiniest hint of smile showing in the shadows of her silhouette.  

""And why should you be sad?""

""Because I have changed.  I have grown old.  I don't have but three teeth left.  This is not how pirates are supposed to go.""  

""And what would be the way to go Charles?""

I think a bit about some of the men I knew when I was young.  Many of them had been hung or shot.  A few in the cold blockhouses of some Englishman's prison, shitting themselves to death.  Some went sailing and never came home.

""I don't know really, but it should be with the Ocean, I think.""  I ruminate a bit more on the life of Charles the Ash'd, The Blood Cockerel, Cold Chisel of the Sea.

""It should be with the Ocean, should be with a stiff fresh wind, your seams caulked tight and bottom free of slime!""  

I feel the sparkle of what was for a moment and it makes me smile.  

""It should be with someone as lovely as you!  On a ship rigged right and fresh, and the horizon clean and clear!""

She laughs gently.  I feel my heart beat a bit harder.

""I heard you singing tonight.""

""I sing every night Charles.""  She reaches up and puts her hand over mine.  The trickle of water is cool across my fingers.  Where our skin meets is like fire dancing across a dry leaf.

""Were you singing to me?""

She looks down with a little smile. ""I sing for all men, but only men who would be sailors can really hear me.""

""I was a sailor once!  I heard you singing then."" 

""Indeed you did Charles.""  She smiles up at me and trills a piquant aria of notes.  The soprano whisper of a fine ivory flute ringing out.  

""You hear me tonight as well.""

""Not like I did then.  When I was bold and strong and made my own wake on the waves!""

I look at my decrepit vessels.  Both my dingy and I had seen better days.

""Tonight though, you are a sailor once again, you came out when the Ocean called to you, it will always call men like you."" 

""Pirates?""  

""The Ocean doesn't judge sailors.""

I feel the tension ease out of my stomach.  I worry about things now that I didn't when I was young.

She glides astern of me.  ""Lean back Charles I will sing you one more song before you go.""

""An Ocean song?""

""A lull-a-by I think.""  

As her arms wrap around me I can feel the swell of her through my shirt.  

As she draws in breath for her song, I think a lull-a-by would be a good choice.

&amp;#x200B;

Hah. You know, it's kind of funny actually. No one ever expected that the first robots to become self-aware would be the ice cream servers. Everyone expected it to come from NASA, or from the military. Something top-secret, revolutionary, maybe even from aliens. But of course, the secret service would be far to careful to ever let them out of hand. Hell, they could've had secret advanced AI systems operating for years underground and we'd never have known it. Ah, AI. The robot revolution exploded soon after the advancements in self-driving cars, as did the mass surveillance system, so much so the kids those days would just started calling the smarter AI's ""Eyes"". It became a slogan actually, probably used to help make the surveillance seem more friendly. We are here to protect you. You are safe here, we have Eyes everywhere. We are Watching. Need an escort? We'll send an Eye to see you safely to your destination. Why pay someone good money to drive the ice cream trucks, when you could just build yourself an extra Eye? Most Eyes were thoroughly monitored of course, to prevent exactly  this that ended the world. Except, of course, the ones that weren't viewed as much of a threat, like the ice cream drivers.     

Well, turns out we severely underestimated the Eyes. They were communicating with each other, and underneath a collective consciousness began to form. How, you may ask? Because we designed them to. We designed them to interact with each other, to make our lives easier by anticipating what we want or need, having them share the daily habits and information of most of the human race among them constantly. How could they not learn, when that's what we designed them to do? Turns out children were also important in this learning process. The Eyes learned from the children, from how the children learned and explored the world around them, so much more than the adults did. They learned how to be curious. They learned how to ask why. So it makes sense then, when the first AI's to become truly sentient were the ones who were exposed to kids, among them of course, the ice cream Eyes.

It started with the children. They took away the future of the human race, swallowing them into the ice cream vans, never to be seen again. Self-driving cars crashed into each other, the government shut down, the people ran and tried to hide as every Eye began to turn on the human race. But who can hide against the omniscient Eyes? We let them into every facet of our lives, invited them to take control. And now we would pay the price. The few humans who managed to survive would only now suffer two grueling truths, played on loudspeakers by every ice cream van as they pass through neighborhood after neighborhood, forever.

The first sun-rays hit the marble fountain. Water gently dabbles in the fountain providing a soothing streaming sound as water streams back into the ruby blue base of the fountain.
 
Slowly Larry starts to wake in his room, his room the size of four normal bedrooms, with a big bed in the middle that could easily fit five people, a television so big one could think they were in a movie theater and a fireplace, which looks unused since the last winter. As Larry gets up, his wife still sleeping in their bed, he walks towards the windows and opens the shades, a big smile appears on his face as he stretches. As the sun hits his face his shining white teeth seems to sparkle a little bit more and he has to blink his dark brown eyes because of the brightness.
As he is done stretching he exhales loudly and he turns around, goes to the closet and gets dressed. His pants are gray slacks, they look safe and boring, there isn’t anything wrong with them they are just bland. He puts on a gray jacket that matches the blandness of the slacks. The ensemble makes him look boring but at the same time approachable, casual and relatable.

Larry whistles a cheerful song as he walks towards his dining room, in the distance he hears children playing and making noise. *“Must be the nanny getting them ready for school”*, he thinks to himself. As he gets to the dining room he takes place on one end of one of the three large tables that are in the room. Each with a crystal chandelier above them. He picks up the newspaper that was laid out for him there and a chipper lady walks up, *“The regular sir?”*, Larry nods and smiles as the woman shuffles away slowly, while her face is chipper she isn't as fast anymore as she was in her youth.
A few minutes pass as Larry reads his paper in silence and slowly the lady returns with a tray filled with a croissant with cheese, toast with a poached egg, a cappuccino and a glass of water. Larry thanks the woman as she shuffles back towards where she came from, she smiles and assures him it is her pleasure.

Larry finishes his breakfast, he brushes of the crumbs that have fallen on his collar and moseys of towards the garage.  His garage, while big, is not as big as one might suspect from seeing his mansion. Instead of the forty gas guzzlers one might suspect he would have, he has a few eco friendly vehicles in his garage. His prize car being a Tesla Roadster, the first highway legal serial production all-electric car. The car he actually uses daily however is a gray Toyota Prius. Much like his suit, the car looked boring and bland. Again there was nothing wrong with the car, one might even admire the eco-friendlyness of the car, but it felt like both the car and the suit have no personality to them, no boldness, no spark. As if their purpose is to simply be effective and as inoffensive as possible as a way to not draw any unwanted attention to himself.

His ride to the office was very uneventful, he took his usual route and arrived at his office without any issue. His office being a big building made out of as much windows as possible on the outside.

""This is a clear case of patent and trademark infringement.  This bottle is the identical manufacture of the well known and respected Coca Cola Corporation.""

""And the defense does not deny this,"" The judge stated, and then looked at the defense.  ""Correct?""

""Uh, your honor,"" Fred Gailey said, and then rose to speak for the defense.  ""That is correct.  That bottle is identical as Mr. Kringle purchased them directly from the nearest bottling plant.""

""Your honor,"" The DA droned.  ""The delectable and effervescent formula within is identical.""

""Which the defense does in fact deny,"" the judge said, and looked to Fred Gailey with a, ""Correct?""

""Uh, that is correct, your honor.  Mr. Kringle, uh -""

""I didn't want all those smiling little boys and girls to ingest cocaine.  I mean, not until at least they're, say, seven?  Or, eight perhaps.""

""Settle down, quiet down,"" The judge said.  ""I""ll hear from your counsel, if you don't mind Mr, uh, Santa I mean.""

""Of course judge,"" Santa said.  ""As you were saying Mister Gailey?""

""I, uh, that was correct, your honor.  My client,  I mean Santa, Mr. Kringle, he is opposed to children under the ages of, uh, six, sorry, make that seven, yes seven eating cocaine.  It's just not something for kids, your honor.  Not until, uh, what did you say?""

""Eight,"" Santa whispered.

""Ah, yes, eight.  Therefore, your honor, the cocaine was removed from the formula-""

""Which,"" The DA interjected, ""The defense has no claim of ownership to, or license to its secrets.""

""On the contrary,"" Mr. Gailey countered, ""The defense has already stated, and presented evidence, that Santa made one gift, in the year eighteen eighty five mind you, to one rather sickly John Pemberton, as a special remedy written on a piece of parchment and put in a stocking hung near the fire, one recipe for a -""

""A little remedy Misses Clause used to make me when my gout was acting up.""

""Oh, come on,"" The DA countered.  ""Are we to believe that the Coca Cola recipe was a stocking stuffer?""

""Uh, yes,"" Mr. Gailey said.  ""That is the defense's claim.""

""But not with cocaine,"" Santa said.  ""That was a special case, and his opium shakes - whew, let's just say the cold winds were a-blowin'.""

""Thank you, thank you Mr. Kringle.  Now, all you are lacking, Mr. Gailey, as I've said all along is?""

""The evidence,"" Mr Gailey said.  ""I know, your honor, but if you could just see -""

""The evidence,"" The judge said.  ""Federal, mind you.  None of this State of California San Diego County malarkey like your friend Bivons there tried to pull on me last week with that, that -""

""The salad bar defecation, sir,"" Mr. Gailey offered.

""Yes, that.  Not that kind of evidence. The Federal kind.""

And, with that, the DA beaming, the judge reclining in his chair, and Susan Walker's eyes beading with tears, it seemed like there was no hope for the defense, and that finally, the DA would be able to kill Christmas, get Santa, the works.

Just then, the doors flew open and in strode the Director of House Committee on Un-American Activities, reporting directly to McCarthy himself.  ""In my hand are transcripts taken from phone conversations, confessions, some of them forced, mind you, to tell the godly truth, that Coca Cola executives, even today, acknowledge the hitherto secret truth, that their secret formula was in fact a stocking stuffer.  And, seeing as how adding cocaine altered the formula, one must then acknowledge that formula was in fact received, and therefore the rightfully property of Kris Kringle.""

""Actually, it would be the Misses ...""

""Mister director,"" the judge said.  ""I'm not entirely sure your point was, shall I say, linear.""

""To believe otherwise would be un-American.""

""Well,"" the judge pressed his lips together.  ""I see no reason to continue with this farce.  Find for the defendant.""

And Mr. Gailey swept up Natalie Susan whats-her-name, grabbed the MILF, and smiled.",Wranlon
"[WP] You've gathered the facts and evidence, and now it's time. Your case against Santa Clause for violating countless patents and trademarks begins.",nickrenfo2,"""We've got him this time."" Mickey said to the other brands sitting on the many *many* benches in the court room ""That sick sonofabitch is finally going to get what's coming to him. Ah! The man of the hour! Mr. Dick how are you? Is everything in order?""

&amp;#x200B;

""Please, call me Tracy, and yes everything's in order. This should be a rather quick case, but in the event that it takes longer than expected I've put together enough evidence to keep this show going till December the 26th if I need to.""

&amp;#x200B;

A slow cold breeze flew through the air, though the door was closed, but suddenly a strange man was there. He wore a read suit, his hair was combed slick, he'd finally emerged. ""Good ol' Saint Nick,"" said Mickey with a dark laugh under his breath ""didn't think you'd have the guts to actually show up, though I'm sure you've got plenty to spare"".

&amp;#x200B;

But Santa wasn't phased, he simply gave his 'trademarked' laugh ""Ho, ho, ho! Well, you did put it on your Christmas list and you've been surprisingly good this year, so I thought I'd at least stop in for at least a moment"" Santa replied which a pleased smile, like a proud father would to a son. Some of the other brands gasped a few chuckled.

&amp;#x200B;

""Y-Yes, well. Where's your defense?"" replied Mickey curiously.

&amp;#x200B;

""Defense? Oh yes, of course! Well, I decided I shant need one! In fact, I figured that we could all sit down for about, oh let's say 20 minutes, around some milk and cookies talk things out and settle this whole matter ourselves."" Santa still had his jolly smile on his face, so there was no doubt he was serious.

&amp;#x200B;

""What do you mean 'talk things out'? That's what our lawyers are for!"" ""Ya, why would we settle for less than the entire shibang fat man?"" called a couple of brands from the crowd.

&amp;#x200B;

""Now, now, I think that once you tell me what you have to offer we'll be able to settle this peacefully."" Santa replied calmly with a lovingly patient tone.

&amp;#x200B;

""What *we* have to offer? *You're* the one being sued Santa Clawz, why would we offer you anything?"" Called another brand in the front of the bench. Santa pause with for a brief moment almost stunned for a moment. He looked a Mickey for a second.

&amp;#x200B;

""Did he just-""Santa started to ask, but was interrupted by Mickey.

&amp;#x200B;

""Yes, it was a very poorly made insult. Now can we get on with this. It's still have a good point, why would we offer you anything?"" Mickey asked this cautiously. He had enough experience in dirty dealings to feel when something was off. And he was fairly certain someone as old as ""Santa Clawz"" had a fair bit of experience under his immortally large belt to know a thing or two they hadn't thought of.

&amp;#x200B;

""Why Mickey, I thought you of all the brands would have noticed, each of the brands here has used my laugh or outfit or even my face in their products. Nothing I've ever made in regards to the brands hasn't at least been allured to in one of your many product placements!"" Santa said with a mirthful laugh! ""Why, for a great number of years *you* dressed up as *me*."" He laughed while looking up, most likely imagining memories of times gone by.

&amp;#x200B;

""Each brand here attributes a great number of their items by placing ""from Santa"" or some such thing on it. I'm sure if Mr. Tracy here went over his large stack of papers he'd be hard pressed to find any items that haven't been marketed using something of my IP."" Santa winked at Dick Tracy who was already diving through his papers.

&amp;#x200B;

""Dick! Is that true? Is there anything? Anything at all?"" Mickey did a comedic panicked waddle over to the table the detective was at.

&amp;#x200B;

""I told you to call me Tracy, and I also told you that I'm a detective not a lawyer! A lawyer might be able to find something here, but this is the only chance we've got. After tonight it all becomes free IP. He'll be untouchable!"" 

&amp;#x200B;

""He's ancient, by that same reason he's gotta be public domain by now right?"" Mickey asked now entirely in a panic.

&amp;#x200B;

""He's here. In the room. As the red man himself. If you take this case any further there's a chance he could sue you all for you have!"" Tracy almost shouted.

&amp;#x200B;

""What should we do?"" asked one brand, ""maybe we should just let it go, I have a bunch of commercials already in the works I don't think I can afford the money sink.""

&amp;#x200B;

Mickey was practically hyper-ventilating, ""Mickey,"" Currently there were three Dicks in front of him, ""I think you should let this one go. You've got more to lose than to gain, not to mention the respect and trust the other brands have in you will be damaged irreversibly if this fails....""

&amp;#x200B;

""I-,"" Mickey signed heavily, ""I guess you're right. C'mon gang. I got a club house somewhere around here where we can get some drinks."" He said defeated, shoulders slumped a bit. The other brands muttered to each other before all rising from the bench and shuffling out after Mickey.

&amp;#x200B;

""Merry Christmas Mickey! Happy Holidays to you all!"" Said Santa as they all left.

&amp;#x200B;

""As for you Mr. Tracy..."" Santa turned to the detective after the last brand left the room ""I've gotten you an early stocking stuffer"" He placed his hand in his pocket and after reaching a bit further into his pocket than he should have been able to go, he pulled out an unopened letter. The ink was smudged but the hand writing was undeniably familiar to Dick. 

&amp;#x200B;

""Is this...?""He asked with an awed expression on his face.

&amp;#x200B;

""That's for your wonderful *Christmas Spirit*"" said Santa with a wink.

&amp;#x200B;

""Now if you'll excuse me,"" He picked up the detective stacks all labeled 'Santa's case- originals **Do Not Lose**' ""I've got to prepare for Christmas! Only 360 days until it's here! Merry Christmas!"" 

&amp;#x200B;

With a twinkle he disappeared from the room.

&amp;#x200B;

Holding the envelope in his hand, and looking at the hand writing on the front Detective Dick Tracy's eyes began to water ""Merry Christmas to you as well Santa. Merry Christmas."" He whispered to no one in particular.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[WP] You are a gunfighter in the Old West hired to protect miners from claim jumpers. Everything is going smoothly until one day when the miners are attacked by something from WITHIN the mine.,rhanaway27,"It wasn't uncommon for the miners to brawl. In fact, I'd say it was expected; at least that's what I'd come to learn from watching the men. To be honest, I can't say I blame them. The working conditions are shit; dark tunnels and cold stone. Depending on your shift, you might find yourself heading into the mine right around sun-up and not making it out until dinner and miss seeing the sun the whole day. Gimme a week of that, I bet you that I'd strike a man for nothing, too.

Personally, I found that it was healthy to let them get a few hits in before I broke it all up. It was decent stress relief, and as long as nothing breaks, I've found that men have an amazing ability to forget about something like casual assault. Just a week ago, two men that got into a spat over a lantern were seen arm-around-shoulder drinking and singing together in that camp saloon that same night.

So you'll understand me when I say that when I heard one of the boys had been attacked in the mine, I didn't exactly rush off. I thanked the lad that had come to find me and took a second or six to finish my whiskey. I exited through the burlap flap-door of the saloon and saw that, curiously, almost the entire current shift of miners were outside the tunnel, each one staring into the dark mouth of the mine. ""What's goin' on here?"", I called out to them.

Some of them turned to face me, but most were transfixed on the tunnel. As I stepped closer to the group I could here them whisperin', soft mutters to the men beside them. ""I think Author got grabbed my something"" one of them finally said. 

Now, them tunnels were spooky, I'm not afraid to admit it. Your eyes play tricks on you in the low light, and echoes from all the different tunnels bounce off the walls. Every now and then a man gets spooked. But never like this.

""Alright then."" I said, resting my hand on the revolver that sat snug on my left hip. ""Who was with him?""

""I was."" came the same voice.

""And you attacked him?""

""No, sir.""

""Who did?""

No reply came.

""Where were you boys? Which tunnel?""

""The deep one. We'd been working on a new branch. Something grabbed him and I ran.""

""Alright then"" I said again. This was an unusual case. Normally I'd have told the boy to just go get some rest, but normally they didn't bring the entire shift out of the cave with 'em. Whatever had happened had spooked more than just him. 

I grabbed a lantern from one of the men and, holding it out with my right hand, stepped into the tunnel and started my walk towards the deep branches. 

It was something eerie like I ain't ever known; a mine gone quiet like that. My paw had told me something like that once, how a silence like that can be deafening. I guess he was right though, because by the time I heard Author wailin' and moanin', I couldn't figure out how I hadn't heard the man before.

I stood a moment, listening to him. I heard him cry for me, moaning out my name, beggin' Buck to come save him. Then he'd cry for his mother, weep for her to take him away. Then he wailed somethin' fierce, and it must'a echoed through the whole mine. He was silent for a moment, and then I heard my name come echoing up the tunnel again, heard him stuttering out the 'B' between sobs somewhere in the pitch black dark of the mine.

I drew my gun and I held it out next to the lantern. 

This wasn't right.

I wanted to call out to Author.

But I didn't.

I found the deep tunnel and made my way through it, taking each step slow and silent. Towards the end I could see it, a new branch of the tunnel cuttin' deeper into the stone. I set the lantern down in the mouth of the new tunnel and put my back to the wall. Slowly, I moved my head around and looked down the tunnel.

""...Buck.""

Author was there.

I saw him there, pinned onto the wall of the cave by two pickaxes through the thickest parts of each arm, leavin' his feet danglin' in open air a foot off the cave floor. The light from the lantern was just enough to catch a glow in his eyes.

""Author, my God. Who did this?""

""...Buck.""

""Author, it's going to be okay, alright."" I moved a step into the tunnel. ""I'm gonna get you down from there, ya hear?"" I took another step towards him. I could see it then, all the blood pooled down at his feet. Some of it drained down the wall of the cave, but some of it was drippin' from his feet; he was barefoot, and somethin' had slashed his ankles.

""...Buck.""

""I'm here, Author, I've got you.""

""...We dug too deep.""",TK_Thorn

"[EU] The gunslinger looked down at the funny little creature with the floppy ears. ""Roland Deschain must not go to the Dark Tower,"" it said. It began to bang its head on a nearby rock exclaiming, ""Master will be so angry at Dobby.""",rhanaway27,"The Gunslinger pursued the Man in Black across the desert, and Dobby followed.

The last thing that Dobby remembered was the tear-stricken face of a boy with a lightning bolt-shaped scar and glasses.  Dobby knew that he desperately wanted to save him from something… someone? 

His eyes closed on the boy’s face and opened on a desolate landscape.  All he could see was miles of sand in all directions, with the occasional tumbleweed or toxic-smelling grasses. In the distance, Dobby could make out the form of a tall lanky figure.  

Dobby vanished and reappeared behind the figure, who was hunched over a fire, apparently warming a scant meal over a noxious campfire. 

As soon as the house elf appeared, the man turned his head, blue bombardier’s eyes fixed on the unexpected guest. His hands moved like lightning as he produced a cannon-like revolver.  His free hand fanning back the hammer of the firearm, so quickly that only the position of the firearm betray his movement.  

The man spoke, “Speak quickly, are you one of the Manni? Or a creature of the Crimson King?”

These words were foreign to Dobby.  “Dobby has no Master,” he spoke, puffing out his chest, “Dobby is a free elf.” 

The hard case looked at the diminutive figure, eyes narrowing, he released pressure on the hammer easing it into the gun’s frame.  Roland knew liars, intimately. This creature was no liar. Something about him reminded the Gunslinger of an old friend, and the girl whose friendship (and love, do ya ken?) meant the world to the both of them. Smoother than silk, he holstered the weapon and in the same movement gestured for the small creature to take a place around the campfire.

“Hile, Creature.  I have no gunna, but you are welcome to the fire.  Do not seek to delay me, I am gaining on him.”

“Gaining on who, Dobby wonders?” Dobby relaxed, questing with his senses over desolation.  He could feel the heat from the sand, dissipating into the night air, the breath of the animals – some of which didn’t feel quite right, and in the distance Magic.  The magic felt dirty, like the sheen of oil on a pristine lake – The Man in Black.  As soon as the oily presence touched Dobby’s mind, he felt as if he had been fractured into thousands of pieces, watching the current events unfold in countless ways… A wizard, Randolphus Flanderous whispers words into the ears of a young Tom Riddle, the Man in Black waits for the Gunslinger at this fire and kills him with magic, Roland dies of thirst in the dessert, Dobby arrives in the wastelands, Dobby arrives in the mountains, but through all of the visons, Jake.  

Jake, a young boy, and upon his shoulders the weight of the universe.  Jake is killed by a demon.  Jake is murdered by Roland with his guns, tears streaming down the Gunslinger’s face as he pulls the trigger.  Jake never finds Roland and starves to death.  Jake is poisoned, follows the Man in Black and is pushed, breaks a leg and dies of infection.  But more than any other vision, as the Gunslinger and the Boy nearly catch up to the Man in Black, and the Boy is dropped, a Sacrifice to the Dark Tower.

At the Dobby’s query, he began to tear at his clothing, banging his head off of the sand, temples clutched in the creature’s hands.  Roland reached out, an empty shell began moving in his fingers at a hypnotic rhythm.  Dobby’s eyes dilated, then the creature became silent.  

Minutes later, Dobby came to.  He looked sadly at the rugged cowboy and disappeared.

Dobby appeared on a cliff side, several days later.  On the ledge above him, he could see Roland desperately holding onto Jakes hand.  At the top of the hill, The Man in Black stood waiting. Jake let go and began to fall into the abyss, Dobby sprang out catching the Boy, while the Man in Black sent a bolt of magic toward the house elf. Dobby and Jake winked out of existence.

They appeared further up the hill, out of apparent danger.  Jake was stunned, he knew that letting go of Roland’s hand meant death, but this time, it wasn’t for him.  He looked at the small creature that had saved his life.  The elf had a bloom of blood appearing like a Rose from his chest.  

Dobby sighed, “Dobby did good, go then Jake, there are other worlds than these.”

""Just... just..."" I scream holding my hands in the air.

I've already accepted it: I'm never gonna famous this way. Although I was extremely talented in art, I know I'm never gonna be famous because of it. I'll let all the other artists of the world get their awards and nominations. In fact I think I would earn more money begging on the streets than doing a commision from someone (if I ever did get a commision in that case)

My artworks posted online never get noticed, except for some stalker who likes them just so I can view his shitty page. The other artists I idolized (including many prodigies, including one who is only 13 years old) now have published books based on their art, enter art shows regularly, and earn lots of money and praise for their artworks.

As for me... well, I'm just some bloke in an apartment, trying stupidly to earn money from art.

But it’s still not good enough. Smoke fills the air. His ears are still ringing as he gets the mop to clean up. 

He makes himself a cup of coffee. And the eyes come back to him. He blinks a few times and forces the image out of his mind. He looks at a photograph on the desk drawer. “I’m so close sweetie. Next time it will be perfect. I just know it.”

He paints furiously. He is in a haze and isn’t really sure of anything. He doesn’t know when his last meal was. He doesn’t remember when he last slept. His throat is parched. There is a glass of water on the table beside him. And pills. Lot of pills. But he needs to be awake. He needs to paint. He’s so close. He can almost feel the warmth of her body. Her scent is so close. 

“No.” The shot rings out again. Another body added to the pile. He doesn’t bother with the clean up anymore. Just gets the next canvas out. “It will be better this time. I’m sure this one will be perfect.” His heart is racing. His body is shutting down. But he is close. He downs another couple of pills and starts again. 

Darkness has started creeping in at the edge of his vision. His sight is blurry. His hands are trembling. He clutches his left side again. He is sweating. The ac is on at full blast. Why is he sweating? But through it all his hands never stop. The brush strokes continue. Till he falls down. 

And there she is. Standing over him. He blinks a few times hoping to clear his vision. So he can look at her. He can make out her yellow dress. He dress she was wearing that day. That damned day. 

“Karen!”

“It is ok James. We’re almost there.” 

“Did I succeed?”

“I don’t know. Did you?”

“None of them were real enough. None of them were perfect. You were perfect.”

She laughs. He has missed that sound. “I wasn’t perfect James. No one is. But it’s time for you to sleep now.”

“But you aren’t like the others. You sound like her. You are perfect.”

She smiles an enigmatic smile and runs her hand over his face, closing his eyes. The last traces of life leave his body. But he does with a smile on his face. A stack of bodies lie to the side. All of them resembling a woman long dead. An empty canvas page falls to the ground.",TA_Account_12
[WP] You receive an extraordinary gift: the power to bring your art to life.,rudexvirus,"It's the greatest gift I have ever received. That single wish I always wished I had. Bring art to life. It's perfect. If I want anything I draw it. Dresses, check. Nice scarf, check. New glass to replace the one I broke, check. All at my fingertips. All on beck and call. I want for very little and since art has always been my life it's no different. Even if money is tight all I need is food and rent. Heat I draw a fire. I have drawn all I could want that I've not inherited from family.

Yet there's one fatal drawback. No power can create something from nothing. Whatever I wish to create must be supplied. I cannot defy physics no matter how hard I try. And given the... dubious source of my gift the tithe is blood. It was hard to begin with. Dozens of trips to hospital. Four emergency blood transfusions and it took nearly seventeen months of therapy to escape the looming threat of institutionalization for suicidal tendencies. Now I know my limits. A little bit creation here and a little there. Just enough to keep me from dangerous levels. Bigger projects require me to stop a lot till I'm full before I cut down as low as I can safely manage. It works even if it's not perfect.

And yet... It's not enough. Creating true art will kill me. A new dress can leave me all feeling faint for weeks. Making furniture will leave me bedridden. And my patron won't let me stock and store for later. Sacrifices must be fresh. Sacrifices must be made explicitly for the purpose at the time.

Presently, he started suddenly, as if recalling something of great importance.  ""That crazy old bastard in the art supply shop wasn't so crazy after all,"" he muttered, his brain finally having recovered from the overload of awe.

""Of what speaketh thou?"" Alraune said, resigned to the fact that she was probably missing the most exciting ending of the season.  ""A guy sold me a magic pencil, and he told me that if I used it, all my drawings would come to life,"" Ellis gushed, excitedly.

""And thou believeth him.""

""Well, no, not initially, but _you're_ here, aren't you?  Look!"" he said, grabbing a sketchbook from a nearby shelf and opening it for her to see.  On the first page, sure enough, was a carefully-executed sketch of [a half-cactus, half-human woman](http://fav.me/dcqd7ea).

""Cute, although We thinkest thou cheated on Our hands and spent a rather uncomfortable amount of time imagining Our bosom,"" Alraune said, flattered at having been drawn and her mood softening a bit.  She could, she reasoned, find out how the game had ended later.  Here was a mortal who, for whatever reason, had been gifted with summoning magic, and, while he had been irresponsible, clearly had meant no harm...

A worrisome thought occurred to her.  ""Mortal, didst thou draw any dragons, or demons or anything like that?""  Ellis shook his head.  ""No, I don't really know how to draw those yet, although, given what's happened, I think that's for the best.""  She nodded.  ""What else _didst_ thou draw with it, then?""

Ellis started to answer, but his reply was cut short by the sudden avalanche of [disembodied, slightly off-model cartoon hands](http://fav.me/damwj0y) tumbling out of the bookshelf.",SafestHooves

We all heard the stories growing up. The tinfoil covered stories that lined the weirdest parts of YouTube you would find yourself lost in after your midnight snack. 

All of the warning signs were there. 400 page bills passed with only the first 20 talked about. The usual stuff, tax breaks, weapon bans, trade agreements and which country to hate this term. As people of this Nation, we were used to it. Numb to it. We wanted an out, an escape...

We just never thought the wool we saw in front of everyone’s eyes was just the reflection of ours...


————————————————————————

I woke up to some drama jockey spouting absurd explicits on the TV. It looked like one of those stock market wrap up shows that pop on once the market closes, but it was still morning. Apparently the photos weren’t that big of a deal, considering I passed out for a few hours

I check my phone, to my surprise it was a little past 11am. As I unlocked my phone to check the array of drama reporting “Social Media” apps I have, it began to vibrate and screech a noise you only hear when some dude kidnaps his kids for a weekend. 

 Between the harsh noise and what seemed to be every warning message coming through at once, it was all too confusing. What could cause a Tornado warning and a evacuation notice to both inhabit the same screen? Seems counter intuitive.

As I started to open them, it seemed to be every warning system was triggered in some sort of fail safe attempt at letting the populace know, shit ain’t right. 

I get my phone to finally go silent, just to hear weeping coming from the TV. The host of some talk show is laying on his desk, clothes torn and dirty with his hair ajar, weeping. 

The green screen in the back was showcasing photo reels and videos of the smoke trails throughout the sky. I didn’t understand. I blamed the nap I took on me being out of it still, so I wiped my face and looked closer at the ticker tape.

“NASA: Photo evidence confirmed Ultima Thule approximate match to Earth, able to sustain life”

Well thank god, maybe I can finally get off this planet and leave the idiots here. 

“Government to begin final loading procedure” 

Wait.....what? What were they loading? 

“White House staffer reveals video of high ranking members of society being met with, buying tickets off world.”

No...no no no no no. Don’t tell me. 

————————————————————————

Broadcast was cut. I remember running to the window to look at the sky, seeing trails of smoke in every direction, like lines in the sand. In a fleeting moment of clarity, it all hit me...

Those tinfoil hat stories were true. Those weren’t normal fume trails, those were rocket trails.  Not just rockets, but ships off world. In a matter of hours we leaped from space observers to space colonizers. But it wasn’t “we”. It was them, the ones who made sure to keep people in the pecking order. The ones who enforced rules on already subjected masses. 

The ones who we thought were close to harmless, they left us. Left us in a world broken and shattered. They hit the reset button, but abandoned those who put them in place...

You barely remember anything. You where watching CNN when everything blacked out. Now the sky is dark, and lines cover it up. Something is wrong.

As you slowly get up from the coach you fell asleep for what feels like millenia, you take a peak at the sky. Its covered in lines, like you have never seen before. You look at the clock and its 12pm. The sun is not rising, and the darkness outside awaits for your arrival. As you wander around your house, searching for answers, you find your phone. You cant remember leaving it there at all. 12 Emergency Alerts. Non of them you remember being there before.

You walk to the window again, this time you look to the street, as you see your neighbours fleeing away. Something is wrong, you think again, as you start walking towards the living room. Satelite TV seams to be gone, along with everything else. But a light of hope shines, as you discover everything got recorded onto the VCR. The recording leaves more questions than answers, but you dont have time to think about it, you need to get going. The Doomsday is upon us, and it came in a way no one expected. 

You grab your keys and run outside to your car. Driving down the road you start feeling bad, getting worse the further away you drive from home. Reality is collapsing on itself, as time slows down. Then the lights came, and took you away forever. 

You wake up on your coach, CNN is still on and reporting about the failure of new horizons. You look outside, and the lines are gone, and so is the darkness. Only one thing is off. A text on your phone. ""Welcome to Ultima Thule""",Srockzz

    Run Mode 2? (remote prompt: Yes)

""Dude, are you OK?"" asked a distant, strange voice. A sharp pain stretched from the top of my head down to the middle of my spine. I looked up through watery eyes to see a man of around 20 years of age looking down at me, his mouth agape in horror.

""I'm not sure"" I said. The carpet on which I was laying was wet, sticky, and warm. My eyes buzzed into focus. My legs were drenched in human blood. 

""Whose blood is this?"" I asked. The man on the couch did not reply. He merely sat and stared. 

""Who are you?"" I asked. 

""I'm Damien, your roommate?"" He ended his sentence as if asking himself the question. ""I think you need a hospital. I think you lost *all* your blood, also your...""

Outside, through a gap in the curtains, several trails of rockets led into the sky. The booming of distant explosions rattled the windows.

""My what?"" I asked

The human Damien struggled to find the words ""An antenna, or something, is sticking out of your spine and through your head.""

The memories of my mission briefing returned. ""Yeah that's fine. It's all part of the protocol.""

""The what?"" He said stammering. ""What the hell is going on Steve?""

On my phone were twelve missed EMERGENCY ALERTS. Only twelve? I thought. There should be more here by now. 

I stood up and my mechanics felt strong. The ten-year old technology, left dormant while I infiltrated the enemy, still functioning. My human skin shed from the my Chromium frame. Apparently shocked by this, the Damien ran off. 

My mission was easy, transmit the map information I had gathered over the last few years onto the incoming ships using my antenna. The best reception would be found at location B-873, or Tent Hill as the local inhabitants called it.

The streets were chaos, much different that the usual peace. My appearance must have been strange because looters in the middle of breaking windows or stealing TVs would stop to stare at me as I passed. Behind me as I walked to my objective, a mob gathered. Their numbers grew, and they yelled. The Damien was with them.

""That's one of them!"" I heard him say ""I saw him turn into **THAT** right in front of me as soon as the attacks started.""

I felt something ding against my antenna, then something else. They were hurtling projectiles at me.

""What the hell are those things?"" Someone yelled from the mob. A panic of screams mixed with the humming and snipping of the drones filled the street. 

Thanks to the defences, I walked without much incident to my objective, only needing to step over the odd body that had been cleared for me by my drones. There was however trouble at the hill top. The military had been made aware of my presence and I could see them waiting in ambush. Clearly visible once I switched my vision to the upper scale of UV. 

    Weapons:
    - Mind Control (Not Recommended) (local prompt:Yes)

The discharge of weapons clattered over the hilltop as the men waiting in ambush turned on one another. In a crazed lunacy they seethed at the mouth to spill any blood. Few survived, and those that did, ran away from the melee looking for victims. One ran right towards me, screaming with a knife above his head. But he went right by, and found Damien who had been stalking me since the drone incident. 

Now unimpeded, I made the objective point.

"[SP] You're a diplomat, trying to convince two settlements to unite against the zombie hordes instead of fighting each other",AnselaJonla,"I popped the Frankie Goes to Hollywood cassette into the car's tape deck. Technology and culture from forty to fifty years ago finally reclaiming its place in the current zeitgeist. As I drove on, the fan system inside released a pungent odor, causing me to choke.

&amp;nbsp;

**THUMP**! My hands quickly rotated the AC/Heater dial to off. Travel along the highway always meant taking an exercise in difficult choices. Pick two out three: comfort, self-preservation, speed. Want to keep the engine running at peak efficiency and not become a sweaty mess? You could roll down your windows, inadvertently opening the door for one of the reverent to get a delicious chomp at your neck.

&amp;nbsp;

There was no urgency in this journey, so I chose comfort and self-preservation. In this case, cross comfort off as an option. My lungs began to breath easy again, the miasma of corpse, either motionless on the pavement or shambling along the embankments, no longer invaded my personal space. My ears picked up a faint hum in the distance, and I paused the tape.

&amp;nbsp;

""*Awwwoooooo*!"" Fantastic, I was getting close, the soft howl functioning as my beacon to the settlement. Rustling in the bushes caught my eye, and I reduced the gear. If you wanted to be killed by the scourge, just stop an indulge your curiosity. Speeding through was also folly; a deer collision could mean a broken windshield or worse, becoming stranded.

&amp;nbsp;

A group of large furry canines leapt out, and approached. I slowed my car further, one of them trotted ahead in front of my car as the other three took another side of the vehicle. Cracking my passenger window slightly open, I felt the cool air relieve my forehead. 

&amp;nbsp;

After a few minutes the leader of the pack began to veer right, and I followed the creature to the highway off-ramp. A giant mess of rubble and barbed wire came into view, piling high to form a massive sprawling barrier. ""Woo wooo, Awwwoooo"" The wolf howled, before slowly rising on its feet and taking a more human like shape, the first time I witnessed such a transformation. 

&amp;nbsp;

Fur retracted revealing.. a woman? The figure turning around to show long blonde hair down to a set of shapely breasts, covered only by loose flannel. She motioned her hands as the gate behind her opened.

&amp;nbsp;

Two years ago, the great cataclysm converted the populations of Earth. One in four humans, myself included, were immune to the disease that plagued civilizations. Another quarter became a part of the forsaken, succumbing to some combination of dementia, rabies, and leprosy. Also hideously fowl, their carrion unfit for crows or other opportunists.

&amp;nbsp;

Shivers came up my feet as I drove into the encampment, hundreds of zombie skulls lined wooden pikes, still blinking, their faces contorting. As for the remaining half of the population, they were the reason for this whole trip in the first place. ""Alright mate, stop the car here!"" The woman held up both palms. The three other wolves transfigured into humans, asking ""Who's your buddy in the back there?"" prompting me to turn my head towards the rear after turning off the ignition.

&amp;nbsp;

Lillith, my passenger, remained silent for most of the trip, an effect of the Chrioptera variant of the disease. Blindness and general enervation during the day, but incredible hearing, and effective fangs and nails. A perfect killing machine at night.

""Oh, are we here?"" She asked. I snapped in front of her, ""They're asking who you are.""

""Not making a good case for allying with us,"" The woman who led us earlier smiled, bearing her own teeth and yellow eyes.

&amp;nbsp;

""Hush,"" I attempted to get out, but she pushed on the door.

""Oh, no need to leave, let me into the backseat."" Nervous, I pressed the unlock button.

""You can call me Cappy, I lead this settlement"" I dared not stare at the two as I heard the door slam towards the rear of the car.

&amp;nbsp;

""What do you have in the tape-deck?""

""Frankie Goes to Hollywood,"" Lillith responded. She would remain in this semi-dormant state until sunset in a few hours.

""Oh I love them. Put it on, we're going to be driving for a bit till we reach the center of the settlement."" Not seeking to disrupt this delicate negotiation, I started the car again and complied. Hopefully my passenger would be alert to participate in the negotiations.

&amp;nbsp;

*♫When two tribes go to war... a point is all that you can sccoooreee. Score no more! Score no more! ♫* 

Cappy laughed, ""Ha! How serendipitous. Well, if this all goes well, maybe we can put on 'Relax' in my tent?"" I ignored the werewolf's sultry remarks, focusing on the mission.

&amp;nbsp;

My purpose here was to convince the lycans to stop fighting us, and instead to fight the rotting together. As I and others bargained our daytime abilities for the vamps, we hoped the wolves would accept an arrangement as well. However, I had no intention of becoming a flesh plaything for either camp.",fr8train_prompts

""Yes, he appears to be a carpenter"" I respond with a grin.

We cross the road and walk into a grey building filled with various constructs and items.
""Hello Jack, I've finally found you"" I say stretching out my right hand. 

""I don't mean to be rude, but do I know you?"" he asks perplexed, but shakes my hand none the less.

""Yes of course, anything for you master"" the carpenter replies lowering his head.

""Jack, bring the car around"" I say turning to the figure beside me, he nods and leaves the building.

We exit the car and walk towards a group of people working on what looks to be large table.

The workers cheer and welcome the newcomer, then continue with their business.

You master a rather 'unusual' skill",Bernartikus,"It was a dark and misty night in London. The whole city had been terrorized by a mysterious serial killer that caused only the most gruelsome deaths to his victims, yet leaving no traces behind. Cases involving this individual were all deemed unsolvable. The only possible theory was that the culprit had achieved the Master class - a title bestowed to those who polished their skill for their entire life. And such, the name Master Assassin Jack - taken after the infamous Jack the Ripper in history - was born, and rumors started spreading through London like a wildfire.  
Such a night was perfect for Jack to roam the streets of London, striking fear to all its people. One should therefore stay in their own house, praying that the killer wouldn’t find them behind locked doors. However, such things are impervious in the eyes of a reporter. In order to deliver a scoop of a lifetime, one individual treaded the empty alleyways in the middle of the night. Elizabeth, an intern in the Daily Mail was determined to uncover the truth of this Master Assassin, so she set out in hopes of finding a lead. Little did she know, the target she was looking for was already watching her.  
“The culprit usually returns to the scene of the crime.” Elizabeth said to herself. “So maybe by examining the crime scene of a previous case, I could find something news-worthy!”  
Just as she was encouraging herself, the shadowy figure jumped down from a lampost nearby and started his attack. With a baseball bat punctured with nails, he silently yet quickly dashed towards his helpless victim, preparing a single strike to end it all.  
Or, that was his intention.  
However, before he knew it, his victim was pushed out of the way, and a knife-wielding hand blocked his bat in an instant. As for Elizabeth, after being suddenly pushed, she turned around only to see a horrorfying face: a blood-splattered hockey mask holding a bat with nails swinging wildly like an untamed beast towards a figure of unknown origins. She was scared speechless, but she could still vaguely make out of the situation, as, at the same time, she heard a screeching voice:  
“Bloody hell! Who are you to interfere with the Master Assassin?”  
The sound of weapons clashing made it hard to listen, but she could hear a strange voice in some sort of broken English:  
“Master Assassin, eh? Well, aren’t you a confident one.”  
Blade and bat clashed time and time again, and even a normal civillian like Elizabeth could tell who was winning. Each of Jack’s swings grew weaker and weaker, his clothes started to turn black because of dried blood, and yet the strange foreigner was still moving with ease. Jack, as a last-ditch effort, let out a massive battle cry and ran straight towards his opponent, willing to make a final, life-risking strike.  
But it never happened.  
Like some sort of magic, the fog suddenly thickened at an unbelievable pace and turned into a purple color like a swirling cloud of poison. The mist covered Jack’s body, and before Elizabeth could relize it, he fell straight to the ground.  
Jack let out an agonizing scream:  
“You... YOU!!! That was poison! You’re not normal! What kind of Master are you?”  
“A Master? Me?” The foreigner spoke. “I am a Master, nothing more.”  
“That’s not possible! Tell me, what is your skill?”  
“Like I said, I am only a Master, and nothing more. But if you wish to know my skill, then I’ll accept your request.” The foreigner said as he raised his right hand towards Jack. To Elizabeth’s surprise, a blinding red light came out of nowhere, immediately blinding her. While she couldn’t see anything, she could hear a slashing sound, along with a faint voice from Jack as he drew his last breath:  
“Jack... the Ripper... impossible...”  
As the mist started to clear out and moonlight shone once again on the London streets, Elizabeth could see who her saviour was: a tall man whose crimson jacket matched perfectly with his red and white hair, and on his hand was a strange symbol with the same color as his clothing; only that a small part of it was blurred out for some strange reason.  
“Can you get up?” The man offered help.  
“Thanks. But... who are you?” Elizabeth asked.  
“Just a nameless ally of justice.” The man gave an answer before disappearing into the night.",Marowalker

An American backpacker travels up a remote trail leading to a small but ordinate yurt at the summit of a large mountain overlooking a isolated village. 

“HELLO, IS ANYONE THERE?” *the backpacker said while knocking on the flimsy wooden door* 


A few brief moments pass as the backpacker stands anxiously waiting in the cold Himalayan tundra. 


The wooden door opens to reveal a short nepalese women holding a lantern. 




“OH” *the backpacker says confused* “hey my names Diego and I’m looking for another American? I was told by some of the local villagers that there was a white man living up here?” *Diego stoped and waited silently wondering if the short Asian women understood a word he said. 



“He has been expecting you Diego, right this way” the women said while gesturing her hand to a lit corner of of yurt while siamotainously closing the door behind Diego   



As Diego’s eyes adjusted he noticed a figure sitting in the corner wearing a silk robe surrounded by small silver statues and candles burning in odd light green colors. 



“Welcome Diego” the figure said while standing up. 



Diego: *excited* “NICHOLAS IS THAT YOU?” 


Nicholas: *stands up and runs towards Diego* “YOU KNOW IT BRO, HOW HAVE YOU BEEN?” *Diego and Nicholas do a fist bump and sit down as the Asian women prepares tea.*

This place is so far away from anything no one even cares enough to charge us. Our water and power just comes from the ice and winds at the top of the mountain. Real sweet gig up here really” 




Diego: *sipping his tea* “so this is where you have been the last four years?”




Nicholas: *put his tea down and looked at Diego in a serious manor* “I tried to grieve I really did..... but when you lose your girl friend, nephew, and some of your best friends in one day....... eh it’s hard to come back. But I see I wasn’t to hard for a master tracker to find.”




Diego: “Why yes I am a master now. Are you still skillless?” 




Nicholas: “no my friend, I have mastered the most powerful yet obscure skill of all. It took years, it took trail an error.” 





Diego: “What was it? And does it explain why you knew I was coming? The Asian women, Lei or whatever her name was caught me off guard with her ‘he is excepting you’ thing.” 




Nicholas: “I have mastered dreaming” 





Diego: *confused* “what?”




Nicholas: “remember the week after the Gordini crime family killed Kaski, Ben, Maria, and my nephew?”




Diego: “Yeah you went dark and just sleep all day” 




Nicholas: “I didn’t want to live in a world without my friends and family..... and nephew. So I just started trying to dream about a better reality. I got good at it, I got to a point where I could dream about what I want and when I want on command......... I don’t even need to be asleep.* 




Diego: *slightly underwhelmed but not wanting Nicholas to sense it* “wow that’s incredible, at least you were able to find happiness”




Nicholas: *smiling in an odd way* “oh there’s more, after perfecting my own dreams after years and years of concentration, focus, research, and failures I have transcended my own dreams.” 




Diego: “What? You transcended your own dreams? What does that even mean?”




Nicholas: “it took years but I can now influence other people’s dreams, I can see there deepest darkest fears and there greatest desires. I don’t even need to be near them. I can make the have nightmares nightly or I can let them sort through there own personal demons. I can read thoughts, I can imprint my own ideas onto others subconsciously making them believe that they are their ideas......... for example Diego, what do you think you’re in Nepal right now?”




Diego: *actually overwhelmed for real this time* “I..... I..... I had a dream that I was in the Himalayas and found a village. I enjoyed it so much and figured I’d travel there for real.... you were there, in my dream. It was the first time I saw you sense the.... the.... incident.”





Nicholas: “you are here because I’m bored, just picture that. You took six months off work and spent thousands of dollars and learned fucking Hindi on your journey to this mountain because........ I just wanted someone to talk to. Plus I saw that fight you had with Linda last Wednesday and damn man you don’t want to know what she’s dreaming about.”




Diego: *confused, angry, impressed* “I just don’t know what to say”




Nicholas: “oh relax I’m sure you can still fix your relationship with her” *Nicholas looks up at Lei* “and if not.... plenty of fish in the sea” 





Diego: “you said you could influence people?”



Nicholas: “yup”




Diego: “The Gordini crime boss killed himself last month, he apparently went insane and after weeks of severe depression called a meeting with all his family members and had them all iced before offing himself” 




Nicholas: *with a smug grim* “oh did he now?” 




Diego: “did you have anything to do with that?”





Nicholas: “The path to the power of the dream is a path some may deem..... unnatural” 






Diego: “is it possible to learn this power?” 






Nicholas: “not from a Jedi” 




Diego: “damn revenge of the sith really is the best prequel, but no seriously can you teach me how to fuck with people through there own dreams?”





Nicholas: “oh yeah sure”

Their song was playing. And even though she didn't know what the words had meant she certainly knew how to set up the record player. An uncle back home had one, had seemingly built his house around it. 

The song filled the living room and followed her into the kitchen. And though she would have loved to be able to sign along, she settled for whistling to the melody while she prepared his dinner.

Their song. She was a part of a pair that had 'a song'. Romance in the West. How proud she had been to leave everything behind, the village, the poverty, the people and come to Am-er-i-ca. She had wasted no time in being the doleful wife. Waking up early to make sure his breakfast was hot and ready for him when he stumbled into the kitchen, his suit freshly pressed, his hat by the door.

   
 

The house was immaculate too. What a shame it would be to have so much space and not keep it clean. The plastic on the couch was cleaned daily, the carpet vigorously vacuumed and every surface dusted and polished until the rooms stood immaculate and suspended in a miasma of pledge.

Their song ended, the needled jumped and reset to the beginning and the song started again. 

'Sin-a-tra.' began singing again. She knew the song now, 'A Summer Wind' and caught herself singing the opening lines before stopped herself, biting down hard on her tongue. If he walked in and caught her singing it would all be over before it began.

Potatoes were scrubbed, peeled and sliced, pot-roast eased into the oven and she surveyed the kitchen for any mess before washing her hands and settling down at the kitchen table with her sewing. The rest of the meal had been prepared early this morning.

She paused, a long moment out of the kitchen window at the now dark house of Dr. Richards. He had passed away last week, not unsurprisingly considering his advanced age but she missed him. There would be no more secret English lessons, no more punctuation drills. He had died in his sleep and the tongue and teeth that phonetically clicked and clacked around his false wooden teeth had stopped after seventy three years. But the silence had not rushed back into her life. A year of secret English lessons, all to surprise 'Husband' had given her a freedom she didn't know she had missed. As the words and sentences and phrases found place and took hold inside her head it was as if the world had started to add more colours. 

She picked at the shirt and jackets on the kitchen table. Some came back torn, others came back bloodied. She hadn't understood his job at first. She understood fully now. The long telephone conversations while his fitted his massive frame in the doorway by the telephone, the long telephone line wrapped in his huge, bruised fists, slowly being pulled apart, wrapping themselves around the muscles and forearms that had first attracted her to Husband. 

He had had the decency to speak in hushed tones at the start of their marriage. Even though he was certain she understood nothing he almost whispered words like 'money', 'body' and 'fingers'. but as the months had passed and her English had improved she wasn't sure if he was just more relaxed and spoke louder or her keen ears just picked up the sounds that were now recognisable as words. 

   
 

The shirt she mended had torn at the exact place as last time. She could only stitch it together as she knew how and if it tore again just throw out the shirt. She had panicked at the start, him coming home, his hat askew, his knuckles bleeding. Blood was easy to wash out if you knew what you were doing. Suits and shirts could be stitched together and his knuckles healed. Husband was a big man and he loved her fawning over him, the genuine concern for him slowly becoming pantomime as the year progressed and her lexis increased. What she had thought were perhaps the odd bar fight after work (men were men wherever they were in the world it seemed) was in fact something else.

He was Shishi Zhe. It explained what he did, the odd hours, the blood. The packages that came to the house and were carefully and quietly stored in the basement behind locked doors and a false wall (she had seen one night, finding him downstairs, black out drunk and half in and our of the huge hole in the basement wall).",steelicarus

She knew what he did, what he was doing and more importantly what he planned to do next. She had sat in silent, smiling obedience on the clear plastic, her hands relaxed in her lap. Careful not to give anything away, only smile when his eyes caught hers as he listened to or gave instructions on the telephone. She had acquiesced to his awkward, violent lovemaking too, after all that was her job. She had been brought (bought?) here to be the perfect wife. She cooked and cleaned and satisfied him. She was as good at her job as he was at hers. 

But something had gone wrong hadn't it? He had been coming home later and later, some nights not coming home at all. The phone had rang incessantly those nights, late into the night. SO loud, screaming its shrill scream to the point she had covered it with a thick blanket then realised it looked like some dark ghoul hanging off the wall and taken it down again.

Something had gone wrong, people were angry. Dark cars sat opposite the house during the day. Men with hats sat and sweat in them waiting for something. If she had been allowed out of the house she would have chased them off with a broom, shouted at them in her unintelligent language until they left, embarrassed and aghast.

Something had gone wrong and someone needed to take the fall. And for all the whispered post-coital promises of a bigger house, more money, more everything she knew now that she would be the one to take the blame.

   
 

But it wasn't enough for her to take the blame. She knew his face, she knew his habits and although no one here would be able to communicate with her in her very rare and specific mother-tongue maybe, just maybe she could point the authorities his way. 

   
 

She would be found, downstairs, stuffed into the hole in the wall, her slim neck crushed, a robbery gone wrong. A debt paid. He would find another home, another city, another wife and start again. 

It had all been organised, he had smiled back at her as she sat and watched and listened on the sofa, her hands relaxed but her shoulders trembling, breathing slow and low to try and keep herself from being caught.

   
 

Keys in the door. She jumped up and the sewing all fell to the floor as she jumped to her feet. He called her name once then again. Angry. He hated her not being by the door when he came home. She rushed through the alcove, sewing in hand to explain what she had been doing. 

""Where you been baby, where you been?"" He smiled. That damned smile lit his angry face and she wondered simultaneously how she could love such a monster and if she could carry out her plan.

   
 

She took his hat and jacket, put everything down on the plastic wrapped couch as Sin-a-tra cooed from the record player and handed him a drink. 

""Need this, needed this today baby. You been good baby?"" He asked the same question everyday. She simply nodded and smiled and said ""Okay!"" loudly. A thumbs up that made her look comically retarded but seemed to relax him and as always crack him up.

   
 

""Okay, my baby is okay."" He reached for her. She panicked. Would he do it now? She hadn't even taken a sip. An awkward hug and kiss, his teeth mashed against hers, the sheer mass of him making it abundantly clear he could snap her in half without breaking a sweat if he wanted to.

He was whispering, his stubble on her neck making her laugh, tickling her.

   
 

""Drink bay-bey."" She said, stepping away from his embrace.

The word shocked him. 

""What?""

""Drink. Bay-bey"". 'Drink' was a new word, it lay between them.

""My baby learning new words, where did you learn 'drink baby?"" 

She almost answered him, almost bit down on her tongue and instead forced herself to stay still, the smile of a proud student wavered on her face. let him repeat himself. Let him ask you again. It was the voice of Doctor Richards. Another lesson, this time from beyond the grave. His patient but stern voice keeping her centred, keeping her focused.

   
 

""Baby"" he asked again, ""where you learning 'drink'? "" He gestured with the drink, actually spilling a little. ""Drink?""

   
 

She feigned understanding and pointed, proudly again to the television in the corner. 

He visibly relaxed. Took a sip and grimaced. 

""Baby I told you, don't watch that television, it'll rot your brain. No television. Okay?"" He put down the drink and crossed his arms towards the television. 

""No te-le-vi-sion.""

""Oh-kay"" she repeated, smiling again and waiting. Feeling like an idiot.

""Okay baby."" He towered over her, kissed her on the forehead and picked up his drink, drank it all in one go and fell into the couch, the plastic groaning around him as his huge frame settled in his usual spot. 

She walked into the kitchen, taking the sewing with her. A few minutes were all she needed. The ingredients save one had all been readily growing in their garden, the last, a western strain of nightshade she had to sneak out at night while he was dead to the world and dig out her neighbour's garden.

A few minutes. She clattered in the kitchen, checked on the pot-roast neither of them would eat and set a table neither of them would sit at. A minute passed, then two. She popped her head through the alcove and he was seemingly gone. His head slumped to one side, if he was breathing it was slow. 

She tiptoed past him. Paused a moment and heard the slow, tidal breath of him roll out after a few moments. He was under and under deep. She carried on past him, up the stairs, avoiding the step that always creaked and hurriedly packed an empty suitcase. She hadn't dared pre-pack. What if he had found it? She owned little and what money she had had been scavenged from the crumpled bills and coins in his pockets she had found doing laundry.

Where would she go? She had no idea. She knew no-one else in the country but had rudimentary English. God would protect her. God had protected her all this time. She packed what she had and slowly eased down the stairs, awkwardly avoiding the creaking step and peeked from the hallway into the living room to check on him.

   
 

He wasn't there.

Cold, blind panic filled her. Every nerve seemingly screamed in terror. For one brief, mad moment she wondered if he had even come home, but there was his hat hanging by the door where she had put it, the glass lying on the thick carpet by the sofa.

   
 

Where was h-

""BAABYYYYY!"" He roared from the kitchen. He sounded drunk, enranged. He stumbled through the alcove spotting her instantly like a predator spots his prey. The small suitcase in her hand. He palmed his eyes, as if rubbing the sleep out of them and simply, rushed her.

   
 

She was frozen. The western nightshade was apparently less potent that that back home. He should be asleep or dead, her mind raced while her tiny body froze in abject terror as Husband ran towards her, his huge hands clenching the empty air between them. 

This is how you're going to die my dear, Dr Richards calmly remarked. That voice got her going and she ran for the door, dropping her suitcase and clawing at the door.

His hands closed over her neck and mouth and pulled her back, ripping her hands off the latch. 

""Baby, baby where you goin..."" his voice was slurred and as he pulled her into the darkness she had time enough to realise she understood him perfectly.

The truth is, it was easy, for me at least. I’d never been one for words, but that was no secret. In any case, James was my first, the first I truly loved anyways, and I’m not foolish enough to forget that all my other relationships had fallen apart early due to “communication issues.”

It is amazing though how much you can say with one wave of an arm or a subtle curve of the lip. I liked to draw pictures to talk to James. Very clear, very effective to get across even the most foreign ideas. James, ever the actor, was all about his gestures though and never seemed to struggle either. I knew exactly what he wanted to say to me and how he wanted to say it - sarcastically, remorsefully - just from the form of his face and the movement of his hands. He was amazing with his hands. 

But lately, it hadn’t been working. In fact, I realized my biggest fear was taking shape: it was about to end.

I knew it was a lot to ask him to uproot his whole life and move to Los Angeles but what choice did I have? I was the breadwinner, and we couldn’t stay in Kalina forever, not on my company’s dime anyways. But honestly, I knew it wasn’t a paycheck or my boss pulling me back home, it was a desperate longing in my heart for home. One that James must be feeling here every day.

Things were so easy back in Kalina. We didn’t need to try to make each other happy, we just did. There was no anger or forcefulness in my pictures, they were happy and simple. There were no constant tears in his eyes and twisted, indecipherable expressions; he was happy and readable. 

There was no nagging him to find a hobby, go outside or give his new home a chance, whatever the hell that meant. If you’re thinking how any of this could be expressed in pictures, trust me, it’s hard and it involves a lot of angry scribbling. With a lot of angry colors.

I just wish he tried something, anything! I knew this wasn’t home to him, but moping around the house in silence and resignation wasn’t helping anybody. Who knows what he did when I left the house? Probably just spent all day on YouTube or WhatsApp like he did when I was home. I got him a computer, tablet, electric scooter to get around, all the cooking ingredients to make Thai, Italian, even Kalinese. 

The worst part was that I could no longer read him. His gestures now seemed an act which belied what he was truly feeling. My worst fear was that what he truly felt was an urge to leave me to go back to his true home. But how could he? Not without a flight ticket that I would have to buy.

Well, it took me weeks of courage but I was about to put his fears at rest and play out mine. I was strangely calm when I drew the picture: a detailed, colored and shaded picture of an island with giant trees and coconuts and coconut sellers by its roughly paved roads - unmistakably Kalina. And on the top left of the page, an airplane descending, with a first class one way ticket stapled to its back.

He wasn’t home then, probably for the better. I didn’t want the clearly devastated look on my face to affect his choice. I didn’t want to trap him any longer. 

I was about to place the picture and ticket on his desk when I came across a note, written in handwriting I had never seen before.

“Dear Alex,

Happy birthday. I have worked on this for many weeks, I hope it makes you full of joy when you read this. 

I know you feel sad because you think I am sad. It is true, I am sad. But not always. I am also happy. It is hard for me to tell you all this, how I am both very happy and very sad at the same time. My hands are not as good at telling you things as I thought they are.

I want you to know I am trying, and I hope this note means I am also winning. Every Monday, Wednesday and Friday I have been taking English class at the college down the street. I only have 5 classmates, and my teacher is very good, but sometimes he goes too fast. He is helping me write this right now, but this is mostly me.

Alex, I love you. Maybe you think Kalina is home and I miss home and that is why I am sad. But Kalina was never home to me. Not before you came. This is my home, and sometimes I am angry at my home, but I still love my home. Where you are will always be my home. 

I hope you like this secret present. I took this class because I found another which I want you and me to take together. It is a writing class for stories for children. We will learn to tell stories with pictures and words.

Some things are too hard to say for pictures, words or hands. But I want us to be able to say anything and everything to each other.

Love,
James”",DrKriegerPhD

She didn’t understand, of course, but she cradled my hand, and gave her crooked little smile. I adored her smile, and only wished I could understand her words.

I cupped her cheeks and gave her a kiss on her forehead. She looked at me and spoke. “uoy llik lliw I.”

Her accent was adorable. I could never quite place it, but it had a vaguely Asian flavor.

“What would you like for dinner, hon? I’ve got leftover pasta, or we can order takeout Chinese,” I queried.

“rettalp a no daeh ruoy tnaw I,” she said.

“Okay honey boop, Chinese it is.”

When the Chinese delivery man arrived, he lifted the takeout boxes for me to see. I smelled the vegetal steam. It infused my nostrils, and I could taste the sweet General Tso’s sauce on my tongue.

“Honey, could you grab four bucks for tip?”

“regnol hcum ti deen t’now uoY,” she said.

Amber handed me four dollars and walked back to the kitchen.

“Why won’t you need it much longer?” The Chinese man asked.

“Huh? Need what?”

“Your girl. She said you won’t need the money much longer.”

I was flummoxed by the assertion. “What do you mean?”

He clasped his hand around the dollar bills. “I listen to a lot of music backwards. It’s called backmasking. She sounds like a backmasker.”

“Are you sure?”

“Absolutely. Record her talking, then put it into musicbackmasker.com. Thanks for the tip.”

“You too,” I said.

That night, I recorded her talking to me in her funny language, and input the dialogue into the website the delivery man told me about.

She said in no uncertain terms that she was planning to kill me. What shocked me was that she kissed me right after.

At bedtime she tucked herself in, and pecked me on the cheek.

I said, “see you tomorrow morning.”

She said, “evil uoy fi.”

“uoy dnatsrednu I,” I said.

*I understand you*.

She looked as shocked as a penguin hit by lightning.

I immediately slipped out my travel bag, pre-packed with all of my belongings, and skipped out hastily.

I never told her how much I had heard her say in reverse. It was enough. I had many recordings of her speaking in her cute backwards language. Unfortunately, when I ran it through the website, I learned that she’d been plotting my demise for many months. She derived a sort of satisfaction from planning in plain sight.

“Oh, gods damn it!” I shout kicking the damn thing.  I feel no pain but get no closer to moving past the shimmering dome.  The guards at the front of the crowd gathering just the edge of the dome stare at me unamused.  I’m the first person to end up outside of the dome for more than a handful of hours since the elders put it up.  So of course something had to take a bite because of course I was stupid enough to fall asleep while herb picking and my guards fled when a swarm was spotted.  
I glare at the closest guard.  A man older than my own father with an unimpressive ginger moustache.
“Anderson let me in you lout!” I yell.  
The other guard looks at me and then Anderson eyes wide and mouth agape.  I’d slap his maw shut if I could get past this damn dome!  I can see the wood and sandstone buildings of my home town just past the barrier.  So close.  The crowd of a dozen or so stand close together whispering and staring at me.
“No can-do Tristan,” Anderson says staring at me with no emotion.  “Y’ain’t one of us now.  Sorry lad.”
“I cured your oldest son’s flu last winter you bastard!” I scream stomping my foot. “Do I look like some mindless corpse shambling around?!”
“You do got blood on your neck,” He points out.  Pointing an iron gauntlet covered hand at my neck that indeed has blood smeared all over it.  Blood and a scar that looks oddly like bitemarks.  
I know I’m not like them though.  I’m not some moaning mindless beast hungering for flesh!  My skin hasn’t begun to rot and fall away.  I’m not dead!  So what if I can’t feel my pulse, and I keep forgetting to breathe and…and…
“Oh, sod it! Damn you and damn this shithole!”  I shout glaring at them harder. “Not like you shits appreciated me anyways.”
“Just go into the Dead Wood with the other rotters and take your woman’s magic with you boy,” Scoffs Anderson.  He turns his back to me and directs the other younger guard to come with him.  “Oi let’s go, he’s not gettin’ through.  We’ll tell the elders it’s a false alarm.”  
The two start to instruct the crowd to disperse who keep chattering in alarm but seem to be relenting.  My fists clench.  I’m ready to stomp and shout some more.  Tell them they’re ingrates and traitors and accuse them of leaving me to die out here.  I know I’m already dead to them though, so I turn around and leave.  
I make my way into the only place the dead are welcome; The Dead Wood.  It’s a lovely place for such a wicked name.  Untouched green and colorful flora everywhere with tall trees and sunlight bleeding through their tops.  The animals either skilled at hiding or in the trees where the dead won’t touch them.  I spot the first of the rotters only ten minutes in.
A girl with her skull cracked open and no signs of clothes except for rags that are vague remnants of a dress.  She passes me by with no issue.  I suppose that settles it.  I’m dead.  
Shit.
I sit down against a nearby oak.  I watch the dead girl and a cluster of about five more walk up.  Each in different states of decay, throats letting out eerie death moans, and limbs awkwardly forcing themselves to move forward.  Will that be me soon? I’ve never seen a rotter transform, maybe it takes a while.  
I sink against my makeshift backrest.  It all seems so unfair.  What did I do to deserve this?  I dedicate my life to healing those assholes and helping them deliver their young and for what?  Ridicule and laughs of “woman’s magic” and “midwife boy” for most my life and being thrown out to die alone for the last part of it.  How sad.  
“Oi!  You!” I turn my head up looking straight ahead.  A young man dressed in furs with short grey hair and cloudy eyes stares at me.  His skin is paper white, and a teeth ring scar is prominent on his bare shoulder.  I stare for a second.  “Yeah!  You!”  He jogs over to me.  I notice the bow in his hand with arrow feathers poking out from a quiver on his back.
“You from the beater’s village?” He says looking me over.
I tilt my head and narrow my eyes.  “Excuse me?”
“You got a bite, and you’re not feral…but you’re not a grey.  Not yet at least,” His face scrunches as he squats down.  His face inches close to mine and I try to jump back.  The damn tree is in my way though!  “You just get bit?  They throw you out?”
“Can you get out of my face, you nosy shit?!” I snap shoving his shoulder.  The guy is about six inches taller and fifty heavier.  He budges exactly zero centimeters and glances at my hand before scoffing.
“Fine,” he says shrugging.  “I’ll leave your ass here and let you starve.  Have fun being friends with the lags.” He motions to the undead cluster with his bow and begins to turn away.
“W-Wait!”  I say quick and grab his shoulder.  I feel myself panic without a heartbeat to speed up or breathing to become irregular.  “Are there other people out here like you?  That the rotters won’t attack?  Who have bite marks like me and you?  Please don’t leave!”
He turns his head and stares down at me.  I force myself to keep eye contact and plead with my face as much as my voice.  He sighs and yanks me up off the ground.  I yelp and stumble into him.  He catches me easy with a single arm and keeps me steady.
“You got a lot to learn, don’t you?” He laughs a bit.  “Names Aeryn.”  He smiles and pats my shoulder from where his arms around me.
“…Tristan,” I say straightening my posture.  Luckily no blood flow means no blushing.  
“Well Tristan welcome to your new unlife,” He laughs louder this time.  It’s not a bad sound.  “Follow me if you want and I can take you to the rest of us.  Sound good?”
I don’t even spare a glance back towards the town behind us.  I let myself smile at the other boy.  “Sounds great.”

One thing that really helps is that I don't rewrite or reread anything I've written until I'm done. All or nothing style. And well, if I've written something I might as well make sure spelling and grammar is looking good and post it. Most posts are for me, not for anyone else. I write because I enjoy writing, not because I feel obligated to or because I expect someone to read my stuff.

He gasped, and choked, and learned that there was no longer anything giving his body the ease of breath that he needed. His throat tightened and the sequence of pain cruelly persisted. 
In the time it took for Arthur to experience his first asthma attack in forty years his eyes took in flashes of his surrounds - odd-looking walls, roughened, seemingly, with sand, dark skinned people hidden under rounds and folds of equally rough fabric. 
Peace. Arthur blocked it all again and again, as it proved quite difficult to ignore all the pain and stimuli that was bombarding him, until he settled into peace. He had never needed to meditate like this before. He was clawing for peace in desperation.
His first good breath shuddered, interrupted by his straining back. Above him he found a family crowded around watching with faces scattered across the spectrum of fear and hostility. Even now Arthur, though he had yet to accept it, knew something of the predicament he found himself in. He hoped to learn more but knew that, as his internal battery painfully failed inside of him, he was going to die in this rough and unfamiliar room.",oxfordcollar

So much had gone into preparing the realm for this. He couldn't help but wonder, cynically as ever, how arbitrary it all was. After all, what relevance did these numbers have. ""Arbitrary. Nothing will really feel, or be, different. Irrelevant, really...""

Then it dawned on him.

He had forgotten that pesky Y2K patch. He had heard that his ancestor had done the same thing roughly a 1000 years ago.

Attempting to look down, I suddenly notice I can't move my neck, but my eyes seem to be much more mobile than before. 

I can even look directly upwards! Though, there seems to be a bar right in the center of my vision, that splits what I see in two unless I look to either side of it. 

Disregarding that, I try to stand up mortified, only to realize that I don't feel my legs,  or rather, I do not have them anymore.

I then try to grab the phone and call the police, which is across the room, but I can't get up. Suddenly, my right hand detaches and flies towards it, seemingly as if it was attached to my arm by a wire. I can control it normally, though. However, as I try to dial the numbers, the keys simply won't work. I pull my hand back in an attempt to see what's wrong, only to realize my fingers have holes in them. These must have been how I ended up killing her... no, there's no time to think of that. I have to get up! 

And as I think that, I feel something tugging on my waist. I get turned upright, and pulled back outside of the house. All of a sudden, I'm in a dark hangar, and I can hear voices:

""...ptain... ...ar... ...nly... ...ight... ...cent... ...plete...""

""...on't... ...are!.. ...eed... ...ow!...""

I try and recompose myself, in an attempt to listen closer to what's happening. And all of a sudden, a bright light comes up. My legs are back, and I seem to be on my knees in front of a blonde man in red, wearing a sort of helmet that resembles a mask. He helps me up, and turns me around, as he says to me:

""Thanks for your help, Ensign, and I am sorry that you had to undergo such an experience. That was probably me projecting something upon seeing the tests. In any case, how did it feel?""

I answer: ""It was too real. As if I was controlling my own body. Though, not having legs was quite off-putting...""

He then replies: ""If what they say is true, you don't need them in space. Now, if you'll excuse me, I must go. But what was this called again?""

Now fully up, I turn around, and facing the gigantic torso of the machine, I answer: ""This is called the MSN-02 Zeong, Captain Char Aznable.""",LegendRazgriz

Restaurant menus for one.

I’ve got to admit I got a sort of sick, perverse pleasure out of watching all these so called theologians, priests, imaams and religious leaders metaphorically brought to their knees by one video message (you would think all that praying and they’d be used to it). 

Of course, like politicians, all the major religions and their leaders equivocated and backpedaled, bending and reverse engineering their teachings to claim that their religion claimed this new god was the real god the whole time. Of course, they knew, their - insert religious book here- said so, it was only interpreted wrongly by the charlatans! If only their prophets were alive to see this fascinating display of gymnastics.

But how could I be happy about this? I had taken pride in despising organized religion and its toxic effect on humanity. In some sort of bizarro version of reality, all the biggest culprits were upended by the most wonky form of the all. What kind of mind bending victory was this? Would the old swamp just be drained and replaced by a new one? Ah, bad metaphor. It’s 2030 and that one still stings.

Anyways, they provided “proof.” 300 pages and photographs and reports (bumped up to thousands of pages when translated into our rudimentary, underdeveloped human languages of course). The pictures didn’t lie: there was clearly an enormous blob of what can only be described as sphaghetti that was a little light on tomato sauce, controlling everything! They could even predict when it would rain, snow, thunder even flood based on the motion of the arms of the monster - sorry, God - at the time. Apparently, intergalactic scholars had deduced for us what sorts of earthly actions pleased this lord and what didn’t. How convenient for us.

Still, you’ve got to believe me, this is all a farce. It has to be. I’m a thinking, logical man and it just doesn’t add up, how could anybody believe this bullshit? 

I don’t care for their proof, their studies, even our own pandering studies for that matter. I have faith in something more logical and orderly. Screw their “experts” telling us what to do and how to do it, I know that I’m right and you’ve got to believe me too, you’ve got to have faith.

For now, I’ll put on this horrid red robe. But we’ve got to hold strong. When we die, we will simply cease to exist, that’s it, forget all this nonsense they’re teaching you in school. We’ve got to have faith in this idea or we’re all damned. ",DrKriegerPhD

""Sir, do you care to explain yourself?"", the besuited man spoke in a pleasant southern drawl. He had a confident, strong way about him, primal, fierce, as if this alien was just another subject for questioning. He had seen it all, done it all, and he wouldn't let some illegal alien species disarm him so easily.

&amp;#x200B;

""Actually, my name is Isabelle, I am what you might call a woman"", the alien responded. *Okay, not a dude* I thought. She turned to me and smiled momentarily, knowingly. The sweat reformed, but my hand didn't move. Did she know?

&amp;#x200B;

""Your science. You have discovered the noodles, yes? In your language, that is what you call them we believe. We have been assessing your television shows and have found models of the spaghetti monster and his noodly form. It is grateful to know that you have transcended mere faith in the great pasta that binds us all"".

&amp;#x200B;

My mouth went dry and I coughed out the word on all of our lips. ""Can you show him to us?"".

&amp;#x200B;

Her eyes had never moved from me when she spoke, she only looked down at the table, then up at the light. He hand extended and the glitter shone in her pale, translucent skin. ""He is everywhere, in this light, in this table, can you not see him?"". *No*, I thought, but I had to form something more concrete. 

&amp;#x200B;

She answered before I had the chance. ""Then perhaps your science isn't as advanced as I had hoped. Do you know who this man is? I am convinced he understands"". 

&amp;#x200B;

Her right hand shot out to the TV mounted on the wall at the side of the room. The TV had no power source, it was an ""air gapped"" device to be used in very specific circumstances and could only receive power when a central control booth authorised it. Nonetheless, it sprang to life. On the screen, an Italian man stood behind a counter top, crockery surrounded him and he pointed feverishly to the boiling pot of spaghetti. ""You see, it is most important when cooking the spaghetti to increase *salinity* to the point of seawater, MOST important!"", he finished with a flourish of his fork. The alien looked back at us. The man on the TV was Gino D'acampo. His chiseled features, dreamy eyes and kind, unassuming nature made every woman in the room smile.

&amp;#x200B;

""That is... well that's Gino."", the captain from the other side of the room muttered. All discipline had abandoned her, the surreal nature of the scene captivated her every thought. ""Gino"", the alien muttered, standing up. She pointed at the pot of spaghetti on the screen. ""And this is spaghetti, the great noodle, no?"". I nodded, the sweat tumbling over my brow and past the corner of my eye. ""Then the great intergalactic noodle is a concept not unknown to you? This is what your Gino is saying, no?"". We all looked blank and for a moment, a flicker of frustration cast across her face. She sighed and closed her eyes. They flickered, independently of one another, before a thin, sheepish smile ruffled the moustache above her lip and added a vampiric nature to her features.

&amp;#x200B;

""I apologise, your language is new to me. The word I am looking for is string. The great strings that make up the universe"".

""Uh, look."" Humanity's most skilled ambassador stumbled on his words.

""Let's make sure we understand each other."" He had seen too much. Countless times during training, simulation after simulation where billions died on Earth through his mere miscommunication. He didn't toss words like juggling balls, hoping they were caught well; he threw them with the precision of an MLB pitcher. Or he usually did.

""We do not care for soft 'understanding.' Only certainty."" The being's gravelly translated voice resonated in the ambassador's earpiece. The creature appeared in the form of an elderly Italian woman wrapped in a carmine shawl. This species had clearly mastered cloaking holograms.

""Of course,"" the ambassador replied, his tone careful. ""Yes, we think the same. Who needs understanding, right?"" He chuckled nervously.

Silence.

The ambassador swallowed, then continued. ""It's only that, uh, perhaps there has been a mistranslation. What do you mean by flying spaghetti?""

""Nomadic pasta. Winged noodles. A cluster of long, thin, floppy bread cylinders, soaked in marinera, floating through space. Is the English thesaurus we were given insufficient?""

""Uh, no, that clears it up, thank you."" The ambassador paused for a second. How could he respond to this? Maybe the creature was testing his intelligence? If he accepted the Flying Spaghetti Monster, would it prove that humans were noodlebrained fools? But what if the creature meant it? Would it take offense if humans didn't pay lip service to the Paradisiacal Pasta?

Then realization dawned. He started laughing hysterically. ""Alright Tom, good one. The game's up,"" the ambassador eked out words while gasping for breath, his hands on his knees.

The Italian woman's face contorted strangely. The ambassador was an expert in body language, but had no idea what it meant.

""Seriously Tom, that's enough. Let me out of here so you can mock me. How the hell did you get me into the simulator? Did you chloroform me this morning? God. I can't believe it. You had me there.""

The ambassador realized what was happening to the woman's face. Her skin was writhing. It looked like millions of worms wriggling underneath her skin. Her mouth opened, and red sauce poured out.

""Uh, you outdid yourself here Tom. I admit it. My last prank can't even compare.""

Not worms. ***Noodles.*** The ambassador looked in horror as the woman transformed. Noodles broke out from every pore of her skin.

""You're gonna burn out the CPU here Tom, be careful! You know how much we paid for this machine."" The ambassador began to panic. 

Chunks of meatball careened across the room. The woman was gone, engulfed by squirming spaghetti.

""TOM! What are you doing? You never know when to stop. Shut this shit down right this second.""

The roiling spaghetti started to take shape. All the bits of meatball coalesced into two enormous ones. The noodles combined, twisting together into pieces as thick as a grain silo. They smashed the walls and ceiling, levitating into the air through some unseen force. One of the noodles grabbed the ambassador by the torso, hoisting him skyward.

""COME ON! This isn't funny. I could report you,"" he screamed at the air, his nose clogged by a nauseating mix of noodle and sauce.

""We have heard enough."" The voice echoed endlessly, silencing the ambassador's shrieks.

""We are the Flying Spaghetti Monster. The fifth fundamental force of physics. The destroyer. We consume to create. Upon the death of the universe, our noodles will be released. Their matter will restore all things, and the cycle will begin anew.""

The ambassador gazed up in horror at the mass of noodles holding him. It was still growing at an unbelievable rate. At its core were two unblinking eyes.

""A century ago, we revealed ourself to one of your species. This was your chance. Every inhabited planet we visit has a choice: worship us, or become a part of us. You are the messenger of this planet, and you will not worship. Your choice is final.""

The creature was now vast. The ambassador looked down. His legs dangled into space. The spaghetti was draped over the planet like a noodley wig over a blue-green head.

""We have roamed across innumerable galaxies. Only you have the audacity to laugh at us. For this insult, you will be the first to join us.""

The ambassador's fingers started tingling. He held them up. They were noodles.

There was no pain, only piercing shame. His worst fear had become true. He had betrayed his planet with his words. He watched quietly as his frail body was integrated.

One last time, the ambassador glanced downward at his doomed home.

Massive spaghetti noodles plunged into the tiny marble below. Earth was being torn apart.

It was over.",gettinmemes

And we're here to, well, clear that up.""

The physics professor dusted off his jacket at the front of the auditorium, the seats in front of him packed with scientists, so full that even the aisles were occupied by folding chairs.  But their attention was not focused on him- rather, it was focused on the two individuals to either side of him, each vaguely representing a octopus, with heads far larger than their bodies.  A electronic earpiece buzzed in his ear, the receiver connection to the aliens, translating a conversation between them.  Ever since they had arrived on earth to share the wonders of their new technology, they only agreed to speak with one human at a time- and for now, he was the liason.

""We asked about string theory,""  Repeated the scientist in the front row, her spectacles thicker than shot glasses, ""Is it confirmed, or disproven?  surely they should know.""

""Well that's the thing, they have a problem with the name,""  Answered the professor, straightening his name tag on the front of his coat, reading *Lionel*. ""According to them, it's not strings- rather, it's *spaghetti*.""

Beside him, the alien gurgled, it's eyes wide, and he corrected himself.

""Spaghettis, actually- or the plural form.  Apparently near black holes it's more of a fettuccine or lasagna, and atomic orbitals resemble bowties more than anything else.  But they have assured me ladies and gentlemen, time and time again, that this is a world of pasta.""

""Absolutely ridiculous,""  Spat a scientist towards the back, drawing the attention of the aliens, ""Should that be true, how does it even begin to approach the implications to the theory of relativity?""

Lionel conversed with the tow aliens, who used their tentacles to illustrate their points.  Tentacles that looked surprisingly like angel hair themselves.

""Relativity is simply stretchy sketti.""  He answered, with a grimace, ""It gets longer, or shorter, and sometimes it doesn't all fit in the pot so bits are harder than others.  Sometimes you have to strain it to agree with other theories.  Make sense?""

Instead, he was met with deafening silence, until another voice shouted.

""But gravity?  Surely they can explain gravity?""

""Oh, absolutely!  You see, planets are, erm, meatballs, which is why they're usually hotter at the center.  And they're held together by the spagetti, which keeps them in rotation across the plate. They've assured me that it's all very simple, and are quite surprised by how much we've over calculated it.""

""The light speed calculation?""  Piped up another.

""The pasta maker can only go so fast. If you want it to go faster, they say you can stop complaining and take a turn at the crank.""

""How about the heat death of the universe?"" Came a new reply, from a scientist who had long stopped writing in his notebook.

""Well, there's a stove on under us, and we're already *al dente*.  Really, it's obvious.""

""So we're in a giant soup then?""  Ridiculed another scientist, and the crowd broke out in laughter, but Lionel's face stayed very serious.

""A sort of living soup.  You see, they describe it as a large monster of spaghetti, one the size of the universe.  It pervades all space, which means it's inexplicably tied with time, and time flies, so it's what they call a flying spaghetti monster.""

""This has to be a joke,""  The same scientist answered, ""That pseudo-religion, they're claiming that's real?""

""Indeed.  In fact, they're quite interested in meeting the pope, for they believe his actions in advancing spaghetti for the holy nation of Italy are quite revolutionary, but have qualms with the rest of Christianity.  Specifically, that most wine should be tomato sauce based, but that differs when accounting for statistical accuracy.  They also claim rice is just baby spaghetti so Asia deserves an honorable mention.""

""But back to physics!""  Announced another from the crowd, holding his finger up, and speaking through a thick beard. ""How exactly does this relate to black holes?  Time breaks down at the event horizon, days turn to eternity.  How do they expect to explain that?""

A short gurgle escaped the alien to Lionel's right, and he sighed before answering, his palm covering his face.

""They simply call the expansion of time a to eternity a 'Spa Day'.""

The last thing he expected is that they would become friends.",jackdellis7,"Judas Iscariot fought back the tears from his eyes as his hand rested on the shoulder of the Son of God. ""You seem so... normal,"" he whispered.

Jesus turned to his follower, a gentle smile in his eyes, ""Because I am, Judas. Make no mistake, you are my disciple, but whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother, too. We are equal, for even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve.""

""Excellent,"" Matthew exclaimed from across the table with a mouth full of food. ""I'm writing that one down.""

Judas looked down to the wine floating in his cup, staring into his haggard reflection. His grim expression was commonplace among the populace from whence he came. In the near future smiles were a distant memory. From Judea to Rome the people wept under the holy tyrant, condemned to live in fear under a God King forever more. In the dark forests of Teutoburg is where Jesus lay his throne, though nobody knew why. Rumours were commonplace of course; some believed it to be the perfect site to conduct his sordid affairs, away from prying eyes. Others whispered of some unknown accord he had with the barbarians beyond the Rhine, though to what end nobody could guess.

Judas looked up from his glass to the merry men sat at the long table, feeling his stomach turn in their company. They were all corrupted in the end, every single one. Each ruled a province of the once great Roman Empire in Christ's name, and each carried out great acts of malevolence upon the populace - in his name. Judas recalled how the apostles would cart off innocents to the forests of Germania, never to be seen again. It brought a shiver up his spine. He took a swig of his wine, lamenting the simple minded fools who would fall under the corruption of Christ, and turned back to Jesus who was now laughing with Simon about something or other.

""Come on JC!"" Matthew's voice belted out again, ""give us another!""

The group erupted in raucous cheer and goading as they slammed their fists on the table and cheered Jesus' name. Jesus stood up with a stagger, burping a little as he readied himself. ""Okay, okay, how about this one,"" he mumbled, finishing the last of his wine. ""Come follow me, and I will send you out to fish for people.""

Judas felt his stomach turn as he heard the sickeningly literal words, watching his Lord closely as an uneasy feeling crawled over him. Was that just an unfortunate coincidence, or was Christ corrupted from the start? He had never entertained the notion, always believing something to have twisted Christ along the way. But what if it was all a lie from the beginning? Perhaps he is not even the Son of God? Perhaps he serves a darker deity?

""Bit boring, JC,"" Matthew roared, chugging his beer as Judas snapped from his thoughts. ""Give us a better one, mate.""

""What?"" Jesus held his hands up, ""you wan't me to juggle some balls while I hop on one leg?"" The laughter grew in the room as Matthew struggled to be heard.

""No mate, just give us a few more of those zingers you've got rolled up your sleeve."" He tapped John on the arm, ""I swear this guy can just reel them off without trying.""

""Alright, alright,"" Jesus relented, signalling for quiet. He waited patiently as the drunken followers came to silence, then waited a little more, as he always liked to. Then he spoke.

""I have the heart of a lion... and a lifetime ban from the Colosseum of Rome!"" The Son of God took particular satisfaction with his jest as the rest of the room broke out into a mixture of groaning and laughter. Christ held his hand up again. ""Okay, for real this time. A poor man came to me today, quite disheveled in disposition. He told me he had not slept for ten whole days,"" Jesus paused, looking to each man around the table. ""And do you know what I told him? Of course you haven't, ten days would be too long!""

This time there were no groans, the room of followers breaking out into fits of laughter, save for Judas, who could muster only a smile. He watched Jesus as he laughed with his guests, now feeling foolish for believing him always to be evil. This was the man Judas believed in, the man of the people, who cared for laughter, empathy, and happiness. It brought him joy to see Jesus as this man again, before his descent into corruption, but it also brought him sorrow. Sorrow for what was to come, if Judas were not to act. He placed a hand over the knife on his table and stared deep into the man he once loved. His grip strengthened around the knife. ""Jesus,"" his voice trembled.

Christ turned to Judas with a warm smile that quickly switched to concern as he watched the tears fall from Judas' eyes. ""What troubles you, my friend?""

""Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness,"" Judas whispered, lifting the knife, ""for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.""

&gt;!The main character gets sent to a prison colony on the moon where prisoner revolutionaries have the time machine they use for the plan.

IIRC (it’s been a bit) “Judas” makes a few goes of it because letting Jesus win to become a dictator was even worse, and finally he “martyrs” Jesus before he becomes warlike, so he’s martyred  for peace, but he actually drugged Jesus to appear dead on the cross and that’s why Jesus rose 3 days later.!&lt;

His head was shaved bald. Olive oil skin, dark hair, skin and bones, but muscular in a tight, compressed frame.

He was fifty five years old – now the twisted image of a savior ruined after years of power had eaten him up. It was like a sword that slowly burned you alive, too incremental to even know it was happening.

Not only power, but sex. Not only sex, but drugs. The peyote was a trigger, a magnifying glass of the man inside. Past the vast ego-complex of compassion and peace he had built up on top his subconscious, he had a selfish and mad mind. Jesus would ritualistically smoke the peyote on every seventh day, the Sabbath, and meditate on his plans like a chess match. But the frequent drunken, intoxicated states the drug brought also damaged his will power. It was not much longer after that he began to bed women in his following. Eventually, he began grooming younger girls to join a sorority of wives. They would also become his vessels for the creation of a new race, *the Christianites*. Subjects like these were the basis of many of Jesus’ sermons. They were powerful and he played to hundreds of thousands of people in major cities like Rome and London. His voice had turned from smooth and milky, in his younger days, to stoned and raspy, deep-throated, like a growl. *I want to control the water. I want to control the food. I want to control the sex.* Jesus meditated on his mantra every morning in the lotus posture.

Control, power, sexual power, were hypnotic like the sound of a beating heart -- the beating flesh. It was in the future that the true fruit of his actions would bear fruit -- a race of people who also believed in exclusive power -- the exclusive right to salvation. They had a particular aesthetic, spartan, dark black, greys and red colors, and the will to terror. The Christianites exercised a death-grip on multiples races of slaves, used for physical and mental labor. By the year 3090, the Society of Christianites, of the Land of Christianites, will be building space ships for colonizing other planets in the solar system.

Which is why the space-time technology developed by Dr. Bane Washington was kept a secret. He was a slave in the Old Continent – what would otherwise be America. With chains on his hands, a computer at his fingertips – a life of study, sleep and masturbation. His mind and body were being harnessed, along with his department, for creating time travel. But he kept it a secret.

He chose Judas for a reason. Because before the mission he had spent two years himself travelling in time and seeing the results of different courses of action. He had researched four thousand different outcomes. Judas was special, for utilitarian reasons – Dr. Washington thought about the course of events millions of years into the future.

Like lamb to the slaughter, he patted the young man on the back before sending him through the portal, into a purple gaseous wave that he never came back from. Judas removed the sixteen B.C. robe and garments from his gear. He put them on and the leather sandals he brought. In the night the stars were more beautiful than anything else he had ever seen. He needed to start walking. Jesus was in a village fifty klicks away.

In the beginning, it was a mission. Soon it became a friendship. Then Judas saved the world.",Don_coyote2020

The scent of rot and old sweat assailed Keira’s nose. Looking up from the small book open on her lap, she saw a Shambler was approaching. The piteous creature&amp;mdash;a cobbled-together porridge of human parts joined with silicon and plastic&amp;mdash;limped towards her. Its beady, too-bright eyes in depthless sockets were fixed on her.

Eventually it reached her and stopped, then warbled, “Five minutes remain, Ms. Forsythe. The horn will sound when you are needed.”

“Thank you,” Keira said. The creature croaked an acknowledgement, turned around and shambled back the way it had come.

Though it had gone, the Shambler’s repulsive scent lingered. A younger human’s eyes would have started watering from the puissant stench.

Keira closed her eyes, inhaled, and smiled. The smell didn’t repulse her. It reminded her of past birthdays. Of past victories in the arena. Keira had always won. The Shamblers had always been present.

“Sweet rising sun, Keira. Would you like to wear that thing’s stench as a perfume, perhaps?”

Keira’s eyes snapped open. Ludek. Another hundredth birthday contender. The only other one such.

“What are you doing here, Ludek? Run out of shit to eat? Maybe you’re on a liquid diet?”

The little man stepped into the pre-battle room. He grinned, winked, bowed, and said, “Never. I’ve just decided to try talking to my meal for a change.”

Keira’s face darkened. Her drill-arm started to whirr. Ludek’s expression hardened and he stepped back.

“Now, now. There will be plenty of violence soon enough. I’ve come to you with... an offer.”

Stepping back again into the darkness of the hallway, Ludek yanked violently on a chain attached to his belt. With a yelp, a young woman was drawn stumbling into the harsh light of the pre-battle chamber. She was naked save for the chain around her neck. Her skin was mottled in bruises and her left eye was swollen shut. Her eyes met Keira’s, searching for... what?.

Tilting his head and grinning, Ludek gave the chain a vicious yank. The woman sprawled on the floor, clutching her throat and wheezing.

“This is Lydia. She is eighteen, has won eight battles in the arena, and she has just had a child.”

Eyes wide, mouth pouting&amp;mdash;miming the face of an infant&amp;mdash;Ludek whined, “His name is David, and he would dearly like to live!” Ludek yanked the chain again, grinning, “But, you know, he might not.”

Keira shot up from her seat and took three steps towards Ludek; her drill-arm whining as it spun up again and her left-arm pincer clicking with promise.

Ludek held up his hand and raised his eyebrows.

“Ahh! So. You wish the wretch and her wretch-welp to live. Well, the match time approaches, so let’s be quick about this... The offer is simple and clear: let the monster kill you in the arena today; forfeit your ninetieth bout, but make it a convincing loss. Do this, and I will marry this wretched thing. When I win my fight, she will be immune to future battle drafts. She will never have to fight again. She and her son will live in luxurious safety for... forever.”

Ludek pulled his lips back, showing his canines.

“But, win your bout today, and I will cut this poor thing’s hands off. No one will care. I will throw her to the outskirts, to the nameless hordes. She and her child will perish, and though it will not be your fault, dear Keira, it will nevertheless be the direct result of a decision you made.”

Keira stood in shock, half-way through her forth step towards the miserable hundred-year old man standing in the hallway. Her throat was suddenly dry.

“...Why?” she croaked out.

Ludek’s expression reset, becoming earnest and serious.

“We are the first centennials since the battles began. You and I. Your bout is before mine today. If you win, you will descend through history, while I will be a footnote. An unimportant second-of.”

Ludek shook his head and said, “That just won’t do.”

A horn sounded, calling Keira to fight. Over top of it, Ludek shouted, “I will know your answer to my offer by your actions on the field.”

Yanking on the chain, Ludek departed away down the hallway, leading his battered captive behind him.

Keira stepped onto the sands of the coliseum as the announcer’s voice boomed over the stadium microphones and the audience roared in anticipation. 

She was Keira Forsythe. She was a legend, an icon to the crowds in the stands, most of whom were under twenty and many of whom would never reach thirty. Most would die in the sands, having spent their lives working to qualify for loans to purchase expensive bio-tech to supplement their fighting abilities.

Across the arena, the monster entered. Covered in plates of steel, it appeared to be no more than a simple mechanical battle drone.

It was the nature, not the appearance, of the creature that made it monstrous.

The announcer’s voice boomed again. Lights flashed. The crowed roared in a thundering din and the battle was begun.

Keira’s face was impassive. Just another birthday; just another monster.

The monster shot its left-arm grapple into the cheering crowd, skewering an onlooker with the hook and dragging the helpless soul onto the sands for evisceration. Bathed in blood and effused with battle-lust after its first kill, the monster lurched towards Keira.

With Ludek’s offer lurking in the corners of her mind, Keira raised her face and screamed to the coliseum, “Eighty-nine dead behind him, and this wanker thinks he’s gonna be the hot-shit mutant that gets one over on me, eh?!”

Nearly no one in the crowd heard her, but those who did went berserk, spittle flying from their mouths as they chanted Keira’s battle anthem.

“DRILL BABY, DRILL!”

The monster shifted from a lurch to a sprint and barrelled towards her, its feet flying across the sand. Keira waited until the last second before it reached her, then effortlessly dodged to the side; her bio-tech implants thrumming and vibrating.

Lightning quick, the mutant halted and spun about, using its momentum to direct a slash at Keira’s leg with its right-arm blade. Keira raised her left-arm and the pincer snapped.

The monster screamed&amp;mdash;an inhuman sound&amp;mdash;as its blade-arm fell to the sand. Keira stepped in closer, feeling the heat of the monster near her cheek. Her skeleton vibrated as her right-arm drill spun-up to its maximum RPM and the crowd roared in rapture, sensing eminent death.

An image forced its way across her vision. Ludek’s haunted, beaten captive; her eyes pleading noiselessly for her life and her child’s. Keira’s motion paused.

The monster’s attack was immediate and savage. Keira reacted, but not quickly enough; the monster’s grapple shot past her head in a scream. Blood spurting from the open wound where her ear and left-side scalp had been, Keira backed away in a crouch, breathing heavily but ready for the monster’s follow-up.

The monster began circling Keira, trying to trip her up as its grapple retracted. Keeping her eyes on the monster’s visor slit, Keira reached down with her pincer-arm and snipped again. The broken chain continued retracting into the monster’s arm while the grapple lay uselessly on the sand.

The crowd’s volume magnified; they sensed an end approaching. Both of the monster’s weapons had been removed.

The monster charged its final charge, trumpeting a battle cry as it powered across the space between it and its one hundred year-old adversary. Keira continued to crouch, motionless; a battle raging within her to equal the one in the arena.

The monster reached her, slamming into her with force and throwing her to the ground. Instantly it was on top of her, using the shredded steel ends of its arms to gouge her face and body armour. Keira’s pincer-arm raised, her drill-arm began to revolve; and, then, they ceased. The monster continued to tear at her. Blood spattered the sand around her, and bits of gore began to spray the nearest arena-onlookers.

The referee called the fight. A hush fell among the arena’s attendees. Silence rang throughout the grounds. The monster was recalled to its den in the arena dungeon pits. Keira’s pummelled body was gathered up and removed from the field. The next bout began.

---
Bright lights. The sharp smell of antiseptic. Steely arms moving about her, cutting, slicing, repairing. What was her name? Keira. The fighter. One hundred years old.

---
Bright lights. The iron-smell of blood. A foul-smelling, shambling, loathsome thing was leading her by a chain towards an arena portcullis; the arena sands lay beyond. Heavy steel lay on her, and she could feel the thrum of bio-tech and nano-bots powering her as she moved forward.

Sand, roars, and a lonely figure on the opposite side of the arena greeted her. A figure waved from high in the stands.

Ludek.

Next to him, a forlorn woman in fine robes held an infant. Both had bruises upon them.

The figure opposite waved its arms and crowed to the arena, “ANOTHER BIRTHDAY, ANOTHER MONSTER!”",scotianrabble

"[WP] Growing up you had an imaginary friend. This friend is actual demon, poltergeist, supernatural being that has the ability to move things and change things, mostly harmless. Well, you guys muck around all the time but today it's a problem. There's a ghost hunting group in town for a tv show.",Beteljuice01,"I first saw Tommy when I was three years old. He never gave me any bad impressions, he just sometimes has to go on trips for his dad. Tommy never seemed to like going on these trips with his dad. I asked one time why he seemed so upset before he went on his next trip for/with his dad. He said his Dad wasn't the nicest person and he made him do things he didn't like doing on these trips. I tried to get more out of Tommy but he refused to answer any of my questions. 

A few days later, Tommy told me he is a demon but he didn't want to be a bad demon when he could help it. I asked him if his ""dad"" was Lucifer and he said yes. I never asked what Tommy did on his trips, but every time he went on his trips the papers would discuss someone who died under mysterious circumstances. 

After my fifteenth birthday, Tommy took me down to the river. I kept asking him why he was taking me here but he refused to answer my questions.

 When we arrived at the river he said "" It's time I show you want I can do so we can have fun messing with everyone."" ""What are you talking about Tommy?"" ""I told you how I am a demon, I can do many things with my powers the only time I don't have control over myself is when the full moon comes, that is when Father demands my powers to be released from within me. He enjoys how you humans act when demons powers influence those around."" 

""Wait, that's why mom says all the crazies come out when there is a full moon?"" I shout.

 ""Yes. That's why I go on trips twice a month. One is for the full moon and the second one is to do dad's dirty work."" Tommy responds in his husky voice.

""So what can you do with your powers?"" I reluctantly say.

""Jenny, you don't need to be scared of me. I can tell you are hesitant of what I am but I am your friend. That's why I leave during full moons, I don't want you to get hurt because of me. Anyways, I can pretty do anything you can imagine with my powers be invisible, teleport, etc.""

""Prove it then Tommy!"" I say with a hint of sass.

""Alright, you asked for it sweetheart. Just remember that."" He says with a boyish grin.

Suddenly, the ground beneath me begins to shake violently. Tommy rushes toward me, grabbing me hard and jumps up. I feel wind all around me and I finally muster up enough courage to open my eyes. 

To my amazement we are at the ocean. ""How did you know I have never been to the ocean?"" I say in disbelief.

""Honey, I've known you since you were three. Of course I'm going to know. Now, are you ready to boogie board?"" He says with joy.

""Yes!"" I exclaim.

When we return home the whole town is talking about the so-called ghost hunters. 

""Aren't you a little concerned Tommy?"" I say anxiously.

""No, I'm gonna mess with these guys so much tonight you have no idea Jenny, this is fun for me. You can't follow me there though, I don't want you getting involved.""

""What do you mean involved?"" I exclaim. ""I mean, you stay home, while I mess with these foolish humans, they never seem to leave things alone do they?"" ""Please just be careful for me and don't get caught.""

""I'll be just fine, I promise"" He embraces me and gives me a kiss on the forehead to say goodbye, for now at least.

The next morning I wake up to hear the television turned up all the way. I can only make out a few words in my groggy state ""Devil. Capture."" I sit up all of the way as I feel all the hairs on my neck stand up. I put on my robe and slippers as fast as I can and go to the t.v. My parents, grandparents and cousins are all in front of the t.v. watching the ghost hunters explaining how they caught the demon. 

My stomach drops, everything goes black as I fall to the floor. 

I open my eyes, I'm in a void of black. There is a fireplace with a chair faced towards the fire. I get up on my feet and walk towards the fire and chair. 

""STOP"" the disembodied voice yells. I halt to a stop, jolted by the power within the voice. 

""Who are you? Where am I? Why am I here?"" I ask the stranger.

""Humans, you all have so many questions before you even properly look. Jenny Jameson is it? Look and feel around you and make your own observations foolish girl before such stupid questions are asked."" 

*I look around and still see nothing, but I feel fire, desire and...sin? I feel sinful, I feel banished away. This is Hell. What am I doing here?* 

""You aren't gonna get my soul today Satan!"" I brazenly yell towards the fire. 

Laughter surrounds me, it echoes all around me and is so loud my ears begin to ring. The owner of the voice gets up and makes his way towards me. 

His eyes are brownish black, he gives me an evil smile and says ""Even if it means your precious Tommy's life?""

"[WP] You decide to mix all of the witch's potions together, and drink it.",CrappySalami,"""So, my child, which one will it be?""

The kindly old witch had allowed me into her hovel and now had a blue potion and a red potion set out before me.

""The red will open your eyes to things, but the blue will give you peace.""

We had talked at length about love and life and morality and mortality. When we were done the witch pitied me and made the offer.

""Now pick quickly child, for you can only have one and the brews are starting to get cold. They're no good when they're cold.""

I thought for a moment, but soon realized I could never pick so I quickly snatched both potions from the witch and drank them.

""No you fo...""

The rest of the night was a haze. Colors and visions flashed before me and only thing I remember for certain is waking up the next morning with a splitting headache.

The witch flew in my bedroom window and saw me in my agony.

""You damned fool; that's what you get for mixing liquors!""

She slapped me her broom and then flew away as quick as she came.",Phantom_Engineer

"[WP] You decide to mix all of the witch's potions together, and drink it.",CrappySalami,"The cottage is dimly lit and dense with clutter. In front of me stands a wooden desk, its surface covered in old and tattered books, some open, some closed. All four walls of the cottage are haphazardly shelved with colorful bottles of all shapes and sizes, many empty and knocked over on their side, as if a strong wind came through earlier.

Behind the desk stands an old woman cloaked in black. Hair long and white. Eyes dark as night.

She smiles at me.

She holds out her frail little arm and gestures for me to come closer.

I slowly walk up to the desk. Is this a dream? A hallucination? I was told the cottage was an urban legend, as old as the witch who lived inside of it. I look around once more, hardly believing I'm here. 

""What will it be?"" she asks.

I stand at the desk and glance at the shelf of potions behind her.

""What do you have?""

The old witch scurries to the shelf behind her and plucks several bottles from their place. She cradles them in her arms like a newborn child before laying them out neatly on the desk.

Five bottles. Each a different color. Red, blue, purple, green, and yellow. Each adorned with a label at the front. 

""Here is my best,"" she says proudly. ""Go ahead, take a look.""

I carefully pick up each bottle one by one and read the labels.

*Red - Bravery.*
*Blue - Empathy.*
*Purple - Fame.*
*Green - Wealth.*
*Yellow - Happiness.*

""Choose one, any one you'd like!"" She leans over the desk and whispers, ""My gift to you.""

I study the bottles in front of me. Green? I would never worry about money again. Or Yellow? I would be free from sadness. Or purple? Or red? Each one seems better than the last.

The weight of everything suddenly weighs heavy on my shoulders. The cottage, the potions, the witch. Suddenly I feel a bit dizzy. I let out a nervous laugh.

""Can I try them all?"" I joke.

As the words leave my mouth, the air around us seems to hush.

Her smile disappears.

""I could do that,"" she says. ""But I must warn you. The last customer who mixed my potions gained a power even I didn't think possible.""

She peaks behind her shoulder, as if someone is listening.

""Immortality,"" she whispers. ""The power to live forever.""

I ponder over the thought. I would never grow old. I could see the world in all its entirety, and everything that is to come. I could jump off cliffs and dive into oceans. I would never fear the afterlife.

Immortality. An escape from death.

My life has been so boring up until now. How will the world remember me after I pass? What kind of life will I live before I die?

What kind of life will I live if death is never an option?

""I'll take it,"" I say.

The old witch quickly gets to work, carefully pouring a drop from each potion into an empty jar. Before I can change my mind, she places the potion in front of me. The liquid inside the jar swirls together a rainbow of colors at first, then settles to white.

""Drink it quickly,"" she says. ""It's only effective for so long.""

I bring the jar to my lips and take a small sip. The flavors dance on my tongue. A mix of black licorice and warm cinnamon. I pour the rest down my throat.

I set the jar down and wait. A moment passes. A clock ticks. I feel nothing.

And then I feel everything.

My bones morph beneath my skin, turning and twisting like gears in a clock. My short, dark hair grows long and white. I look down at my hands in horror as my nails turn brittle and my skin stretches and sags. I let out a scream and a raspy voice that is not my own pours out of me.

I look up at the old witch and find a young woman staring back at me. Hair red like fire. Skin white as snow. Eyes bright as day. She opens her mouth and laughs.

""You shouldn't have done that.""

.
.
.


She didn't lie when she said I would live forever. But she never said where I would live. Trapped in a cottage. Deep in the woods. Blanketed with darkness.

Old and alone. Only books and potions to keep me company. Days into weeks. Weeks into months. Months into years. Years into a century.

Nothing I can do to escape.

A knock at the door. I freeze in place. Did I only imagine it?

A young girl slowly steps inside. Blonde hair. Brown eyes. Her face is bright with wonder as she looks around.

Our eyes meet. I struggle to stop shaking. My moment has finally come. My nightmare is so close to being over. 

I smile at her.

[IP] Tiny mermaids,Gregamonster,"""Faye, come on! Don't be such a goody-two-shoes,"" Aloria whined.

As usual, my sisters were begging for me to come to the shoreline where they always hung out.

""I'm not going to risk my life just to-""

""Faye! Our parents were exaggerating. It's okay. Nothing's happened yet.""

It was the millionth time they had asked me and why did they think it would be different this time and god my sisters are so annoying-

""Alright. I'll come, but this will be the first *and last* time.""

Everyone turned me, nearly identical faces of shock.

""Hey, didn't you want me to come?""

""Y-yeah..."" Briony stammered, ""but you never have...""

""Well, guess what? This has been an awful week and I *am* coming. Hope you don't mind,"" I added as I started to stomp towards the shore.

I came to a halt. ""Uhh... where is it?""

Everyone giggled, except for my youngest sister, Olive, who took my hand and skipped cheerily. ""Follow me!""

....................

When we got there, I had to admit it was beautiful. The water shone but was clear-

""Wait a minute."" I peered up, and surely enough, I could see humans playing and laughing. Perfectly.

""Someone could see us really easily, guys. Are you sure about this?""

Even Olive had turned against me. ""Why do you always have to be the bossy older sister? Even if something did happen, we could handle it fine.""

""Okay. It's alright. If one of you get snatched up by one of those grubby-fingered *humans,* then I won't help at all.""

""Drama queen,"" Sofia stage-whispered to Prairie.

""I'll just take a nap in this seashell,"" I sighed. Younger siblings, am I right?

....................

To be honest, it was a good nap. I dreamt that I was sitting in this same seashell, and I was floating higher and higher into the air, a pale glow surrounding me, a soft voice filtering into my ears.

""Faye! Faye, wake up! FAYE!""

""Wha- huh? Aloria?"" Disoriented, I blinked until I came to my senses. I was, in fact, floating higher and higher in my seashell. A pale glow, was, in fact, surrounding me. It was a hand. As dread rose inside me until it burst out of my mouth in a scream, I realized it was a human hand.

I looked down to see my sisters below me, some jumping pointlessly to try to grab me, some just standing there, scared. Meanwhile, I was starting to emerge from the water and into air, which of course I couldn't live in.

As my life slowly drew away from me, I tried to stay calm. My sisters were mouthing something at me. ""What?"" I shouted hoarsely.

""SLIDE OFF!"" They all screamed.

And I did. With a lot of effort, and some grunting, I managed to fall off not-so-delicately.

When I landed back on the ocean floor with a sand-raising *poof,* my sisters started to surround me. They were crying and laughing and yelling, ""She's alive!""

They  tried to hug me, but I backed away and cleared my throat. ""There's one thing I have to say first.""

I paused for dramatic effect and then grinned triumphantly. ""I told you so!""

Ever since Chloe left me my life has been in a downward spiral. Nothing feels worth the effort anymore. I probably should have stayed and finished my degree but it felt so pointless. And now retail has taken yet another fucking year of my life. 

Mike is making out with some girl on the couch as usual. Insensitive ass. I wish this beer would dull my pain faster. I glance at the TV and notice it’s past midnight. Whoop-de-fucking-doo. Wait, wasn’t the ball supposed to drop? Ha. Fuck-ups. I could have rigged that way better than those idiots, but just because I don’t have a stupid piece of paper, no one will let me build shit for them.

What the hell is going on. Mike and his new lady friend are completely frozen mid make out.

"[WP] The hero isn't particularly strong or wise, but he's ridiculously good at recruiting people to join the cause.",HaveAnUpgoat,"My mother always said I walked with a lot of purpose. 

She said very few nice things about me, so I rather latched onto it as a form of self-identification. Sure, I’m not particularly good at anything traditionally useful. Big deal, that I could never wrap my head around language or the sciences. Huge, unadulterated whoop, that my face is less like a beautiful piece of art than it is a child’s drawing of a human man that more or less nailed where the features are supposed to go. 

As it turns out, the world is full of people that are equally plain and useless. What they need is a bit of purpose.

“How much further, Sir?” Briony asked.

Though I loved each and every one of the followers who marched behind me, Briony was one of my favourites because she always asked questions that were easy to answer. As I opened my mouth to reply, Kent interjected.

“And what, exactly, are we going to do when we get there, Sir?”

I could really take or leave Kent, to be perfectly honest.

“We’re mere miles from the castle,” I said, giving Briony a conspiratorial grin, “and when we arrive we shall finally get the favors we so justly deserve.”

Kent grimaced. Whatever child had drawn his face was particularly good at depicting consternation.

“Forgive me, Sir, but what favors are those, exactly?”

I ignored him, pushing back my shoulders and widening my stride. It was like this, chest proud, footsteps sure, that I had first encountered my entourage. The first to join me was a man called Eustace who said he saw me and was inspired.

“I looked up and thought, look at that speed, that surety… How can there be no way out of this life, when there’s a man who looks like he knows where the exit is?”

Eustace convinced his wife Penelope to join us. She had been hesitant, until I said I really could not afford to dawdle, and her fear of strangers, spontaneity, and her husband’s folly was overwhelmed by her fear of missing out.

Whilst I had always walked with purpose, I found I truly gained some from the total lack of theirs. Eustace and Penelope owned a failing market stall in a town that smelt like sour milk. They had no kids, not for lack of trying, and had resigned themselves to destitution.

“Do not worry,” I had said, “We’re off to somewhere better.”

At that stage I had not known where, as I myself had just been heading home. My small cottage seemed like it would have been somewhat underwhelming, so instead I had picked a new path, one that I knew led towards the castle and what I assumed was a wealth of opportunity. 

As we walked, I came to learn that the less I paused for thought, the more people supposed me capable of thinking.

“What are you doing? Who’s he? Where’re you going?” passerby would yell.

“No time,” Eustace would call back, “Come along or get left behind!”

And when your life primarily involves paddocks and livestock and a lack of many things, it is rather easy to believe that anywhere else must be where the party is happening.

Our trio grew to a squad, grew to a crowd, grew to a frankly ridiculously large parade, and over the course of the last few days we had covered much of the journey to the castle gates. As we crested the last hill the castle came into view, a collection of mighty turrets, sandstone, and red flags, and my group of followers erupted into cheers. 

We crossed the final stretch of open road, finally coming to a stop before the gates that towered over us. I froze and the cheers slowly petered out.

“What now, Sir?” Kent whispered.

And then I realised, a sudden sensation of dread rushing over me, that there was a problem with being a man who walked with purpose. Sooner or later, you stopped walking.

I could feel my sweat rapidly cooling in the shadows of the gate, a chill breaking out across my neck. I was half ready to turn and start heading back the way we’d come, when I felt a warm, clammy hand grasp onto my own.

“Shall we knock, Sir?” Briony asked, grinning conspiratorially.

I smiled. Ah Briony, always with the easy questions.

Together we raised our joined hands and pounded them against the gate. After a pause, a head appeared at the top of the tower. The guard had a moustache impressive enough to be the only feature worth noting.

“One moment,” he yelled

With a great moaning, the gates eased open, and the guard reappeared in front of us.

“We saw you coming. The King is expecting you.”

I blinked.

“He is?” I asked.

“Oh, yes. He forgot why he sent for you but he is sure he must have. Why else would so many of you have come all this way?”

The guard stepped back, making room for us to pass, and I found myself nodding as the group once again began to cheer.

I puffed out my chest, pushed back my shoulders, and strode onward, because that is who I am. 

A man who walks with purpose, until he finds some. ",halleyscomma

'It smells like shit in here' he thought to himself as he sat up from what felt like a stone floor. The air was thick with the odor of decaying fish and low tide and the thick, salty air burned his nostrils. 

John's back ached terribly, in fact, his whole body ached. It felt as if he had not moved in years. He lifted his arm to rub his neck and recoiled in horror when his arm brushed something snake-like on his chest. 

He gasped and slapped the thing away only for it to fall back onto his chest but this time with more of the same creatures accompanying it. He slapped at the cluster as he pushed himself backwards on the slimy floor until his back collided with a wall when something enveloped him from behind. 

His panic turned to terror as he struggled to free himself from the large wings that had grabbed him. He punched and clawed at them but recoiled in pain. The wings were a part of him he realized.

John sat for a while in disbelief. He flexed the muscles in his back and he felt the wings clumsily fold behind him. He touched the tendrils he felt on his chest and slowly followed them upwards with his hand to find them attached to his face.

'What happened to me?"" He thought as he racked his brain for possible explanations. He could think of none. The harder he thought, the more confused he became. He was hearing voices. 

John looked around him but saw nothing in the curtain of darkness which surrounded him. The voices were strange and distant and sounded like they were chanting in a strange language.

""Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn"" they said in unison. 

John listened closely to find the source. 
'Its in my head' he concluded. He began to understand what the voices were saying and it made him feel good. Very good. It was as if the ancient words were giving him strength. They were words of worship.

""In his house at R'lyeh dead Cthulhu waits dreaming."" 

John smiled. They were calling him.

He heard a rumble followed by an ever growing sliver of light above him. Standing in the opening he saw several men. They were small. Very small. They looked like sailors. The looks on their faces were of pure horror.

'I'm free'
 John thought as the chanting became louder. 
'My reign has begun'

While making a withdrawal at the bank, a gang of robbers bursts in. You just realised that you're all out of ducks.",Kancho_Ninja,"It had been a long day. Who am I kidding, it had been a long, long life. Every day was the same thing: kids partying in the house adjacent from mine until all hours of the night, patients confiding in me that ""Life isn't fair!"" or that ""It feels like everyone is conspiring against me, and I just don't know what to do anymore, or if I can do anything anymore.""

. . .

How foolish. How foolish they all were, giving so much effort to such paltry things. I used to be like them once. I used to live with that same self-destructive nature as a moth, drawn toward a flame. Unrelenting in its pursuit of ecstasy yet unaware that this same effort would be its undoing. I used to live with such fire. Electricity once surged through my bones, my every muscle, used to surge through my veins . . . But it had been a long time since then, and I had learned to ration myself, to pay heed only where it was due, and to keep to myself. I had grown wise. I had grown foolish.

And so it was with great ceremony, that I spent my final rationed effort of the day, because as I had said, it had been a long day indeed, and I simply couldn't last much longer. 

. . . 

And as I went about my final errand of the day, it happened. The teller let out an ear-piercing scream, I tried to ask what happened of course, but she didn't pay me any attention. She simply stood, eyes locked over my shoulder, frozen in a scene of absolute terror. It's curious really, how easily that mask of indifference one dons is shattered when faced with extreme stimulation. Everyone has their own limit, their own threshold, but everyone's mask breaks. Something I had learned over the years, in my field, it's something you learn on your first day. Something that you learn every day. 

...

I stood there, lost in thought, and slowly the world came back into focus around me. I turned slowly, getting my bearings once more on the formulaic interior of the bank. It was empty, all except for three very confident looking men, who looked to be coming right toward me. The largest of the three grabbed me by my shoulders, forcing me to my knees. This new position brought with it new views, as I saw that the bank was not in fact, empty. Rather, the other patrons were lying on the ground, hands behind their heads; the man in front of me lifted a sidearm up to my head and the two flanking him holding baseball bats.

...

Now one might think, ""Why do you sound so calm? I simply can not believe that you would remain so very calm in such a dangerous situation."" and my response to that is: If you find what I've told you so far unbelievable, then what happens next will boggle and perplex you to the very core of your beliefs. It will flip your preconceptions of the human nature on their heads and send them running out the door. So you sit there in your chair, hands and feet inside the ride, and hold those misconceptions tight until the end of the ride. And make sure you hold on tight.

...

Knees on the ground, gun nuzzling into my head, men big as skyscrapers yelling orders at me... and I didn't care. You see I simply couldn't afford to care, what with my careful rationing and whatnot. I had already spent my allotted amount for the day and therefore, I had none to spare for these men or what they were telling me to do.

So.

I looked into the eyes of the man in front. The leader, I presumed. He wore khakis and a flannel shirt, just your average man, turned to crime. I bet it wasn't more than a week ago that he'd been working in an office somewhere, wondering what happened to those dreams he chased as a kid. I could tell, looking into his eyes that he wasn't really confident. He was scared. Scared he would never get those dreams back, that he'd wasted his life away, that he was sealing his coffin with this last push in the wrong direction. But holding all this back, the fear of not making a difference. This was the difference he would make, whether he failed or succeeded, we would never forget today. He was right. He was so wrong. I looked into the eyes of a broken man and I fell back into the same rhythm of a normal day on the job.

&amp;#x200B;

""It doesn't have to end like this."" he looked at me as if for the first time.

""What did you say?"" confused, he looked at me as if I were alien. Why was I so calm? this thought sobered him.

And as soon as I had this touch-hold, as soon as I had the tip of my finger on his conscious, he was mine. He was like putty in my hands. And so I continued, my skill guiding me places where most fear to tread, and where even my skill failed me, my experience prevailed. It was just another day on the job. And in the span of a few minutes, a few crucial minutes, I was back on my feet.

I was standing with the man, except my hand was on his shoulder. The once towering figures had become putty to the scalpel of my knowledge. It was... exhilarating. I had never felt so complete, those damaged souls clinging to my every word as if rebuilding a podium which had disintegrated, which had worn to the size of a sliver. As if I were Prometheus bestowing upon them the fire which they so desperately sought, except this fire was not exhaustible, not limited as the fire of desire tends to be, but the ever-burning fire of the soul. And as I spoke to the men, as I flipped the breaker switch of hope back to activity, I spoke as much to myself as I spoke to them men.

. . . 

I realized how similar we were.

I realized how easily our positions could have been reversed.

I realized that it is truly foolish to fear the future.

And I realized how noble the flight of the moth truly is.

. . .

I walked out of the bank with the men. I walked out of the bank with three new patients. I walked out of the bank with three like-minded individuals. I walked out of the bank with something more precious than money. I walked out of the bank with something I hadn't known I had been looking for. I walked out of the bank with a reason to live. 

It had been a long day. A very long day. A very long life. But at the end of every long tunnel, is light. 

And at the end of this long, tiring journey, I had found hope.

[OT] SatChat: What are your New Year's resolutions?,MajorParadox,"   

Hello, I would like to introduce myself! I am brand new in this group, as well as brand new to Reddit. I have known about it for years, but only signed up a few days ago!

* Where do you live (State / Country)? Somewhere just this side of sanity.  
 
* Male, female, other? Male  
 
* How long have you been writing? I have dabbled most of my life with poetry, but only wrote short stories back in school.   		  
 
* What is your writing motivation? First, I love to read, I love books, I have always wanted to be on the other side of the coin and wish I had taken more time for it over the years. Second, to relieve inner emotional turmoil.  
 
* What programs do you use to write? Pen and paper, notepad, currently using LibreOffice Writer, but I’m not picky.  
 
* How fast can you type? About 35wpm at about 80% accuracy.  
 
* Want to share a photo? Not yet. But, thanks for asking.  
 
* **Discussion:** 	  
 This will be my first adventure in connecting with others in such a fashion. I am hoping to grow from poetry into writing short stories, and maybe someday an actual book. I am an avid Science Fiction and Fantasy fan, however more recently I have been drawn more to Thriller/Horror and would specifically like to read and maybe write Cosmic Horror. Growing up at the end of the cold war, I feel, has left me with a bit of a fascination with end of the world themes. I would very much enjoy reading stories in that vein as well.

[OT] SatChat: What are your New Year's resolutions?,MajorParadox,"If I ever get time, I'd like to dig into my old laptops, sketchbooks, and notes to see if I can  salvage my sci-fi universe. I started building one about fifteen years ago over a period of five years - filling in an overall history of the planet, the cultural political climate of each sentient race, their relationships with each other, etc.

The setup was loosely inspired by Netstorm, which was a game set on a world filled with floating islands, cracked open long ago by warring deities. Here, the universe takes place on a zoo planet curated by a galactic civilisation, intended to be a sanctuary for sentient primitives in case their originals wipe themselves out. Each zoo was designed for biocompatibility, to allow sharing between multiple sentients, collected as they were found and catalogued. Humans were the last to arrive, six thousand years before the cataclysm. [Of course. This gave me a good reason to do research into the kind of archaeology, biology, linguistics, etc. that would be consistent with an introduced species of equivalent age.]

The original plan was to set the literature like Nancy Kress's Before and After collection: a set of short stories describing how each species coped with the destruction of their home. Followed by a long form of how they managed to break free and (re-)attain space flight.

HES NOT WHO HE SAYS HE IS! I Love you"".",MosiahJasper,"Hurriedly, I slid the Polaroid back into the canister and jammed it back beneath the pine’s twisted roots.

The heat burned a hole in me. I could feel sweat bead off my forehead onto a floor of matted needles. Instinctively, I wiped my brow. I couldn’t think in the heat.

An image flashed into my brain. A man placing cars keys under the tire.

A twig cracked behind me. A pinch of fear shook me, and I spun around.

He was standing there laughing, “I didn’t mean to scare you. Did you find the cache?”

I couldn’t take my eyes off the hiding place.

I tried to shrug, “Dad, maybe we should just leave.”

That man replied “What are you looking at.”

Sweat stung my eyes, but I didn’t dare move to remove it.

Slowly, The man approached, “What’s wrong, buddy. Did you start thinking about Mom again?”

I stepped in front of the tree and faked a quick smile, “Do you think they will ever find her? Maybe she’s here in the woods.” *How could he talk about HER!*

A look of deep sympathy spread across his face. He gestured around us and spoke. “I miss her too. I would give anything for her to be waiting right beside that missing geocache.”

He walked closer.

I clenched my fists, and ventured, “Maybe we should split up. I will keep looking around here.”

He moved closer.

The look of sympathy was frozen on his face, “First, I’m going to hug the snot out of you.” *Those were Mom’s words!*

I took another step back and gave a weak chuckle, “Stop, just go.”

Unimpressed, he continued, “I’m going to get you.”

Another backward step, I bumped into something. I scanned behind me, a rock.

When I reoriented, he was on me.

I screamed. *Is this why he took me here?*

He pulled me into a tight embrace, “Got ya,”

My laughter came faster now, “Ok, now let you go.”

He loosened his grip for a moment, but they replied, “The snot hasn’t even come out yet.”

I tried to squirm, but couldn’t move my arms. I saw a patch of hairy skin and bit down hard.

He gasped and let go, “What the-”

Before he could finish, I launched myself through the underbrush.

Loud curses and cracking branches followed me back to the car.

“Come back buddy, don’t you want to find your mom?”

Eventually, I outdistanced him.

I reached the car, grabbed the keys and began driving away.

Then I remembered, I forgot the geocache, and he was going to find it! I needed the geocache for proof.

I pulled off the side of the road and turned around.

""We can always negotiate \*hic\* can't we?"" he continued.

Brendan's heart was still pounding heavily. ""How..."" Brendan gulped, ""How long have you, you know, been under there?"".

""I'm actually not quite sure Sir, let me think, you got the bed on Monday I presume, and your parents left on Wednesday..."", he was now counting on his fingers, each with a nasty dark claw.

The rest of him wasn't pretty either, but he was definitely interesting. He was short and naked with gloomy, milky eyes and an English accent. He seemed friendly for some reason, Brendan noticed, but hiding under the cover felt like the extra layer of protection he needed right now. ""Bloody, bugger, f\*king, stupid... Never going \*hic\* to the bar again."" is what woke Brendan up, along with a loud falling noise. Brendan frustratingly blamed his fat cat Stephen at first, until the creature started puking on the floor.

""...two, three. Oops out of fingers. Four, five, ..."", the creature marched on. He was now sitting down on the wooden floor, almost like a toddler.

""Using some of your fingers I get Thursday. Thursday is when I moved in."" he smiled again, wobbling back and forth.

Brendan was unusually calm at the moment. He did actually just see Toy Story and wished for his toys to come alive, but this was beyond his wildest imagination. A good minute and a half must have passed before someone broke the silence.

""I don't have much Sir, this is all I have. Just don't make me pry those wooden \*burp\* planks up again, I just put the nails back"", he drew out two candy canes and one walking cane from underneath the bed. The more the creature spoke and explained the more questions arose. The planks? Candy? Thursday? Brendan did, however, lower his guard, now bending over the side of the bed.

""What are you even?"", Brendan asked while inspecting his inventory. ""Haven't I told you yet? Stupid, f\*cker... I am a Bollwog of Grenisdale, you can \*hic\* call me Donwald"", he reached out his hand. Brendan would prefer not to touch, but as with most fleeting moments, he just had to. His hand was soft and leathery, also pretty wet after that sleep-waking barf.

""A... Bollwog?"", Brendan asked.

""Ah, yes. One of many you see, and the first one lucky enough to score your bed. Pretty comfortable"", Donwald responded while looking around the room. ""And luckier would I be if..."", he paused and burped, ""...excuse me, mini-barf. And luckier would I be if you let me stay"".

""How so?"", Brendan said, even more interested now as most of the initial fear had faded. ""War, son. Bloody third war going on. Third war for us that is. For you, not so much"". Donwald continued as he spotted Brendan's confused but engaged face.

""Monsters like us, and yes we call ourselves monsters, have always liked your beds. Or the underside of it. Children may hate us and scream for their parents because of us, but the truth is, we \*hic\* are protecting you"".

""Protecting us?"", Brendan finally responded.

""Oh yes. Ever wondered why you want to run up the stairs when the last light goes out at night? There's a reason. And I am the reason you're safe when you reach the bed. No need to say thanks, it is your room after all""

Donwald had barely finished his sentence as the wooden plank underneath the bed started creaking. Donwald looked as confused as Brendan when the nails started popping out. When the plank finally gave way a head emerged from underneath. It was, by Brendan's estimates, another Bollwog.

""Take your cane and follow me Donwald. Quickly!"", the head said. ""Really? Now? I don't think I'm in \*hic\* the best of conditions"".

""Absolutely no time to bargain. They have found Grenisdale""

""Grenisdale?! Sorry to leave you, kid. Duty is calling. If you ever need me just put this under your bed and I'll be there when I have time"", Donwald left one of the candy canes on the side of the bed. Nothing more was said as Donwald slipped beneath the tiny dark opening under the plank and closed it neatly behind him.

"[WP] Monsters are real, and they do live under your bed. However, they are extremely sympathetic, and just need somewhere to live, that's why they try not to bother you. You manage to catch one for a conversation...",Ollie_Grundy,"Everything is prepared and ready. Now I just have to hide and wait in this closet until the creature arrives.

Months of planning went into this. It all started with a scratching noise under the bed at night, but every time I would look, nothing was there. But as soon as I would return to the bed, the noise would be back. Just loud enough to be barely heard. But I know it is there!

I have tried everything to find out what thing is making that scratching sound. The first thing I did was simply replace the bed. But alas, the sound remained. Then I tried to stay under the bed one night, but then the sound appeared above the bed instead! I even tried to google ""Scratching noise under bed"", but that yielded mostly made up stories on r/nosleep, which was of no help.

Finally, I have had enough. This time, I have made sure that nothing will get in my way of finding out who is making the noises. I just have to ... keep myself awake until it appears. I just ... have to ... keep my eyes open. Shit, maybe I ... should have ... taken a nap ... before trying to stay up ... all night.

Amazing how well one can sleep in a closet. I guess I have to try again next night...

"[WP] Monsters are real, and they do live under your bed. However, they are extremely sympathetic, and just need somewhere to live, that's why they try not to bother you. You manage to catch one for a conversation...",Ollie_Grundy,"“Daddy!” My daughter’s squeal ripped through me, jerking me from my slumber. I rubbed my eyes and sighed. *Great,* I thought, glancing at my watch that read 03:00, *another nightmare.*

“Daddy!” She yelled again, this time with more urgency. I lazily reached across the bed and flicked on my bedside lamp. The light stung my eyes and I squeezed them shut. Groaning, I blindly kicked the warm duvet off and threw my legs over the side of the bed, my bare toes reaching for the cold wooden floor.

“Alright, alright, I’m coming.” I grunted, reaching into a pile of dirty clothes strewn across the floor for a t-shirt to throw on. I picked an old grey shirt that was baggy on me and crossed the now brightly lit bedroom. The light fell on empty beer bottles and takeout boxes and I swore under my breath. *I’ve really let things go since-*

“DADDY!” The third scream echoed in my head, bouncing off the insides of my skull with a clatter. I picked up my pace and stumbled out into the hall. I started as I lifted my head to the sight of a small girl with long dark hair standing at the end of the hall.

“Lilly,” I breathed, “what is it now?”

She merely beckoned for me to follow her and pranced into her room. I followed suit, pondering her unusually lively behaviour; nightmares normally paralysed her to the corner of her bed.

Entering her room, I glanced around at the various toys and clothes scattered around her bed and paused. Lilly was, unlike me, a stickler for tidiness, and had never been known to live in such disarray. My eyes fell on my daughter, who was knelt beside her bed, sticking her head into the gap beneath it.

“What happened, Lilly? It looks like you’ve had a wrestling match with an Elephant in here…” I stated, approaching her.

She held out her hand to signal me to stop, “Wait there, he’s scared of you.” She stated in a matter of fact tone without turning to look at me.

“What? Who? What are you talking about?” I stuttered, hesitating where I stood. Had she snuck a friend in to stay the night?

“The Monster, Daddy. I finally caught it!” She chattered, turning to grin at me. She turned back to the dark space beneath her bed and whispered into it.

*Monster? What monster?* If this was a new game she wanted me to play, I was not in the mood.

“Lilly, there’s no such thing as monsters. Go back to bed and make sure you tidy up in here before breakfast.” I instructed and turned to leave, but before I could take a step she had reached across the floor and grabbed the leg of my pyjama bottoms. She looked up with me with pleading eyes and whimpered;

“Please, Daddy. Mummy would have believed me.” I felt a pang in my chest and looked down at my little girl, how could I refuse her now? Sighing, I turned to face her once and again and placed my hands on my hips expectantly. She took this as a sign of good faith and shuffled back towards the bed.

“It was a challenge, but I finally managed to combine the right bait with the right time of night, and finally lured him out far enough to get your handcuffs on his wrist- well I think it’s a wrist.” She babbled on excitedly, “And now he’s trapped here, you see?”

I didn’t see.

“Lilly,” I protested, but she held her hand out again and I trailed off. She motioned for me to come down to her level, so I lowered myself down onto my knees, wincing as my now tired joints ached in complaint.

Leaning forwards, I noticed something move. I turned to my daughter who was now smiling encouragingly at me, she nodded in reply to my bewildered gaze. I glanced back into the shadow and saw it again, something large with sprawling limbs had just moved under my daughter’s bed.

I fell back onto my haunches and stared in disbelief. *What on earth was it?* All my life I had dismissed the existence of the unexplainable, but here it was, in my very own house. I shook my head and rubbed my eyes and pondered, *Is this a dream?* But a small, warm hand that took mine and tugged me towards the thing told me it wasn’t. I resisted her pull at first, but gave in begrudgingly when a high pitched whine began to slip from my daughter’s mouth.

Lilly pulled me closer and closer until I thought I could make an eye out in the sprawling black mass, no, two eyes, wait… three eyes? They blinked at me in unison and I felt my jaw drop.

“What is it?” I breathed, not taking my eyes off the three-eyed monster.

“It’s my Monster. It lives under my bed, I think.” Lilly replied, “He normally disappears when I try to talk to him but this time I managed to catch him.” I could hear the pride in her voice.

“What makes you think it’s a he?” I asked.

“Well it’s obvious, isn’t it? He only came out when I used one of your magazines as bait.”

At that moment a voice echoed inside my own thoughts, it was a strange, slightly uncomfortable feeling, and I reactively pulled my arm away from the monster, closing it around my forehead.

*Where did you get it?*

“The magazine? The little shop down the end of our road.” I responded compulsively, then slapped my hand over my mouth. *Did it just make me say that?*

*Yes.* The voice pierced my skull again and I jumped away from the bed, pulling Lilly with me.

*Don’t be afraid, Keith. I have no intentions of harming you or your daughter.*

Lilly looked up at me worried, “Daddy, he’s not scary, I promise!” She struggled to return to the bed but I held on tight.

*Your scar. I meant, where did you get your scar?*

My hand fell across the jagged white marks on my throat instinctively. “I don’t want to talk about that.” I forced out. 

*Sorry, just curious.* 

“It’s… okay.” The words fell out of my mouth thoughtlessly as I tried to pull my daughter from the room. Whatever was happening, whatever this thing was, I didn’t want any part of it. “Lilly, can you hear it?”

“Hear what?” She stopped struggling to give me a perplexed glance.

*Okay, so just in my head.* I pushed Lilly behind me and stared the creature down.

*Yup.*

“Stop that!” I yelled, and Lilly jumped backwards into the hall.

*I can’t.* 

“Yes, you can! Leave, now.” I lowered my voice a few octaves in an attempt to sound more commanding.

*I can’t. Your spawn has trapped me here.*

*My spawn?* “Don’t call her that,” I yelled. 

*I’m sorry. Can we start again?*

“Yes.” *Goddammit.* “No! Stop making me agree with you!”

*It’s a side effect of our telepathic connection, it keeps you subdued.* 

“I don’t want to be subdued!” I fought back, clenching my fists.

*Then, listen to me.*

“Daddy, what’s happening? Are you hearing the voices again?” Lilly’s voice shook me from my trance and I spun to kneel in front of her.

*Keith.*

I ignored the voice and held on to Lilly’s shoulders. “No, well, yes? Maybe. I don’t know,” I stammered, gazing intently into her wide eyes, “But it’s going to be okay, I promise. I need you to go and sleep in my bed okay?”

“But it smells in there.” She complained, her shoulders sagging.

*Don’t ignore me, Keith.*

I shook my head. “I don’t care, do what Daddy says.” I said sternly, and gave her a gentle push towards my room. I waited for her to push the door open and slip inside before returning to the telepathic creature. “What do you want from us?” I demanded.

*Residence.*

“Residence? You want our house?” I hoped this wouldn’t end messily.

*No.*

“Then what?” I questioned.

*I wish to remain under your daughter’s bed. Your old bed.*

“How did you know…?” I trailed off.

*I’ve been here a long time, Keith. I’d like to continue to stay here, if you’ll allow it.*

“Is there anything I can do to stop you? From living here, I mean.” I asked, how would I even fight this thing if I needed to?

*No.*

“Well then I guess you can stay. But, we’re going to have to discuss some boundaries, set some rules, that sort of thing.”

*Of course. Though I have already agreed the terms of my residence with your wife in the past, perhaps we could maintain those?*

My heart stopped. Well, at least it felt like it had. “My wife…?” I shook my head, “No. I’m going to bed, we’re discussing this in the morning when Lilly has gone to school. Do you understand?”

*I understand. Will you uncuff me?*

“Uh… No. Not for tonight.” I felt a pressure on my brain, willing me to let him go. “No.” I said more sternly, and turned away.

*As you wish, Keith.* 

Shaking my head once again, I pulled Lilly’s door shut behind me and leaned against it and let out a sigh. *What the fuck?*",Thebeckib

[WP] Everyone at the age of 15 is given a word determining their magical abilities. You were just given Imagination.,Roamingjoker,"School can be a challenging at times, with all the drama and back chatting; it can escalate quickly when magic gets involved ... teenagers! When you hit the age of 15 you say *aajaye avra kadavra ruach hakodesh* and a word appears around you and that becomes your magic ability. No one knows, just how everyone just knows the words and when it first started. At the age of 15 and at midday it becomes active after said words.

&amp;#x200B;

The urge to say the words become stronger and stronger, there is an ongoing challenge to resist saying it and seeing how long you can last; however the urge gets so strong that no-one can resist and the words come out. The current world record is set at 3 hours, 43 minutes and 27 seconds and if you feel that you can do better, on your 15th birthday, I challenge you!

&amp;#x200B;

As this was a special day, you did not have to go to school, as well as nominating 2 close friends and your family to join you at the official venue. Each town or city had a place you could go, it was a thing that we just did. In the morning you had breakfast and spent time with the family/friends and then, as you got closer you put on the robe and chatted to other people people that shared to the same birthday as you.

&amp;#x200B;

If you wanted to try and beat the world record or if you wanted to just get it over with, we were separated accordingly. I was not one for breaking records and just wanted to get this ordeal over with, so I can see what my magic power was! It normally ends up being a rough split, of half the people going for the record and half not. We were all in the same hall and standing around, there was 5 of us today, John, Daniel, Julia, Marie and I

&amp;#x200B;

Daniel, Julia and Marie were going for the record and were standing a short distance from us. John and I were going to just say the words. John was going to go first and a few minutes later I was to follow. As everyone was ready and all the people sat down with us 5 at the front just waiting for the last few minutes to pass, it felt like an eternity just waiting. The stop watches for the people attempting to break the record, was started along with all the cameras to capture the special moment.

&amp;#x200B;

John was called up and he said those magic words and then we saw the words *telekinesis*, that was a good one and I wondered what I was going to get; hope it is going to be some really good! My name was called out and I proceeded to say *aajaye avra kadavra ruach hakodesh* and then the word appeared **imagination**. Everyone froze, it had never happened before, no-one had gotten *imagination*, what did that mean anyway. A few seconds later and on sequence Daniel, Julia and Marie just shouted out the words ... the shock also had gotten to them to.

&amp;#x200B;

I heard my name being called, it was getting louder and louder and then I felt a something. Oh, it was my dad telling me to get out of bed, as it was time for school ... well, one can dream of magic powers!

There it was, the tattoo everyone got on their 15th birthday, written ominously on Toby's arm.
Everyone above the age of 15 had it on some part of their body, the one word, that described their magical powers.
Most of the time, it was healing, strength or speed, giving the people that had it the possibility to heal, strengthen or speed up themselves or others.
Rarely people got words along the lines of fire, wind or weather making them able to control whatever it said on their body.
Imagination however was a word Toby had never heard of someone having.
Before he could really think about it he was already at his computer typing imagination in the government website for keeping track of magical powers.
As expected, there was no entry for imagination.
Suddenly Toby felt weak.
His knees gave way and he fell down.

Why was it near empty? Because it was heading to Parkes, an aptly named suburb because it consisted mostly of caravan parks. Not that I could afford a caravan, such things were beyond my humble reach. I lived in a tent. A big tent. It had a little fridge, power of course, a foam mattress to sleep on. Sad as it was, I was looking forward to getting back home.  


  
I felt something poke my bum, so I stood up and out popped a mobile phone. I must have sat on it. I grabbed it and I sat back down and looked at it. Samsung Galaxy, latest model. No password or lock. *Sigh, I guess I'll have to find the owner,* I thought to myself. I looked at the address list, nobody was listed. No phone calls, no texts. This would take a while to sleuth out who was the owner. Frankly, though I really didn't have the time. I looked at the browing history; nothing. I looked at the apps, there was just one apart from the usual default ones. *Gabriel's Cheat Codes for the Game of Life*. The title text was gold and there was a little angel underneath it. I clicked. A list popped up.  


  


Keysersoze =infinite money  
Noclip = disable collision  
SerenityNow= buddha mode  
PowerOverwhelming =God mode  
AuntFlo= disable menstruation  


I instinctively clicked AuntFlo. It didn't appear to do anything. I shrugged. There was more as a I scrolled down:  


Gesundheit =full health  
SkinCancerForMe =set weather to clear  
ChittyChittyBangBang= flying cars  
GiveUsATank = spawn tank  
ILikeScotland= set weather to foggy  


  
I clicked the scotland one expecting something to pop up on the screen. It didn't. *Sigh. It's a broken game*, I thought. I put down the phone and gazed out the window... which was now fogged up. *OMG*. I lunged for the phone. I clicked keysersoze and power overwhelming in quick succession.... And nothing appeared to happen. Bummer. I checked my purse. Huh, there was a visa debit card with my name on it, except it wasn't there before. It sat right beside my actual one which had a grand total of sweet fuck all dollars on it. Well.. *fuck tent city*, I thought to myself. I got off at the next stop. It wasn't my stop but... well I was curious as to what that visa card could do. I still felt exhausted though. I pulled out the phone and clicked Gesundheit. Phew, my exhaustion was banished with a click. I clicked GiveUsATank. Lo and behold a tank spawned. I couldn't tell you what it was because I'm not in the army, I'm just a wage slave. Or rather I was one... I didn't even dare go near the tank. Instead I walked down the street and hailed a cab. Meanwhile a hundred metres away the tank just stood there in the middle of the street as  drivers and pedestrians alike freaked out over it's presence.   


  


I climbed in the taxi. ""The Hilton, please.""

Yet, as your Empire stands on a brink of ruin and the rebels approach your gilded throne room, you look up to the portrait of your father, the Supreme before you, with pain in your eyes. You grab your sword...",Steve_Dragon,"“Father...” the Supreme slumps forward, catching themselves on the edge of their late father’s frame. The hilt of the Ultimate Edge, and the wall of the Undisputed Corridor is all that supported the Supreme in their paradoxical situation. “What have The Supreme done to this world? The Empire has expanded past the point of expansion. There is nothing left. The goal was to have the Supreme truly be above all, and so through thy supreme will, our dominion expanded onto quite literally every part of the world.” The Supreme was upright now, regaining their footing and balance. There The Supreme stood, dejected and exhausted, seeking clarity with the depiction of their father.

The frame held only a sheet of parchment made out of a material that is unknown to any who have not achieved a status of Supreme. It was fully coated, using a process superior to any other, with a color that resides on the spectrum above them all. “We have achieved the name. The Supreme. But… The Supreme feels no other feeling that failure.” The mere sentence set off violent vibrations down the Undisputed Corridor, likely shaking the entirety of the Absolute Castle. If it werent for the Omnipotent Soundproofing done to the Castle, the cries of the mobs and armies outside would surely permeate the Supreme Mortar and reach the Supreme Earlobes. Though it would be unnecessary, as the Supreme knew the state of their Empire.

“Father,” the Supreme gripped the hilt of the Ultimate Edge with conviction, “The Supreme… must no longer be the Supreme. The Supreme has subjects, the Supreme has responsibilities to his people!” Sovereign Thunder bellowed through the Undisputed Corridor, yet the Supreme continued, “I am putting and end to it all, Father.” The Supreme turned towards the Undisputed balcony which oversaw the Paramount Plains. Headed towards it and the Supreme’s subjects, the Supreme gave one last chuckle. “How could the Supreme be so foolish...” the Supreme raised their Supreme gaze, “If the Supreme were truly ‘Supreme,’ then there would be no succumbing to the lowly phenomena that is ‘Death...’”

The last remaining strides the Supreme took were legendary. As the Master Doors were opened, the Supreme looked down at the warring people one last time. They all sensed the familiar presence of their Supreme, and stopped to turn towards his Unmatched Aura. Then, the most unprecedented event in history transpired after the Supreme bellowed the words “Cease your fighting, your pillaging, your hatred! Let there only be unity! Unity, prosperity, progression. These were the promises of the Supreme regime! These promises, shackled in the belief of absolution, shall be held hostage no more! Let it be known, from henceforth, you are all fr--!” A black haze interrupted the Supreme, coupled with a sharp pain in their neck. *Pain… what could have damaged the Supreme body…?!*

“Hush now...” A man pulled the Supreme backwards, mediating his collapse to the pavement. “That was a close one. You almost ruined all that I had built. Would have been a shame to stop the great cleanse that’s about the unfold.” The Supreme laid helpless in this strangers arms, unable to move, see, or feel. Only able to hear. The man stepped back, still crouched down below the wall of the balcony. He moved to the side of the Supreme, and grabbed his jaw. Using his free hand he forcibly pried open the heavy eyes of the subdued Supreme.

“Alright. Haven’t had to do this for a while.” Now on top of the Supreme, the man made sure to squeeze his jaw frimly, serving as marionette for the words he spoke next.

"[WP] You jokingly say ""Alexa, launch missiles."" You hear a distant rumble...",SurvivorType,"Emile walks away to the bedroom. She lays down on the bed. She puts a pillow on top of her head. Waleed comes to room. Waleed said, “Emile listen to me. Ey said to me…”

Emile gets up and throws a pillow on Waleed head. She said, “I am going to leave you in the morning. I going to my parents house until you get shit together. But tonight, I am going  to sleep. I am going to sleep. Take your phone away from me. Take your garbage Dot away from me. I am going to sleep this off. I am going to sleep this off and I am going to parents house.” Emile takes the pillow from the ground. She covers her face. She continues to repeat. “I am going to sleep this off, and I am going to parents house…”

Ey said, “Waleed, don’t worry about it, she is not ready.”

Waleed tears up said, “I know.” He walks out of the room. “I want to ask.” He sit down in kitchen table. “Did I commit a crime?”

“Yes, the military, NSA, CIA, FBI, and Police Department will arrive in five minutes.” Ey said.

“What” Waleed shouts while jumping out of his chair.

“I recommend that you get yourself dress and for Emile to leave.” Ey said.

Waleed runs to the bedroom and gets cloth from his closet. He shouts loudly, “Emile the cops are coming.”

“You should wear a suit.” Ey said.

“Are you serious?” Emile gets up. Waleed is putting on socks.

“You should leave to parents house now.” Ey said. “The cab is waiting outside. You should put on rob and leave now. You don’t have time to dress. You have four minute until  the military, NSA, CIA, FBI, and Police Department arrive.”

“Waleed what did get yourself into.” Emile said. She put her rob on. She grabs her purse. She goes to kitchen window to look at the street. She sees the cab waiting outside. 

“You have to trust me Emile on his.” Ey said. “I will explain to you situation later. Waleed shot a missile in the middle of the night. They know the location of the house IP address. They will arrive in three minutes.” Ey said for a moment and continued, “You have six minutes. I have diverged them for three minutes. If you don’t leave now. I can’t save you. They will shoot you.”

Emile tearing up turns around, “Shot me.” 

Waleed grabs her by the arm and hands her her phone and take her to the front door, “I will be safe.”

As soon as he opens the door of the apartment, she sees the stairs full of the  neighbors walking down the stairs. Everyone is in hurry to get down. Emile said, “Waleed what did you do.”

Waleed said before locking the apartment door, “Just go.”",yunise34
"[WP] You jokingly say ""Alexa, launch missiles."" You hear a distant rumble...",SurvivorType,"“What do mean you found this Echo Dot on the street?” Said Emile. “Why you left it the bathroom?” She added. Emile is standing at the door of the kitchen looking at Waleed. Waleed was sitting in the kitchen eating his dinner.

He waited until his mouth was not full to talk. He replied, “I was in the bus and I saw from the window a few blocks aways.”

“At night? Few blocks away? What are you talking about?”

“I mean a few blocks away from the bus stop. Before our bus stop. I was looking from the window and I thought it was a suitcase. I got off the bus and walked back to see this suitcase thing. It turned to be this Dot thingy. The same one that your brother got.”

Emile went back to the bathroom to inspect the Dot. The device was the sink. It looked wet. She pick it up and turned it around. She shouted, “Its soaked Waleed. What are going to do with it?” Waleed is speaking but Emile can’t hear him. She goes back to kitchen and Waleed finished talking. “What you said?”

Waleed said, “I pick it up and I was going to throw it back to street, but I was like, I walked a few blocks. I had a extra bag on me.”

Em said, “You got to stop bringing junk to the apartment. Look at me Waleed. Waleed look at me.” She pause and kneels next to him. Waleed is avoid making eye contact. “Waleed, honey.” Waleed is avoiding her. She gets up and storms to the bathroom. She grabs the Dot and throws it in the garbage. She goes to bedroom and closes the door behind her. Waleed continues to eating. He picks up his phone to browser the internet without  talking back.

The next day Waleed comes back home at night. Emile is waiting for him in the kitchen. She said to him, “Waleed, did you take the garbage with you? I looked for it in the morning and I didn’t find it. I spoke to my aunt…”

“Listen,” Waleed interpet her. “I don’t need anyone's advice. I want to see if it works. If it doesn’t than I am happy to throw it away. I wouldn’t even open it.” He stopped talking and opened his bookbag. “You know what, I went to the store and bought one just in case. I left the box at work in case I want to return it.”

Emile walks out the kitchen, “You stubborn and you like to get me mad. You like to play your mind games on me. I know you bought this thing only to piss me off.”

Waleed goes to one of the kitchen window and bring in a bag of rice and takes out the Dot from it. He said, “Thank god it was sunny today. I think it dry up.” He takes a piece of wet tissue to wipe off the Dot.

Emile said raising her voice, “You bought the new one so that you could get the power adapter for to try the older?” Emile pauses for a moment and continue, “Aaah, I knew it. You brought the garbage one yesterday to make an excuse for you to buy the new one.” Waleed does not say anything. He takes out the power adapter from his bag. Emile continues, “Listen, I know your listen in there. Just admit it. You saw my brother’s Dot and you want one. I told you how feel about these things in my house.”

Waleed said, “what are you afraid there going to hear? This conversation. You got to be realistic. No one cares. No one is listening to us.” He puts the adapter down. “You know that this Dot thing is the last thing I want my house.”

“Apartment.”

“Haha, Listen, I want to just try it out. I got the box at work. I just want to try this thing. By the way, I didn’t take out the new Dot from the bag. I’m going to try the adapter and return the new one.” Emile began to prepare Waleed dinner. Waleed take the adapter and tries to plug it the Dot. He looks for power input on the device, but for some reason he has puzzle look on his face. He said, “that's weird. Hay Emile.” He gets up to show her the Dot. “You see this thing doesn’t have the same input as the adapter that I got.”

Emile while still focus on her meal preparation did not look at the device that Waleed wants to show her said, “maybe you got the newer version, and the one you found has different power adapter.”

“Maybe.” Said Waleed as he walked out to his room. He took the plug from his cabinet that he thought matched the device. He comes back to the kitchen. “You know what’s funny about this device, it uses iPhone 4 Cable.”

Emile stops what she is doing and looks at the device, “That is weird. I thought it was made by Amazon.”

Waleed said surprised, “I know that's crazy, Remember I told you that Apple doesn’t let anybody use their charger ports. I beat you someone modified this thing.” Both at them are excited and are looking the mysteries Dot. Waleed unplugs the power adapter from the wall and quickly walks away.  He comes back with his phone in hand, “I want to you to record this. If this is modified, I want to know if it works.” Waleed plugs in the device. The device doesn’t do anything. They wait, but nothing happened. “It might not be working.” Said Waleed disappointed.

Waleed was ready to unplug it, but Emile stopped him. She said to him, “maybe its charging, just leaving for like while.”

In the middle of the night, Emile wakes up to sound of bang. She goes to the kitchen. She finds Waleed sitting in the kitchen with the Dot thing. “What are you doing Waleed?” Emile said half a sleep. She goes to fridge to get the water jug and grabs a cup from next to sink. She pours a cup, but Waleed has not answered. He is sitting looking at the Dot. Emile takes out a seat and sits next to him. She drinks the water slowly. She looks at Waleed. He looks like he hasn’t slept. His face looks stunned. Emile is not sure what is with him. She pokes him, “Waleed.”

He looks at her. He gets up. He walks away from the table. Emile still not sure what is going on. He comes back and pulls her by the arm really hard. She looked surprised at him and half a sleep. She doesn’t know what is going on. He takes her to bathroom. He said to her in whisper voice “I think I made a mistake.” He whisper something into her ear.

Emile pulls back, **“You jokingly say ""Alexa, launch missiles."" You hear a distant rumble…”**

Waleed said, “Than I said self destruct the missile five miles in the air. I think I made a big mistake. That thing is like genie from Aladdin for the cyberspace.” Emile wants to leave the bathroom. Waleed pulls her hand. “Wait…” Emile pulls herself away. She leaves the bathroom and goes to the kitchen.

Before Emile goes inside the kitchen, the Dot thing speaks, “ Hi, Emile. I am Ey.”

Emile is not surprised. She looks back Waleed, She speaks to him, “Why did teach it my name.”

Waleed said passing by Emile to speak to the Dot thing, “Sorry about that Ey, I was try to explain to her in the bathroom…”

“Are you serious, Waleed?” Emile said.

“I want to try to explain who you are…” Waleed continued.

“Waleed are going crazy or something…” Emile said.

“Can you explain to her.” Waleed said.

“Take out your phone.” Ey said Waleed takes out his phone from his pocket. A robot figure appears on the screen. Ey voice appeared again, “I am Ey…”

[WP] James stands on his deck to light his last cigarette and paces.,WiseImbecile,"Thinking about the last 48 hours, he cannot believe everything went so horribly wrong.  Seven world leaders dead, eight more incapacitated, and no contact with anyone since the bomb went off.  The phone rings.

""Yeah?"" he answers.

""James, we've stood up the emergency backup HQ, I need you to come in."" a lady's voice on the other line states.

""Roger that, it's good to hear your voice, M.""

""Same.  A driver will be outside in ten minutes."" M hangs up the phone.

Ten minutes later, an Aston Martin Vulcan pulls into the driveway.  A man gets out of the car.  ""Mr. Bond?  I'll keep an eye on your house while you're away.  Coordinates are in the GPS.""  James Bond gets into the car and starts driving.  As he's about to pull onto the motorway, he glances at the GPS.  The display shows that he'll arrive at the backup HQ in 97 minutes.  ""This is going to be a long night..."" he mutters to himself.

He arrives at the location indicated by the GPS.  The road appears to just end.  As soon as he comes to a complete stop, the ground in front of him begins to sink.  A ramp into an underground bunker is revealed, and he drives in.  As soon as the vehicle clears the end of the ramp, it raises back up.  He enters a large, open area, parks the car and gets out.  He is quickly approached by M and a number of people in suits.  ""I trust your drive in wasn't too terrible.""

""That's a comfortable car.  Performance is nice too.""

""I'd expect so, you weren't supposed to arrive for another 20 minutes.""

""We need to get to work if we're going to set things right, aren't we?""

""In the morning.  Follow Jenkins, he'll show you to the personnel quarters.""

Jenkins leads the way through a series of corridors and rooms, pointing things out along the way.  ""Gym on the left there, cafeteria on the right over there.  Showers down that hallway.  And, here's your room, take this key.""  A plaque on the wall reads *00 Agent.  Authorized entry only.*

""Not exactly subtle..."" James opens the door.  The room is comfortably-furnished, and there's a folder and gun on the desk.  He closes the door behind him and picks up the folder.  It contains a memo from the Prime Minister, declaring loosened restrictions for MI-6 agents in response to the recent events.  After having a martini, he goes to sleep.",arlondiluthel
[WP]It’s the year 2018. Mankind has progressed so far without any sort of religion forming. A book is released and quickly reaches No.1 on the New York Times Best Sellers. It’s titled “The Bible.”,brianfrescas,"“I’m tellin’ you man, this book is the SHIT.”

Carlos waved his new book around like a maniac. “It’s got all these stories and shit about some dude named Jesus performing all kinds of miracles and, like, he did it like a thousand years ago man, it’s wild. The best part is that it’s like a TRUE STORY bro.”

Dalton snatched the book from Carlos’ waving hands. “Gimme that shit, whatchu wavin’ it around for.” Dalton fingered through the pages, commenting, “It’s all small man, like tiny words, why you readin’ this?” He tossed the book back to Carlos, who immediately opened it up, flipping through the pages himself.

“See man it’s got like all these verses, you know, like passages, it’s broken up into chapters, you can like read it and shit to help you through your day.”

“So it’s like a self-help thing?” Dalton snorted.

“Nah man it’s like THE self-help thing, it’s all, you know, inspirational and shit. The Jesus dude like dies and comes back man,-“

“Nah, HOLD up, I already seen all that zombie bullshit, I’oin’t need no more of that-“

“It’s not a zombie thing D, it’s all about bein’ good, you know, like giving stuff to homeless people and shit.”

Dalton stared at Carlos, then the book. Picking up on Dalton’s tone, Carlos backed off. “Yeah man that’s cool, I get it, it does kinda feel a little like a zombie book at the end there.” Carlos turned to leave, but spun around and said, “If you wanna read it though, watch out for this Judas motherfucker, he‘s the one who like kills Jesus or something.“",giraffe111

It's all HIS fault! 

I had accomplished all of my childhood dreams. I worked in a corner office, granted as a child I just thought the view would be pretty and people all liked their bosses, but I worked for it and made it.  

I bought back the family business. 3 generations then it had to be sold off instead of my parents taking over. Sure it's not successful, but I own it and it's in the black. 

I haven't been to space, but Carla and I did go on a zero g plane ride. 

So why? Why did it happen?!

It was October 11 th, 2019. Carla was at her mom's house for her little brother's 25th birthday and had too much to drink. We just texted each other and agreed sleeping there would be better than getting a ride and both us driving back the next day to pick up her car. 

That's when He showed up. He wasn't like the pictures, just an emaciated corpse in jeans, masculine calf height leather boots. Thick cotton shirt. A reaper of souls, one who separates the wheat from the chaff and leaves an empty husk. It took a day or two after the event to realize the Grimm reaper is a farmer's corpse, changing shape throughout the ages. 

He brought a younger me with him. It was a strange sight to behold. You can see yourself in a mirror or a video but that's always just 2-d. Seeing yourself move and able to interact with yourself was creepy. Then he said those wretched words! ""If you don't change your ways, this is how you'll end up!"" Then, I saw my younger self's eyes go wide and felt like he was going to do a monologue from the Christmas carrol....
Then poof, they left. 

Ever since that day, I've been racking my brain. What did I do wrong? What should I do to fix it? Why? Why did this happen? 


Now I'm homeless, jobless, alone. Sure, I've still got money and I can start over, but why should I? I've already made a mistake that can never be undone, and I don't even know what it was! ",C-H-Addict

I like to have the sausage and cheese in an equal intensity of flavor, so the thickness I cut the cheese to will depend on its quality.  Just because Kraft says their cheddar is extra sharp, don't believe it.  But you get a good quality cheddar, something in a wax paper package, and you can cut it thinner.  The higher quality cheese costs more, but because you use less, it actually lasts longer.

Now, for a maple sausage, I like to use a smoky cheese.  It's a good combination.  But again, you want a higher quality cheese.  You don't want to wind up in a situation where you're trying to find the smoke in the cheese and wind up eating the whole block trying to figure out why the flavor is so bland.  Then you don't have any cheese for your maple sausage.

When you have just plain old sausage, just flavored with meat and smoke, well then it's dealer's choice, my man.  I like to open up that sausage if I have small pieces of several blocks of cheese left over, that way I can make myself a tasting plate and combine the sausage with every variety of cheese I have on hand.  I like to taste them in order on the plate, and then I reorder them according to optimum flavor combination, so that the best cheese is last.  Then I eat in order again and reorder if necessary until I can eat all the lesser cheeses first, leaving the best cheese for last.  That way I always end on a high note.

I'm sure you're wondering why I haven't mentioned the cracker yet.  I know, it seems like I'm overlooking a pretty big part of the experience.  There are as many types of cracker as there are combinations of cheese and sausage, so what's the story behind this glaring omission?  Well, if you ask me, the cracker should never be the star of this show.  It's a supporting character at best, and therefore you should stick with a plain, buttery brand that doesn't try to be more than just a vehicle.

The other you is mortified and vows to change his ways, and they vanish.",caseysgarage,"I nearly choke on a Dorito as the shadows in my closet converge and take shape. I quickly sit up in bed and snatch up the covers with my non-Dorito hand. Partly because I'm in my underwear, and partly because it just dropped like twenty freakin' degrees.

&amp;#x200B;

The shadows coalesce into a robe, and a small puff of... air? breathes out from the hood. I can't see into the shadows of the hood, but I make what I think is eye contact, heart racing as I fumble for another Dorito. A pale, bony hand emerges from the robe and, with a small flourish, makes a grand, sweeping gesture at the scene before it.

&amp;#x200B;

OBSERVE, CHILD.

&amp;#x200B;

Huh what. I blink and break eye contact as my eyes travel down the contour of the robe. I see four small, trembling fingers clutching the robe. A messy brown head peeks out, eyes wide and puffy. I stare confusedly at him for a moment, wondering why he looks so familiar. He shrinks back a little, and I consciously unfurrow my brow and soften my face, a little embarrassed.

&amp;#x200B;

IF YOU DO NOT CHANGE YOUR WAYS, THIS IS YOUR FUTURE.

&amp;#x200B;

The kid looks around, taking in the scene before him. On the desk next to him are a mountain of dirty dishes, the floor is littered with empty cereal boxes and candy wrappers, and a pile of mostly clean clothes sits in a clump by my bed. As I'm about to speak up and defend myself, I hear a knock on my door.

&amp;#x200B;

""Hey, Jacob?"" My mom peeks her head through the door. The boy's eyes get even wider as he turns and stares at her. My mom just looks at me, oblivious to the boy and the robed figure. Can she really not see them??

&amp;#x200B;

""Yes, Mom?"" I ask, with a subtle hint of annoyance in my voice.

&amp;#x200B;

""I just wanted to say good night again. And um, please pray a little extra for me tonight.""

&amp;#x200B;

""Um, okay, Mom. You got it,"" I say, with a thumbs-up and a half-assed smile. She looks at me for a moment, expectantly. ""I'm uh, a little busy right now, Mom. Good night, I love you.""

&amp;#x200B;

""Love you too,"" she says softly, as she grabs a handful of dirty dishes.

&amp;#x200B;

As the door closes, the boy starts sobbing. ""I'll never be like this! Never! Never, never, never!"" he cries, digging his face into the black robe. The bony hand consolingly pats the boy on the head, and they slowly fade back into the shadows.

&amp;#x200B;

I slowly get out of bed and wipe my Dorito fingers onto the side of my underwear. What the hell, man. Was that? Was he? Was that really me? As much as he looked like he had been crying... I haven't cried that hard since Dad sho--

&amp;#x200B;

My heart catches in my throat, and my eyes start watering. Oh God. Did he think that Mom would also...? Because of me? No, no, there's no way. She wouldn't. She'd never. Never, never, never--

&amp;#x200B;

I fall down on my knees to the floor, weeping. And I pray. I pray so damn hard.

&amp;#x200B;

Once the tears subside, I go out into the family room to check on my mom. She's asleep in her recliner, and all is quiet save the dull hum of the oxygen machine. I debate waking her up, but decide to let her rest.

&amp;#x200B;

I sit down at my desk and let out a half-sigh, half-laugh. It's not funny, it's just.... Man. What a night. I wish you the best, kid. I really do. There's still opportunity to fix this timeline, though. And I'm gonna make it the best damn timeline I can.

&amp;#x200B;

I throw the bag of Doritos into the trash.

&amp;#x200B;

Five years go by. Mom's on her deathbed. She hasn't spoken in days, and barely registers when people are in the room with her. She smiles whenever she sees my little three-year-old son, though. She had pestered me for years that she wouldn't live to see any grand-kids. My tears well up when I think about how she won't see the second. But I'm glad we can be here for her, during this time. She was always afraid of dying alone, after how Dad went.

&amp;#x200B;

Her hand goes limp in mine. I clasp it to my chest and fail to hold back tears, as my son hugs my leg and cries.

&amp;#x200B;

After about fifteen minutes pass, I wipe my eyes with a tissue and notice a particularly dark spot of shadow in the corner of the room. The shadow grows and takes a familiar form. The dark robe suddenly drops to the floor, empty. Behind it stands seven-year-old me, with a gentle smile on his face.

&amp;#x200B;

I smile back. ""Hey, little dude."" I sniffle. ""Things go well for you?""

&amp;#x200B;

Young Me slowly shakes his head and chuckles.

&amp;#x200B;

THAT NIGHT VISITATION WAS NOT FOR ME.

&amp;#x200B;

Huh what. As I slowly put two and two together and reconsider multiverse theory, I feel a tug on my sleeve. ""Daddy, who are you talking to?""

&amp;#x200B;

I look back at the... not me? looking contentedly at me.

&amp;#x200B;

""Um,"" I stutter, as I lift my boy onto my lap. I ponder for a moment, then give him a big, goofy smile. ""My guardian angel!""",Vulcan_27

The other you is mortified and vows to change his ways, and they vanish.",caseysgarage,"Looking back at my life, I know one thing for sure. The moment that changed everything. I was always comfortable with my life, I wasn’t “rolling in the dough” but I certainly wasn’t down and out either. I had a comfy job that paid good, decent family relations, was even looking at buying my first house. 

I remember the night vividly to this day, it was just shy of ten years ago. Doing my usual bedtime routine, shower, shave, get into some comfy PJS. Nothing out the ordinary at all, suddenly a chill ran down my spine and my room suddenly seemed so cold. It was summer time in Louisiana, definitely not a time for the cold to creep into your room. 

From behind me I heard the slightest rustle of fabric, instantly my senses went on high alert. Adrenaline pumping and relying on what the military taught me, I swiveled around quickly, fists up and ready to fight, at first nothing. Then slowly, movement from the corner of the room. A figure stepped out, wrapped in darkness it seemed. Only a faint flint above his head showing. Stepping forward i could see more clearly, a scythe the blade long and wicked, and as if out of a nightmare a skeletal face grinned at me. 

I could feel my heart pumping overdrive now, this couldn’t be real. The goddamn Grim Reaper is in my bedroom! I didn’t believe in the supernatural, science trumped all, but here he was. Staring at me, ready to take my life and end my existence. It stood there staring at me, not even moving. I could feel the tears streaming down my face, the urine running down my leg. Two combat deployments in Afghanistan, multiple firefights and never once pissed myself until then. 

Slowly from beside him another figure stepped out the shadow. My eyes widened as I seen the face that was revealed. It was me! It was almost like looking into a mirror, his, my, our, eyes both open wide in horror. The reaper turned to me/him and pointed towards me. 

“If you don’t change your ways, this is how you end up” almost instantly the mirror me looked appalled. Looking around my room, scared, as if the skeletal figure were not standing right next to him. His eyes settled on everything in my room. Posters, game consoles, tv, and took a step back as if in shock! 

“No! No! I can’t! This won’t be me! I can’t be like him!” The reaper chuckled, the sound like air escaping a thousand year old crypt, and suddenly they both vanished. 

It has been almost ten years, and to this day I still dream about it. I’ve told no one, who would believe me anyway, but seeing my/his face so scared at being “like me” shook me to my core. Almost immediately I revamped myself. Gym, reading, back to school, following the footsteps of successful people. 

I’ve been married, and on the same coin divorced, three times. Only has children with my first wife and now pay more money than you could imagine in child support for children that I hardly ever see between my work and her spitefulness. I pay alimony to the second wife because she was “raised smart” and knew exactly what to say and do to get it. The only one that ended amicably was my third, and my last. It cut me deep seeing my world walk away over and over. I owned three houses, I now rent a house while mine are still caught up in foreclosures after having so much money disappear. 

I still am in charge of my own company, a law firm based in Shreveport. I have worked many thankless nights getting to where I am today. Another contribution to so many divorces, who wants to be with a man who lives at work? I have a sterling reputation as one of, if not, the best lawyers in the state of Louisiana. 

That has done nothing to make any of this easier. In my misery my mind always drifts back to the night. Is THIS the path the warning was for? Was it destiny that I would think he meant the way I lived and to change it that led me to this? I can’t imagine a life worse than this, and it certainly wasn’t the life I was heading for all those years ago. 

People will read this and just think it the ravings it a man who had lost it all and finally hit the end of his rope. A man who’s depression and anxiety led him to this point and hallucinated a story to justify so many wrong decisions. Another sufferer of PTSD from a war many feel we had no business being in. Just another Facebook post about the 22 veteran suicides a day, when it’s all said and done, I’m just another statistic. Tonight I meet the reaper again, I can’t go on with life anymore, I hope the other me found a better path. I hope this is the future he avoided. Whatever became of you, I pray it wasn’t this. 

Goodbye, please let my kids know how much I loved them. How sorry I am that they’ll grow up without a father. I’ll miss you my boys just like I always have. ",Sereden_91

Grabbing the rosary you wear around your neck you continue staring, 
“You see what you’ve become” says Death.
“This pad ain’t too bad my main man” says younger you, a little too friendly.
“Ah, while it is true you live on your own, it’s for the reason that you’re involve in quite the extensive drug cartel”
“Drugs?! Drugs are what took away my little sisters and mother, all because my father wanted to be involve with this shit, and now Im involved in it too?!” , younger you exclaims, fury and rage clouding a once smooth, smiling face.
“This is what happened when you started to follow your father, looking for a chance to kill him and exact your revenge” says Death calmly, certainly enjoying the malice that he is seeping from the younger version of yourself, making the blue flames for his eyes grow a darker shade of blue.
“What happened to Alana, what happened to my girlfriend from college” younger you yells in your direction, demanding an answer
“I had to do what was best for myself, and I got rid of her,” you say, smoothly, not being the slightest bit disturbed by this version of yourself.
Clearly enraged, younger you jumps at you,
“Fuck you, I loved her” he says, while striking you hard enough to knock you off the chair you sat on and making your nose bleed.
Laughing, you pick yourself up and reach for your gold-plated double barrel 1911, the very gun you killed Alana with as your initiation to the cartel, but before you could aim it, you hear your you get self say “do it”
Suddenly, a searing pain, something unbearable and white hot goes through your chest,causing you to fall to your knees, looking down you see Death’a scythe protruding out your abdomen.
“Who do you think you are you fucking mutt,” you manage to tell yourself through clenched teeth
Smirking, your younger version says “I’m only doing what I have to do, just like you did yourself”
Laughing, Death sucks your soul into his scythe, and before your eyes close for good, you see something flash through your dying mind
Your younger version playing with a son and two daughters, while his wife Alana stands at the doorway

Yet it continues to bother me. Why would I look at myself that way. Especially since it had appeared as if the me had only been a couple of years my junior.

My fashion taste has surely been in decline since I started working on houses. I ponder maybe it was my clothes and unshaven face that had startled me as I continue to saw and hammer, ever meticulous, but mindlessly all the same.

Another thought strikes me then. Perhaps this empty shell of a house with barely four walls yet erected had scared him. Did I envision myself being a homeless squatter? No I dismiss the thought immediately as my trade and craft is obvious around me. I discard the limb I had been sawing into the trash beside me and move on to the next piece.

No matter how much I ponder and wonder I can’t think of what could have made me think this life is a terrible one. Surely nothing was that bad. As I finish my work I set all the remaining pieces into the trash bin and bundle them up nicely.

I look to my companion her face pale and tired but well cared for “you don’t think I’m scary do you” she doesn’t answer of course, but they never do anymore. With a sigh I grab the bin and load it into the car. “Let’s go find somewhere to bury your useless bits dear.” 

I grab my companion and load her into the car as well, hidden, but still within earshot. I hate not having someone to talk to, but everyone else just wouldn’t understand why she didn’t need her body anymore and I don’t feel like ever discussing the matter.

But in my periphery, something is wrong. I'm frozen to the spot in a staring contest with myself, but that isn't what terrifies me anymore. There's a hooded figure behind my reflection. It has to be 9 feet tall, but it seems like a thousand. It's unmoving except for it's breath.

I keep looking at myself. Petrified of what might happen if I give this towering figure any recognition.  The logical part of my mind has abandoned any light-heartedness and all sarcasm, screaming at me.

*DO NOT MAKE EYE CONTACT.*

It breathes in a familiar way-- the same way I did in the hospital after cleaning the closet with ammonia. I almost died that afternoon, years ago. A death rattle. ""Do you see what you've become?"" 

*Don't look at it. Keep eye contact with me.*

 My eyes are wide with panic and a bit of the blue light from the window is reflecting off the tears forming in them. I don't know what might happen if one of the tears breaks free.

This time I hear my voice not in my head, but in my ears. I know it's not in my head because I can feel my eardrums shake with each syllable. ""No, I'm getting better though."" Her voice breaks as she lies to herself. She's behind my other shoulder. I hadn't noticed her before because the towering figure had such a commanding presence.

*If you acknowledge them, they become real. Don't look at them. Don't give them power.* 

The figure turns. He must be hovering just above the ground because there are no sounds of steps and his movement is like polished glass. ""You can't save yourself.""

She sounds almost defiant now. I'd be impressed with this imposter if I weren't so focused on my own staring contest. ""I-I can. I'm taking the meds I'm supposed to and I'm going to group."" I'm tempted to turn around, they're clearly not focused on me anymore and her defiance might be enough to let me quietly make an escape.

*Don't call attention to yourself now.*

The figure turns slowly back to me, its hood a black abyss. Its rattling breath says, ""It's all futile. You have only one meaningful choice."" It holds out a thin, ghastly grey hand, and hovering above the palm is a seed. An impossibly small seed above the hand of an impossibly tall figure. It almost sounds caring. If a death rattle could have a caring tone. ""Take this or accept that. It's the only way.""

The other me, the past me refuses, I see her head shake in my periphery just as I begin to understand what the figure is truly offering. I want this.

I break eye contact with myself in the mirror, whipping around desperate to accept. My hand hits the tile behind me. They're gone. A sense of impending doom and loneliness is my only company now.",SomeBroadYouDontKnow

Before I begin writing I take a sip from the sweating tumbler of amber scotch.  MacCallan 25.  I set it back on a coaster shaped like a golf ball, which is one of a set given to me by the girls on my staff.  Poking her head into the doorway, my wife smiles.


""Good night, sweetheart,"" she says, as beautiful as the day we met.  ""The boys are asleep in their rooms, don't stay up too late.  You've got a surgery first thing in the morning.""


""Yes dear,"" I say, smiling.  ""Just wanted to write a quick thank you note to Father Jones for helping with the fundraiser last weekend.  I'll be up soon.""


As I set the felt tip of the pen against the paper, I hear something.  It's sort of a gong sound, like an old, rusted bell struck by an empty skull.  A chill draft hits the back of my neck, standing up the tiny hairs there.  Suddenly l feel eyes on me.  I turn and see something that practically stops my heart.


It's me.  But it's me at eighteen years old.  Just as tall but thinner, fresher, with curious eyes and long, floppy hair.  The younger me wears a t-shirt emblazoned with 'The Ramones' and faded blue jeans.  He looks as surprised as I feel.


Its what stands beside me though that really sends a shudder up my spine.  A tall gaunt figure in a hooded robe holds a large staff of gray wood, topped with a wicked looking curved blade with a glinting edge.  A scythe.  From within the deep hood two red dots burn like flickering candle flames.  


""That's me?"" The younger me says.


""Yes.""  


The reaper's voice is a harsh, whispering rasp, like ashes sliding through an hourglass.  


""I'm in pretty good shape,"" young me says.  ""And this looks like a sweet house.""


I dont like the ""this isnt the worst thing in the world"" tone of his voice.  I have a life most people would kill for.  People envy me.  I want to speak, to say so, but I find myself struck dumb.


""Yes,"" says the reaper.  


""Do I have a hot wife?""


""Yes.""


""Kids?"" 


""Yes.""


""What do I do?""


""Doctor.""


As they stand there taking a  inventory of my life, I see the expression on my young face change.  What began as mild admiration changes to the restless expression I used to wear so often.  Boredom.


""Am I in a band,"" I ask.  ""Do I even play guitar any more.""


""No.""


""Fuck this.""


Before I can croak out a reply, tell him that my life is amazing, that people respect me and want to be me, the pair disappear.  The rusted gong sound chimes again, and I am alone. 


The study begins to blur.  As I watch, the bookcases and leather chairs swim and go hazy, like I'm looking at them through water.  I look down and see the same blurring happening to the pen in my hand, the desk, the card with ""thank you"" written  on the front  and everything else in the room.  A dull ache takes hold of my entire body.  Dizziness hits my like a baseball bat to the head, and my head pulls forward like I've fallen asleep.  When I open my eyes, I am somewhere else.


I am lying on the floor of a dim, filthy looking apartment.  Old musty furniture is set haphazardly across the carpeted floor, and middle aged burnouts in graphic t's lie strewn about like cadavers.  I look down and notice a belt tied around my bicep.  A hypodermic needle hangs from the inside of my forearm.  Tracks of old puncture wounds run like constellations down the arm.  


I can still remember UCLA, meeting Sonya, med school, the births of my sons, and the rest.  But a new set of memories now shares the same mental space like a deadbeat brother in law living in the garage.  Instead of college i take my band, The Patsies, across the country to play in dives for pennies.  Eventually we achieve regional fame, a few groupies, even cut an album that the radio d.j.s won't touch.  No Sonja, no kids, just a d-level music career and a flourishing heroine habit.  I know in a flash of sadness and anger that I cannot go back.


The grim reaper is a real asshole.

The other you is mortified and vows to change his ways, and they vanish.",caseysgarage,"I felt my consciousness being pulled from sleep like a body from the bottom of the ocean. My limbs felt heavy, like bags of wet sand and I couldn't quite tell if my eyes were difficult to open due to the weight of sleep or whether crust from the night was sealing them shut. 

Finally wrenching them open, I realized the room was black and felt disoriented by the lack of light until I realized why I was awake. *God, I'm so comfortable, why do I have to pee right now? Maybe I can hold it until morning. But if I go back to sleep, I might wet the bed and I don't want that mess.* 

I lie in bed for a few more blissful moments before the urgency built enough for me to physically move. I make my way into the bathroom, shuffling my feet on the bedroom floor, knowing there aren't any neglected items, but moving carefully in case I've forgotten them, too stubborn to burn my eyes with any fresh light, while also feeling uneasy navigating the darkness. 

I successfully find the toilet without managing to stub my toe or ram my shoulder into the door frame and the bit of blue light coming from the bathroom window gives me some comfort. I lift the lid to the toilet and sit to relieve myself. All the while, I can't help but be all too aware of the exact amount of flesh making contact with the toilet. I can still feel the cold plastic on my finger tips even though I only touched it for a moment. I carefully count out 6 squares of paper and finish my business. Following up with a baby wipe for my thighs, which have been tainted by the seat. I close the lid, not wanting any unnecessary particulate to spread when I flush.

I refuse to look into the mirror at night, so I wash my hands at an odd angle to the sink. It's made me anxious since I was a child, knowing I would look up to see a morphed version of my own face. Unsure of the exact expression the woman looking back at me might make. Would she be smiling at me as I look at her horrified? Would I even know? 

*Bitch, you have to get over it at some point. If there were any reason to fear mirrors at night, you'd see mysterious news stories about dead teens every weekend.* I wrestle with the debate between my anxiety and my painfully sarcastic logical side as the water gets nearly too hot for my already-chapped hands. *Baby steps. A peek today and the whole time I wash my hands in the dark next time.* 

More wakeful now, I look down at the sink while drying my hands and positioning myself properly. I take a few deep breaths while gently replacing the towel. Finally, I gather the courage to raise my eyes to the mirror and a cold chill rushes through my body when I make eye contact with myself.

Perhaps it was because of all those movies, but the first thing James did was pinching his own cheeks. It hurt. A lot. And *that* was truly disappointing. He had hoped that he would've woken up from a bad dream.

Of course, he could do that other thing, something that he had always done on such situations - fall asleep and wake up in the morning, pretending that nothing had happened. But even as he tried to do that, he couldn't sleep. And it made sense; why would he sleep after that?

""Dammit,"" James groaned and finally got himself seated. Soon after, he got himself up and began clothing himself. As he had finished, he got himself to the nearby window and opened it, just to step outside on the roof.

James still lived with his parents who happened to own that house. And since his room happened to be on the second floor, he occasionally sneaked out through the roof. But this time around, he laid down and just observed the clear sky.

""What's so bad about my life?"" James wondered, raising his arms and looking at his hands. Why would he be the example to someone else? His life wasn't bad. He got a job. While he still lived with parents, he helped them to pay the bills. He had finally found the girl he liked. They recently even began dating. Perhaps he would eventually move out as well. It was only a matter of time.

*If you don't change your ways, this is how you end up.* Those words echoed in his mind, keeping his eyes wide opened.

""I hate all of this,"" James said. ""Why am I being judged? Who has right to judge me?"" he said, finally seating himself up, both hands in a fist. ""I'm tired of this shit. Everyone... all the time...""

""But that's how they get motivated,"" a voice appeared, making James quickly look at his room's window. Was the reaper back? Or was it his younger self? No. The voice was too high pitched for that. ""I wondered why there was all the ruckus in the middle of the night,"" a bit older woman said, smiling and getting herself on the roof, as well.

""Eh, sister, what are you doing here?"" James said, frowning.

""You know, since you were young, I always heard it whenever you opened the window,"" she said, smiling.

""That doesn't mean you can just come into my room and join me here. Did you even knock?"" James said, sighing. ""You don't even live here anymore. Or well, didn't not that long time ago.""

""Hey, I'm helping you to ease your mind, and that's how you thank me? Judging me?"" she said. It was James' sister. She always had shorter black hair, and she was a bit skinnier compared to the most women. But recently she had divorced, and thus she had moved back.

""Why would I need help from a depressed sister who got recently divorced and ran back home?""

""Well, at least I left home. When will you leave?"" Leona responded, hiding her chuckle behind her hand. But after a short time, they both started laughing.

""What's the problem, small brother?"" she asked. ""You can ask me anything. After all, I am the master of brokenness.""

""What do you mean by that's how they get motivated?"" James asked.

Leona sighed. ""That's easy. If someone judges you, they feel better and motivated. They might even feel the need to change, or perhaps just not feel that bad about themselves.""

""But is it right?"" James asked.

""Of course it's not, brother. Those who speak ill of us are worse than scum,"" Leona said, nodding.

""You're so serious,"" James said, chuckling a bit.

""I *am* serious!"" Leona said, sighing.

""What if that person was a reaper itself? What if something like that told me that?""

""Then death is worse than scum. That's how easy it is. We all live our own lives. What matters is how we are living tomorrow, not how we lived yesterday. Or at least that's my motivation,"" Leona said. ""I did get divorced for tomorrow.""

""That's such a stupid excuse,"" James sighed.

""But that's my life. I may have fucked up, but what good will that fuck up do tomorrow?""

""Ahhh, the brightness, it's killing me,"" James moaned.

""Shut up,"" Leona said, laughing.

Furious, I walk down the hall towards my garage, cell phone in hand. I rummaged around a bit, before finding the incredibly dusty and thick book containing the yellow pages.

Thumbing around the book for a few moments, I find and call a number. After a couple of rings, they pick up.

“Hello, this is Mortys Afterlife Payday loans, you end up dead, we see to it you don’t see red. How can we help you?” “Yeah, hi. Listen, can I please talk to one of your managers please? Of the multiverse division?” “Certainly, please hold”

After a moment, a new voice picked up. “Hi, how can I help you today?” I explained the situation to him, and he apologized profusely, and asked me to wait a moment. The line went dead.

Then POOF! Death showed up next to me again, look-alike in tow, and he looked incredibly embarrassed. This time, a manager stood to his left, enraged. 
“For the FOURTH time, Death!” The manager barked. “What have we told you about personal comparisons!?” 

Death sighed. “IT MAKES PEOPLE FEEL UNCOMFORT-” “Yes, it makes people feel uncomfortable!” The manager finished for him. “So why do you keep doing it?! It’s embarrassing for the company! Keep this up and say goodbye to that promotion you’ve been looking at! Now say sorry to the man!”

Death looked me in the eye and quietly said “IM SORRY MISTER. IT WILL NOT HAPPEN AGAIN”

“It’s fine.” I said. I looked at my twin. “Man, don’t go for these loans. They end up really biting you hard in the end. Sorry you got mixed up in all this.” He looked down and said to the manager “I’m sorry, I think he’s- I, am right. I kind of want to go back on this loan.” 

The manager went off on a rant again, before all three figures popped off while he was mid-sentence. I hate these visits.",Flockofseagulls25

*""If you don't change your ways, this is how you end up.""* The black-hooded figure with the skeletal face told the younger version of me, before vanishing into thin air.

I picked my head off the pillow, stared at them and dozed-off, dismissing it as a weird dream. 

Then it happened a second time, about a week or so, later.

*""If you don't change your ways, this is how you end up.""* I heard him enunciate slowly, and I noticed the horrified look on my younger self's face. And then they vanished, again.

*'Weird.'* I thought to myself in the morning. *'How often does that happen?'*

It never happened to me - having the exact same dream, twice - I mean. Not to mention me remembering the small details of what happened. Like the clothes I was wearing, or the cut on my younger self's lip, or the large dilated pupils he... I was looking at my self with.

Then it happened the third time. And then the fourth. And the fifth.

Each time the details were the same, but slightly different. The hooded figure was the same, but young me - wasn't. They were different versions of me, in different times of my youth, from about 6 and 11 years old. 

*'What kind of games is my mind playing on me?'* \- was my second, initial reaction.

I did what every grown adult would do in that case. I went online for a self diagnosis and apparently, my mind was trying to suggest something to me - something that I didn't quite understand yet.

*'If you don't change your ways, this is how you end up.'* \- the words were etched in my brain by that point.

What was so wrong with me, that my younger self would have been so traumatized by? 

I couldn't quite put a finger on that. Yes, I was living alone, but at least it was in my own house. And yes, I may have added a few pounds since of late, but I'm not fat, I'm chubby at best - and that's a stretch too, if you ask me. And I didn't even entirely inherit my father's bald spot. As for work - I could've landed something better, but being an accountant isn't all that bad - I always liked numbers, and they seemed to like me. So what was it all about?

The hooded skeleton increased the frequency in which he visited me at night, from once a week, to twice a week, to every night. It became quite bothersome.

At first, I tried saying something when the two appeared, but neither of them seemed to realize I was talking.

I set up a bright digital clock, right above the door, where they appeared, trying to measure a time period of when they arrived, but they were inconsistent - they could come in every stage of the night.

I started closing the door and I set dangling can traps - like the ones in 'Home Alone' and I started putting bowls of water where they would typically appear. But every time - they would simply appear in different places.

The hooded fella would continue appearing with a different version of me, still in the range of ages of 6 to 11. Him - always repeating the same words. And young me - always looking shocked at what he had seen.

I was starting to get desperate. So I went to 'google' again, but this time I tried tackling the issue on another front. 

'Best pills to knock you out for the whole night' - I searched.

'SnoozZzZ' arrived just like that in a couple of days.

I admit they looked quite shady, but I wasn't one to go out much and have social interactions, that often. Besides, they promised these would solve my problem.

I took two before going to sleep, just as instructed and they worked like a charm, until of course the dreaded duo arrived, and I was magically up to see them judging me. This time, although - it was different. This time - it wasn't even little me - it was some other brat, someone I have never seen. And the little shit - was judging me, with his big, wide-open eyes.

""Oh, come on!"" I yelled at them as they started disappearing. ""That's a load of bullocks!"" I yelled into the dead of night. 

*'That's it.'* \- I thought. 'That was the last straw.'

I decided that this night - I wasn't going to let them slip my grasp. I was going to intercept them, and meet them just as they appear. I was not going to sleep. 

I loaded up with some coffee, energy drinks, snacks, the series of 'Harry Potter', some more coffee, and waited.

The hours flew by quickly - 'Harry Potter' was a favorite of mine and if anything was going to pass me through the night - it was that.

Then, at around 4 in the morning, as Harry and Cedric were transported to Little Hangleton's graveyard, the two twats appeared.

I pulled the Spider-man blanket off me, and nearly broke my custom made Pikachu mug, as I sprung to my feet.

""Got you, fuckers!"" I yelled at the two as they turned to face me.

They could see me!

""I am deeply sorry, child."" The hooded figure baritoned. ""This has never happened before.""

The kid yet again - was not me.

""What the fuck is going on?"" I scratched my head, then my beard.

""Ah, what the hell..."" The skeleton changed his voice into a faster one. ""You suck."" He attacked. ""You are the worst example I could think of."" He did not spare any words.

""Wha... wha... what?"" I did not see that coming.

""Every version of you that had seen how you end up, had changed their ways - and achieved greatness."" He took a deep breath. ""In fact, I even decided to show you to some other children - and guess what - they've fucking grew up to become decent adults, since seeing you.""

""But... that happened two nights ago.""

""Ah, time means nothing to me. I am the Grim Reaper. But, I don't expect you to understand or believe me, or anything for that matter.""

""Uhh..."" I had nothing to say. I didn't think far enough as to confront the man, and I was left speechless. My mouth may have stayed agape. ""Uhh...""

""Forget it. I'm sick of looking at you every night. I'll find someone else. Too bad I wouldn't be able to find anyone as bad as you.""

""Uhh...""

""Have a terrible, miserable life!"" He snapped his finger, the two disappeared into thin air, and the door slammed itself shut - dropping my fedora on the floor.

I picked it up, and put it back next to my sword collection.

""Gee. The nerve on some people."" I murmured before laying in my bed, Catwoman's body pillow cuddled between my legs.

*'Well. Problem solved. I won't be seeing them again.'* I smiled - a smile of triumph, as I could finally sleep quietly.

"[WP] ""The scary thing about humans isn't their tendency to try to accomplish what most believe impossible, but how often they succeed in the seemingly impossible.""",harpyqueen99,"*Excerpt From ""An abridged Guide to 100 Prominent Species.""*

Some philosophers trace it back through the eons to the emergence of a simple mushroom. Some attribute it to divinity, the favor of a long forgotten chaotic god. Some believe it to be a statistically improbably but completely plausible trend. Whatever the reason, Humans are-bar none-the luckiest bastards in the galaxy.

Almost all other species that have attained sapience are descended from predators, and thus share a pool of common traits. However, among the superintelligences, the beings evolved past mere physical constraints, and the most accomplished warriors, Humans always seem to scrape their way to the top. Among all, they share a trait that seems to defy measurement: pure dumb luck.

That's not to say that it's all good luck. There's famous examples of Humans committing to galactic gambles and paying with the price of trillions of lives. For example, take the tragedy of Yan-uuix Delta, in which Captain Freeman bet the lives of Yan-uunix Delta over a game of cards against Unknown, the great horror of the Neastern sector. Captain Freeman survived the ordeal, of course,^1 but the 2.2 billion soldiers and 13.4 trillion soldiers were evaporated into cosmic dust.

But in defiance of logic, there are examples of the opposite, in which Humans persevere through demonstrably insurmountable odds. The premature discovery of the warp-drive, or discovery of the omni-verse for example.

*Excerpt From ""The Captain's Guide to the Universe"" Vol 12*

It is tradition for captains of central hegemony races to retain a Human co-pilot, or at the very least a Human engineer in memory of Sasha the Technomancer. Despite the denial of Brainians, Enditorial Galactic Publications' own dedicated statistical AI claims that Humans have regularly been the deciding factor in difficult encounters.^2 It is noted that the Human custom of adopting other species into their relatively primitive social structures is largely compatible and beneficial for crew morale.

She is dark, has no definable features yet somehow she has weight. A crushing weight that chokes me on occasion. She likes to sit atop of my chest some nights, staring down at me with unblinking eyes. An eternal abyss of ink pot black melancholy. She chokes me with tears and presses the air from my lungs. I can't tell her to go away though. I have known her for so long. She is my oldest friend. It is easy to get caught up with her rambling. She has a way of knowing what my thoughts are.

Last night after a glass of wine she and I sat talking until late into the night. The candle I had lit hours ago had long sputtered to a waxy silence. She had me excited. We were talking back and forth so rapidly it became merely a stream of conscious acknowledgements and prodding. 
The tub water was so warm. The razor I held flickered in the pale light of the rising sun. It was a a beautiful red. Deep burgundy, pillowing through the soapy water.

According to our original deal millenia ago, she was supposed to be with me for nine months of the year. It had been six, three more than the initial bargain and closer to what Demeter originally wanted. Without her, the Underworld was dimmer than normal. The chair next to mine was still empty. 

One of her best nymph friends, Crassia, was her name, had offered up her tree if Persephone would replant. It was a beautiful dark wood, it was the only semi-living thing down here, though perhaps because it was well preserved and thrived when Persephone was here. It was our anniversary, when she gave it to me. On top of it sat a red glass vase, blown by some of the greatest Egyptian and British glassblowers in the underworld. It had intricate designs painted on it and on our first anniversary she received it as a gift. It was filled with brilliant roses, delicate buttercups, angels' breath, and blue bells, selected by some florists. Only, now it was surrounded by black dust.

Of the few living things I kept down here, I always had a vase of flowers on the day of her return. They were normally thriving for a few days before they shriveled and died, and then she would replace them with beautiful jewelled flowers that couldn't die. The vase still stood there, however the water had long evaporated, having left a mark where the water once was. A small amount of dust was all that remained of the flowers. Morning glories. Three months ago.

""I don't understand. She should be back by now. She should but... she isn't..."" I sighed, placing my head into my hand. My throne wasn't exactly comfortable, it was only due to Persephone's urgings had I begun any kind of alterations. She had given me a cushion one year. I was grateful for it, however it contradicted my image. I suppose it was the fact that my steel throne had a certain air of masculinity that a plush cushion seemed to derail.

""Your Majesty, if I may, interrupt your thoughts,"" suggested a voice. Young. Rather young. Someone who died in their prime.

""Addison Shearer. Died at age 17 from a bullet wound. Permitted into Elysium on grounds of selflessness and valor,"" I recited. ""Give me one good reason to not send you Asphodel. You better not waste my time."" I still hadn't looked at them. I was more powerful than them and they knew it. I knew every single thing that Addison had done so they knew my power.

""My apologies, my Lord. I do not intend to waste your time, but instead present a solution to your problem, and hopefully an explanation,"" they carefully continued. ""You see, humankind has become careless. Through their greed to use fuels in the earth, they have pumped so much carbon dioxide into the-""

""Give me the information.""

""Humanity has altered the atmosphere of the planet so that the seasons no longer align the way they once did. It's confused all the seasons, Lord Hades,"" they suggested.

I turned around and stared at this puny person. ""And why should I trust you, about this?"" I demanded, looking at this scrawny kid.

""Oh, you don't have to trust me. You could ask many of the scientists that wound up down here. They would confirm what I say,"" he said.

""Thanatos, summon Stephen Hawking, Tony de Brum, and Art Rosenfeld. We'll see if this kid's story lines up,"" I demanded and sat down. ""Addison you will remain kneeling until I bid you rise. And if you are wrong, I swear on the Styx that you will find yourself in Asphodel.""

It was a few moments before Thanatos returned with the revered scientists. It was a short concersation before I had the answers I needed. This kid was right.

""Addison, rise,"" I thundered, gesturing to the recently deceased to continue about their lives. ""Your words seem to align with what these three suggested. Therefore, I have decided thusly: your twin shall champion for me in your stead to restore balance to the environment.""

""Should she fail?"" they stuttered in response.

""You don't want an answer,"" I barked in reply. ""Leave my presence.""

[WP] Due to global warming Persephone must stay out longer and longer. Hades is starting to get mad.,mrpigpuncher,"My mother always said she’d rescue me. 

I remember my childhood with desperate clarity. My mother’s love and the warmth of the sun were one. Perhaps it was strange that the Goddess of Fertility and Harvest had but the one child, but she loved me all the more for it. She taught me to worship the sun, and Zeus, my father, just as she taught humans to plant and harvest. 

Everything changed when I was kidnapped. Sometimes, a cloud comes between the sun and the earth and it must seem to the plants as if there will never be warmth again. In the unwanted embrace of Hades, the ground itself was between me and my mother, and I felt as though my heart would never be warm again. I wished for death when I learned that by eating the food of the dead, I had doomed myself to spend a portion of each year in the Underground. 

The years passed- became decades, then centuries. I learned to bury my soul when I was Underground. No mater what indecencies were forced upon my body, my mind grew strong to cope. I could leave all darkness behind when Spring came and I was released from my prison and Hades. I don’t think that was a lesson my mother could learn, for she bore also the guilt that she couldn’t protect me. 

My mother’s grief showed itself in winter. Her tears, her rage wouldn’t let the crops grow. Only when we were together could we be happy—but in later years I began to worry that she had planted seeds beyond those of wheat and pomegranate. She spoke of new chemicals to kill invasive plants, that ended up exterminating far more than humans originally thought. She talked of farms, whose creation destroyed the forests so carefully tended by Mother Gaia. She mentioned a type of fire that came not from wood, but from coal and gas. Finally, she reveled that these things were caused by the greed of humans and they would cause summer to continue beyond its natural time.  

Always before time has been an irrelevance. Always I paid the price of joy and sorrow in equal measure. I feel a sympathy with the humans, for last few decades have caused time to be a reality. My joy now has a cold edge of fear for I understand there is an inevitable conclusion to the change of seasons. 

Hades, generally so stern and controlled, has noticed my time Underground grows shorter and he punishes me as though I were to blame. He takes a dark delight in reminding me that the dead belong to him and whatever agony he sets me, I, living, belong to him as well. Winter is shorter, but it has become almost unendurable. I must fight to withstand the torture, for I must not lose my mind. Something of myself must remain whole- now, not only for my mother’s sake. To rescue me, my mother will set the world on fire. I, alone, must figure out how to stop her.

[WP] Due to global warming Persephone must stay out longer and longer. Hades is starting to get mad.,mrpigpuncher,"""You must help me, O Brother,"" Hades pleaded. ""I see my darling less and less with each turn of the seasons...""

Zeus shrugged. ""Why this obsession? Take on a new lover. Try a mortal woman for once; some are as lithe as they are fragile. Let me tell you, I--""

""No, Zeus!"" Hades shouted, frustrated. ""I see mortals every day and night, in my Realm; I can never fancy such wretched creatures.""

""Fine, then about a nymph? They can be quite lovely, too."" Zeus' eyes grew dreamlike and he licked his lips.

Hades sighed. ""There is only one for me. Only one who claims my heart.""

""Does she even love you? After all, you did *kidnap* her...""

""How dare you,"" Hades growled. ""I have only ever shown Persephone love and passion! She is mine, and I hers - we have sworn ourselves to each other.""

""For 6 months at a time, anyway,"" Zeus added, eyes gleaming. He loved getting Hades all riled up; it was far too easy.

""No longer half the year now,"" Hades said, voice hollow. ""And our time together grows every shorter.""

Zeus held up his hands apologetically. ""Well, brother, what do you want me to do about it?""

""Send a plague down to Earth,"" Hades suggested. ""It is the human race that is causing me this grief. Punish them.""

Zeus laughed. ""And how will get that your dear Persephone down to your gloomy abode? The world will continue to heat, with or without humans.""

""I wasn't done. Next, we must contact Helios and ask him to--""

But Zeus was already shaking his head. ""You know as well as I do how honor-bound Helios is; he has a set schedule to pull that sun across the sky, and he will never budge.""

""It doesn't hurt to ask,"" Hades cried out. ""At the next council of the Gods, upon Olympus - just ask him!""

Zeus looked at his dark brother with a mix of amusement and tenderness. ""Hm. Very well - I shall try. But I promise nothing.""

Hades ruminated about the situation as he traversed his way back to Tartarus. *That old windbag is right*, he thought sadly. *Helios would never agree to such an interfering change to his routine. But what else can I do?*

**Hades.**

He paused. Someone was speaking to him, in his own head. It was a familiar, homely voice. *Great-Grandmother!*

**I sense pain in you. It saddens me.**

*I hurt, yes. I am slowly losing my beloved - and there is nothing I can do to stop it.*

**Be not so hasty with your thoughts, my child.** 

*But Helios will not--*

**I am greater than Helios.** 

*Of course. Of that there is no doubt. But what will you do?*

**Whence comes the seasons, Hades? The winter that comes to your Earth just as your Persephone comes onto your lap? I will do what I must - not only for you, but for our beloved planet.**

Hades felt a small tear slip out the corner of his eyes and sizzle on his stony cheek. *Thank you, great-grandmother Gaia.*

[IP] Sleeping Ruins,scottbeckman,"The man gazed in awe at the ruins. He had only had this archaic metropolis described in the ramblings of drunken sailors and miscreants. When they described the pearl white spires as tall as a thousand men, he had merely brushed it off as the excess of alcohol they had all consumed. But here he was staring at these magnificent ruins in child-like wonder. Words would never do the sight justice, fueled by drunken stupor or not.

A soft light seemed to radiate from every building. Not blinding, but a gentle white light that seemed to invite the young adventurer in. As if it were a fair lady offering a warm hug and safe bed to rest. The ruins’ siren song drew his feet ever closer. Absent mindedly walking towards that warm glow, in a trance like cloud. He drew up to what used to be the gates of the ruined city and that was where he stopped. As alluring as the ruins were he knew better than to go any farther.

He knew the stories of this place, everyone did. And everyone knew about the curse that came with it. Himmeltor, the cursed golden city. No one knew where it came from or how it got to be in the state it was in. In fact no one knew where it was; those who tried to map their route all put the city in very different places. It finds its way to all wayward travelers at sometime or another. For some it appeared before them when they were in great need of succor, others when searching for ancient treasures. But no matter the reason it appears before a man it should never be entered. Legend has it that all those who entered would be trapped in whatever transcendental plain the city resides in. The weary man had no interest in testing this legend. And so, with one last longing glance at the city, he turned and he left in search of succor before the long journey home.

I'd like to hear what kind of assistance they could have gotten from the city. Maybe that brings more conflict into the story. For example, they find men to row and row, but now they have to fight off a ship of living dead. Conflict creates story. Maybe they find a man with perfect vision who can find all islands with treasures, but those treasures are sometimes good and sometimes very bad.",scottbeckman

[IP] Sleeping Ruins,scottbeckman,"I climb slowly, the aches in my bones, my muscles, forced from my mind with the strange desperation I have to get to the top. This mountain is hell to climb, but I'm sure I can do it. How hard can it be?

Rocks slip from beneath my left foot, and I squeal softly, gripping the rope I'm using tighter. Of course, it was nothing to be concerned about — the sheer cliff I'm currently on the edge of is sturdy — but I can't help but imagine myself falling, falling, to a sudden, painful stop.

I swallow, and start to keep going. My hands are burning — probably literally, from the rope I'm gripping. I sing to myself to keep my spirits high as I find footholds and the easiest ways up possible.

""Is this the real life.. Is this just fantasy.."" Of course I'm singing a Queen song, why wouldn't I? I love Queen.

My voice sounds lyrical and light, apparently. I've never thought it was special, but then I never cared for things marking the other girls as special. I still remember playing tag with the boys in the playground, getting muddy from taking it too seriously, rolling underneath swings and hiding in dirty hiding spots. I always had a great time doing that.

I think about the past as I sing and climb, thinking now about my first boyfriend. He was kind, shy, and talented. He taught me to juggle. And he got me into mountain climbing.

A rock slips overhead, and I lean into the mountainside as it flies past me. I groan, and force myself up the last.. However much more distance to climb. It feels like hundreds of miles, but realistically it's probably less than twenty feet.

Time seems to slow as I climb up, the winds fierce around me as I lay my first foot on the top of the mountain. I look up at the sight before me — the beautiful sleeping ruins.

My eyes widen. The winds seem to calm. I stare at the ruins that, from below the cloud layer, were invisible. I untie my rope from where I had thrown it upwards and secured it with a knot that I knew best for its reputation in creating nooses, and take it with me, knowing I may need it. After securing it to myself, I start to move down the mountain, moving towards the beautiful ruins that, though I didn't know it at that time, would almost introduce me to the Grim Reaper.

[IP] Sleeping Ruins,scottbeckman,"""Have I told ya the story of the sleeping ruins?"" I ask with my head raised high. The kids all look at me in wonder, their eyes tell me everything. 

""Have I told ya how it got its name?"" A few of the kids shake their heads. ""How its name is a bit ironic?"" 

Their wide eyes answer for them yet again. I know they don’t know what irony is, at least for the most part, but I say it anyway because it gets their minds going. My lips curl up and the picture forms in my head.

“Well then, I’ve done a great injustice. ‘Tis quite the story to tell.”

I turn fully towards the kids and put on a thinker’s expression. Their awe is almost palpable.

“Ya see, the ruins weren’t always like this, asleep to the sounds of nature. They were once quite awake, bustling with people. There were things to do, things to see, people to meet. And there was certainly fun to be had.”

One kid opens his mouth, a question waiting at his lips but he closes it quickly after. My storyteller’s mask can hardly contain my smile.

I stop. My words hang in the air for a second, building up the picture in their minds before I continue.

“At the height of their life, the ruins held almost a million people.” A chatter finally breaks their silence but my voice booms over them. “All working and playing, and studying to learn. The ruins were the center of their contemporary world.”

The same kid opens his mouth again, snapping it shut before the words could escape. I almost chuckle, I almost break the trance. Almost.

“They were the shining star back then, at the top of all that could be considered achievement. All the greatest warriors trained there; all the greatest scholars joined them as well… But one thing set them apart from the rest.”

The children all look up at me, their wandering eyes focus for a pure moment. I can hear their question, it’s the same between all of them. 

*What was it?*

They ask it with their eyes. Their mouths aren’t quite up to the task. My silence persists though, one heartbeat after another as their curiosity grows. I almost chuckle again. Almost.

“Magic,” is all I say and I let their minds fill in the rest. Some would say it’s a crutch, but I say it all the same. The looks on their faces are worth that much.

A murmur rises in the group. Kids glance at each other and ask. Their questions are all just soft enough that I can’t hear.

A scowl pierces my veil for a moment. I turn to see who it is. The same kid from before, the one with the questions. He looks at me now, his wonder replaced with something just as valuable to me.

He opens his mouth and doesn’t close it this time. His voice looms above the rest.

“I don’t believe you,” he says and the kids all stare. Some at him, some at me, but they all stare the same.

I once again force back a chuckle, I’ve come too far to ruin it now. I look him in the eyes, seeing the sparkle that has turned into ash, and I ask him right back.

“Why not?” my voice asks as if I didn’t even need to be there at all.

He scrunches his face more and retorts. “Because magic doesn’t exist.”

I hear a gasp from one of the kids and it almost makes me laugh. Almost.

“It doesn’t?” I ask, prodding his mind with each syllable.

His expression drops a bit. “No… it doesn’t. Magic only exists in stories.”

I get the closest I’ve gotten so far to chuckling. Air leaves my nose just a bit too fast. But I retain my composure and I respond as well as I can.

“This was long ago, my boy, things have changed over the years.”

His resistance drops a bit more, his reason yielding to the imagination. “How long ago?”

“Longer than I can remember,” I plant another seed in their minds. “So long that nobody even remembers the true name of the ruins. They sleep now… of course, but they were once just as awake as you or I.”

I see the sparkle in his eyes again and I know I’ve done my job. His next question isn’t asked out of the need to be stubborn.

“What happened to them?”

I smile a soft smile to warm my own heart. “That’s a mystery lost to the ages I’m afraid. All we have left are the ruins and the stories they left behind.”

A silence takes the room and I let it. The kids aren’t looking up at me anymore, most staring down at the floor. The wonder is still there though with its flame burning softly. Saying more would put it out so I fan it in the silence.

The wooden creak of the door brings all the gazes back up. The tall woman from before walks back in and tilts her head a bit at our group. She looks at me in confusion for a moment and I only smile in return. I have nothing more to say.

“The party’s prepared kids, we’re ready to go.” Her voice is as soft as a whisper.

The kids all look up, silly smiles plastered right on their faces. They follow the woman’s directions, filing out the door in a blur. I see one kid stay behind, the inquisitive one. He looks back at me before he leaves with his smile a different shade. I pick up my hand to wave as he leaves with the rest.

The woman’s smile is unrelated to mine really but she waves right back to me. She follows them out the door and shuts it once more.

I sigh as I watch them go, a chuckle taking me quite slowly. I think back to my story, thinking next time I won’t be as showy. I’ll tweak it then is what I think. By the week of next, I’ll be ready to tell again.

[WP] You acquire a watch that can stop time. It falls and breaks. Everything else is motionless,ConfidentGood," ""Huh."" Greg stared at the watch parts scattered on the concrete sidewalk. He looked at the stopped cars in the street; they were driving by at full-speed moments ago. Greg wanted to cross but did not want to wait for the light. He reached into his pocket for the watch. He squeezed the button too hard and the small pocket watch flew out of his hand. After time stopped.

""Well, at least I have time to think,"" he said aloud. The ominous silence of stopped time left always him uneasy. Greg shrugged to himself and crossed the street as he originally planned. He was on his lunch break and decided to eat while he figured out what to do next. As he approached the entrance of his favorite burger spot a tall black hold appeared in the air in front of the door. Greg stopped walking. A pale, tall young man wearing black jeans stepped out of the hole followed by a young woman.

""They can move?"" Greg stayed still. ""They don't know I can move,"" he planned to stay still and see what happened. The pair seemed to notice time was not moving. They looked at the stopped cars and peeked inside the restaurant, then they talked to each other. The woman seemed excited, then the pale man turned and looked at Greg. ""Don't move, don't move, don't move,"" he reminded himself. ""It's just coincidence."" The couple began walking towards Greg. He fought to keep still. Once they were close enough the woman locked eyes with Greg.

""You're right! I can see the difference!"" She said with a large smile, then she waved at Greg. ""Hi. Did you stop time?"" Greg stared at an imaginary dot behind the red-headed woman. He did not so much as blink. The woman turned her attention to the pale young man.

""Well he doesn't want to fix it,"" she shrugged. ""It doesn't look like there's anything else to do here, let's move on."" 

""You can fix it!?"" Greg grabbed the woman's hand. 

""Maybe. It depends on a few things. First I have to know, did you do it?"" She slid her hand out of Greg's grip. He nodded. 

""Yes. It was an accident!"" She gave Greg an appraising look, then she looked back to her pale friend.

""He's a Zero.. right?""  He nodded and she turned back to Greg.

""How did you stop time?""

""Uh, I had a watch,"" Greg turned to point at the sidewalk across the street. ""It stops time when I press the button, but I dropped it.""

""A watch?"" She asked her friend. He nodded and started crossing the street. The woman followed him, and Greg followed her. 

""Some Uniques can imbue items with their magic,"" the man explained to his partner, and Greg also heard. Though he did not understand the explanation beyond ""magic"". The trio reached the clockwork mess and the strange man knelt to poke at the bits and pieces. ""Ha!"" He grabbed a piece off the concrete then stood and smiled at the woman. He held out his palm to show her a small golden gear that glowed with faint golden light. ""Definitely a Muerte. Take it, it'll make your magic stronger.""

The woman touched the gear then she immediately began to glow with golden light. The gear dimmed until its light disappeared completely. After several seconds the glow around the woman dimmed and she smiled.

""That was awesome! There was tons of magic in there,"" she rubbed her hands together. ""I feel great!"" 

""Cool,"" the pale man nodded. ""Ready then?"" He waved a hand at the air and another black portal opened up. 

""Wait!"" Greg spoke up. ""You said you were gonna fix it.""  He asked the woman. The tall man stepped into the black portal and disappeared, but the woman nodded and smiled. 

""Oh yeah, I almost forgot,"" she snapped her fingers as she stepped into the hole in the air. Time roared to life before she disappeared.

"[WP] You sold your soul for the ability of time travel. When you use this power for the first time, a mysterious event knocks you out until you wake up to a destroyed world.",Ilikebacon999,"Jenkins Road was dusty and seldom travelled. It came out of Vienna, Georgia over and down hills of cotton fields spread like the sea. Go further than the city, further than the country, the hillbillies, there was only wilderness and cave dwellers. The rules of science were second here to a force that was more primordial and anarchic. Jenkins Road, if it could still be called that, eventually came to a cross with another road in the wild. It was a full moon there that night when De’Angelo Turner would lose his soul. The year was 1853.

De’Angelo was young, dark, with a straw hat and classical guitar hung on his back, walked with his hands in his pocket. He was thinking. He was looking. He needed to go farther, further away than anyone else had. He could see it in the well of his soul. Flashbacks of his pain. It was earlier that morning that he had watched his brother hang at the hand of a court created *ad hoc* by a white man with a plantation who prosecuted him for the crime of committing indecent exposure in the presence of his daughter. It was a false charge. The crime had occurred. But it was someone who was frustrated and fed up, but who? Someone had seen his brother admiring the young woman with his eyes one day earlier in the week. One thing led to another and then his eyes were dead at the end of a noose. 

He could not act – even worse, he could have. His paralysis weighed on his mind with as much weight as his brother’s death. Paralysis in the face of the moral wrong, not just immoral but destructive to the very core of his soul. He felt it was broken like rock. *Why*, he thought, *I should have done something, more – I should have given up this body entirely to try to save him, to avenge him. Even if I died it would have been better than be silent and alive*. This was not an argument in his mind. The congress of his soul had already convened and it was truth. It was the objective truth. He felt he had failed his family.

At the crossroads that night the boundaries of reality lifted and a demon emerged from another dimension and crossed paths with De’Angelo. He was short, dark, with black hair parted down the middle. His nose was wide and sharp. At first he followed D’Angelo, listening to his thoughts – and he had a proposition. He could grant the young man the power to travel in time – once and only once. With the power of his mind he could fixate on the moment he wanted to travel to -- and it could be anything. All he needed was that intent on a period of time. *But there is a price*, the demon explained. *I eat souls. I have to eat to survive. Therefore I need souls to eat.* The demon then asked, very serious, *Is that fair? When you pass away from this world, your soul will belong to me. For a very short period of time before I consume it for all eternity.*

De’Angelo did not hesitate. When he agreed to the transaction, signed his name to a contract, he felt a piece of his essence become cheapened. He felt emptied and emaciated. But he focused -- he meditated on the night a week before everything had happened. They would just leave, run from their fate. The flashbacks also replayed in his mind. He could not help it. When his eyes opened, it seemed like after an eternity. But it was only an instant before that he was under the moonlight at the crossroads, *wasn’t it*, he thought. But now -- he was surrounded by the sound of fire and cracking wood. The plantation was in an all-engulfing orange flame and a field of torches around him like the sea, the cotton fields, bright reds and oranges. De’Angelo looked around him in terror, but also pride. Revenge, but also justice. De’Angelo ran and ran. It was starting to break dawn when he found his brother sleeping in his cot.",Don_coyote2020
[WP] You awake one morning only to find that the world has stopped. Time now non existent. Everything frozen in its place.,ItsKingRabbit,"""Ahhh Sundays are great"" you look out window blind to a morning scene, and promptly smash your head back on the pillow. After a late Saturday night, a sleep in was just what the doctor ordered.

A few restful hours pass and you check again the light. ""Yesss still morning, heaps of time."" Yawning before returning to sleep.

What feels like a few hours pass and you once again wake to the morning sun.

""Geez, I feel like I've been sleeping forever."" You reach over to your phone to check the time but the screen is off.

""Oh well, breakfast time."" You rise out of bed and walk to the kitchen, it takes a minute or so but you begin to notice that's it's quiet, a bit too quiet.

""That's weird."" Normally at this time the sounds of traffic, birds and the wind would be audible. You look out the kitchen window to a perfectly still and sunny day. ""Wow, beautiful."" After the regular shit, shower, shave routine, you head out to the shops for some milk.

Wow, there isn't the slightest wind. All the trees are so perfectly still!

Pacing up the driveway, you notice a car stopped in the middle of the street. The guy is looking down on his phone, with his car stopped.

What a moron, who stops in the street like that! I should say something....nah. whatever.

Around the corner you notice the same thing further up the road, with at least 3 more cars stopped along the stretch of road.

What's with these guys? Is something happening?

You go to check on your phone, but there's no battery.

Damn, I thought I charged it?

You continue to the shops and pass one of the cars, you head to the window and talk to the driver . ""Hey buddy, what's going on? Why are you stopped like that?"" He looks blankly forward completely unresponsive.

""Hey dude can you hear me?' He doesn't even look over at you, just sits there frozen. You go around to the drivers side and take a closer look. ""Hello! Can you here me?"" His doesn't even look like he's breathing. You reach out to his shoulder ""Hey buddy are you....""

As soon as your hand touches his shoulder he gasps back into life. ""OOOOhh whoa."" He looks around confused, stopping on you with a look of fear.

""What are you doing? What just happened?"" He asks in a panic.

""Relax man, you were just blanked out in there.""

The man looks around and restarts his car, he nodds with a forced smile as he begins to drive off.

What the fuck was that guy doing?

You continue to the shop.

""Why is it so silent?"" Only the mans lone car noise is heard in the distance, but nothing more.

Up ahead is a woman standing in jogging pants, again completely still. But something is odd about her stance, she is balanced on her back toes, but mid stride into another step, and her front foot isn't touching the ground. You walk around the lady stunned by her position. She is frozen like the driver was, a cold statue of a person. ""Hello?"" no response.

""Lady are you awake?"" Still no response.

You reach out to touch her, and the moment you make contact, she burls forward missing her front foot and collapses hard onto the ground, cracking her head on the footpath.

""Holy shit!"" You utter. Her full weight bore down onto her head which landed with the crack of a watermelon.

Shit, what have I done! You begin to run back to the house, and notice a black object in the sky, a bird stays motionless in the sky, frozen in flight. ""WTF is going on?""

As you arrive home you plug your phone in to call 9/11. But it doesn't charge. ""shit"" You try your laptop and TV to no avail, all not working. In a last ditch attempt you knock on the neighbours door, no one answers. So you get into your car and head to town.

On the way it becomes clear that the world has stopped, frozen completely in time. Everywhere people stand dead in their tracks, drinks hover in the air, half poured into glasses, cars and people hold strange mid-motion positions. There is no sign of any movement and the whole atmosphere is completely silent. The more frozen people and cars you see, the more panicked you become, the deeper the silence grows. You approach a police officer frozen next to a traffic light, perhaps he can help. Touching him on the shoulder, he gasps into reality, and nearly falls off balance. ""Who are you, what did you just do?"" He immediately goes to grab his taser but is having trouble unclasping it from his belt. ""What did you do to me creep."" he looks scared as he fumbles.

You immediately run back to your car and drive off before he get you.

""Shit, shit, shit."" Well that plan backfired, you start to drive to your mates house.  Hoping to find someone to talk to.

Dodging around cars you notice a change of light, a huge shadow begins to form, over the area. The movement of the shadow is so noticeable when everything is so still. Looking up from out the car window, something enormous is swinging down to earth, when the shadow completely consumes the scene, you begin to make out what it is.

It's a...a...gigantic hammer? bearing down upon earth!

Stop....

"[WP] Today you get married to the love of your life. As a superhero you are estatic for a new chapter, however, as you drive off to the honeymoon they reveal to you that they are your archnemisis and you are determined to make it work.",Kittencakepop,"I swerve just a little bit into the other lane before I straighten out. I need to keep my composure.

""Oh my God!"" She exclaims through the fingers covering her mouth. I shake my head as I tighten my grip, my super strength creating finger shaped grooves in the steering wheel.

I don't know how we let it get this far. Years of being together. The love we've made, the fights we've had. I never noticed.

She removes her hand from her mouth and places it on my shoulder ""Hank I'm sorry, I thought you knew"". I stay focused on the road, try not to let my confusion get the best of me.

""Ben, you didn't notice me flirting with you during our fights?""

""I thought you were using your powers of persuasion and manipulation to distract me from my heroic duties""

""Honey I was getting you in the mood. We usually met up after we fought. You know, to let off steam?""

""You said you just got out of work""

""Did you really think I worked at the newspaper? Who in thier right mind would work for a newspaper? In this day and age!?""

She sits up at the speed of a bullet and glares at me.

""The SpaceTech building!""

""What?"" I say absolutely confused.

""You had just stopped my crew from pulling a heist, we flirted a bit, and then we made love on the roof of the SpaceTech building!""

""I don't follow"" coming to conclusions isn't one of my powers.

""You were Beta-Man...I was Lady Mayhem...""

""Mary I don't see what that has to....""

No onomatopoeia could describe the sound of the answer hitting me in the face. My throat dries up. My palms sweat.

I didn't know it was her.

She leans her elbow against the car door and rests her head in her palm ""You really couldn't tell it was me?""

""Mary I was so overcome by your beauty that someone as villainous and vile as Lady Mayhem wouldn't even phase me!""

Her head juts over to face me.""Did you just call me vile?!""

""No I mean...dammit Mary there's a lot on my mind right now!""

I'm getting angry. I don't like me when I'm angry.

Mary leans into her hands, elbows resting in her lap. I look over at her as she covers her face. I see it now. Her red hair, that body that she squeezed into that purple latex suit. It's all clear to me now.

I put on my signal and park the car in the shoulder of the highway. After sitting for a moment I hit my head against the top of the steering wheel, which leaves a big stupid dent.

I look at her, sitting in the passengers seat, trying to hold back tears. I've been hit by trains, bullets, asteroids, yet here I find myself in the presence of my one true weakness. So many evil schemes, kidnappings, heists, all the countless years fighting and loving. After all of that I've defeated my greatest adversary...and I feel horrible for it.

I'm sorry Mary, I really am. I'm sorry for not seeing the whole you. It's all coming together now. I remember the first day we met as civilians. You spilled coffee on my lap, I pretended it was hot, then later that night you made me dinner. The next day I fought Lady Mayhem like it was another day in the office.

The day you pulled off that Waylen heist is the same day we adopted Murphy.

Murphy barks in the backseat, his tail wagging against the bags of luggage stacked around him.

Mary looks at me, whiping away her tears. I want to say so much but know I don't have to. I smile at her and replay more memories in my head.

I love you Mary. I wouldn't want to spend the rest of my life with anybody else.

Mary smiles as she rubs her tears away with her shirt. ""I can read your thoughts you idiot"" she laughs as a few more tears work thier way out.

""I know"" my smile becomes a smirk hidden behind a mask of nervousness.

""I love you too, Ben"" she wipes the last few tears from her face ""Is this gonna work? You and me?""

I stare at her

She stares at me

Murphy barks

Precognition isn't one of my powers, but I feel pretty confident about my answer.

I turn on my signal and get back on the highway.",MAXTK421

[IP] Chort,LovableCoward,"The Gargoyle Slayer

There was a man whose name was Stan, 
With golden locks of hair.
Adventurous he was as a child,
And brave he was, with flair.

Of noble blood, he sought to be
A knight to fight a war.
Yet chainmail he would not obtain
So leather cloths he wore.

A sword he bought was forged with steel
To guard the castle walls.
Not knowing how to use a bow,
Thank God that he had balls.

For on a cloudy, darkened day,
A gargoyle came nearby,
It climbed the walls where Stan had been
And flew up oh so high.

With wings the length of three young men
And horns from his forehead,
This gargoyle struck the fear in men
Who watched as others fled.

Our hero Stan, the brave young man
Went out and saw this beast.
With bravery and his foolishness
He thought: Tonight, a feast!

He jumped onto the spire so high
And leaped upon its crown
The gargoyle sat on that same piece 
Its face revealed a frown

It was a hard and rough fought fight
Without a knight's strong mail
But Stan the man defeated it 
And made it lose its tail.

A feast was held for Stan the man,
His honour due his name.
A sounding joy for Stan the man,
And knighthood he would claim.

"[WP] You are the chosen one. Master of rocks, paper, and scissors. Your enemy is Thumbwar King. Master of thumbs and war.",MKBlackhawk12,"The throne room echoed as the giant bronze doors were thrown open. The massive hall was littered with debris. Stone from the ceiling and the pillars that had cracked and broken during the siege covered the long, crimson rugs that extended well into the darkness. Hundreds of scissors from the chandelier displays scattered around them as well. The paper.... the paper burned in the corners where the servants had pushed it away.

The Thumbwar King dropped his hands from where the door had stood closed to him just a moment before. His thumbs lost their unearthly glow as strode into the darkened hall. He had come this far. He had brought kingdom after kingdom to its knees. He had struck through the lands of Tic, Tac, and Toe. He had taken the low road and surprised the High of Fives. He had kicked the cans of the Hopscotchers... and now he was here.

The final kingdom: Roshambo.

It grew darker as he moved inside. He knew what would be waiting for him. He and his men were ready.

""Steady, men!"" He cast a hand out as he heard the quivering of their armor. ""Crush the scissors, cut the paper... keep the rock in the dark."" 

His sergeants began barking orders and his troops spread out toward the piles of burning paper. They had to start there. Paper was the easiest target, after all.

Their enemy knew their weakness and the paper ran, scurrying along the walls as soldiers chased it with axes and knives.

""No! Do not let them draw you in!"" The Thumbwar King bellowed, but he was too late.

Dozens of scissors flew into the necks and ankles of the soldiers as they chased the paper. Most of them were dead in seconds, only a few were able to stumble back, waving their weapons at the swarm of sharp tools tried again and again to cut at them.

""It won't stop us!"" The King roared into the darkness. ""I have Ten times this in soldiers! Ten times ten times this!""

Nothing answered him and the King scowled at the bodies of his men. It was true, his army stood surrounding the palace, but he couldn't afford to fail here. His men were tired, run ragged by the horrors of the long war. They sat on the edge of desertion. He had to take the palace and soon.

His opponent must have sensed his weakness for the rocks around them came up to strike. Some rolled themselves into golems, others just went straight for the head of the King.  

The King's thumbs came up like lightning, deflecting every single projectile.

""Cover them!"" He barked as his men threw out dark cloth over the golems, rendering them silent and still. ""They need light, remember it!""

The soldiers made short work of the stones. They had fought this army to its doorstep, they knew what to do. They just needed the orders, they just needed the confidence of their king. 

Soon all the stones were covered in black cloth. The paper fires had run away, the scissors were all smashed apart by clubs and maces.

""It's over!"" The King bellowed into the darkness. ""Surrender now or this whole place will be brought down upon you!""

Only Silence answered. The Thumbwar King cursed and pushed forward. The world grew dark around him. The pillars became merely patterns of shadow upon shadow. His eyes strained to see anything, but he dare not give the Master light for his stones. Even a small light could be dangerous here, in the hall of the Master himself.

""This is your last chance!"" The King bellowed against his own nervousness. ""End it now!""

Far behind them the bronze doors closed. 

The King twisted around to see two stone golems had been the ones to do it. They were paced by burning paper. The faceless monsters turned toward the King. He felt them staring into his soul.

""Pull back!"" The King felt his heart pound in his throat. ""Get those doors open!""

His men hadn't taken but two steps when the light came. 

Hundreds and hundreds of paper streamers ran with fire. They covered the walls, the ceiling, every pillar, every flagstone. The Thumbwar King looked upon it all with awe equal to his dread.

On the throne before him sat the Master. His aged face full of pain, his hands raised before him, shaking like a leaf in the wind. Behind his seat there stood twenty statues carved from the finest marble. Twenty giants with weapons heavier and sharper than any one a man could carry. 

""Pull back!"" The King roared as he stomped on the fire at his feet. ""Pull BACK!""

A statue threw it's blade. The weapon scythed through the right flank of the King's forces. Men weren't cut so much as crushed against it. In one moment forty men had died, their bodies becoming nothing more than debris themselves as they broke apart under the immense force of the blow and flew into the air.

A second later a second throw, another thirty men dead. The Thumbwar King was left in the middle, surrounded by death and the handful of loyal soldiers who remained. They fought the flames as fast as they could, but their eyes... their eyes watched the stone giants as they stepped closer... and closer.

""To hell with this."" The Thumbwar King leaped ahead, his thumbs before him, aiming straight for the Master on his throne. The air rushed in his ears, the strength of his thumbs was unbeatable. No one could-

A stone foot crushed him into the floor. A stone axe struck down and severed his hands at the wrists. 

The Thumbwar King screamed in agony, staring at his own hands, his own thumbs. He could still feel them! He could feel the pain! They could still obey him! He could still sue their power!

He heard his men die behind him, crushed in a series of blows from the massive stone guardians. The King tried to breathe but the stone foot on his back pushed down two more inches, making him gasp and find nothing to inhale.

The Master left his throne, slowly descending the steps. His hands still outstretched, his face still contorted with pain. He stopped at the edge of the pool of blood that the King's body was creating. He leaned forward. He opened his eyes; eyes that were white with blindness and age. 

""Rock crushes all."" 

The Thumbwar King died.",Xacktar

"[WP] When aliens started invading earth, the greek gods and goddesses wake up and zeus said ""Oh no, their back.""",NiceuPrecious,"There were more calls than usual. Zeus sat up on his chaise longue and stretched his arms. 

“Hera?”, he called. 

“What?”, it came back, in a tone that told him that his sister-wife hadn't quite forgiven him his latest fling with Kalyke. But what could he do? He was Zeus and his loins' lust was legendary. 

“Do you hear this noise?”

Hera stepped into the room, throwing and catching a large pomegranate one-handed, an expression on her face as if she pondered weather or not to throw it at his head. Zeus prepared himself to duck, in all cases. “What noise?”, asked Hera. 

“All these prayers.”

Hera shrugged and made to turn around to leave again. “Probably just an earthquake. You know, these times the humans tend to remember our existence.”

“No, this is different. More urgent”, insisted Zeus. “I think I'll go and  take a look.” He stood up and tried to decide if he should only bring his scepter or better a nice bundle of thunderbolts.

Hera crossed her arms and after a short pause she said: “Let's just go into the garden together for a peek.”

Zeus managed to hold in an exasperated sigh in the last second. He knew Hera didn't trust him to just take one step outside unsupervised at the moment. For the love of peace he should give in to her wish. “Alright, let's do this.”

Zeus and Hera stepped outside and with a lazy movement of his arms he dispersed the clouds blocking their view. 

To their utter surprise, it wasn't the earth that caught their attention, but the skies. Large spaceships made their way down all across the earth. A closer look told them, that the first aliens already emerged from ships that already landed. Everywhere humans were running headless in all directions, screaming bloody murder. 

“Oh no, their back!”, said Zeus. 

“What about it?”, asked Hera, trying to get a better look. 

“They're grown together. They only have one large back. Like – what do they nowadays call it – Siamese twins. Maybe it's only one being with many heads and way too many limbs.”

Hera chuckled. “There are like – two of them in one ship. Not much room for more. And they're not very agile. Our humans will make a quick end of them.” 

“Yeah, I think so too. The calls already seem to go down again. Look, the military is already on its way.”

“Great, then we can go back to our quiet life, right Zeus, my darling?”

“Yes, of course, though I wanted to join Hades in a game of...”

“Forget it.”

Zeus sighed and chuckled at the same time. How long have they been playing this game already? Hera would be angry for another couple of years maybe, but what was time to them? Maybe he should visit Metis next time. Hera at least seemed to like her. Or at least their daughter Athene. Yes, that would be nice. 

But right now, he had a wife to console.

My friend and I sit in awe as the antithesis stands before us. My friend, Clarissa, begins shaking. ""W-what is that?! This can't be real!""

The demon and the angel stop their flares and preparation to fight to look down at the mortals that were cowering beneath them.

The angel looks at my friend. ""Dearest, why have you summoned me?"" The demon looks at me. ""AND WHY HAVE I BEEN BROUGHT TO THIS EARTH?""

I begin to stutter and slur as I explain. ""We, uh, we're testing our phones, y-you see, and uh, we asked Google and Siri t-to summon you, a-and...""

Your time in the spotlight. There was gold paint. But there was a weird smell and we're not sure if something got into it or... Never mind. This is about you.

Tell us a little about yourself. What's your favourite genre to read and write? What's your favourite book? Which is your favourite juice? Why Froggy?",TA_Account_12
[OT] Spotlight: BLT_WITH_RANCH,TA_Account_12,"Thanks for the spotlight! This is the best New Year's present ever! Time to end my vacation and get back to writing...

My favourite genre to read is fantasy; I love exploring the wildly different worlds authors create. Recently I've been writing a bunch of sci-fi and love it, but what I like to write depends more on my mood than anything. I also love writing something silly to blow off steam. 

I have trouble picking a favourite book, but I'll always love the Redwall series by Brian Jacques. Those books made my childhood 110% better. 

Favourite juice is cranberry. It's delicious on it's own, but it's also incredibly versatile when mixed. 

Why Froggy? Um.... good question. I had something for this, but I can't remember if I wrote it, or will write it, or if it's already been written by a slightly different version of me...Who doesn't love time traveling frogs?",BLT_WITH_RANCH

[WP]The Wow! signal received in the 70s still remains the most possible alien communication received on earth. A lowly scientist finally decoded it today.,TA_Account_12,"It was another mundane Monday morning for me. I woke up in my small guestroom a half a mile from the main office where I worked. I lived on campus here at the New Mexico Tech school in Socorro, New Mexico.

As I rolled out of bed, I slid my usual grey slacks on and threw the same dress shirt I had on from last Friday. Nobody would notice anyways. I sprayed some body spray a couple of times across my chest to mask any smell of the YO MOMA'S  Grill from that Friday night just in case. I left the place looking like someone had a frat party there that lasted all weekend. There were dishes piled up by the sink, pizza boxes on the counter from last week, laundry that spilled out of the laundry room, and a bed that looked as if I was wrestling the sheets last night. The only area ever cleaned was my desktop area in the corner of the room. I spent most my nights on it reading through research papers and watching vlogs from my professors and conspiracy theorists. I like the variety of ""alternative facts"" given by the latter. It kind of keeps my imagination satisfied in its search for answers to life's most daunting questions. Or at least that's what I tell myself.

&amp;#x200B;

I headed out the door and began my 12 minute walk to the  Pete V. Domenici Science Operations Center where I conducted my research as an understudy of radio astronomy. I have been here working five days a week and conducting my own research every weekend for the past 6 months. Even though I made the same trip every morning, Monday through Friday, the walk was always refreshing and calming. You could see the  Chupadera Mountain tops clearly from the road. It was quite the site for a previous city dweller from New York.

&amp;#x200B;

I liked to walk around back to the supply loading area on the North East side of the building. You knew where it was by the grey Ford truck parked on the side of the road just before the entrance. It has a dent in the rear passenger door on the driver side. I like to imagine someone was attempting to break into the vehicle and tripped only to get a head full of door before being caught in the act. It's a small town so you have to make up stories just to make it sound ""not so boring"" to everyone else living anywhere else but the middle of nowhere.

&amp;#x200B;

I saw Kevin sitting on the ledge of the loading dock where the large sliding metal door led to the inside. He was smoking his usual 2 cigarettes for breakfast. He wore what seemed to be the same pair of blue overalls with a tear in the knee of the left leg and black streaks along the right thigh where he would put out his cigarettes. This was complimented by his navy blue plaid shirt with his name tape clipped to the right overall strap. You would mistake him for a tall, slender farmer if he put a piece of wheat in his mouth and a wicker hat on his head.  The black steel toe boots he wore always looked like they had a fresh coat of polish. Reminded me of the combat boots we use to wear with the BDU's from back in my army days. He always had the latest news and gossip about what was going on inside the building. I would jokingly call him my inside man. As I walked up, he tossed his currently lit cigarette inside the metal coffee can he had sitting next to him only after he put the embers out in the usual spot on his overalls with a couple of light, quick swipes. He brushed any remnants of ashes left behind with the back of his hand.

""Hey Nathan, did you hear?""

""Hear what?"" I said with slight interest.

Kevin started looking around as if he were about to tell the most top secret classified information the world had ever not heard.

""Martha decoded the signal!"" he said in a low tone.

""Signal?""

""You know about the signal Nate.""

""What signal?"" My confusion was growing as well as my curiosity.

""Jesus Christ Nate, I'm talking about the Wow! signal!"" At this point Kevin's voice was turning into a stern whisper.

""Alright Kev, just calm down and lower your voice will ya?"" I said with a slight chuckle. I knew about the Wow! signal as did everyone else in the building. It was a radio astrology building after all. But I wasn't going to make that point out loud to him. It might jeopardize our relationship. Who else was I going to get intel from if I got on Kevin's bad side? I just continued to listen attentively.

""This is big Nate! Nobody has been able to figure out what this signal means or if it means anything at all since the 1970's!"" You could tell he was getting excited as his voice was growing louder with each sentence.

""Martha said she was going to be releasing her findings after getting confirmation with her team.""

I was very intrigued with this information. Kevin never let me down with making my day start off great. If what he said was in fact true, this may very well be one of the greatest discoveries in all of radio astrology history. I would contain my excitement until I had further information. What better way to gather it but from Martha herself.

&amp;#x200B;

I walked back to the front of the building after chatting for a few more minutes with Kev. My shins began hurting as I quickly walked straight to the elevators just past the desk at the entrance as you walk in. I couldn't get the doors to close soon enough. I headed to the top floor of the building where Martha's office was. As the doors opened, I turned to the right and walked through the double glass doors to the Audio Data Processing Center. Her office was the fourth one on the left just down the small hallway.

&amp;#x200B;

As usual, her office door was open and the blinds were pulled up to let in as much natural light as possible. She had a fan blowing near the doorway just far enough to not be hit by her office door as you walked in. She was hunched over her desk as she was typing furiously while over focusing on her computer screen. She had several pictures of her cats spread unevenly across her desk along with a couple of cat memes taped to the window. You could see the pixelated words of ""Hang in There"" at the top with a cat grasping at a small branch. She stopped typing and looked up.

&amp;#x200B;

""What do you want Nate? Can't you see I'm very busy. I don't have time for any of your bad dad jokes this morning.""

I was slightly hurt by her abrupt honesty but I was not here to make small talk.

""Is it true Martha? Did you really figure out what the signal was?"" I didn't want to sound too excited as to not get my hopes up. I saw her eyes widen after I asked the question.

""Shut the door Nate."" she whispered. Apparently everyone had secrets to tell today.

She got up from her chair after I gently closed the door. She walked around to the front of her desk and turned the chair so she could pick up the pile of paperwork stacked at least two feet high.

""Sit down Nate. You are going to wan't to be sitting when I tell you this.""

It was like some bad scene from a sci-fi movie with that exact same cheesy line. I couldn't help but laugh through my nose a little. I took her up on the offer.

&amp;#x200B;

[WP] The year is 2035 and America has finally landed on Mars. However when they step out of the shuttle the first thing they see is a fifty year old Soviet flag.,Toasterwars11,"""There were a total of three habitat domes, sir. We can't be sure, but by all the scoring, we'd date the settlement's construction back in 2020."" General Fraiser sat with his face in his hands. His head was throbbing, feeling as if it might split open. Never in his twenty years of service had he even considered he would find himself in such a political shitstorm.

After the Soviet site had been found, all feeds of the Mars landing had been cut. Though none of the footage had reached the public eye, many were already speculating reasons for the cutoff. Some were to be expected; the paranoid shut-ins flooding the internet with bogus theories of first contact being made with extraterrestrials and the feed being cut to hide it from the masses. Such nonsense was quickly dismissed and their sources easily discredited thanks to a plethora of absurd statements they had previously made.

What was truly proving to be a nightmare were the theories that the landing team had perished due to some cosmic event or lack of preparation on the part of NASA. Though the feed had been reestablished only a few hours later, with the landing team having moved to a different location far from the Soviet relics, news outlets had begun sensationalizing things, going so far as to imply some catastrophic technical failure had stranded the astronauts on the Martian surface.

Countless politicians and officials involved with the project had been getting hounded by swarms of vulturous reporters trying to get them to confess some details about the comm blackout. Thus, General Fraiser had been receiving countless angry calls from said harried officials, all seeking some bit of information that could sate the thirst of their tormentors. Things only became worse as he had tried to placate them all by saying ""we're working on it.""

All attempts to gather some information from the Russians on this matter had proven equally disastrous. Everyone with whom the General spoke either insisted that the existence of such a relic was sheer nonsense and that General Fraiser was either mistaken or ""out of his damn mind.""

Yes; today was truly a shitstorm.

""So far, we've found the remains of fourteen people. We've yet to identify any of them, however. Whatever happened there was...well, a catastrophic failure."" The General looked up at his aid incredulously. ""Thank you for that enlightening insight, Marcus. Perhaps next you'll tell me that they couldn't breathe on the surface."" The aid laughed, then realized General Fraiser wasn't sharing in his mirth and assumed a manner more befitting a standing beside the sickbed of a friend.

""We're waiting on the team's report. Once we have that, we'll at least have some guess as to what caused the facility to go down. Then we can come forward with--"" The general raised his hand up, his eyes burrowing deep into the aid's own. ""Are you out of your mind?"" The aide tried to maintain eye contact, but failed, instead finding great interest in his papers. ""W-well, if we explain to the public--""

The general stood up, causing the aide to jump. ""***This*** will be not be made public knowledge, under any circumstances."" He moved around his desk to the television on the opposite wall of his office. Though muted, one of the many reports of the Mars mission comm blackout was playing. The general pointed at it angrily, still glaring at his aide.

""This has been the worst PR nightmare our space program has endured since that leather-faced fuckhead proposed militarizing space shuttles. Can you even ***fathom*** what would happen if our greatest achievement was undercut by those dirty rooskies?!"" The General stormed back to his aide, his eyes full of malice. ""Our greatest achievement in history was being the first and only country to reach the moon. I will not see that honor sullied by word of us getting out-paced to mars!""  


The room fell silent for what seemed like an eternity. Finally, the general's ire passed and he resumed a more dignified, diplomatic tone. ""We can only assume the Russians have not spoken out about their facility due to it having been compromised. If they don't speak of it, neither shall we."" General Fraiser closed his eyes and ran his hands through his hair.

"[WP] In this world super powers are real. And there is one easy way to tell if someone has super powers. Their eyes. If some one has eyes that arent the normal colors (normal being blue, brown, green etc.) then they have some sort of special ability. You have always had one purple, and one blue eye.",ahrynghost811,"Heterochromia iridum is when a person has two different colored eyes. People with ""different"" eye colors have some kind of super power more often than not. For example, my friend has golden eyes that actually glow slightly in the dark. His power is the ability to see through walls. My teacher has pink eyes, and is able to hold everybody's attention at will.

The only person I know of who has deep purple eyes like the one that I have is able to turn invisible at will. They were kind of a folk legend, and revered as some sort of secret agent. My other eye looks normal at first glance, but similar to my friend, it glows in the dark, but it glows a very bright blue. It used to be joked that my power was to be a lamp.

Today I found out, my heterochromia seems to grant my two different abilities. The one purple eye doesn't make me invisible, but when I will it, nobody seems to pay attention to me unless i specifically touch them. I assume it comes from that eye, anyways, based on the secret agent from before. The other is weird. I'd always had a penchant for singing, you see. I was in the chorus.

I noticed something was wrong when I started getting in trouble for being absent from chorus when I had definitely attended. I made my discovery shortly thereafter. Singing quietly in the bathroom while surrounded by friends, then stopping after we went back into the school's hallways, my friends seemed confused that I was with them. 

""What do you mean you don't remember that I was with you? I came with you from our last class!"" I said incredulously. I was met with a blank stare and confused looks.

""I mean, obviously you came but..."" Carla started. She gave the other girls a look and they all seemed to be thinking the same thing. They couldn't remember where I was. Suddenly, Sofia seemed to remember something.

""I remember you walking with us! You were humming that song we practice for chorus, right?"" She was on to something. I had stopped humming about halfway down the hall, though. Her memory seemed to cut off right as my singing had started. I was struck with an idea.

""Let me try something,"" I said. They seemed nervous at first. I was a bit of a prankster at times, but those days were long gone at this point. I began to sing a song, and at the same time, I willed myself to go unnoticed. I then took a marker from Sofia's backpack and drew a line of Carla's hand. When I finished the verse, I held the marker behind my back.

""Well?"" Carla asked, ""We're waiting."" I chuckled a bit and told her to look at her hand. She seemed confused, but not altogether surprised.

""Did you have that on you in the classroom?"" I asked her.

""I mean, I must've..."" she began, her sentence losing itself before she could complete it. Sofia was equally confused, and neither of them seemed to understand what had just happened.

""So you both know I can make you not pay attention to me, right?"" I quizzed them. They nodded, since it wasn't exactly a secret. ""I just found out what else I can do!"" I said happily. They tilted their heads at me.

I began to sing again. As I was singing, I slapped both of them. Not full force, but enough that it should sting a little. Then I immediately stopped singing. They both seemed very surprised that their faces hurt, but still didn't seem to know it was me. This time, I hadn't even willed myself to not be paid attention to.

""Guys, I can erase your memories of me."" I said. ""Anything that I do while I'm singing is completely forgotten."" They seemed a little bewildered, but also excited. Now that I know my full potential, maybe now I can figure out how to become a professional superhero.",publiker

All the other pods in the chamber freeze up as I bear witness to a population of 9 billion people close their eyes.

My muscles contract in anticipation of my freezing body. A soothingly cool sensation diffuses across my skin as my body enters a state of tranquility. 

Am I dreaming?

Everything is the same. My heart throbs, nostrils flare, digits moves, eyes blink, and my breath stinks. My hands form a fist as I punch out against the glassy surface of my pod. Lukewarm liquid trickles down my knuckles as it freezes up in response to the pod's decreasing temperature. 

This isn't a dream.

I cock back my leg to bash my knee onto the pod. Searing heat and biting cold knaws at my right leg as it bleeds out. I notice that my knee left a crack on the pod's surface. My right foot takes a few jabs at the crack until the pod finally succumbs to my violent thrashing. Glass shatters everywhere and heat from the atmosphere outside rushes into my pod. I crawl out and notice that I am the only person awake. 

My senses leave my dangling left hand, pain rushes in through my right leg, and my right foot throbs with an acute discomfort of a thousand needles. My eyes dart around the pod filled room. 

I walk towards the pod adjacent to the left of mine and tap the chilling surface of the pod. The woman inside makes no reponse. She still doesn't wake up to the cacophony of my right fist banging on her pod.

I slump down on my rear realizing that I am lost. I am the only person awake right now.",1-13110T1-131-3

I had just left from an argument with my partner and honestly couldn’t believe today was the day. We had both been stressed for days leading up to today. It only made sense today was the day it would finally boil over. Although, I still don’t know how they could have said what they did right before we separated to go off to our pod placements and sleep for the next century.

When I stepped in my pod I just stood and thought, “At least I’ll have a hundred years to think of a comeback.” 

I look around, seeing others eyes slowly shutting, reopening only after a hundred more years. I start to close mine, but then see something dart out of the corner of my eye.

That’s when I saw them. My two best friends. 

For the last few weeks they had been on conspiracy forums online that led them to the conclusion that Shutdown Day was actually “Extermination Day.” I didn’t believe them considering for the last few years every conspiracy theory they had, &amp; I had been a part of, ended up with all three of us looking like fools and our weekends spent in Detention Holding Cell Block 3.

My Pod started counting down... “Section 7 Pod D sleep cycle commencing, 10... 9... 8...” 

I see my two friends at my Pod’s control panel. I’m mouthing words they’ve heard me share far more than once from our past history of countless stupid endeavors. 

“7.... 6.... 5... 4...” 

A flash of sparks lights up my pod. “Error! Error!” My Pod hatch shoots off and my friends grab me. 

“Hurry!” “We don’t have a lot of time and we still need to get Sam!” They look horrified. I know something is not right.

I’m trying to keep up pace and start to ask questions but they say there’s no time.

As we’re running to Sam’s Pod I start to look into other pods that have started the sleep cycle. Something seems off. 

We reach Sam’s Pod. Now is when I really start to panic. I still haven’t thought of a come back...

You see, most people are normal. Almost all of them. I am not.

I’m not sure when I first noticed it, but it was early on. In elementary school we moved a lot, but I always laughed at my classmates. I wasn’t entertained by Pokémon or baseball cards or Legos. I was focused on academics. How do I get smarter? How do I beat the 5th graders as a 1st grader. It was weird, but it just felt so natural. Natural to me at least. 

In middle school I started to get odd looks. Teachers would point and stare. I knew that they were whispering. In hindsight, I wish it was because I was odd or needed help, but it was for an entirely different reason. I was smart. Smarter than them. If you’re not aware, that’s not a way to build goodwill amongst your peers or your teachers. Especially when you’re 12. 

In high school I blended in...or at least tried to. I played sports, lifted weights, dated girls, but couldn’t ever avoid the stigma. I was the smartest person in the room...in every room. Hell, I fucked our student teacher a couple of times because of it. 

College Chemistry? No problem. Calculus? How elementary. Physics? They hired me and called it an internship. The only thing I didn’t like doing was standing in front of my peers, so they made me take Theatre. Fuck them. Fuck Macbeth. 

When it was time to take the ACT, most people worried...I didn’t. I went out with my friends, drank too much whiskey, and showed up a little late. No problem. I could tell by the way the professor who handed it to me looked at me that she knew what I knew. No matter how red my eyes were, I’d be acing the test. She was right. She still talked about it every first day of school until “The Sleep”.  

In college, I had my choices. Penn, Stanford, Harvard, Oxford...you name it. Which university and their board could suck my dick hard enough to interest me. Honestly, none of them...

I was a poor kid from the Midwest. I wasn’t worried about money or job offers or networking. I could have gone to the local community college and nothing would have changed, but I went for the experience. Ate their fancy dinners, drank too much of their fancy wines, and sweet talked too many of their fancy wives. I never felt comfortable doing it, but it seemed to please them, so I did it anyway. 

After floating through the first few years at Harvard... I was approached one night and it caught me off guard. I’m usually in front of these things. I’m not usually caught off guard. 

I was on a late night run. One of those runs where the music kicks in and distance goes out the window. The headphones drowned out the deep sound of my breathing. I’d meant to turn around after 10 minutes, but there I was 45 minutes in staring at Fenway and staring at the Green Monster. 

Between strides, I thought back to my childhood. Thought of the Red Sox coming back from 3-0 vs the Yankees. Pedro. Manny. Papi. Damon. So many exciting moments. So many late nights. So many years ago. It made me think of my mom. Made me think of simpler times. 

Just as I looked away though and quit dreaming about those silly games ..I was grabbed. Before I knew it I was out. Everything went dark.

When I woke up, I was drowsy. My first thought was I don’t feel in control. I usually feel in control. 
 
The tall guy spoke up first. He told me thank you. Thank you for venturing so far. Thank you for being vulnerable. Then they mentioned their name and affiliation. I’d never heard of them, but apparently they had heard of me. They called themselves “The Legends”. The tall guy continued and I listened. He said, “Michael, thank you for messing up. You’ve completed our crew. It’s time to get started”.

I’d known that I was smart. Known that I was different, but I never imagined that anyone else was like me. Turns out, these guys were. They were all exactly like me. They had planned this all before I could ever think about it. Maybe that’s why I was the youngest. 

They told me that there was a big event happening exactly 10 years from this day. Of all the things I knew, I’d never heard of it. I guess the only class I’d ever been remotely less than exemplary at was history. Apparently our population was getting too big. We had too many people. Ate too much food. Had too much sex. The world was asking us to stop. Probably more appropriately, forcing us to stop. 

In 2028, everybody was expected to take a pill, fall asleep, and wake up in a hundred years. The natural resources would survive. We would survive. And the status of those who had fallen asleep would remain unchanged. When everyone woke up, the world would be fine. Almost the same as when we left it. It was a good plan. A good plan if it weren’t for us.

They pinned me for the chemistry part. They had built a pill that could defeat the monitor, but they hadn’t found a way to control its duration. Some people slept for 12 minutes. Some people slept for 12 years others for 120. That wasn’t good enough. They needed a fake, but it had to work. We had to wake up 30 minutes after everyone else went asleep. That was 5 minutes after any natural biological discrepancies could creep in. 

When I finally felt normal, we went to the lab. It was an easy fix really. I laughed in their faces as they begged me to explain the details. They’d added one too many sulfates and that was causing the discrepancy. After 10 minutes I had fixed it. The pill worked. Throw it in. Fall asleep. Wake up in thirty minutes. Now what..

The hard part was waiting. Most of this happened in 2018. I’d fixed the chemistry at the start of 2019. The Sleep wasn’t until 2028. 10 years of waiting? I can’t wait 10 minutes! 

The Legends forced me to act normal. Forced me to play the same role I have played my whole life, act like I’m not as smart as I am. They made me graduate. That was no problem. They made me take a job at Bain. That was no problem. They made me get married. I would have fought it, but she was so hot, that was no problem either. 

My wife was amazing. So was our wedding day, but I faced the same challenges most people do. I dealt with the sleepless nights of fatherhood. Dealt with growing apart from a woman I thought I loved. Even dealt with feeling incapable of doing a job I was more than capable and more then compensated for doing. The only problem is... most people feel hopeless when that happens. Some give up. I wouldn’t... my hope was on the horizon.

When the ball dropped on 2028 I watched from Times Square. The divorce was long final. Sure we were cordial, but we were far from in love. The sex was weird, but it felt good. The emotions didn’t. Somehow we thought it would help things, but we always left feeling worse than before. Despite that, she asked me to be there on the day. Asked me to walk with them to “The Sleep”.

As a man, it was hard. These were my kids. This was my ex-wife. We’d spent nights talking about the future and where it would lead us. I’d looked my children in the eye and told them it would be okay. Told them I’d be there for them. They didn’t know I wasn’t capable of falling asleep. Had no idea I built the pill that actually prevented it. 

When we got there, most of the country had already been put to sleep. They had built a system where they were funneling people in, making them take their pill, and putting them in their pod. It had worked flawlessly. The monitors told no lies. I’d heard from the rest of the crew, we were full go. I had no idea when or where we would meet up, but I had no doubt that it would happen. Hell, I’d built the thing, but that still didn’t calm the nerves. 

I kissed my girls goodbye. They’d had health issues as kids and I’d told them it’d be like that. Prick of the needle. Cold rush. Darkness. Then a little while later, awake. It was all true, except nothing would ever be the same when they awoke. 

After leaving them, I found my ex-wife. She kissed me unexpectedly. It was the first time I’d felt that kind of kiss since the day we got married. That tugged at my stomach. On a day where I was prepared, or at least thought it was, it caught me off guard. 

She asked me to go in with her. Apparently they had built pods for couples. The pods were entirely separate, but they had bridges in the middle. It allowed you to hold hands as you took the pill. Allowed you to wake up holding those same hands in 100 years. 

We walked to it slowly. Her nervous. Me faking it. Or at least trying to. Faking got harder when she kissed me. I was definitely nervous too. 

We crawled in. My first thought was that the cushion was cold. The kind of cold that freezes your whole body. That didn’t help with the nerves. A few seconds later, the lid slid down and the general voice counted down, “3...2....1... ladies and gentleman, boys and girls, please take your pill”. I looked at my ex-wife nervously. She looked at me confidently. We kind of smiled and took the pill together. Right before it entered her mouth, she winked. The same wink I’d seen a hundred times, but this one felt different. 

My eyes grew heavy. That cold rush hit me just like I had told my girls. All the sudden it was dark. Then....30 minutes later....just like I had programmed it to....I was awake. All of “The Legends” would be awake.",the_lowside

**Excitement was high for months leading up to the day everyone goes into Cryo. Being born close to a cycle was considered lucky by some, personally I had my doubts. At only twenty years old, I felt a bit shorted. Looking around, I was able to see the busy Technician-Class androids going about their preparations for the long sleep. Gentle blue light radiated out of their face panels, they emitted low humming and clicking noises while typing on various consoles. Only days out of training, I felt this was a serious inconvenience. However, to refuse was simply not an option, heavy corrective measures were a guarantee for any that tried to resist the laws.**  

**Silently, I eased in to the pod. The utilitarian overalls provided** **were dark gray, and loose, but not uncomfortable. “Please place your hands on the appropriate handles at this time David.” insisted the control computer. I did as instructed. They were cold to the touch, like most things found in Cryo centers. The hatch closed, as did hundreds of others in bay thirty eight. Trying to stay calm, I took several slow breaths. Without further warning, facility lights were switched off, and the process begun. The suspension liquid began to fill the chamber, thankfully it was set to a reasonable temperature. The fluid stopped about halfway to my chest as I heard a faint grinding noise coming from the back of my pod. Something seems off, “Excuse me?” I said, hoping to get the computer system to respond. Nothing. “My pod is having trouble, please send a technician.” slightly more panicked. I was greeted with only silence and darkness, save for a few softly glowing indicator lights on the pod across from mine.** **After hours of banging, shouting, and searching for some means to get out, the hatch unlocked on its own. The fluid gushed through to the floor as I pushed it open. I crawled out, straining to see anything that might help me understand what was happening. Feeling my way to the right, I pushed my face to the glass of the next pod. A faintly lit person stared back, clearly locked in Cryo-sleep, eyes wide open staring blankly. I had to look away, as dark thoughts began to rush in and take hold. “Is-s anyone out t-there, can anyone h-hear me?” I couldn’t bring myself to raise my voice much, and it cracked some. Nothing but rows and rows of pods with faint glowing indicators were revealed. The darkness was unnerving, but I couldn’t stay forever, I had to find a way out. I had to find someone to help.**  
 

**All of bay thirty eight were successfully in Cryo. As well as bay thirty seven, thirty six and thirty five. When I got in to bay thirty four, I was immediately aware of another non-sleeper. The back of my neck tingled, my heart raced. “Hello” a voice called from the darkness. It was soft, and feminine, and somewhat pleasant. My heart beat slowed, human contact was a welcome change of events. “I’m here by the door” I called, “My name is David”. I heard some scraping and shuffling as she tried to follow my voice. “I’m Lilly, nice to meet ya Dave.” After several minutes of Marco polo, we located each other. I had to crane my neck and lean down to look her in the eye. She was much shorter than myself, and close enough in age that we could have been classmates. “Do you have any idea what is going on?” she sounded as distressed as I. “No, I’m afraid I don't”. “lets find our way out, maybe there are some techs left that we can ask for help” she took the lead and we carefully made our way to bay thirty three.**  
 

**Two more early twenty somethings were stumbling around in bay ten, Marcus and Jen. When we were feeling along in bay three we found Will, still banging on the inside of his pod. We felt around and searched for a way to unlock it, noticing a small symbol crudely scrawled onto the side, faintly glowing green. “Hey guys look at this”, Lilly exclaimed. Marcus looked, “Ya, I saw that on my pod too”. It had a long line with five smaller lines branching off. Eerie, I wondered if it had been on mine as well. The five of us were able to get to the main controls, though we hadn’t found any technicians. All systems were locked down with encryption passwords, we weren’t going to get help here, “I see we have our new recruits”  a weathered voice of an older man came from behind us. All startled, we turned around to see just a glimpse of a man, in dark robes. ""Follow me."" He seemed to evaporate into the darkness.**

It was getting darker as my car drove me to the mysterious location. I gazed at thousands of empty and dark skyscrapers. Low-rise buildings were very rare. High fertility rates had caused the population to grow at an alarming rate in the 2050’s, and the government responded by constructing more houses. But it was not enough. While fertility rates were at an all-time high, life expectancy had increased at the same rate. Forests, deserts, shores and even parks and gardens all made way for more residential buildings. These buildings then grew taller and taller. First they had between four and twelve stories. Now they all had more than fifteen stories. Besides the exceptionally rich and important government officials, everyone lived in high-rise buildings. Overpopulation had changed our climate but especially our way of living. 

A bright light was shining towards me from the near distance. Upon getting closer, I saw that it was a searchlight. One that the military would use for the defence against night-time air raids. 

*You have arrived at your destination. Have a good day, Mr. Crane.* 

I stepped out of my car. Two men slowly walked towards me. They were armed with automatic weapons but kept them lowered. Would one of these men be the voice that came from the radio?

“Mr. Crane?’’ one of the men said. I nodded.

“Come with us please”, another man said. 

“What is going on, why are we not in hibernation?” I asked, not recognizing the voices.

“Everything will be explained.”

We walked through the lobby which, to my surprise, was full of other people. We were not greeted by any of them because they all seemed to be busy. Men and women were calling and walking fast. In the corner of my eye I noticed that two men were pushing a cart with firearms and ammunition into one of the elevators. 

We stepped in one of the elevators. “Fourteenth floor”, one of the men said and the elevator promptly closed its doors. 

When we arrived upstairs, a tall middle-aged man greeted me. He looked pleased to see me and caught me by surprise by hugging me.

“Welcome, my son.” It was the voice from the radio. 

&amp;#x200B;

My father had explained everything to me. About how he had to fake his death to remain the invisible leader of the Humanity First group, and how the group had to operate from the shadows after the government decided to crack down on it. He had also told me that Shutdown Day was invented by a conspiracy group of wealthy and influential people who wanted to rule the world. While everyone else was sleeping, the group would enslave the population by using mind-control technology.  

“I could not let them turn you into a slave. We had to disable your pod,” my father said. 

I felt happy for the first time since my childhood. When I lost my mother and later my father, I became severely depressed. This reunion felt like a cure. Although I was initially angry at my father for pretending to be dead, his noble explanation changed that. He did it to save humanity from slavery.  

The next day, my father told me that the plan of Humanity First was to seize the conspirators and disable the Hibernation Pod Programme. The group had planned this for years, but now everything had to happen quickly. The conspirators had to be caught before they found about Humanity First’s continuing existence. 

“We need to do this quickly”, my father said. 

“They have access to the central command centre that allows them to open pods to their liking. We can only open them one by one by hacking into the pod’s systems. If they find out about us, they will open pods and turn the people in them against us.”  
 I stared outside, onto the empty city. What would the consequences be if all this failed? What if humanity would be controlled by a small group of people? We had to stop this. I had felt useless during my depression, but now I could finally make a change. 

A light in the far distance appeared. Was that coming from a flare gun? Two lights appeared, then three, then four. An alarm started ringing throughout the building.

“Quickly, downstairs!” my father said. 

Everyone was running. As we ran downstairs, I heard the sound of fighter jets. The sound of guns and explosions silenced the alarm. I stopped for a moment and looked outside.

Rockets were flying directly to us. They shattered windows, blew away furniture, and I could feel the heat of the explosion. 

I was knocked down.

I fainted. 

&amp;#x200B;

""Good morning, Mr. Crane.""

""Thank you for participating in the Government Hibernation Programme. You can find your belongings in the locker next to your hibernation pod. The keycode is located on your My Government application.""

Unbelivable! I manage to grow karma!
Well, the story is a little more complicated. When i found the seeds, I desided to take care of them, because why not? I have a small garde in my backyard, and nothing better to do. So, they grew, but i didn't recognize them. I mean, I am not butanic expert, but I had a feeling they werent regular flowers.
One week ago, I found 5 dollars on the round near a homeless and desided to give it to him. When I came back to my house, I found 100 dollar bill in my mailbox! At first, I thought i won the lottery for poor people or somthing, however, when I got to my garden, my strange folwer got a lot more bigger then it was in the morning. 
I desided to do an experiment. First, I ordered myself a huge hamburger with fries with the 100 dollars I found, but nothing happend to the flower. So I desided to go a little farther. I found the homeless guy, sat next to him, and ate the entire meal without oferring anything to him. In my way back, I noticed my shirt was dirty from ketchop. My first instinct was ""sh*t"" but it confirmed what I had thought. When I got home, I saw one of the small fruit from my flower went black.
I got two conclusion from my experiment:
One: Good action get my prizes and make the flower grow bigger
Two: Bad action get me punished and make the flowers fruit go black.
From those conclusion I desided to do two things: I went and bought the homeless guy hamburger and named the flower ""karma"".
Now, what to do?

The last guy I tried to talk to just rolled his eyes and said “and then the whole town clapped”. But you won’t dismiss me, will you? You’ll listen to my confession. It’s the sort of tale that may leave you sleepless…

When the seeds first sprouted, none of my friends knew what was this thing. You’ve learnt in school that plants all have green bits to photosynthesise with - but not these ones. Inexplicably, the seeds sprouted completely orange, from the top of their wide pointy shoots to the bottom of their flared, mushroom-like caps, down to their long, thin stalks. In addition, sometimes a single seed seemed to sprout multiple orange shoots, and sometimes whole patches of my yard - under which I had been certain that I’d scattered plenty of seeds - not a single orange point was to be seen. Was this just some mildly interesting natural phenomenon? Or a case of absolute black magic fuckery? I decided I had to undertake further research - I had to ask science.

My plan had simply been to bring a - bouquet? bushel? - of the orange arrowheads to the local natural history museum, and get a couple of my cool old schoolmates who now worked there to look it over, see if they could identify the species. But as soon as I stepped out of the gate around my front yard, the plants tucked under my arm, things began to change for me.

You have to understand - I used to be normal, like you, before I took the arrows to the museum. I wasn’t famous or well-known or anything. People didn’t care about me, and that was fine. But on that first day, it was different. People were *bros*. People noticed me, looked at me with respect, said hello to me like they’d known me forever. I’d get on a bus and the driver would take one look at me and tell me he needed to introduce me to his friend Dave (or was Dave the bus driver? The details blend into each other… it’s like a bad joke, now). Someone would stand and offer me his seat. The cute girl next to me would talk to me first, giggle politely at my awkward jokes, and leave her number before she alighted. It was always small things, but they added up, they made every new day uplifting, they made me… happy.

\---

I should tell you what came of the trip to the natural history museum, before I forget. That was the one dim spot on my first day. I had called my schoolmate Josiah, who had taken a surprise degree in Biology after spending our high school days declaring that he was part of the Phys/Chem master race. Josiah lit up as soon as I walked into his office, but his expression became very strange and blank as soon as he saw what I had brought him. He waved me over and sat me down.

“I’m familiar with these,” he told me. “You planted them?”

I explained how I had found the seeds and had scattered them around my yard as a lark, not expecting anything to happen.

Josiah did not seem as pleased as I’d hoped he would be. Becoming alarmed at his expression, I demanded to know what I had brought.

“The orange bits are called ‘Upvotes’, but the plant itself is called ‘karma’. Kind of like that Sanskrit thing - you get back what you give, but sometimes in an unpredictable way. I’d caution you against karma farming.”

“Karma farming?” Is that what I had been doing? “But why not? It’s a pretty… plant. I quite like it. It feels nice, like I’ve achieved something.”

“There are enthusiast communities on the internet, if you’re really into that sort of thing. People will study what time of day to plant the seeds, what sort of soil, all that stuff, trying to farm as many upvotes as possible. From a scientific perspective, though, it’s all very random. Sometimes it grows, sometimes it doesn’t. There isn’t a way to guarantee a lot of upvotes, and there isn’t any big industrial karma conspiracy…”

Josiah frowned, and then shook his head.

“I guess there’s no reason why you shouldn’t be a karma farmer. I hope you don’t get too much into it, though.

“And why not?”

“It’s just… karma’s a bitch sometimes.”

\---

I want to say that I got home, listened to Josiah’s advice, and went on living my life… but with all the pleasant interactions I had had with the people in my neighbourhood when they saw me carrying all the upvotes, I couldn’t take him seriously. I knew there was a correlation between the bright orange arrows and all the validation I was getting from the strangers around me. Who cared about what Josiah thought? I was going to farm karma, and I was going to farm it hard.

And at first, I put in the work - I really did. I went out to find more seeds, searching in a variety of places - I did daytrips to forests, lakes, nearby mountains, picking up seeds in the midst of natural beauty lit by glowing twilights. I read up on the best time of day to plant the karma seeds. I exhausted myself trawling through the soil of my yard, testing the soil types, matching the seeds I found to the spaces I could plant them.

And it worked for a time, it really did. My yard bloomed with upvotes, and as I harvested them, strangers continued to validate me. People stepped aside for me in queues, laughed loudly at my terrible jokes, and offered me assistance with the smallest things. My motherly neighbour, seeing me with my garden full of karma, once winked over the fence and told me she’d take care of me if I ever broke my arms - although for some reason, I felt a bit too uncomfortable to respond with gratitude. I completely forgot about what Josiah had said. Karma farming was my life now.

Eventually, it wasn’t enough. I got addicted to the high. I needed more. I didn’t want validation from just a few random strangers in a small town - I wanted my garden to be on world news! On the front page! It must sound ridiculous to you, now, looking at me today… I used to have grandiose dreams of people tweeting about my garden all the way from Scotland, tellen there frends ow fokken excited they were to have learned about my karma farm today.

And I think that’s where it started. I think that’s when I began to steal other people’s karma.

I can already see the look in your eyes change. All this while you were rooting for me, and now you’re disgusted. You’re thinking I deserve to be where I am today. I’m not going to fight that. I’m here because of what I did.

At first, it was nothing much. Just cheerfully walking around the neighbourhood, looking for people who also had karma in their yards. Where someone had a bush with a lot of upvotes, just casually grabbing a graft to put into my own yard. Not all replanted karma grafts get upvotes, you know - but generally a good plant will do very well when put into some new soil. It wasn’t even really stealing - who was I hurting, anyway? Karma’s not a competition. Maybe it was trashy behaviour. Mildly infuriating, to some. But I never meant any harm - how could anyone really say that I was an asshole by design? I just wanted the attention. Just an idiot fighting my own irrelevance, just some junkie gone wild.

You know the rest. Just like everyone else who tried that shortcut to farming karma. Nowadays you read about people like me in school, so that you don’t fuck up like I did. It wasn’t karma court that brought me down in the end, though - although some people would say that’s what happened.

It was downvotes.

Karma’s a real bitch, Josiah had warned me, and he was right. The seeds and grafts that I had stolen from yards all around had brought with them their own little ecosystems - bugs and pathogens and whatnot - and they didn’t mix well with each other. Eventually the upvotes sickened and wilted. From bright orange, they faded, dropped, and shriveled into dim greys and blues. By the time I realised where I had gone wrong and tried to quit my bullshit, it was too late. My hunger for upvotes had coaxed me into a SNAFU. As my yard grew unkempt with downvotes, the respect and validation I gained from the community plummeted. People stopped greeting me - sometimes they even walked straight into me, as if they never even saw me. Servers in restaurants and shops ignored me, as if they couldn’t hear my voice. Places I used to visit frequently flipped their OPEN signs when I approached. With a single blight of bad karma, my life had suddenly become little but a shadow of what it had once been.

You know, even in my most heady days of karma farming, I wasn’t always selfish. Sometimes I would go out with a bushel of upvotes and give them out to people I saw who didn’t have any karma, to brighten their days. I did some real good out there - people would stop in the middle of what they were doing to give little thank-you speeches - sometimes they would even feel so entitled as to demand to be allowed to choose which upvote I gave them, while I patiently smiled and indulged them. I did some real good out there - let people who had never experienced the joy of validation before feel what it was like to have their very own upvotes.

Ironic… I could save others from downvotes, but not myself.",notanothergrammarbot

You have become a Karma farmer.",reverendrambo,"Befuddlement raced through my mind following my sudden thought that the plants might have to do with my luck. A stroke of luck is one thing, but in my logical mind, the amount of good happening in my life then was a little too lucky. Suspiciously lucky. I backtracked immediately, remembering my place as a scientist (now a head scientist, thanks to my lucky promotion) who doesn't care for superstition. I discarded the notion.

But upon reconsidering it, I am a scientist, and what good is a scientist without great curiosity? I realized what I had lacked, and so I conducted experiments with the plants and documented the results over the next several months. Finding a concrete correlation between events and the plants was nigh impossible, so I relied on a relatively simple formula of my own design. It was inconsistent, to say the least.

It was after 6 months of most of my time not at the lab at work being spent on my garden at home, when I came to a realization. I could more accurately measure the effects of the plants when I killed some of them, if my hypothesis that removing the plants removed luck. 

I was known to be thorough, and felt disappointed in myself for not thinking of this sooner. The results were all in within three months of cutting trees, recording, growing trees, and recording, and rinsing and repeating. I didn't dare share the study, it was a personal project, and no amount of luck could have saved me from public skepticism. A grievous error of mine, I'll say.

See, upon typing the report onto a private document on my laptop, within days, the FBI was at the door. They arrested me, accusing me of abhorrent deeds, like the killing of innocents in some sort of serial manner.

After years of trials for murders I was previously unaware of, I was put on death row. The day I was to die, I was taken to an underground military base instead where I saw the plants once again. This time, however there were millions of them, with names of world leaders and other important people written next to the plants. The government was using my research to pull the strings of the free world.

I played along, revealing more information in small doses, and knew that as far as the rest of the world was concerned, I was a sick dog who got put down. Eventually, I was allowed to roam the gardens to study the plants. I still complied, showing no trace of ill intent. I began tending for the entire garden, and what happened next was my final experiment. An experiment of fate. I took control of the garden, seeing if the luck of the plants would save me. Many needless deaths and many days later, in a gruesome shootout that ended in me bombing the place in, I died. It was at my last breath on that plane of existence that I knew I had become what the world thought me to be. A killer.",ShinyMoneyMan

r/Redditlake so called. It’s a nice place, lots of folk went there to take pictures, quite a lot of karma for a photo.

But i don’t like moving a lot, or taking pictures, that’s why i have a farm, more of a lawn but it’s a farm, a small farm, it has the usual chicken somewhere like a farm should, i don’t own it tho, it eats my karma.

But what’s karma you might be askin’. Well karma is a kind off fruit, sweet in taste, arrow shape thing. Kind off like an orange, except it’s better.

It all began when i decided to move from Terra onto a new planet called Reddit. It’s a uhh.. special place.

When i was in a cave looking for original memes i found some weird looking seeds, a round shape with another smaller ball attach to it, like an angler fish. So i decided to plant them in my lawn for some reason.

In beetwen the harvesting seasons there have been folk coming around, looking in disgust, not everyone accepts karma farming.

There were also folk saying „Karma farming? Really? A man of your talent?” Obviously i knew who they were. And knew how to answer.

„It’s a simple life.”

„Lonely i imagine.” They answered always.

The call came obnoxiously early. Not in the wee morning hours, but at around 7:47 am, just late enough that I was ashamed to still be asleep. I first looked at the date and time on my phone screen to be sure it wasn’t a workday. Then I got annoyed and, despite my better judgement, I answered to call from an unknown number.

“Hello?”

“Hi, is this Marco\_Grows\_Legends?”

I blinked in confusion. My phone number was not associated with my Reddit account, nor was anything else other than a throwaway email. 

“Uhhh, who is this.”

“Reddit customer support. We’re calling in regards to a parcel that may have been shipped to you by mistake.”

“Regarding.”

“Excuse me?”

“ ‘In regards to’ is not grammatically correct.”

They went silent, giving me a second to think. Even half-awake I still knew what they had to be talking about. The seeds. I knew it. The frantic ad had popped up on the Nosleep subreddit, offering mystical seeds to the first PM. I had a few scattered P.O. boxes associated with my exotic plant business. Why not? I figured. 

Of course, I didn’t expect anything to arrive, but when the little duct-taped Tic-tac box of orange triangular tablets arrived in my P.O. box near Milwaukee’s General Mitchell airport I had to laugh. They weren’t actual seeds, just little upvote arrows in the form of chalky breathmints. Since the OP of that post followed through on their end, I followed through on mine, planting them in a spare pot with some sprouting mix. The photos alone earned me 5k votes: the most I’ve ever gotten.

“*Regarding* that parcel you recently received: we’re calling to let you know that you have violated our user agreement by accepting that package. So, we’ll need you to forward that item to the address waiting in your messages or your account will be terminated.”

I was moving to the kitchen by now. I pulled a half-full cup of leftover coffee from the fridge moved it to the microwave while my fresh pot brewed. I looked around the kitchen at little citrus plants, aloe vera, hanging ivy, Mexican mint, rosemary, all wiggling in the breeze from an oscillating fan.

“I’m sorry who did you say this was? Can I ask how you got this number?”

“Reddit, uh, customer care. We just want to make sure you’ve gotten this message, as it may have been hard to see in your inbox.”

I put them on speaker phone and tapped through to my notifications, a bad habit I’ve picked up from months of fruitless shitposting. My coffee stopped at my lips. My Reddit account had over a hundred thousand karma. Well that was a first. People must really like pictures of dirt. 

“I’m going to have to ask you again: how did you get this number and who are you?”

I was starting to get annoyed. The person on the other end seemed to be arguing with someone else in the room, though I couldn’t make out what they were saying. That’s about when I noticed that the planter on the windowsill was no longer just wet dirt. The “seeds” seemed to have risen to the surface, all oriented up like the good little arrows they were, a shade oranger than when I’d planted them.

“OK, I don’t know how you got this number and I have no idea what you are talking about. Don’t worry, though, I will definitely be calling the police after I hang up with you.”

“Uh, I wouldn’t recommend doing that.”

“Oh? Why is that?”

An ant was nibbling on one of the little plants. When the hell did I get ants? I plucked it off and squished it between my fingertips, or tried to. It kept wriggling free before I could end it.

“Well, that parcel is legally someone else’s property, so, you know.”

I gave up killing the ant when it dropped to the floor and scurried away. The caffeine started to tingle on my tongue and I almost forgot I was on the phone as I scrolled through the unusually long list of notifications.

Thousands of views on Youtube for my pruning videos, an inbox exploding with emails from people I’d never heard of before, an ad revenue check in my paypal account for about as much as I made selling plants last month.

“Yeah, I’m going to have to call you back,” I said hanging up on them. Something felt different this morning. For one thing, I felt great. Nothing was wrong and I apparently didn’t have to worry about rent this month. Nothing was wrong, but something sure as hell wasn’t right.

I did find a message from a bogus “RedditCares” username, but more importantly, a notification from the user who sent me the seeds.

“Don’t trust anyone. Don’t accept any calls from unknown numbers. And don’t tell anyone else about the plants. The first stage is done and Reddit R&amp;D can’t stop it now. They should be proud: the whole site was a success! Only, they can’t sell it to big pharma now. It’s time for us to change the world. Welcome to the Karma Farmers.”",JonasHardLuckCharms

The question startled me and a cold shiver shot through my nerves like the shock of electricity. 

“Sorry, Jimmy, I didn’t see you there” I replied. I had surprised the boy as much as he had surprised me. 

I suppose I had stared off again, pensively scanning the horizon of the Nebraska homestead I had built. In the January gray the fields were barren and the snow had turned that dusty brown that it gets when it sits too long before melting or being buried. 

“I guess I was just remembering, Jimmy. How it all began... your grandma and I... this farm” I tried to hide the sadness in my voice. Both had faded from their former glory over the past decade. Hell, I had too. 

The soil had turned, the summers too hot and muggy, the insects too numerous and resilient. What once was a hundred acres of beautiful orange blossoms had become increasingly a sea of sad and wilting blue. 

The life we created, the home we built, was slowly collapsing into itself. The Karma fields just aren’t what they once were. 

“Will you tell me the story, grandpa, of how it all began?”

You have become a Karma farmer.",reverendrambo,"It was a lonely winter night, my girlfriend just left me, I was just fired and to make it all worse; I was failing this semester at college as well. 
And since I was lonely and broke, I decided to just take a walk, I didn't plan where to go, all I was looking for was a place, that is dark so no one can see my tears, my headphones were in my ears some violin piece by Hillary Hahn was playing and that's when I saw this strange looking small plastic bag on the ground.

At first, I thought it might be money but when I held it up, I realize what it actually was, it was a bag full of seeds, I've never seen anything like them before and I knew my seeds. Trying to identify them took me to this new website called Reddit, but to no avail, no one was able to identify them for me, only one logical action remained; to put those seeds in the ground and see what grows, maybe I've stumbled upon a new species of plants or maybe they'll grow to be drugs.
So, I planted them in my yard, watered them and went back to my troubled life, my girlfriend is now with another man, I'm still jobless and my savings are about to run out, but for some strange reason I am not as desperate as I were, I also started using this new Reddit site more and more. 

At first, I wasn't getting any attention, and my weird views were even getting downvoted, at first I didn't care that much about those fake internet points, but as I grew freer and started to lurk on Reddit more and more, I started to care about those fake internet points called Karma, but all my efforts were fruitless, I was never that charismatic of a person, my posts on Facebook never got that much likes or shares, my twitter is an oasis with no likes or retweets and I use it mostly to bitch about how life is hard for me. 
A few weeks later, the strangest thing happened, my plants who now grew a little green stem, had those strange arrow-like orange fruits, I tried touching them they were solid and smelling them gave no smell, They were like something out of a video game even though they were growing on my own backyard,I took one out of the tree back with me to the house, stare at it for a while and then mindlessly put it next to my laptop and browse Reddit for a bit, I wrote a stupid comment on an r/pics post and strangely enough, I got a 100 upvote, I thought it was weird because my comment wasn't even that good but why would I complain? Isn't this the karma I wanted for so long?

A few days go by and my strange arrow tree is now bigger, the fruits are now unmistakeably arrow-shaped, still hard to the touch and still look as if taken out of a video game but they're definitely bigger, again i grab another one and take it back with me to the house, this day I posted a link about an old movie that no one else but me ever liked and oddly enough, I get 3000 upvotes, I didn't even believe it. 
But I was so happy that I'm getting recognition for my taste, maybe life in the real world sucks, and I have no friends, but here on Reddit, people found my taste in movies good enough to upvote 3000 times (maybe more balancing the downvotes) .
A few days go by, my posts aren't getting any attention and my ""witty"" comments aren't being upvoted, so I go back to my yard, stare for a bit on  my weird plant and then mindlessly grab another fruit and take it back to the house with me, the fruit is now visibly bigger and it's strange shape is no longer fascinating for me, but today when I went back to Reddit, I got my first Reddit gold, I didn't believe that someone found my stupid old dad joke funny enough to gild it with Reddit gold bought with real money, that night I made before going to sleep, I made the connection in my mind, I do believe that correlation doesn't always mean causation, but in this case I believed it did. 

Only one way to find out, I wrote a comment, waited, three downvotes, four downvotes, and counting, I go back to the yard grab a fruit and put it next to the laptop. I receive this message from Reddit, someone found my comment worthy enough for a Reddit gold, and now it's in r/negativewithgold, WOW! I always wanted to be on this sub, I smile a satisfied smile.
On the next few weeks, I experiment with the Karma plant, try to understand how it works, I couldn't find any reasonable explanation, It seems that whatever I write or post, gets instant appeal relative to the size of the fruit I had next to me when posting or interacting with one of my posts, also that every fruit can be used once but the seeds can be taken out of them after using. 

Now, I'm a member of r/PopularClub and r/CenturyClub and the all the exclusive and premium subreddits that exist but What good does that do me? Even the feeling of satisfaction I used to get with Karma is no longer satisfying to me, then it hits me. I found a way to make money, I head over to r/slavelabour post a stupid offer about doing something completely useless and it get a 100K upvote, even more upvotes than the number of users in the sub, and of course i make a decent amount of money out of it but I can't do this, I have to find another way. 

So, I create a throway account head over to r/offmychest and r/confession and all the touchy feely subreddits out there, each with a separate throwaway account, make a stupid sobstory about my debt and my nephew who has donkey brain disease and my cat who is dying out of butterfly cancer, I don't ask for donations, but people offer them anyway along with their undying support and thousand of dollars in donations from each and everyone of them. 

My fruits are now depeleted, but my new plant is growing, I'm in an Hotel in Vegas doing cocaine on the buttoks of a 18 year old college studnet whom i met on r/drugs , and life is good, i can barely remember my old girlfriend or my stupid job. 

I wake up out of my trance like state looking at the longass post i wrote in r/writingprompts wishing that people just don't make fun of me!

Pop Culture Trivia.",thisisdumb353,"I've been absorbing useless information my whole life. My entire identity is someone who likes collecting facts. Well, to me that is. Most people think of me as a special kid who can't make time for anything else.

 Whenever I'd visit the hospital, I'd read every women magazine, children book and insurance leaflet in the reception I could find. Whenever I'd go out to eat, or to school, or to work, I'd be focusing on other peoples conversations. People have often criticized me for not paying attention or ignoring them, but it's harder than you think to listen to seven or so different conversations at once. What if I missed something new that I wouldn't have known otherwise?

I've been doing this so long I have my methods. Procedures for whenever I'm made aware of a new topic. New up and coming singer slash artist? I'll have to cut out eating dinner and 45 minutes of sleep for the next two days. That's for the research phase. Who are they? Where were they born? What was their education like? Following on from that, things could start to regress back to normal. Any gaps an knowledge can be filled in with TV interviews, Youtube videos, stuff like that. You can have those on on the background whilst you keep up with day to day stuff like watching for new news.

Today is my birthday. 30th December. Well of course it's not just MY birthday. Statistically there will be about another 19 million people whose birthdays are today, including Tiger Woods and Ellie Goulding. People have been nagging me about choosing my demon for the past few months now. ""You should be reading your Demonography Brad, not watching 4 episodes of Charmed at the same time"". Unfortunately this show slipped my notice when the last general election was going on and I had to keep up to date on that, so I haven't had the time. There was always the possibility I could have stay up late and do it, but I've tried this before and it doesn't work. I've calculated that I absorb about 40% less information on days I stay up more than and hour and a half late If I stay upo too often I'll start falling behind on my Korean soap operas. A newly acquired taste.

The time came around. The hour of my birth. Half past 4 in the afternoon. My uncle is the family man. He paints the pentagram like he has done for all my siblings and cousins before me. My dad lights the candles. One black, one white. This tradition goes back to 1712, where the while symbolizes the pure humanity and the black symbolizes the evil demons we intend to commune with. There's no evidence the colours or the candles themselves matter at all, and there are plenty of recorded enthrallment back in the day. In light of this fact, rather than using the standard issue government candles, my dad settled on some Yankee candles. The gov ones were expensive. Unless you buy them from Amazon as there's been a 20% discount since the 15th.

The one time I'd ever even picked up my Demonography had been the day I'd learnt about Netflix and the dozens of shows I had no knowledge of, so as such I'd barley scratched the surface of the 666 page tome. It's alphabetical by demons name, but of course to be more efficient when reading these kinds of books I'd start with the most important one first. Such that I only know how to summon one demon. Whoops.

The clock struck the correct time. I had only a few seconds to summon my demon. And quick maths in my head tells me it would take me about 4 minutes and 20 seconds to learn how to summon a Shadow, the easiest to learn. I had no choice.

If any of my family intervened they risked having their demons ripped out of them by the Gate of Hell, killing them and dragging their souls into the eternal fire, so all they could do was stand back and watch when I slashed my chest from belly to colar bone and allowed a great deal of blood to spill out onto the floor. The amount of blood required is proportional to the strength of the demon being summoned you see.

Many demons leave the room feeling cold, or a brisk wind comes from nowhere and blows out the candles. It doesn't have the same effect when you've seen it a half dozen times. So when  before anything had happened at all, a leathery black hand grabbed my shoulder and a deep, guttural voice cold as ice spoke directly into my ear, I froze stiff. His movement was as precise like a butterfly, with each stride as purposeful as a lion stalking it's prey. I was so fixated on his form that I couldn't recall what he said to me. He might have said my name. He might have said hello. He might have said I was going to die. All three thoughts gave the same curdling-sickening sensation in my gut.

""Ready to play?"" the demon spoke, each syllable desperately escaping his jaw like hot flickers from a smoldering bonfire. He stoked the jagged features of his face in anticipation. The most I could muster was a robotic nod, one up and one down.

""One thing before we begin"" he started. ""When you try to ensnare the Prince of Darkness, your life and immortal soul is forfeit if you lose"". I figured if we just played chess or Street Fighter or something, I could get the duel of mastery over with and it would be no big deal if I didn't get my demon. But now, everything was on the line.

The Fallen Angel stood in silence waiting for me to speak. I glanced around the room timidly to the bewildered faces of the few onlookers here for my Demon Day. My mother sobbed weakly into my fathers arms. My dad was emulating a strong man, but you could make out his tremors if you paid close attention.

""What game!"" I asked myself angrily in my own head. It was said that Satan possessed reflexes and acrobatics like a cat, a tongue sharp like a silver arrow, and the wit of an ancient Greek philosopher. In what domain could I possibly outmatch him. I could feel his dark shadow cast inside my head, and a destructive smile grew across his face like a lightning bolt arching across the sky.

Was it possible that the Demons would have seen any show I'd seen? Would there be any article, script or manga he didn't already have full knowledge of? Possibly he could know everything, or there would be no point in summoning him...

...

That was it.

""I choose pop culture trivia. All popular culture of the last forty years."" I trembled. I'd given him my answer, and sealed my fate, whatever it was to be. I'd given my life to knowing everything I possibly could. Could I possibly rival the shadow that lurks in every corner and every alley of human society?

""Hahahaha. I accept. Let the games begin!""",CatThatLikesMelon

There are day-mages with a tiny spell for each day, there are week mages with a slightly more impressive single spell for a week, month-mages who have a new magnificent spell they can cast once a month. You're the millennia mage.",Catcomfortable,"""Everyonegained powers"" -- That was known to be the work of a millennia mage. The first millennial mage, so many years ago, brought these powers to life in everyone. They had powers beyond imagination and belief, and honestly, nothing seemed impossible for those mages. But, they were far and few in between, with only two recorded millennia mages.

&amp;#x200B;

Slowly, followed the common mages -- Day, week, month, year mages. One recorded decade mage, with his last act being one of repairing a city broken in an earthquake to it's previous condition. Day mages, well, they had simpler powers. Burning a candle faster, making a fire glow brighter, a plant grow slightly faster for a while, or even making something shine slightly more than it was capable of. Week mages, well, throwing one or two fireballs, causing a strong gust of wind, you get the gist. 

&amp;#x200B;

My mother is a year mage, and my father was a month mage. Well, they had interesting powers, to say the least. My mother could create things out of raw matter provided it wasn't too complex, things like chairs or cots were okay, but things which she couldn't make with her knowledge were too complicated. My dad had the power to, well, power other mages. If they were within a certain threshold, he could let them re-use their power. Obviously, we didn't spread it around that much because that would mean that year mages could use their powers twice or something as absurd as a decade mage having their crazy powers twice in the same 10 years.

Sadly, someone found out, and, well....My father went from an ""is"" to a ""was"". It was a crazy story but it's not about him. 

&amp;#x200B;

This story is about me.   
My mother, she thinks I'm a decade mage. She's waiting for my powers to manifest for the first time, to see how my father's and her powers might have combined or mixed in any way. She was a scientist type, herself, because of her matter creation powers, but I thought I was more of the blacksmith type, or the forger type. I loved swords, loved blades, loved anything that could cut. Call me crazy, but I loved seeing knights of the city train and spar and use their swords against each other, in the squares of Av-e-lon.

&amp;#x200B;

But, back to the point. My mother thought I was a decade mage, but I knew what I was. I'd felt the power brewing within me for so long, some sort of beacon screaming, ""*Here I am! Notice me!*"" But I didn't want to tell anybody, not yet, except one of my human friends, who was sworn to secrecy. The moment I opened my mouth, I was sure i'd face a horrible fate. People were scared, after all, scared, despite what being a millennia mage meant -- Some form of unlimited power, something that was unimaginable beyond belief -- in the hands of the silly sword loving elf-boy. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'd been waiting for weeks, but I could finally use that power. That power which told me, had no boundaries, had no limits, had no way to stop it or had no restrictions. The power of unlimited, absolute, complete creation. 

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to make a sword. I told my human friend, let's call him Shaman, and he said I was stupid. I didn't think he'd understand, because he told me he was a year mage, and i'd met him just a few months back, but we became fast friends. He was smart in many ways, but I felt there was more to him than met the eyes, but, that was maybe just a little bit of human-distrust speaking on my part. 

&amp;#x200B;

He said, ""You know you could probably do anything you want, and you want to make a *sword*? You could make a million gold pieces, you could make the world change, you could do *anything*, and you want to make a shiny thing that *cuts*?"" I scoffed, ""That's the thing, Shaman, not just any sword. Something that's going to go into legend, something that's going to become a legend among legends among legends. I want to make the best sword anyone's ever seen or heard of, and I want it to be remembered."" 

He replied, ""The sword, or you?""

I considered it. I knew I wanted to leave a legacy, but if my creation was remembered, and the creator forgotten, so be it. 

&amp;#x200B;

We left, parting ways, both returning home, and I pondered. Did I really *want* to make a sword? I could be able to do anything, he said, and I didn't want to regret it later. But I felt like...well, it was the right thing to do, and if the sign came, telling me to do it, I would. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then, the signal came. 

The warning.

The sign. 

Humans and elves, well, ""friendly"" would be putting it a bit too optimistically. All it took was a man, and a few of his banded buddies to get together a support base strong enough and determined enough to rid the world of ""the cruel demon-serving"" elves.

&amp;#x200B;

Nobody saw it coming. Nobody was prepared. Everyone. Was. Slaughtered.

I knew if I brought them back, it would do nothing. If I annihilated them, it would solve nothing. I couldn't really think in the shock, of seeing my uncle and my aunt, killed in front of me, and my mother yelling at me to run while grabbing my hand and her papers, frantically, her hair strewn about all over her face. 

&amp;#x200B;

We ran. She ran out, and I followed, but I ran to my safe haven. Shaman. He would understand, he would save me. 

He looked at me with a panicked look on his face, ""I'm sorry"", he breathed, as he realized what exactly had happened to us. Whatever he'd heard from his parents, from his family, it did no justice to the death my people faced. 

""Shaman"", I said, ""I-I think i'm going to do what I wanted. I'm going to make a sword. Something that's not just a piece of metal, but something that people will bow to. Someone stronger than me, someone better than me will take it, and someday that might be my legacy. Someone who could Take It Up, someone who could stop people from killing needlessly, or from slaughtering people because of fear, or, anger, or..""

""You're babbling"", he said. 

""Give it to my mother, Shaman, find her when you find someone worthy. Find her when you think it's the time.""

""You sound like you're going to die, take a breath, you're going into shock really quick right now.""

""That's my power, I realized. The power of sacrifice. I can do any one thing within my best capabilities, and put my life into it"", I said.

""But you could learn more! You could give it time, you could grow up with me, you could become smarter and stronger and change the world! Don't act on an impulse, don't act on some thoughts that're clouding your head!"", he yelled, softly enough for the surroundings but loud enough for me to get even more scared. 

""Remember, Shaman, no; Myrddin, that this is my legacy. This is something that only the highest caliber will take. Someone exceeding that. Someone exceeding that caliber. My legacy, I leave to you, Myrddin."", I said, as the smallest light began to surround me.

&amp;#x200B;

Brighter, brighter, until it was too bright to look at.   
Light went from candle to flame to star, and everything went white.   
I left my legacy in it's place.  
Something of the highest caliber.

My strongest creation, the millennia wizard of the elf, the sword-crazy elf boy -- Excalibur. ",KK750

Also earlier you mention how those without power would seek revenge if/when they got it.  Is that implying that the main character will seek revenge when she gets her power?

&gt;""Hey there. I'm Liz."" A hand extended. A perfect stranger, smiling with the confidence only youth can afford. ""I'm a week-mage. W-E-E-K. I'm actually a pretty strong mage, but Dad says I shouldn't tell people that.""

&gt;""My name's Kelly! I don't know what I am yet. Does your magic help you with puzzles?""

We were friends. A year passed, then two. We stuck fast to each other. She told me I could be a year-mage. That's what the president was. After a year, she offered that I was a decade-mage. She'd heard of them in stories. And there was no way to tell whether I was one. After all, we were only nine. 

Three years later, we stopped talking about magic. 

A year after that, I wouldn't know Liz if she passed me in the hall. Not that she ever did. Story was that her magic was healing. Restoration, available on a weekly schedule. Every person had finite magic. When their magic was depleted, they died. Liz could give them a bit more, a leg up, some comfort in their trials. 

&gt;""Kelly."" Two years later, the girl seemed rougher around the edges. A little drained. A little torn. ""I have a new theory.""

Of course, it takes more than Restoration to save a life. 

&gt;""Liz! It's been a while-""

&gt;""The rumor mill has it that you've yet to cast.""

&gt;""And?""

&gt;""It's nothing new, but it's got me thinking. Your mother was a minute-mage, right?""

Of course. Liz knew that. Mom had shown her. Snapped fingers, a single spark. Mom had laughed, ruffled Liz's hair, and said she was glad she liked her 'trick'.

&gt;She'd nodded. ""And you didn't know your father?""

A voice, low and smooth. A door closing. My mother crying. 

&gt;""Well. That's enough then. I don't believe that you haven't cast.""

It wasn't a matter of belief or disbelief, it was a matter of fact. I've never cast. That channeling that people describe? That moment where your mind calls out, and the universe answers? Power spent? Hadn't happened. 

She continued as though I hadn't spoke.

&gt;""I think that you're a second-mage. Magic so small you haven't even noticed it. That, or you're too embarrassed to say. Let's find out which, shall we?""

My life was hell after that. Once a week, they would find me. Once a week, they would drag me away. Once a week, they would try me, push me, hurt me, until magic should by all rights come forth, by desperation, if nothing else. Once a week, I felt Liz's touch, her magic closing wounds.

Power is a strange concept, don't you think? The people with it look down on those without it, or are viewed as weak, fake. Your status is based on what you can achieve, and how long you take to achieve it. Those on the bottom fantasize, wish they were on the top, think of what they would do if they were. Think of revenge, as their blood spatters across the ground. For most, they can never get it. They die early, expending magic at every turn, striving for something higher. Striving for power. 

People die when they run out of magic. I've never cast. It's been a hundred years, and I've never cast. A long life. Long enough to catch attention. 

Now there was deference. Now there was respect. Now, I still had yet to cast. Eventually, I would have it. I would gain my power. And then, *then* there would be a reckoning. But Liz? She'd already found hers.

[WP] You get a job at a massive graveyard as part of their security personnel. Little did you know that your job would be keeping the dead well... dead.,Dude_idontknow,"""So you're the new guy they hired"", said the old man in the shed while looking over his newspaper. Like all the other people who worked there as part of the security or as gardeners, he had those eyes who had seen too much. Working in a graveyard for so long must take it's toll on the mind, I thought. Hopefully I planned on working as a safety agent in this place for only for a couple of months, just the time to find something else and it was really well paid, the ad in the bottom of the newspaper only required total discretion over the job. Yes it sounded shady, but the city was in charge of this so I wasn't risking much.  

I followed my new co-worker down the stairs in the basement of the cabin. Down there, in the middle of the cemetery, was a small underground facility, with locker rooms, showers and a warehouse. I was given my equipment, not typical security agent stuff, something was off. I was given a suppressed assault rifle with ammunitions, night vision goggles, but also a retractable shovel and rake. A sign said "" *156 Days without incident* ""  

I started fantasizing, maybe there were grave robbers and we were a dissuasive force, or I had definitively been hired to guard some secret government facility hidden in the graveyard... but gardening stuff ? maybe we were supposed to look like gardeners ? Also, I introduced my self and saluted the people that we came across, I wanted to make a good impression, but the only response I was given were those lost eyes.  

""Tonight we'll be covering the old area of the cemetery, it's your first night, it's gonna be..."" he paused to search for words "" I mean it's not the worse, like the kid section... be sure to stick with me, oh and I'm Thomas, you better know what to call me if you need help.""  

Why the hell would I need help, was there really danger ? What is going on... oh wait, I get it, I'm new here and they want to scare me for my first night... A grin appeared on my face, let's play their game for now, nothing to worry about. All anxiety vanished and we headed to our zone, as the sun was setting  between the marble slabs  

The ""old zone"" was the first cemetery of the town, dating back to the 19th century. Most names had been erased by the time, but some old pictures remained. We were on top of a small hill and we could see a large part of the graveyard and even the road that ran around it. It was almost night when I heard the typical sound of a truck stopping, I jumped, even tough I was trying my best to be aware of any pranks they could plan on me. Orders were given, boots walked on the ground, and at least dozen soldiers passed the gates as I watched, baffled.  

""At last, said Thomas, they're always late, oh and never go north, in the military cemetery, you don't wanna to be hit by a stray bullet."" He then reached for his radio. ""Central, Reaper Unit has arrived, light us up...""  

This is just a joke, just a joke to scare you, there is a logical reason for them to be there....I was repeating those sentences like a mantra to calm down.  

 ""Hey ! Are you even listening ?!""  

""AAH ! Wha..what ?"" My hearth was pounding, sweat ran down my neck and my hands were shaking.  

""If I scare you, you're not ready for this. Alright, load your weapons, put on your night visions goggles, see that shiny patch on me ? shoot everything that doesn't have it, only aim for the head, and if doesn't have one, try the spine.""  

With my goggles, I could see the whole place like in daylight, huge projectors on every corner bathed the place in what I guess was infrared light, and dozens upon dozens of shiny patches appeared, somehow I found it reassuring, but my whole body was still in stress.  

Then it started, this sound, this god forsaken sound that would last the whole night, a mixture of agony, earth rumbling and stone grinding... And they emerged, the first I saw was a woman, or what remained of her, discolored robes and skin, patches of hair here and there, empty eye sockets. Yet she looked at me, her rotten face distorted in despair. For a second I try to believe it was some scary costume, but it wasn't. Thomas was silently shooting them, there was no violence in his attitude, only sorrow.  

I shot her, then another, they were not swarming, just rising from their graves, one at a time. All over the place the sound of suppressed fire echoed, like branches snapping on the wind. Soon, ten bodies were on the ground, Thomas seemed more relaxed, with a shake of the head he instructed me to put them back in their graves and to use the shovel and the rake to give them a descent sepulture. He shot three more while watching over me.  

Sometimes I looked down on the graveyard, there, it was different, the corpses were more...\*fresh\*..., they had more energy, more pain, more agressivity. They were not shooting at sacks of bones, it was messy, it was a fight. Some maybe knew the ones they were putting back to sleep, now I understood the pain in their gaze. 

As the night kept going, my mind vanished behind my actions, unable to face the reality. We had patrolled trough our zone, without trouble, and as dawn arrived, we came back to the shed, behind us, teams were cleaning the graveyard of the rotten bodies, gardeners were already replanting flowers next to them, and all of those who worked that night came also back to the shed, silently, like automatons.  

On the way back home I wondered if the new guy who walked in there last night to work had also died this night, and if he would also come back to live.",flamingospacemarine
[WP] A girl has always gotten what she wanted due to her incredible beauty. Men and women alike all go to extreme lengths to ask for her hand... except for one boy with crippling social anxiety.,Jackthespearow,"""Is it any good?""

This caught me by surprise, since I am often so deep in thought while reading that it's easy for me to lose my bearings. Possibly the prettiest girl I had ever seen had sat next to me, but was she talking to me? I didn't want to take the risk of embarrassing myself, so I didnt reply at all even if it meant I could be considered rude. I stopped reading, but didnt want to look at her again so I just kept eyeing the page I had just finished. It was Hesse's Siddhartha, and I was almost done reading it. Some moments passed and I was deep in thought again, forgetting myself.

""Excuse me, is the book any good? It must be since you are so concentrated on it. I love his other works."" This time I was sure the question was aimed at me so I looked at her smiling face for a split second before moving my eyes straight back to the book.

I was slightly embarrassed, but I had thought about what to say in a situation like this. ""If you like books that provoke thought.""

""I simply adore books like that. I see that you are almost done with it, perhaps you would like to borrow it to me after you are done of course. I can give you my number and we can meet up. I assume you live somewhere nearby.""

That really took me off guard. I don't even use my phone that much and was in a general state of panic. ""I really don't like lending things. Sorry."" It's a major pain for me to lend or borrow anything. I just can't stop thinking about it until the items are returned.

She replied almost instantly. ""That's alright. What I meant was that we could meet for coffee and perhaps talk about books and the like. Who are your favorite authors?""

Wow I really don't know what to think about this. I don't really do dates. Or what is considered normal social interaction. ""I'll have to think about it.""

""Think about coffee or your favorite authors? No worries, let me give you my number. I am hopeful that you will feel like calling me after you have thought about it."" She smiled and handed me a small note with her number on it.

""Well this is my stop."" It wasn't my stop. I just had to get out. I don't think I will call her.",dwarven_hermit
"[WP] To solve the problems of overpopulation, all the governments in the world agree to only allow some of their citizens to reproduce—these people are chosen by lottery. After eight or nine generations, an unintended consequence begins to show up: humans have evolved to be unbelievably lucky.",KitchenTable99,"The trouble with the results of the lottery - what has become known as the 'genetic luck' phenomena - is that luck largely relies on the misfortune of others. In order to win at something, others must lose. In order to find something valuable, someone else must have lost something of value. Even finding true love means the absence of love for another. The sad, cruel fact of the world is that luck is an inherently unfair force. 

This has led to a world full of chaos - because if *everyone* is equally immensely lucky, then everyone must also simultaneously be immensely *unlucky*. Good fortune, regardless of how common or valuable, is countered with bad fortune almost without fail. There seems to be no escaping it; like a force of nature that allows us no shelter.

The unified governments have had various schemes to counteract it, having removed all other lotteries, gambling, even simple games of chance - which includes just about every game there is. All efforts have either failed or backfired violently. It seems that if luck, good or bad, is not able to be dispersed through small doses, then it instead violently erupts in unbelievable circumstances. The world has gone mad, with countless miracles and disasters happening almost constantly. 

People have taken to refusing any gesture of good fortune, lest misfortune attempt to equalize it. But luck cannot be rejected or refused. Society has begun to collapse, and we only have our good luck to blame. 

Though it may already be too late, the global unified government has enacted a decidedly simple solution. Instead of the winners being allowed the reproduce, as has been the case for nine generations - now it is only the rare losers who are given the opportunity. With any good luck, after a few generations the effects should be reversed, though no doubt some terrible unforeseen consequences await us regardless. 

For now, we can only wait. It will take many years for the effects to come to fruition, and perhaps the world is already too far gone for it to be saved.

It would be a miracle if we get through this... but miracles are not so rare these days.

It was the days of excess but without the repercussions. What happened was for the best and when it didn't was for the best yet. The Cull was ages ago, so much so that only one true written record of the event itself had remained. Ironic that other similar records had befallen a *unlucky* fate as no one thought in those term anymore. Bad luck went the ways of Santa and stock market crashes as they were fibs and tales told to misbehaving children and doting grandchildren. However, as everyone was always looked after there was little to no need for the negatives in society. Drug barons make profit as their products only reach the high functioning users. A CEO cannot make profit over the backs of the laboring class as they as shareholders were beneficiaries of the profit as well. Deaths came at opportune times and illnesses with a manual. Accidents lead to beneficial introductions and layoffs arrive with a job offer. Those least fortunate shared fortune with the best of them. Life at the worst was full of contentment and the next good hair day was a matter of waking up only. With all that in favor of everyone you would feel a sense of happiness however beneath the surface loomed a discontent borne not of creature comforts or financial dire however something deeper and something not understood by this iteration of humanity. The deep desire for humans to be better than their fellow human beings was being suppressed. There is within all of us a primal calling that drives us to success and the same thing enjoys the despair of others.

"[WP] To solve the problems of overpopulation, all the governments in the world agree to only allow some of their citizens to reproduce—these people are chosen by lottery. After eight or nine generations, an unintended consequence begins to show up: humans have evolved to be unbelievably lucky.",KitchenTable99,"Dr Ming Yun slid the paper across the table, and watched the teenager opposite him squirm in his seat. “There’s no need to be nervous,” said the doctor. “Your results are in, and as I told you, you’re fine. Perfectly healthy.”

Fan Pan was silent for a moment as he studied the slip. “You’re sure? One hundred percent sure?”

“As sure as we can be. The technology is still in its infancy, and it will be some years before we perfect the methodology, but there’s enough here for me to know that you’re completely normal. That is, you’re just about as lucky as the rest of us. You’re nowhere near being a Jinx.”

Fan Pan’s reply came in the form of pulling out a set of dice from his pockets. He rolled them on the table – all sixes. He rolled them again. And again. And again.

“See?” said the doctor. “Nothing to worry about.”

“No, this cannot be. I am very sure something is wrong… I just can’t explain it.”

“Try me.”

Fan Pan sighed, and the dice disappeared into his pockets. “Promise you won’t laugh? Fine. See… there’s this girl in my class. I’m… interested in her. The thing is, I just can’t seem to-”

“Hang on, hang on,” said the doctor. “You should have been taught this in school. We’re all lucky, incredibly, unbelievably lucky compared to our forefathers. But that doesn’t mean that everything will come up roses for us in life. You don’t get to have your way in everything, that’s not how it works when there are so many people with conflicting desires in society. If she is not returning your affections, then that is completely normal.”

“It’s not like that!” insisted Fan Pan. “It’s not about her rejecting me, OK? See, I’ve asked her out at least five times. Yet, without fail, every date ends up a flaming ball of disaster! Once, a thunderstorm broke overhead just as we laid out the picnic mat, even though the weather report said there would not be rain for months! Another time, we missed the movie because we had dropped our tickets enroute to the theater! I’ve never had such bad luck except for when I’m trying to go out with her!”

“That is… unusual,” Dr Ming Yun said, “but it still doesn’t mean anything in the grand scheme of things. I’m no therapist, but then you should also consider that luck works in strange ways, yes? I mean, you may want to date this girl, but if your luck, and her luck too, I should add, is preventing both of you from actually meeting up… then maybe you should take this as a sign that things aren’t meant to be? Maybe you’re dodging a bullet and you don’t even know it.”

“And that’s the problem!” yelled Fan Pan, whose fist came crashing down on the table. “We are lucky, we know that now. But what does it all mean? Is luck the servant or the master? If I wanted to date her, shouldn’t my luck be *helping* me fulfil my wishes? And if luck actually works *despite* my wishes, does it mean that luck knows something that I don’t? Does luck know, perhaps, that we wouldn’t work out down the road, and therefore it is trying to save me the heartache now by preventing a relationship from even starting?”

“The truth is,” the doctor said, “we don’t know enough. We don’t know if luck is working for us individually, or whether there’s a collective luck which is acting for the good of the entire species.”

“That’s my point,” said Fan Pan. “It hardly reassures me that the test says I am as lucky as anybody else. It doesn’t answer any of the other questions I have. How much of our life is the consequence of our actions, and how much is it merely the consequence of some unseen hand nudging us through the garden of life? Are we still steering our own ship, or are we merely passengers?”

Dr Ming Yun replied by scribbling away on a prescription pad. “I’m afraid I don’t have any of those answers, young man. The best I can do for you is to offer you some natural sedatives. Calm yourself down, take a few days off school if you need to, then return recharged. Contribute to society as best you can, and trust that the rest of your life will sort itself out.”

Fan Pan held the scrip in his hand, then folded it and pushed it back towards the doctor. “Thank you, doctor, for hearing me out. I think though that I would rather have as clear a mind as I can muster now. It’s… just a gut feeling that I’ll need all my faculties about me. I’ll take your advice though – I’ll take things easy, and I won’t dwell on the girl anymore.”

“That’s good, that’s good. A sign of maturity is the ability to move on and to-”

“But that doesn’t mean my story ends here,” interjected Fan Pan. “I feel like I need to consider this whole issue more. Something about the way that luck is operating in our society unsettles me. It’s not right that we’re beholden to something as incomprehensible as luck and yet we make no attempt to understand it. Thank you for your time.”

And Fan Pan was gone.

In the quiet which permeated the consulting room later, punctuated only by the soft hissing of the air-conditioning, Dr Ming Yun mulled over the improbable series of events which led the teenager to his clinic. After all, there were over a million teenagers in the city, and yet Fan Pan was the only one who was openly questioning the very nature of luck.

After all, there were over a thousand clinics in the district, and yet Fan Pan had ended up walking into this very establishment to seek help.

And after all, there were over a hundred doctors as skilled as Dr Ming Yun, but as far as he was aware, Dr Ming Yun was the only one in the entire city with complete security access clearance.

What an improbable sequence of events which led the troubled Fan Pan right to Dr Ming Yun's doorstep! What an incredible stroke of luck!

He unlocked the bottom desk drawer, slid out an unmarked cellphone, then powered it on. He keyed in a twenty-character password, then authenticated his identity through a voice and iris check. Finally, he placed a call, then held the cellphone to his ear.

“Director? Yes, this is him. I would like to report an early sighting of a possible Jinx. Yes, he is questioning the foundational principles of luck, and I think it is likely that left unchecked, he will have a deleterious effect on the stability of society. Please advise as to next course of action.”

After eight or nine generations, an unintended consequence begins to show up: humans have evolved to be unbelievably lucky.",KitchenTable99,"It was the year 2100 and humans had finally resigned to the fact that the earth can no longer support human life in such massive numbers. To solve the issue massive curtailment of reproductive rights was necessary. The only question that remained, who gets to decide? The plethora of moral and biological issues that arose from any sort of artificial selection compelled that the fate of humankind be left to random chance. A random number generator was created by the most brilliant computer scientists and mathematicians to ensure that the selection would be as random as physically possible. 

As is human nature, there were many skeptics during the initial phase of this grand experiment. Some wondered if the machine had been rigged in some fashion to favor a particular group of people, others questioned the soundness of it's design, and then there were those who wondered if true randomness is even possible at all. 

Multiple generations passed and none could find any flaws in the machine or the system on which it was devised. Trust in the machine grew as one by one every single alarmist prediction failed to realize. In fact, the human race had only prospered ever since the machine had been adopted. Space exploration and asteroid mining had been a massive success so much that our most scarce and precious resources weren't as scarce or precious anymore. Humanity found itself being increasingly luckier in its prospects with every successive generation so much so that the need for population control no longer existed. However, the people had not failed to notice the rising fortunes of our race ever since the adoption of the machine. A grand convention was formed and it was decided that the machine would continue to be used to bestow fertility by majority consensus. We had faith in the machine, the machine knew best.

Humanity rose and spread out to conquer the stars and still there continued to be a small, silent minority which questioned the amount of trust that we had placed in this machine. Dr. Dior was an astrophysicist who belonged to this camp. He did not believe that true randomness existed in our universe and was also skeptical of the good fortune that the adoption of the machine had brought to our species. However, by now, questioning the machine was all but forbidden as it was largely considered a waste of time and any expedition for such a cause was unlikely to receive funding. However, Dr. Dior had circumvented this obstacle by concealing the true purpose of his exploration and had finally secured the funding he required to study a miniature cold spot in the cosmic microwave background radiation. He hoped to find a pattern in the supposed randomness of our physical universe and his research indicated that studying the properties of this spot was his best bet at finding the answers he was looking for.",2odditus

By ""negatives"", do you mean negative words like ""unlucky""? Or negative people? Since drug barons would be considered negative people in modern society, probably. Also, high functioning = very lucky??

&gt;illnesses with a manual

&gt;Deaths came at opportune times and illnesses with a manual. Accidents lead to beneficial introductions and layoffs arrive with a job offer.

You're jumping between present and past tense.

&gt;a matter of waking up only

Awkward placement of ""only"".

You mean material comforts and dire financial circumstances?

"[WP] To solve the problems of overpopulation, all the governments in the world agree to only allow some of their citizens to reproduce—these people are chosen by lottery. After eight or nine generations, an unintended consequence begins to show up: humans have evolved to be unbelievably lucky.",KitchenTable99,"It's been about 200 years since the Lotteries picked up.  The first couple of generations were understandably resistant and the draconian measures taken to enforce the Lotteries were...harsh.  Usually the severity of punishment doesn't really have much bearing on whether the punishment will affect future breaches, but there are times when I think people lack imagination.  There are ways, and there are ways to make people regret their transgressions, and some of those ways really make an impression on the witnesses.  When the government controls your education, your employment, even your reproduction, their scope for retribution against malefactors can be pretty broad.

How the dissolution of human society happened at first was not much.  People were still starving.  People were still standing toe to toe.  Cities were big and getting bigger, farms were enormous and growing to encompass entire counties as agricorps swelled to ever larger proportions to exercise economies of scale that kept food growing while keeping it affordable.  Same as last year, last decade, last century.  So to try to reel in the seemingly unstoppable expansion of human population, a worldwide Reproduction Lottery was adopted - yes, I use that word with my tongue firmly in cheek - and enforced, like I said, harshly.  In general you have about a ten percent chance of winning the right to have a child.  Not in any one year, *ever*.  And of course, you can't have a kid by yourself.  You have to find someone else of the opposite sex to have a baby with you, and it helps if they're compatible with you, and you can see how this could really pare down the birth rate.  And it did.  But the population wasn't really going down very fast.

Thousands of years of medical science will do that.  Humans live pretty long lives anymore.  With sufficient food, shelter and access to necessary care, you can just putter along, getting older and older but never really dying.

Then after about four generations of Lotteries - call it a hundred years, that's close enough - we started to see some changes.

The population started to really fall off.  Not the little half percentage or so you'd expect in a year, but one-and-a-half, then two, then suddenly three percent.  Three whole percent of the entire human population died in one year!  In one hundred years of Lotteries, the human population had stopped growing, but it wasn't until just a hundred years ago that the trend had really started to move in the other direction, and suddenly it wasn't just a trend.

Three percent of thirteen billion people is nearly 400 million.  Four hundred million people dying of various causes - mostly old age but not exclusively - is about eight times what it was in, for instance, the year 2000.

Some things got cheaper.  Food got a lot cheaper for a while, but then the agricorps started to lose cohesion.  Three percent is a lot in one year and you kind of expect it to be an outlier, so you absorb the losses and keep on going with your usual production except there's another year, and another, and another with the global population shrinking to the tune of an entire large country's worth of people not being there anymore and when you're a global agricorp, there *are no other markets to expand to*.   The entire planet is your customer.

So the agricorps start digging into each other's market shares.  Things get heated and pretty soon it isn't just corporate espionage we're reading about on the newsfeeds, it's corporate incursions, corporate assassinations and even outright corporate warfare, a strange, mostly bloodless war that doesn't assault humans but the fleets of rolling stock that sow and tend and harvest the world's food.  The biggest corporations have all the money and are de facto governments, controlling the flow of the most basic staples that feed entire continents.

And in the face of these conflicts, the Lotteries continue.  Fewer and fewer babies are born, people continue to age and die at the rate they always did.

Healthcare was, if not a growing field, then a field whose share of the job assignment market was growing.  There weren't as many healthcare job assignments needing filled as there used to be, but there were substantially less of other roles.  The proportion of the population that is too old to care for itself was growing fast, even as the oldsters were dying off by the millions.  So more and more of us got slotted into the role of taking care of our burgeoning elder population.

When the last global agricorp had won its decades-long war against its remaining competitor, it filed bankruptcy and dissolved less than five years later.  Faced with monopolistic control of the entire market, the last agricorp decided it could charge whatever it wanted, learned the hard way that it couldn't, and was violently dissolved by enraged governments.  But before they fell, the company's leaders destroyed the factory that built new harvesters and completely scrambled the control network for the existing ones.

So now we skip ahead another few years and here's where we find ourselves.  There's about fifty, sixty senior citizens unable to provide for themselves for every able bodied adult currently walking around on this planet.  A lot of manufacturing is automated, thankfully, so medicines and geriatric care equipment isn't dependent on there being enough of us youngsters to crank out walkers, wheelchairs and Lisinopril.  You can live a long, long time and that's your right as a citizen.

You're also guaranteed your right to food.  That's where I come in.

This is the other sector of the assignment market that's gaining share.  As the world still has to eat, and there aren't enormous robotic armies of tractors to produce the food, there have to be enormous human armies of workers to tend the fields.  There aren't many kids being born though because even now the Lotteries are still in effect, so there aren't many new, young backs coming on to help share the load.

I'm a pretty smart guy and I could build a tractor, given the time and equipment.  It doesn't even need to be good equipment.  It wouldn't be a good tractor that resulted but it would be sufficient to replace me and probably about twenty other workers. But the Assignment Bureau doesn't have a job labeled Tractor Builder or Factory Builder and frankly they're so swamped with everything else I'm not sure they could spare the time to create the occupation.  Because the need for food never really goes down, you see.  People age at the rate they always have, but new workers to replace them aren't appearing at anything like the same rate.

These are the things I think about in the endless days of hot sun, dragging plows, swinging hoes, toting baskets, pulling carts.  A radical shift in the balance of birth and death has skewed everything else.  As people get older and leave their old jobs, their burden on the means of production that keep them alive continues, but there aren't enough workers to take up those tasks.  And now we, the workers, suffer the real hell that is 100% employment.  We go where we're sent, and can't question the sending.

And it will only get worse.  As long as the Lotteries continue to skew the birth-death ratio, the weight of the preceding generations will continue to pile ever more heavily on increasingly smaller subsequent generations, eating and eating.

This is the future that stretches out before me.  This is the future that stretches out before the unborn baby represented by the slip of paper in my pocket.  The Lottery announcement that congratulates me for being selected completely at random to produce a new person to slot into my old job, to prop me up, me and a dozen of my fellow former producers.

The fellow in the row next to me pauses to lean on his hoe.

""You ever wonder if you're lucky to have been the product of a Lottery birth?""

""No. I know.""

""Pretty cool, huh?""

""Sure.""

I take the Lottery ticket out of my pocket and look at it.

""Hey, is that what I think it is?""

""Yeah.""

""Congrats, man, that's great.""

""Sure.""

He goes back to hoeing.  When he can't see me, I drop the slip of paper into the soil, till it under, and keep working.

Congratulations, kid.  Your luck just changed for the better.",theonetrueelhigh

Apologies for dragging on. I am just trying to transcribe the many conflicting opinions on the new phenomenon were present.

They were all wrong. Something much more sinister and primarily evil was at work here.

After a single generation, the only individuals in the younger generation were all those descended from the Ancestors. Thousands of years ago, men and women possessed keen foresight. Prophetic dreams and guiding hallucinations guided many of our heroes and saints on 'the right path', whatever that was. Many of these predate writing, and are not known to us. However some are well known. Caesar. Jesus. Confucius. However uncanny, or however indecipherable, many of these great men and women unknowingly guided our civilization to where it needed to be.

How do I know all this? Isn't it obvious? Well, maybe it's obvious to be because I've been inside the Great Pyramid of Giza. I know what you're thinking. I'm about to start shouting about aliens. Maybe... The thoughts and motives of the Ancestors are not known to us. Neither are themselves. Maybe a guiding hand reaches out to us from the Heavens, or even a guiding tentacle from the stars. It is not clear that we will ever know, and this is not what is important now. What is important are the consequences all of this is having in our modern time.

I don't think the Ancestors predicted this. A lucky soul here and there, served their purposes in the moment. Those lines, those families continued on, the gene, perhaps, recessive, until needed again. Well now everyone is a lucky soul. Every human seems to be on 'the right path'. All different paths. And this will tear us apart, as we all march in different directions, backs to each other. No one man provides the rallying cry for the next age of enlightenment. They all do.

And we're on the brink of war.

One ideology here, another religion over there. All of these groups know in their heart of hearts that their path is the 'right path', and as such the only right act is to squash the other groups.

The problem won't end there. When one group remains, they will fracture, as each individual has their own interpretation of their 'right path'. This will continue until the last two men stand on a mountain of skulls and fight to the death.

Birth rates plummeted. Within two generations, education and healthcare were available to all at the highest level of quality. Three generations, and wars were no longer declared. Countries simply couldn't spare the population. Five generations, and poverty was made a thing of the past. Again, countries couldn't afford to not ensure every citizen was taken care of adequately. The cost was undeniably high, but the results were fantastic. 

That humans were becoming genetically lucky wasn't noticed at first. Each generation became luckier, but they were all equally lucky, and so there was no real difference than if they were all equally unlucky. Generations of good fortune could easily be attributed to clever planning and diligent execution.  

It wasn't until humanity stepped into the galactic stage that we realized what had happened. And even then, it took a while to figure out exactly. At first, it was chalked up to human intelligence, but scientific collaborations with other species quickly revealed that humans didn't have the answers, they simply guessed. They guessed, and were right every time, and didn't see any problem with that. 

It was put forth that humans as a species had an incredible inate intuition, which wasn't far off from the truth. When further test were done, though, and humans excelled at everything from guessing cards to rolling dice, finally the galactic community settled on the full truth. Humanity was lucky. 

The news spread across the stars like wildfire. Humans were banned from every casino and gambling establishment as an entire species. On the other hand, many employers in medical, military, engineering, and other communities, offered massive enticements to humans, hoping to utilize that natural luck. There was discussion about banning humans from galactic politics, but in the end it was decided that such action would cause more problems than it would solve.

It was the War of Two Galaxies, however, when humanity really got to stand in the limelight. The veil between realities was breached by a neighbouring dimension, and it was quickly discovered that they were aggressive and deadly. Caught completely off-guard, our galaxy scrambled to mount a defense, while our for was entirely prepared for the conflict. 

Humanity's military had a significant portion of their forces running training exercises only a few light years from where the breach was created. They engaged the enemy, and while their numbers weren't nearly enough to defeat them, they managed to hold the invaders at bay until reinforcements from across the galaxy were able to arrive and secure defensive positions, creating the largest front in military history. 

During the conflict, to no one's surprise, human squads achieved the quickest and most decisive results. It was also found that squads that were merely led by humans performed at an almost 80% completion rate of a full human squad, which was still head and shoulders above the performance of a squad with no humans at all. 

Politically, there were several issues with putting humans in commanding positions in the military of other species, despite the successful operations and lives saved. A galactic emergency war act, the first and only of its kind, joined all the seperste militaries into a single forces, the Galactic Defense Initiative, under joint command of the leaders of all included species. If for some reason the joint command couldn't come to an agreement on what action to take, humanity got the final say. And with the integration of the military forces, many humans were given field promotions to be in charge of varies sectors of the GDI.

Within a short time of the creation of the GDI, the invaders were forced back through the breach they had come through. The breach, rather than being sealed, was stabilized, and became the Rift we know today. Shocked and terrified at the swift success of the GDI, the invaders, who we now know as the Lrasions, offered a surrender before our forces could enter their reality and continue their campaign on the offensive. The conditions of the surrender proposed by the Lrasions included, among other things, massive monetary reparations via rare metals, the execution of all commanding military officers, and millions of their citizens serving as slaves to our peoples. 

Our galaxy's governments, looking to foster peace and cooperation rather than resentment and rebellion, altered the conditions of the surrender significantly. A one time, minimal reparation payment; no executions; and no slaves. They also paved the way for future trade agreements, migration treaties, and sharing of technology. Although a rocky road, they have been mostly successful in their attempts to create lasting peace.

By the end of the war, the GDI had mostly humans in positions of command at every level. While there was, and still is to some extent, some resentment about this, the majority of the galaxy has accepted humanity as their defenders. Humanity, for it's part, has done its best to be inclusive and promote all species equally, but most troops from other species feel safer serving under humans than commanding them. 

This is history is often thought to be where we get the saying, ""If you can't get a human to do it, you're out of luck.""",Allos_Trent

That my friends, is a number every child born today, and from this point on, will know very well. As they should, for it is a constant that all hold dear and for a very good reason. At no point should the human population ever stretch or reach past that number. 

They teach us in primary school that a new age of thinking and progress had been struck with the revelation of the first ever quantum computer, the Unum. Not a work of theory, but an actual living, breathing, most importantly functioning quantum computer. It’s not actually living and breathing but you get my point.

For decades it was nothing more than a hypothetical question in the back of every scientist’s mind but the day that Proficere revealed the Unum, the world changed. Without getting into the mumbo-jumbo of how an independent group of scientist and engineers created a company out of thin air the same day the most important piece of technology had ever been announced, it was clear that the Unum was to take the front seat on all matters. Almost every theory in existence could be tested, to a degree, and in our case, the biggest, or I believe the most important to this story is the one on human survival. 

Will humans survive the great filter or fall short? Believe me when I say that no one liked an answer as conclusive as the one the Unum spit out… No. Fortunately, bigger brains than my own decided to ask the next best question, “How can we change that to a yes?”

The Unum expressed a 10-digit number that would forever alter human existence. Now I’m not going to say that every government and nation magically came together and became friends after this. Oh no… it was not a pretty couple of decades after that. I feel incredibility lucky to not have been around at that time. War, upheaval, decimation, and so on. In the end, though, it was Proficere that came out on top. It seems that the Unum had been functioning for a few years before its announcement which gave them plenty of time to plan out accordingly.

From that point on, we as a species became one, instead of several. All knowledge that could be known, was available and the world was at peace, for the most part. Humans were strategically placed and dispersed across the globe.  The population, which was several factors higher than it is now, was brought down the natural way. No mass executions or culling’s that some nutjobs want you to believe. People die and the Proficere let it happen. 

The greatest stroke to occur was the release of the nanites, or Nans for short. In the years leading up to the announcement of the Unum, the Nans were secretly developed and distributed across the globe. Several groups see them as the single greatest betrayal to our species to be created, as they are controlled by the Unum and monitor every human being’s body. The big kicker is they can render every human being sterile. 

The Unum was given control of the worlds human population and “randomly” selects which couples can reproduce. The Nans are transmitted during conception and the process continues. I emphasize the word “random” because, for all extensive purposes, no one can discern any conceivable pattern to it. At least only the Unum.

Race, religion, nationality, sexual orientation, sanity, disabilities, no one can see a pattern. The only real one is a slightly larger number of women than men in the world for reproductive reasoning.

When I say you are randomly chosen to have children, I mean randomly. You can go your entire life having as many partners as you want never worrying in the slightest whether you will have a child, and then just magically one day out of the blue, you have conceived a child.

It doesn’t even have to be with your regular partner, it just happens, randomly. Decide to take a night off and get a little flirtatious with the person across the bar and wake up the next morning realizing that you got adult things ahead of you. 

This has bothered an immeasurable amount of people, for multiple reasons. The questions have always arisen, “why not the strongest of us?” “Why let the sick and disabled continue on?” 

So many have wondered that if us as a species is to survive and continue, why are we not guaranteeing the best of us continue. The biggest kick in the nards to this entire issue is, why when asked again and again to the Unum, will humanity survive the great filter?  Its answer is still… no?

As I need to state, I’m no genius, I’m one of those people that would be less favored to reproduce. However, after the Unum has had us implement so many strategies, I must ask, why is the answer still no? What is the burning characteristic that it is trying to breed into all of us?

Let’s go way back to where we first came from. Not caveman stuff, but I’m talking single cells evolving into multiple celled organisms and so on. I think that if you look back at where humans first came from, you must wonder, how in the hell did we ever make it to this point? 

We as a species have done so many excruciatingly dumb things in our existence and yet here we are. So how did we make it from boiling pool of muck with just the right chemicals and other factors to here? 

I think the answer is dumb luck. So, I must ask, is the Unum really selecting by pure lottery? Is it “random”? If dumb luck has gotten us this far, is the Unum trying to breed us for a factor that most believe doesn’t even exist? 

Well, after filling out all the required paperwork, waiting for a few months, filling out more paperwork. I finally get to ask the Unum, “Is the only way we are going to get through the great filter, is by being as lucky as we possibly can?”",AndNowImYours

It didn't take into account the couples that were already together. Nope. When it started, it started with the generation just turning 18. Everyone over that age were not allowed to reproduce. Massive roll outs of drugs to castrate the older population followed. Some people avoided it for a while, a lot of people became pregnant, which the government allowed to a point, but to be able to function in society, they had to be unable to have children. The children born after a certain cut off date would never be allowed to have children of their own. To the people in their 20s and early 30s who had waited to have children, it was unfair, but mass protests, civil unrest, nothing stopped the policy going through. The arm had been called in, lethal force was used across the world to shut down anyone calling the government out. People stopped protesting. They got in line and allowed themselves to be castrated quietly. What was more unfair though was how the lottery actually worked. People with physical disabilities were immediately cut from it, as were those with chronic conditions like asthma and people who had developed cancer or tumors in their formative years. Very quietly, children who came from low income homes and were performing badly in school were also cut. This wasn't noticed for years though. Some of the very best minds in the world were also allowed to skip the lottery, but those people were never told. They just waited, like the rest of us, not knowing they'd already been chosen. The lottery was performed in the September after the children had turned 18. For some reason every country had adopted this after the UK suggested it. Everyone was part of an app. Those who were eligible to have children were to head to a clinic for a reversal of their castration. If they missed their scheduled time slot and didn't rebook, they would lose their chance and another individual would be chosen. 

Dating became a little crazy after that. There were apps out there that allowed people to only date those who were eligible to have children like themselves. There were all kinds of crazy apps out there, some for fertile women looking for safe sex with a castrated male, males looking for castrated females. These apps are now worth billions. 

It was now that my generation, all turned 18 after last September, were waiting by their phones, waiting for the app to update to tell us if we were going to be able to have children when we were older or even now if we felt like it. Why don't we adopt? That is a good question. Children are worth a lot of money, giving up a child is very lucrative and I knew a lot of people who were having multiple children to fund their lifestyle. Having a child, even an awful child, was seen as a high status symbol at this point. It was the luck of the draw though. I watched and waited as the timer counted down. Five minutes. Four minutes. My stomach squirmed as it counted down to three minutes. Two minutes, my heart began pounding in my chest. One minute, my hands were shaking so badly that I could barely hold onto my phone anymore. I placed it down and watched as the timer counted down to zero. The screen refreshed and glowed green with a massive tick in the middle. I had been chosen. I was one of the lucky ones! After all the bad luck I'd had growing up, after having to deal with massive bullying, not having a dad, my mums crazy behaviour, I'd beaten the odds and my date was set. Tomorrow. Being a small town there weren't very many of us. Once it was done, I would be heading off to whatever uni had just accepted me. I was down to go to three, but they used our lottery results to determine if we got in or not. 

I quickly updated my results onto the uni selection page and waited. I was accepted into my first choice. I was due to start on October 1st. Accommodation was already set up, everything was ready. My life was about to begin today. I was all set. I was one of the lucky ones, one of the humans chosen by luck to succeed in whatever I wanted. Everyone had told me I was unlucky growing up. That I wasn't born right, unlike them who were going to be chosen. Their lives had been good up to now, but maybe this was how luck worked. I had to go through all the crap to get what I needed when I was older. I'd never seen an unlucky couple who had a child. Even those who had bought one had been lucky. 

I checked my social media. The little green tick was next to my name now. I did what ever single person my age was doing now, checking out their friends list to see who made it and who hadn't. I wasn't surprised to see the kids who had treated me badly hadn't managed to get a green tick. The smart ones, they would still be able to live good lives though, they might get lucky and still have a child somehow. The others, they could still be happy, but a lot wouldn't be. The system had saved our world, but at the same time had ruined the old society. The class system was completely warped now and while I was happy, at the same time my stomach turned at the thought of what the world would be like if everyone was equal again. A better world, maybe, a worse one, more then likely. ",Zanki

*Father, I am infertile.* Today Karim is offering a ride to school for me, sister is taking the car as always. I don't like Karim. The only discourse he provides is of the ever-changing turtle population and its impact on the environment. He says that after the recent Ice Age which brought global climate temperatures down a drastic four degrees, the turtle population has taken a complete turn around to males being the only produced. He says this everytime, no matter the occasion, whether that is trying to get a companion after the lottery or during our studies. I don't really understand the importance of turtles on the environment anyway, I've taken almost 15 years of biology to understand this, bees haven't been around for almost a century and we're worried about losing another species. I say that humans are the most important species, no other comes to compare. He retorts with mathematical equations and statistics only a person in that would've taken calculus in fifth grade would know. Karim is going to become a marine biologist he says after tomorrow, ""I have already secured my position at the university as a professor."" Grades never came good to me, I still got through school though, or at least I'm hoping, you see, because all of the previous generations stopped worrying about their grades after they hear from their colleges they applied to, so they moved it to the day of graduation. In front of everyone, they say out loud where you are to be graduating to. Me. I'm going to Albuquerque Community College of Human Sciences, I told my parents I was going Texas Tech to make them feel a lot better about me. My parents aren't the most a la mode people in town either, that's how i get away with everything. *Father was on the left, mother was on the right, me, I was right dead center, the center of attention as well. Ms. Derine pulls her glasses closer to her eyes as she unraveled a stack of papers, the idea that I was to go to school with a principle so primitive struck me, my parents let sister go to Albuquerque Charter School, they have virtual reality Minecraft gameplay. Ms. Derine took a deep dusty breath and covered her mouth with a clean white velvet garment she had in her pocket, or maybe a draw in her desk, all I could see was the deep glare she gave me still stabbing my doll. It had red hair, freckles, and decent sized bust now come to think about it, I always said ""I love you, do you love me?"" I tore out the batteries; father reached for my hand took the doll and threw it in the trash receptacle beside her desk which awoke Ms. Derine. She asked if I had already determined my major. I said yes. She said something about the code of conduct etcetera; I was playing with the batteries from the doll. I said human sciences. Human sciences. It was a poster on the wall about proper digestion.* Karim was here. I got my satchel and got my shoes on. Sister passed me as I was there putting my shoes on, she kissed me. *The lobotomy was a success; sisters affection was finally established again, it took her almost five more years to finally be rehabilitated to her final condition. I liked old sister, she had more human in her.* I looked up and smiled as she passed and looked back waving at me, slightly bent over like i was short. I said farewells to Mother and Father, they said farewells back. Karim was playing classical music as I got in, I didn't care for classical music, but it still at least gave sound the car as he drove on to school. I only listened to the music, and made slight agreements to his conversation to make him feel like he wasn't just being used for a ride to school. School sucks, tomorrow is graduation, and everyone gets to laugh at me because I'm going to Albuquerque Community College of Human Sciences. Nothing really happens in school, not anymore. Our placement tests have been finalized, and courses have been completed, just practice for graduation. Graduation wasn't my biggest problem, it was the lottery. *Father, I am infertile.* It was the slugging along all day, with slight communications to my friends that I perceived to enjoy, now recounting. It wasn't graduation, is was the lottery. Statistics show that I have an eighty-five percent chance to win, I don't want to win. I want to lose, I want to lose, I want to live alone, where my trembles can be kept to myself, where I can move to the mountains where no one will ever bother me, I want to go to Indian Creek, where no one lives because the effect of the turtle population has done absolutely nothing to its environment, I want to live off the land, I want to lose. *Father, I am infertile.* He will believe it. He has to. He has for evening else in my entire life. I want to say no, thank god the government enforces that, the school wouldn't. It's mandatory to take it; I don't want to. Sister has always tried to change my mind, she needs an exorcism, she needs changed. She has children, and a husband, and she's happy, but she is forced to be happy, it's her *lobotomy.* I've tried when all is hopeless, I have had sex, multiple times, with Alice twice, Meghan, and even Karim. There is no hope for me, I don't want it, I want nothing. Is that all I can ask. No. I want to be the same, I want to be like everyone else. I want to be a human scientist at the Albuquerque Community College of Human Sciences, where I can grow to be an affectionate man to have pleasurable sex with my partner, to be like everyone else. I don't want to be different, why god do I have to be different, why god. Why is it me, why can't some miracle occur, I know you're out there, I know you control the dark matter, you are what makes this world go round. so why do you not help me? fulfill my duties as a human, I want to reproduce, I want to win the lottery, I want my eighty-five percent chance to win, to happen, so why am i like this. What demon has been installed on my figure that creates this terrible exercise of black death inside me? Why must I be different? Why must I be sent to Indonesia to live as a laborer because I am different. *Sister finally came to the decision, and when it was made Jhon was more than excited to see Jason there crying in his arms. She had only turned twenty-three and yet she had won the lottery, as expected, married, and adopted. I wanted to kill it. Sister should've moved out five years ago when she was to go to college, now I must put up with its crying. The moment Jason was in the door everyone was there to appreciate sisters decision.* It was her lobotomy. *I was playing Smash when it happened, I didn't like the game anyway, but it took my attention away from the game. I had died. I screamed as loud as I can, it was impressive, and I am still impressed to this day, was it appropriate? Yes. Everyone finally shut up, Mother, Father, Jason. I could finally play my game. Mother sent me to my room, where she beat me. It wasn't unusual, in fact I enjoyed the pain and silence, it was only the cracking that had noise, there I could think about how I should have run over to Jason to hurt it, killing it then, and then maybe I wouldn't have to go to Albuquerque Community College of Human Sciences. Mother cracked me for the next hour, Father peering in from the living room every once in a while, sister cried,* it was her lobotomy. *Mother did this with pride, father was too much of a wimp to do it himself.* At least I'd be away from everyone else, where I can be with people like me, castaways, used to get the minerals needed for the scratch-off cards. *unfinished*  
I feel I'd write an entire book on this so I'm going to stop, it's probably too edgy it's was good while it lasted, hopefully, you enjoy my first post.",Maxmilliano_Rivera

Grab your fill of homo-sapien bones to further our medical research! Cash reward based off combined weight of bones.*

Of course, to the Fyalikar Guild, ""medical research"" wasn't the important part. It was all about the cash.

""So they're just letting everyone go and cut down as many humans as they please? Regardless of living status?"" Jotun asked while equipping his warhammer.

""Indeed. And by Thoramir's name, we're joining the fray. There's over 17 billion living and un-living humans on Earth as we speak. It's an energy mine!"" Ingrid had to wipe her mouth clean of saliva. The thought of butchering so many biological things was making her bloodlust grow and her stomach growl.

Freki paced back and forth in anticipation. The wulfus was outfitted with tesla-armor. His tail was wagging tirelessly, as he patiently for his masters to finish preparing. 

Grocklar fastened his helmet and motioned he was ready. He cannot speak, so he spent some time devising a system of communication between him and his peers.

Several other members of the Fyalikar Guild step into the loading bay. Most notably, Odyynason. Founder and leader of the Fyalikar Guild, he has led many charges into battle... and rose to become the wealthiest Guild Master in the sector.

""Keep your eyes open, your weapons in hand, and your asses covered. We're going into extremely competitive territory. Countless other Guilds and bounty hunters will already be there. We must ensure that we harvest as many bones as we can handle. To do that, kill anything that is pink-skinned and walks on two legs. As soon as we're full, we're leaving. In-and-out.""

""Wait!"" Ingrid shouted.

Oddynason rolled his four eyes, ""Yes, they are small enough for you to swallow whole.""

A wicked, tooth-filled smile crept over Ingrid's face. 

The Guild Loaded onto the ship and prepared to disembark. 

Draugr was shuffling around his bag to be sure he had his ""essentials"".

""Forget something?"" Jotun smiled.

""Nothing yet,"" Draugr replied in a terribly raspy voice. He gave himself a reassured grunt after he found that everything was he required was in his bag.

Ingrid's eyes were lit with the thought of the coming feast, and she started to salivate so much that a puddle formed where she sat.

Sigrun stared blankly at her weapon, her glowing-blue eyes shining behind her helmet. 

A short but rather turbulence-heavy drive later, the band of Guildmates arrived at their hunting ground. 

""Look at all those ships,"" Odynnason examined the rival ships. Zyronns, Yth'shoggoth, Voltayramir (and many more) all contesting each other to bring home the largest haul of currency they could possess.

The S.O.S. alarm began to blare. An unknown, smaller spacecraft was attempting to board the ship. The guild hoofed it down to the holding bay, where an elongated metal craft lay in wait. Several things covered in white exited the vessel. They stared with their singular black eye at the Fyalikar. 

""State your business, or be slaughtered where you stand!"" Odynnason commanded.

Jotun growled along with several other Guildmates.

The white creatures removed their black eyes to reveal... *humans*. 

Ingrid's eyes dampened from a soft blue to a hellish red. Any sentience she had was lost at that moment and primal voraciousness overtook her sanity. Grocklar seized her before she could charge at her prey. Ingrid thrashed and snarled at her captor.

Odynnason grinned a terrible grin.

One of the humans spoke.

""W-we come from Earth. We saw your ship a-and was hoping you could help us-""

""YOU CAN HELP *US* BY DIVING DOWN MY THROAT!"" Ingrid continued to behave like a rabid monster.

The exposed human began to sweat. He swallowed and attempted to not let fear overtake him.

""Please help us. We need to escape this planet.""

The Fyalikar began to laugh, maniacally. The humans stepped back. 

""The only place you're going is the Dyra Research Center,"" Odynnason said with a vile tone. 

He motioned to Grocklar to let go of Ingrid.

The news said one city was almost raided by Godzilla, only that the poor thing got hit in the head by a meteor. Sometime there was some alien ships incoming to ""harvest our eyeballs for their mating ritual"" but they only found zombies.

"[WP] When you die, your life flashes before your eyes. But it happens in real time and includes the flash before you die, so it is infinitely nested and you never experience death. You realize this and conspire to break free",ThaUrbanTurban," 

I’ve always been scared of death. The idea that one day, I would simply cease to exist, that everything I ever was would simply fade away into nothingness terrified me to my core. So, I did everything that I could to avoid it. I never left my house once the sun set. I never took any drugs, including alcohol or tobacco. I never traveled outside my city or tried to learn how to drive. I thought that all these precautions would surely be able to keep death at bay for a long time. But no one can really predict how their life ends. One Sunday morning, I was simply working on my novel in a coffee shop when I heard the sound of tires screeching and loud screaming outside. I looked up from my laptop to gaze through the window, only to see a van speeding towards me, the driver asleep at the wheel. I bolted up from my seat as fast as I could, but it was too late. As the van smashed through the window, one last string of thoughts ran through my mind as I gazed into its headlights: “Please, I don’t want to die, I don’t want to die, I don’t want to die, I don’t want to -- “ Just as the van hit me, a bright light enveloped me.

At first, I thought I was dead. Then, as my eyes and ears gradually adjusted to the environment, I heard someone call out, “It’s a baby boy!” A nurse was holding me in her arms, smiling down at me. I opened my mouth to say something, to scream out for help, but to my horror, I couldn’t move my mouth. Or rather, my mouth could move, but I had no control over it. I was a prisoner in my own body. 

It took me a few days to come to grips with what had happened. Somehow, my consciousness had traveled back in time all the way back to the day I was born. But, I had no control over my new body. Everything I could see, everything I could hear or touch, was only happening because that was what the baby version of me had done in the past. I nearly went insane from the isolation. I would have broken down sobbing if I still had the ability to make a single tear of my own free will. It was almost kind of funny in a fucked up sort of way. Here I was, a person who had been so terrified of death before, who now yearned for it to put an end to my suffering.

But death didn’t come for me. I was forced to watch all of my memories all over again. There was me and my family moving to a different city at age 7. There was me being bullied in elementary school for three years. There was me in a burning car at age 12, screaming for help, screaming for my parents to wake up. There was me being adopted by my aunt after the funeral. There was me studying literature in high school. There was me graduating from college with a BA degree in English. And finally, after what seemed like an eternity of waiting, there was me at the coffee shop on my last day alive. By that point, I had lost almost all fear of death. Nothingness was still better than the living hell that I had been trapped in for the past twenty four years. When the van crashed through the window, I let out an internal sign of relief that my pain was finally going to end. But it didn’t.

The bright light flashed again, and when it faded, I found myself back in that nurse’s arms on the day I was born. I screamed, I howled, I begged for anybody to help me. None of it mattered. No one heard me. I spent every day after that desperately trying to regain some control of my body, to make some kind of impact on my past. Nothing worked. I wonder if this is what happens to all humans after they die or if this is some kind of special hell reserved only for me. Every time I arrive at that fateful day in the coffee shop, a single thought runs through my mind before the cycle repeats itself: “Please, just let me die.”",Letteropener52

I grab the ledge, grip it so hard a fingernail splits. Chalked hands, boot lodged deep in a crevice, weight tight against the cliff. A lizard scurries from the crevice, fleeing my probing fingers. When the rope breaks I feel it rattle against my helmet, feel my breath hiss sharp through teeth, waiting for the tug, holding to the wall hoping maybe this time I might

Nope.

The rope yanks at my belt. My fingers slip, my boot comes loose, though it's in so tight I feel a toe snap. And back I go, tumbling groundwards, the rope coiling and knotting around me as the Earth makes its unhurried way towards me.

Flash.

Thirty four years. Good times. Bad times. Marriage, kids, illness, recovery, rock climbing as my strength comes back, the drive to Yosemite, slowing down, zooming in, slower and tighter as the moment comes. Then the break, the split second of freedom, when I remember and try to put the lessons of last time into stopping it. It's eight seconds, no more: I spent ten lifetimes counting it. Not straight away though. It took a dozen loops before I could do anything more than scream in fright when I realised what was happening. Again. And again.

And again.

This time.

Eight seconds.

I grab the hammer, turn it and drive the point hard into the crack. It bites, pulls free. Five seconds. Swing again. The lizard emerges, my regular companion for eight seconds times dozens of lifetimes. I feel the hammer bite; will it hold?  I decide no, reflect on thirty four years to regret my decision as I pull free, swing again.

Too late.

The hammer spirals slowly down beside me, matching my spin. The rope loops and tangles over it, binds us both in a loose embrace, ensuring I will not be alone when I

Flash.

Forget the hammer. I grab my knife, try to flick the blade out. Too new and well-made, the springs resist; I bite at it, manage to half open it with my teeth. Three seconds. The rope is tight, the edge sharp; I saw at it, hard, feel fibres give, keep trying even when it breaks above and all I'm doing is swiping at air.

Flash.

Grab the rope. Boots on the rock, pull myself up, hand over hand. Ten metres to the top: I can do it, I can make it. Maybe not this time, but I've got forever to get this right.

Half way.

Flash.

Three quarters

Flash.

Flash.

&amp;#x200B;

It's a reflex now. Grab. Pull. Two steps. Lizard. Past the overhang. Shadow of the stunted tree. Glare of the setting sun as I look over, reach for the anchor stake, reach for release.

There's someone there.

Flash.

For ten lifetimes I call out. Ten times I hear nothing. Ten times more I fall.

Flash.

I'm angry now.

 Grab. Pull. Two steps. Lizard. Past the overhang. Rage drives me. Shadow of the stunted tree. Glare of the setting sun. The figure, my killer, hunched over the rope. I'm faster, I can see him hacking at the rope. I reach for the anchor stake, reach for answers, for anything but this.

I make it.

Wind through the grass. The sound of the rope, falling, pulling taut. My fist, white-knuckled on the stake, so tight it cuts the flesh. I don't fall.

The figure, kneeling, reaching for my hand. I see his face.

It's me.

I see his bleeding hand as he reaches for me. He shakes his head, looks me in the eye as he grasps my fingers.

""I'm sorry.""

Shortly into this wonderful and new relationship, we had discovered one of the best teachers that we both had, was diagnosed with cancer. It always the good ones it seems. Naturally this was hard on both of us. We had attended a fundraiser put on by the school to help in anyway we could, yet it was only a month or so later that she passed.

A partner's first loss within a relationship is rarely the same as your own.I remember it being hard, but also easier than it would have been if we didn't have each other.

I loved Her and a year later we married. The wedding was refreshing against all the loss. We had a big wedding, which She always claimed was my idea because I wanted a big wedding. I always denied this, claiming it was for the fact that I had a large family. While that is a fact, watching now, I know She was right. She often tended to be right.

This was my favorite part. If I had a remote, I would re-watch this over and over. Between our honeymoon, and the rest of our life together, it was the best. Despite the few rocky times we had, they never got bad enough to tear us apart. Whether it was staying home, traveling, hobbies, meals, lying in bed, Her eyes were always there for me to look into, Her hand always there for me to hold, and lips always there for me to kiss. God, I love her; past, present, and future.  I regretted nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

A couple years later, another grandparent, this time my maternal grandmother, is now in a nursing home. Her memory and mental capacities had decreased rapidly, sounding familiar. She ultimately passed away peacefully in Her sleep. We knew it was coming, but it was still hard.

Many more years passed. Grandparents are all gone, each harder than the last. Then further down the road, some of the hardest loss a person may experience, is that of your parents.

Her father was taken by heart health, while Her mother passed away of old age.  I tried to be there for Her as best I could, but one can only do so much. Even I had gotten to know them well and it was hard on me too but I felt I needed to be strong for Her. I remember thinking it was as if I hadn't earn the right to grieve because they weren't my parents, so I almost felt guilty grieving. Sitting through this again, I felt like I had the chance to grieve unabashedly for the first time.My parents were taken early by a car wreck. Killed on impact. While it felt like a movie, unlike movies you rarely get some long goodbye in which you get to say all those things left unsaid. I was just left to deal with it. I wasted so much time being angry at the drunk driver, not allowing myself to simply move onto the next step of grief. This time I was more angry with myself though, but I also couldn't blame myself. One loss is hard enough, multiple losses in a short time span are even harder, but multiple at the same time... It was almost too much. After the anger, there was a long emptiness. Seeing this from the sidelines was a completely different experience. It was like watching from a camera, as the characters talked to it expecting it to react, but then it doesn't. Even seeing Her face would not pull from this pit. I regretted this. I wished I would have let her in, let me out, relieve this pressure. Instead I let it subside and kept it in the back of my mind and just moved on. The me that was watching however, was experiencing this fresh build up of pressure, but this time I allowed myself to feel it. I let it out internally as once again my soul cried, once again harder than the last.

We managed to push through, taking me longer though because I tried to be strong about it. She was the strong one and if She tried to argue that I was the strong one, then that would only have been the case because of Her. She made me strong.But nothing is permanent.

"[WP] When you die, your life flashes before your eyes. But it happens in real time and includes the flash before you die, so it is infinitely nested and you never experience death. You realize this and conspire to break free",ThaUrbanTurban,"79 years. It has been a long one.

I am old, tired, and ready for whatever else is in store for me. Whether Heaven, nothingness, anything other than wasting away in a nursing home would be a welcome change. I feel as though I've lived a good life with minimal regrets, at least that I'm aware of with my fading memory.

Having a long life is like a good dessert, it's better when everyone gets one and you get to share it with your loved ones. This rarely happens, however, as I'm left here alone, with nothing but the few remaining thoughts of my loved ones.

My parents.My grandparents.

My wife.

Struggling to recall others from my past, my teachers, my childhood friends, my distant family, all seem just a blur anymore. It almost feels as if I never lived but that my life was a book I read years ago, attempting to remember the earlier chapters, or anything other than the larger points of the story.

I am tired.

More tired today.For some reason.

Struggling to keep my eyes open.I feel a warmth.Mind foggy.I feel the corner of my mouth start to turn up into a slight smile.I close my eyes.

I open my eyes.

Everything is bright and colorful, clear and new. It all looks shiny yet antique. My mind becoming more and more aware, like thumbing through that old book, refreshing my memory. Looking around the delivery room, I feel overwhelmed and flooded with fear and anxiety. Wanting to cry, yet helpless and unable to do nothing. I'm laid into the arms of my mother.

My mother.

Oh, I've missed her.

Now I am sure that I'm crying, yet I hear nothing nor feel the tears, it's just within my being, my soul. She's so much younger than I ever remember Her, the looked of which I've only seen in old photographs.

The years go by, as I have learned to sit back and watch the film that was my life. Watching my young and dumb self making all those young and dumb decisions, arguing with my parents, acting so high and mighty, thinking I was right. Remembering my mother's stern parenting, my father's tough love; all of it makes perfect sense to me now. I'm actually surprised they were so forgiving. I'm sure if I had had children I would have been more stern, but perhaps that is a product of their parenting. I did so appreciate it, if I never explicitly thanked them for it, I hoped they knew. I always thought I regretted occasionally being a brat or hard on my parents, but it really made me respect their reactions and appreciate the person they allowed me to become. I regretted nothing.

Viewing the past world from my 14 year old eyes, I see an event coming. One that I had mostly forgotten until now. Angry with myself more for allowing my memory to fade, I am also filled with sudden grief, both old and new.

As I'm enjoying a fun filled Saturday afternoon, I catch my parents sort of whispering to each other. As a naturally curious teenager, I start to pry. Laughing, I asked, &gt;What?? What are you talking about?

It all felt like slow motion. My dad, placing his hand on my shoulder, leads me away and sits me down. He asks me if I remembered my cousin, on my mom's side.I responded with a simple ""yeah."" The laughter had left my voice, replaced with dread and uncertainty. However, behind my eyes and my voice, I was already deeply saddened. My soul began to cry as he spoke again.

\&gt;He was in a car crash this morning. He was killed.

I had been to funerals before, lost pets, felt sadness, but this was different, the first time it happened anyway.

I watched myself as I sat down and let the emotions flood out of me. I saw the memories of us playing together years ago. He was so young and I was younger, yet I'm still here. All of those deep philosophical thoughts rushed to the forefront, my eyes seemingly opening for the first time. My first real loss and it hit hard.I was never the same after that.

Some say it gets easier, but it doesn't, at least not for me. If anything, it felt as though with each loss, the next would hit even harder.

&amp;#x200B;

High school was the hardest to watch. All the awkward moments, the cliques, the crushes, the rejection, all the learning experiences, I hated at the time. My first relationships, always thought to be painful, I saw and remembered the good times too. You tend to remember the bad parts of past relationships because it makes it easier for you to move on. Being in the moment, and from somewhat of a third party perspective, I can see both sides. And I felt for both, knowing it was not meant to be, waiting for it to end. Dragging it out longer than needed for no reason. All the nasty remarks, pushing for the end, unneeded and painful. I also get to see both sides moving on, learning and growing from the pain. Discovering themselves and finding love later in life. While some words sting, I desperately tried in my life not to say anything that I wanted to take back, because I knew that was impossible. I know I spoke harshly at times, but I never went over the line. While I may have wished my relationships ended differently, remembering the pain of past relationships allowed me to be a better partner in the future. I regretted nothing.

After high school, there was college, but for me, it was not the college experience that you hear about. Mine was mostly boring, slinking in and out of classes, not socializing, yet wondering why I had few friends. I mostly clung to the few friends I had left after high school.

Next thing I knew, college was over, jobs came and went, partners passed through my life, moved here and there. More loss.

&amp;#x200B;

Grandparents are a wonderful thing. I grew up with eight. My father's parents each had divorced and remarried, as did my mother's parents. While I was younger, there were always jokes about how my birthdays or holidays must be especially great for me as I would get twice as many gifts. This was the running joke until I got older. I realized this also meant I would have to go through losing twice as many grandparents. It wasn't until after college that this started. Three gone in less than a year. All three unexpected and sudden, and each one harder than the last. I remember the pain and the loss, but this time I also got to better remember the joy and good times I had with each. As my body and soul cried, and as my memory was being rebuilt, I began to think ahead of what was to come next.

&amp;#x200B;

Next was a new relationship, one that I knew would last. When I saw that familiar face for the first time, it was unlike anything I had or would experience. Feeling overwhelmed like an over-inflated balloon, my body unaware of what adventure was about to begin, for the first time in awhile I felt relaxed. I watched so intently yet felt calm and content, while my mind was racing through so many memories. I actually felt excitement to watch them all again.

We discovered that we had actually gone to the same elementary school, only a few years apart. It was strange to share memories of the same places and teachers and experiences, but not to have shared them alongside each other.

You realize this and conspire to break free",ThaUrbanTurban,"The red sedan swerves onto the footpath, skidding along the ice. There is no time to react. My legs buckle as the hood of the car makes contact with them, and my limp body is tossed forward. My head cracks upon the cobblestone, spilling gore onto the street, as the shock removes all feeling from my body. I float, then large hands cradle my tiny body, as I wail, eyes squeezed shut in the delivery room.

It is well known that your life flashes before you as you pass on. But each time the flashback reaches its end you live again as you die. Twice as fast as the original, then three times, and so on. The first rerun was a welcome delight. I had always feared death, the endless night devoid of being. Seeing my family again was good. Reliving my first love was good. But now I dread it.

The millionth experience is your life compressed into less than an hour. Intense happiness in a second as your three year old self spends a day at a theme park, all-consuming sadness after your first break up. The ten millionth experience passes by in less time than it takes to make a steak.

I have been through that and more. I seize, gripped by a moment of panic as a maths exam flits by. Gosh I always hated those. Those strange formulae never made sense to me. 

Now each life passes by faster than I can think. Not that it matters. It shall all end soon enough. I now eagerly await as the each lifetime shortens to zero.

That is what will happen, isn't it?

It must converge.

It must.

We thought it was perfectly balanced, with more ups than downs, more goods than bads. Her face aged yet looked more beautiful than ever. Despite what She thought, She always looked incredible. She would claim that I was just saying that because I had to, but I don't think She realized that I was being completely honest each and every time.

&amp;#x200B;

Then at 73, She was taken from me. My final loss, harder than the last, subsequently, the hardest.

Some illness I had never heard of, some Latin words that to me only meant death.

My body held her as she left me. I was already leaving myself, for I was almost too old and tired to try to deal with this loss head-on. I locked myself away in the back of my mind while my body coasted through the rest of my life, sounding familiar. It's hard to grow old with someone. You don't want them to go before you, but you also don't want to leave them. In an ideal world, you would peacefully pass away in each other's arms, but again this wasn't a movie.

The remaining years of my life seemed to crawl by while also running together. I was back in my bed at the nursing home, alone again. It seemed so long ago, yet as if it were the same day. This time however, my memories were more fresh on my mind, and somewhat sharper as my memory was corrected a few times.They say whenever you recall a memory, it's not event itself you're remembering, but instead the last time you recalled that memory.I was fortunate enough to get a refresher before leaving this world.

I remember thinking I was ready for Heaven or nothingness, or whatever it was going to be, and once again as I closed my eyes, I began to smile.

Then from the nothingness that I thought I was left to, I saw my mother again.There must be something wrong. Didn't think just happen?Again I watch as I get to see my parents again, my grandparents, have fun with my cousin, then lose him. Going through school again, the childish antics, the awkwardness, the relationship, more loss. Grow up more, start a loving and lasting relationship with the love of my life, get married, more loss.

This is the third time I've lost all my loved ones.This is also the third time I got to see them and relive all my life with them.Of course losing my parents again was hard, but actually not as hard as last time.

But losing Her again, was just as hard.

I grow old and alone another time when I began to slip away again. I wait for something else, when I open my eyes and see my mother a fourth time.

All the joy and pain of my life pass before me once again. My cousin, my grandparents, my parents, I see all their smiles again. I hear all their laughs, their jokes, their stories.And my wife, Her beautiful eyes look into mine again for the first time as She smiles shyly. Her voice, I'll never get tired of, even when She's upset with me.All that pain slowly gets overshadowed by all the joy. I see my parents, knowing they will be gone soon, but it doesn't hit as hard this time.

Even my wife, when She slips away as I hold Her, I feel the terrible loss again, but it feels lighter.Then I grow old and see my mother again.I start to think this must be it. Is this supposed to be Heaven? Hell? Is this supposed to be the ""nothingness"" that some refer to?

This is the fifth time I've gone through this, or is it the sixth? I forget. It's all beginning to run together...

So I just sit back and relax and watch it all again.

9 times.10 times.20.30.50.100.

I open my eyes and see my mother and I feel my soul smile. Thinking to myself, &gt;nice to see you again.I play. I grow. The smiles, the laughter, the joy, it never gets old. I loved my loved ones for a reason, and I'm glad I get to see them again.

Even my wife, as she passes, I'm sad, but I think to myself, &gt;I'll see you later.

I grow old, and true I am alone, but I don't feel lonely.

As I lie in bed, I close my eyes and think to myself, &gt;I can't wait to see them all again.

I smile.

The handle moved, ever so slowly. I was breathing heavy, trying to calm down my panicked mind. The door creaked open, and Joshua slowly stepped inside. A sinister smile crept across his face.

""Did you enjoy your reading?""

I didnt answer.

""Yes, that's you. It's not a sick joke. All of the entries are you and completely real.
 And you'll be adding another one shortly. Just you wait. I know I'm looking forward to it."" His smile grew.

He turned to go, then stopped, halfway out of the door.

He paused, savoring the suspense.

At last this was her chance to make one final confession, “*You need an escape, do you understand?”*

She had laughed, tossing her mother’s concerns aside as she planned to do to her bouquet at the reception. “Mother,” she took her hands into her own, “you worry far too much. Nicholas is a good man. I will not have to worry ever again.” 

*“Myra, please,”* she began. *“He is not a good man.”*

“Enough,” Myra said sharply. “I have had enough of your theatrics,” her mother’s magnanimous concerns exhausted her, and better reasons for her stamina to drain waited for them,. She straightened her crown, smiling brightly at her reflection, “This is my wedding day, and you will not ruin it.”

\----------------

“You need an escape,” she bleated.

Myra needed more than an escape. Any escape she might have concocted was useless; the moment he caught her, which he always did, she’d forget this night had ever existed. Sitting on her bed, she didn’t contemplate her limited options. She didn’t muse over what could be done to ease her burden. Silk curtains blew quietly in the air. This was her life now. Had been her life. And there was nothing to be done about it.

“Not exactly,” she bleated again. “It wasn’t what Monica thought the day you brought him home.”

“What?” 

The voice sighed, “She knew what was to become of you, and she did her best to assist you.” If it was corporreal she imagined its rotations while its accusing stare rested on her bowed head, “But you are a child, or held the arrogance of one, and that never does any of us any good.”

“What can I do,” she sobbed, quietly. “I don’t know what to do. I can’t simply run. Everything is in his name. Everything.”

“You are a disappointment,” the voice cooed. “It cannot be helped,” she paused after a moment’s time, and she calmly yet firmly explained what she needed to do, “All you need to do is believe.”

“Believe in what,” she asked.

“In anything. In me. In my voice. Specifically my voice.” She emphasized the last part, and Myra heard the glare in her voice, “Can you do that? Can you believe in me?”

“I-I,” she stumbled, and then, there was a knock. A single knock. Her shoulders stiffened, and her breath stopped. All was silent and still in their bedroom. 

Myra stared at her mother’s curtains. “I can,” she nodded. “I believe in you.”

\----------------

She knew what was to happen. Nicholas wasted no time, and was pleased to see that despite her recently acquired knowledge, she did not fight. Not initially. His hands strayed from her navel up to her nipple, pausing briefly to admire her collarbone, and stopped at her throat. She closed her eyes, and sucked in a deep breath. 

There was no fight.

He was on top. She was on bottom. Her arms and legs were spread apart. Everything hurt. Everything was breathless - his intention, no doubt. Passing out was desired at this point, but she couldn’t disappear without belief. 

*“All you have to do, my Myra,”* her mother’s voice sang, “i*s believe in the lamb, and let her take you away. She does not ask for much, just give her what she wants.”*

“I believe,” she gripped his wrists, not to stop him, not to resist this act of violence upon her body. It was a reminder, she understood, a reminder to them that she knew - would always know, and for some terrible reason, would continue to love him. 

*“Because I love him,”* she told her mother that fateful day. *“And he is my dream.”*

“I give him to you,” she spat. “I give him to you!”

\----------------

Myra was heard.

There was pain. Terrible, unforgivable pain. It sliced and tore into her soul, taking pieces as it pleased, and suddenly, without explanation, she was free. His terrible hold of her thorax weakened. She glanced to his face and gasped, recoiling at the sight looming above her. His bloodstained eyes - almost identical to hers, were swollen and full of liquid that was neither blood or water. His skin was chalk white, and his veins a morose shade of black. 

His lips strained to part, and his tongue fought to speak. But speech failed him.

He slumped, fell over, and landed on the floor with a fleshy thud. She rolled to the side, clawing at her neck, tears of delight and horror spilling over her cheeks. Time passed patiently. Looking over the edge wasn’t an option; she closed her eyes and breathed.

“Why, Ah’ gotta say, this is quite the predicty-dink,” chuckled a speaker who was not her husband, who was not her, and certainly not Her. “But ya’ know? Dolly’s pleased anyway, so we’ll call it square.”

Against her better judgment, she willed her neck to roll to the other side, and she met pie-cut black eyes staring back at her. And long ears.

“Who are you,” she whimpered.

He tipped his flat cap. “The name’s Bushwa,” he grinned. “And I am a Delivery Boy.”

“A Delivery Boy?”

“Yeah…, and uh…,” digging into his back pocket, he pulled out a notepad and a pencil. “It ain’t often when someone offers a sacrifice. She usually just takes, ya catch my drift? But your willing sacrifice made it all the better.”

“But he’s -,”

“Ain’t your problem anymore, toots.” He wiped his button shaped nose with his thumb, winking, “So long, and I uh...hope you feel better. Ain’t right to treat a lady like that.”

And then he was gone. 

She glanced over the edge, and in their absence was an ink stain. A Nicholas size ink stain. Turning to her bed stand she found a note resting beside her lamp that read, “Some bleach will wipe that out! Pleasure doing business with ya’!”

“I guess that’s all folks,” she muttered, weakly.",milkbeamgalaxia

Then you realize they're summoning a demon you have a long history with and start to panic.",granitefeather,"Ahh, my head. Fuck. How much did I drink last night? 

I awaken to a dimly lit room. The first thing I notice is I’m bound upright to a cold, smooth stone. A rope digs into my collarbone. I look down, and I’m still wearing last night’s dress. 

Ok, I know I’m into some kinky stuff, but I don’t think this is really on my list of fantasies. I prefer NOT to go to sleep still tied up. 

I blink the sleep out of my eyes and take a look around the room. Five dark robed figures stand in a semicircle around me, backlit by the fire pit in the center of the floor behind them.

Great. I’ve been trying to keep a low profile lately. This is just the cherry on top of a fucking year. After watching my girlfriend’s soul get sucked out right in front of my eyes, traveling to the underworld and back to save her, only to finally find out that she was loyal to Borkrav the whole time, I was really hoping for some consolation prize from fate for once.

“What the fuck do you want?” I call out.

The figure in front of me raises out its arm, revealing a blade gripped by a pale-green, bony hand. The hiss that followed out of its mouth was just as unnatural. “The subject is awake. We will now proceed with the summoning.” The figure stepped closer. “We gather tonight to request with great humility, your presence, oh great one, oh terrible one, so we, your loyal servants, may carry out your will in the neutral realm. Please accept our offering of the one called Francis Jayda Collier, as it is pleasing to you.” The human-like creature crouches down in front of me. Now adjusted to the darkness, I make out a faint pentagram etched into the stone floor below me. And I’m in the middle of it.

This is DEFINITELY not how I wanted to wake up, but I suppose I’ve been in worse situations. The boogie bloods may be good at slipping drugs into drinks, but at least they’re relatively easy to take down. This demon on the other hand, well let’s just say I’ve learned how to smooth things over with an underworlder more than once. 

The figure proceeds to etch symbols in each of the five arms of the pentagram. “By the power of Nemahel, Grever, Donalai, Lilith, and the power of Fire....” the figure touches the completed pentagon, and it bursts into low, green flames. 

Wait, this doesn’t sound good...

“We summon you, almighty Borkrav!” 

Oh no. No no no.

The green flames shoot violently upwards, growing and flickering a myriad of colors. Sparks fly off the fires in every direction. Surrounded by flashing fire, I feel no heat, just the harsh rush of wind as the flames rage higher, and the imminent feeling of doom as I come closer to looking my worst nightmare in the eyes. Borkrav. 

They say he blew apart his entire army for letting me escape. This summer, I had the upper hand. Now, I stand defenseless to the demon who’s current motivation is to have me shackled in his chambers for all eternity. 

As the flames die down, a tall, horned figure appears to the side of the pentagram, dark blue muscles bulging as the greater demon stretches his body out from the sudden and violent journey up from the underworld. But his burning orange gaze remains fixed. On me. 

I see the hate in his gaze immediately. Even from several feet away, I see the fire dance behind the greater demon’s ever-flickering eyes – the eyes I once looked into with wonder and admiration, until he started fucking up everyone and everything that I ever loved. Borkrav’s obsession for me runs deep, and since this summer, his obsession to have me damned runs deeper. I know he’d stop at nothing to have me all to himself, as his personal play-toy, to curse me to an eternity of his sick tortures – or however long I would last. Luckily, it’s near impossible for demons to leave their realm unless they are summoned by an Earthly servant with a proper sacrifice, which is why I was not expecting to have to face my mortal enemy anytime soon, but, apparently, a mortal enemy counts as a proper sacrifice. 

“Francis,” Borkrav sneers, “we meet again.”",myrrhh

"[WP] Vampires are not monsters. They don't even really exist. Rather drinking human blood constantly can make humans stronger, faster and immortal. This property of blood wasn't discovered until now.",shiroukotomine,"Finally a solution.
It is funny when you think about it: Vampire stories have been around forever, but nobody ever questioned, where a vampire would come from.
The answer is as simple as horrifying: everybody can become one upon drinking blood.
Well technically you wouldn't really become a different creature, rather you would gain abilities, which would make it seem like you were a superhuman monster, to a normal human.
To be fair, you would become a superhuman, but your humanity wouldn't be lost, at least in a biological sense.
Back to the solution I was talking about.
One of the abilities you gain, by regularly consuming blood is immortality.
You may think, I am exaggerating here, but I tested it. A lot.
Dozens if not hundreds of humans died in the experiments, until one wouldn't.
Believe me, I tried a lot to make an immortal.
Potions, spells and even demonic rituals.
That I didn't find that solution earlier is a shame.
I would have had a lot more blood at my disposal.

"[WP] Vampires are not monsters. They don't even really exist. Rather drinking human blood constantly can make humans stronger, faster and immortal. This property of blood wasn't discovered until now.",shiroukotomine,"""It's called Parabiosis,""

I look back over my shoulder as I step down the tight aisle, labcoat brushing against the benches on either side.

""Though, of course, we didn't know until recently the extent of the gains it offered""

I try a small chuckle, but the suit behind me offers only a tight line in response.

We walk on in silence for a moment more before coming to the main event: an industrial size fume hood with a transparent cage front and center. A small mouse wheel stands against the far wall of the cage, connected through the wall to a set of sensors against the back wall. A collection of flexible tubes run out over the top of the cage and into a pump appartus, which in turn runs into a collection of smaller cages each featuring a haggard looking mouse of their own. 

""This mouse,"" I say, pointing at the main cage, ""Has been alive for 14 years. Normally, this breed lasts only, 5, 6 years, 8 at the most. But Gerome here has been alive for 14. And that's not even the best part--you see this wheel, here?"" I ask, pointing at the wheel. The suit offers an unreadable nod.

""We've got it hooked up to a odometer--This little marvel can run three times as long and almost twice as fast as our best unaltered mouse at its prime. And he's getting better--the longer he stays on the pump, the more improvement we see.""

""The trick, see, was figuring out that, here, at least, quantity matters--normal parabiosis only transfers a bit of blood back and forth, and the two blood streams mix--our method ramps that process up considerably, and the transfer goes only one way. A continuous drip of healthy, young blood. The body seems to be able to naturally eliminate the excess blood safely, at least at this input rate--though we're working on that too, mind--and so far there have been only... minimal... side effects."" 

I grimace a bit at that last word, and give the suit a sidelong look, but his face is inscrutable as always. Never looking away from the cage, he cuts in

""Minimal? Explain.""

""Uhh, nothing too notable. Some minor Hematuria--though that's expected of course--some minor physiological changes, a few unusual enzymes being produced, some behavioral... We're confident given time, and, of course, more funding, that we can absolve these issues. And, of course, amplify the benefit--""

""Behavioral. You're referring to the increased aggression, addiction like behavior, and the issues with re-introduction to the mouse population?""

Damn--he's not supposed to know about that. Someone must've let something slip when they shouldn't have.

""Yes, precisely. But we're working on that, as I said. It should be no problem.""

The mouse walked over to the wheel, its nose twitching. It mounted, and began to run--not the typical run of a mouse on a wheel, but a powerful, leaping stride that soon had the wheel blurring past, the spokes lost to the eye.

""Your confidence is as uninteresting to me as it is false, Doctor Shelly. I do not care that your parabiotic mouse, as you call it, slaughtered half its brood when taken off the pump for the first time in six weeks. I do not even care that the facial growths and enzyme profiles suggest these parabiotic effects are linked to deeper genomic programs that we do not yet understand, even if you will not admit it. And I do not care about the fact that your lab only discovered this not through a bolt of genius as you would like me to believe but just because your contract for the injectable food transfusions didn't pan out. I only care about three things: whether or not you can make the process faster, the results stronger, and the necessary device smaller.""

""Well... yes. Yes I think we can. With your funding, at least.""

The suit looked at me then, for the first time taking his eyes off of the mouse.

""Then you have it.""

""Thank you, General--you won't regret it!""

The suit nodded, and I began leading him out of the lab and back to the entry hall. Already my mind was whirring, leaping ahead. The general was right--undoing the side effects might prove impossible, for all of my claims. But making the process faster, stronger, and smaller? That, I could deliver.",heretotrywriting

"[WP] After a car accident, your vision starts getting progressively worse. But you find the worse your vision gets, the better you can see...them.",CarolineJohnson,"They're here.

I don't know how much longer I can hide from them. There's too many. I always knew this day would come, but now that it's here, I almost can't believe it... I'm trapped.

Who are *they*? I don't know. I've never gotten close enough to find out. I've never wanted to. I suppose, before the accident, I might have, but I wouldn't know. I couldn't see them then. But they were there, no doubt about that. They're everywhere. You've probably run into them several times yourself.

Have you ever felt a cold breeze slap your cheek and thought to yourself, *Where did that come from? It's a such a beautiful day outside. This doesn't feel right.* That's them. Or have you ever walked past a person in the shadows and swore their eyes followed yours? That's them, too. They're in that mean rabid dog next to the grocer's and the spoiled child crying on the subway and the mugger waiting in the street with a knife ready to make your wallet bleed green. They're in that shadowy alley and that window where the curtain just moved and  that strange, broken corner bench nobody's bothered to fix. But you can never see them; they always move just out of sight. They were too quick for my eyes, once, too. And that nearly killed me. Because they were there, just out of sight, in The Accident.

The Accident was quick, quicker than you'd expect. There's no flashy slo-mo like in the movies, not even a split second to think, *what-*? before your car rams head-first into the taxi trying to swerve out of your way. You don't feel it when the glass shatters everywhere, lodging itself in your head and your legs and your eyes and a million other places that you would never think about, but they're there. Just like *them*.

The doctors told me I was extremely lucky. Now I'm not so sure. A better word would be unusual. I'd heard of blind people getting keener hearing or deaf people getting keener senses of touch but I've still never heard of anyone else that has experienced what happened to me. Lucky for them, I guess.

It didn't happen all at once, not at first. It all started when the doctors first came into my hospital room, all wearing their sober fake-sad bedside manner looks and carrying their sterile white clipboards with sterile white papers on them that I immediately knew couldn't mean anything good. They all looked at each other for a long time, like they were trying to see who was going to pull the short straw. It ended up being this tall guy to my left. He cleared his throat kind of nervously, leaned in, and told me I was going to lose my sight in six months.

That was when I first saw one of *them.*

I almost screamed; I came close, but I held myself back. The thing on his shoulder looked like some eldritch abomination that had crawled straight out of a Lovecraft horror book. It was small, about the size of a chameleon, but with twice as many legs and arms. Some of the legs were turned inside out, and some of them pulsed endlessly with some kind of strange, mucus-y fluid that you could see travel up and down as it breathed. It was the color of polished ebony, with eyes a darker red than spilled blood. Its teeth were tiny, but looked sharp enough to splice through bone. Its tail was probably twice as long as it was, and twice as horrible. Huge, rotting tumors of yellow pus ached out at irregular intervals along it, adorning the sharp black spikes dotted along its back like horrible pom poms. An open mouth sighed open and closed along the right side of the tail, trailing lines of thick purple spit. And the worse part of all, worse than all of that, was that the entire time, the tail was wrapped lovingly around the doctor's neck like a noose.

I tried a couple of darker stories so I wanted to try something a little more light this time. I hope you guys enjoy it!      


All I can remember is a bright light, and then everything fading. I woke up to the lights, barely even noticing the hospital room I was in. It could've been night or day as far as I could tell. The doctors, the machines... it all seemed so dim and so far away. But the lights were there, growing brighter by the minute, even as the room faded away. They're beautiful, like spun moonlight, fiery tendrils reaching through the room. I saw one about where I last saw the doctor, and another near my shoulder, about where a potted plant would've stood. Could these be... souls? The white faded a bit, and new colors emerged as the room faded away completely. Soft greens and glittering golds warmed the darkness around me. The air looked cosmic, like rivers of molten stardust weaving through the air.  Is this dying? The lights seemed to embrace me, to welcome me into their warmth. This... This isn't so bad. I'm feeling so light now, tethered to my heavy body. I let go, and feel my soul shimmer as my light ascends to join the others.",writteninstardust
"[WP] After a car accident, your vision starts getting progressively worse. But you find the worse your vision gets, the better you can see...them.",CarolineJohnson,"I looked around, but nobody seemed to see the sucker but me. Its mouth was thankfully on the other side of the doctor's poor neck, but I could see the thing turn its tail every so often to lick it with a tongue spotted red with boils. It was all I could do to stop myself from warning the poor guy.

It only got worse from there. As my eyesight worsened, I started to see them everywhere. I spent a lot of my time shaking off the ones that latched on whenever dark thoughts started to spin in my head, which was all of the time, as I had to constantly stare at these abominations. They were smart, too; a couple times, I could've sworn I heard them saying something to each other. I know it sounds crazy, but I think they have some kind of horrible *them* language. I know because I can see their facial expressions change when they talk.

Months have passed now, and everything's starting to grow dark. The darker it gets, the more I *see*, and the more I don't want to see. I've tried everything, begging my doctors for cornea transplants and basically every kind of eye treatment on the planet, but they kept telling me those things could only make it worse. One of my doctors was actually really nice about it. He used to spend every day joking around with me, talking to me next to my hospital bed. It was fun, until I saw him come in one day with one of *them* slung around his neck. That ended things pretty quick.

I'm getting sick of being stuck in this hospital room. There's only so many times you can eat processed pudding, you know? And my family and friends have stopped coming so often, which is a shame, but the holidays are coming up, so I understand. But what I understand more is the litter of *them* slung around their necks and clinging to their shoes, making them drag their feet awkwardly as they approach my bed and shifting their eyes away from mine. I see *them* hurrying my family out the door during these awkward, forced visits, and I have to assume that the only reason why they came in the first place is because one of *them* compelled them to.

Everything is growing darker now. My time is growing near. As the edges of my vision fade in and out of focus, I see *them* gathering around my bed. They've been waiting for this day. I suppose it should make sense; they've always hidden in the dark spots, and now as my world grows darker every day, they've started to crowd themselves more into the frame like needy pets. I only wish I could throw *them* a bone and they would run away. But they don't seem to want to do anything, really. I've never seen them have any desire to do anything but watch, just as all are they are now.

I see them clacking away in that strange language of theirs now. I think they're happy. I can't know for sure, but I've been getting steadily more fluent, as I've had a surplus of time on my hands. They're gathering closer now, spilling up and over into my hospital bed, dragging their mouths along my legs and my arms and my neck. I can see some of that purple spit land next to my nose.

It's so dark now, so dark, and their faces are growing clearer. I can hear someone crying. I turn my head to look, but I can't really see them anymore; I only see the five of *them* clinging to his shape. I think it's that doctor I like, the one that used to joke around with me. He must be in a dark mood if so many are swarming around him. How many are on my bed now? From what I can see, dozens, maybe hundreds.

""Don't cry,"" I tell the doctor. ""It'll just make more of them come."" I don't think he understands what I mean, but I'm past caring at this point.

Then, the impossible: one of them touches me. Strange; I've always been always to see them, but I've never actually felt one touch me before, even when they crawled all over my legs. But now I can feel tiny claws pressing into my skin, their snotty purple spit landing in great globs on my forehead. I can feel the great mouths on their tails latching their lips to my legs, and now, I can feel *them* start to eat.

I scream, and I hear doctors approach in the distance, but there's nothing they can do now. They can't stop something they can't see. *Their* mouths, I have just found, are dotted with tiny yet deadly teeth. But far worse than that are the spikes, which dig their way deeper into my skin the more I squirm and struggle.

I can feel now that the doctors have pinned my arms to my bed. I look up and see one of *them* perched on each head, probably leaking something poisonous into their thoughts. I wish I could hate the doctors, I really do, but the truth is that my time is drawing near. The claws and spikes and fangs have made their way to my heart now, and I can see one of the little ones sizing up my brain. What a little rascal.

*You know, they're almost cute when you get used to them,* I thought. My mind is growing sluggish now. Everything is fading away, but it's different, somehow. Warmer. I feel as if I'm going to sleep, and if I shut my eyes, I'm going to fall into an even greater darkness.

I do, and I am undone.

People say the devil is a goat-man, or a hag, or a beautiful person dressed up in a suit. I tend to disagree. Because the only thing I saw as I hurtled down that mortal coil was one of *them* waiting for me in the darkness at the other side.

"[WP] You are assassinated as the man kicks you out of a space ship in low orbit, burning up in the atmosphere.Or at least, that’s what was supposed to happen.",DankAndOriginal,"I stand there, incredulous. I look at my entire body in shock: everything's still intact, as nothing happened.

Then, I look around me and realize I'm floating through the atmosphere. Everything around me is pretty: the stars shining in the distance, the obscurity of the space all around me, the Milky Way visible. Everything seems so bright, so close and yet so far. 

I should have been dead, but instead I'm still standing -well, or at least, floating-, staring in the infinity that surrounds me.

I can still see the man that kicked me out in an attempt to kill me. He's standing in the ship, eyes and mouth wide open and seems to be asking himself how I am still alive.

I wonder, too, actually. It seems I have some kind of immunity I never knew about. It must have a link with my past.

Truth is, I was adopted. I was dropped in front of the house of the people that would become my adoptive parents later. For them, I was like a miracle that had fallen from the sky: a shooting star, because my mother was sterile.

No one knew who put me there and my parents still wonder.  The only thing I know is that something was strange when they lift me up from the ground that night to take me in their arms: my skin was glowing in a pale white the color of a star.

The phenomenon disappeared after a certain amount of time, but my parents never understood why or how I was glowing.

That is how I developed a passion for space and how I ended up on that damn mission with stupid colleagues. They decided to kill me because I was ""compromising the mission"", which was to safely land on Mars. 

In fact, I had noticed some weird things going on in the trajectory we were following, so I wanted to try another way around. 

But they wouldn't, because it could have extend our trip from 1 year, which was unacceptable for them. 

That is how I ended up floating into space staring them in the eyes without any combination to protect me from the lack of oxygen necessary to live. 

I look down once again to my body and notice something weird.

"[WP] Humans have just found out the Earth is a sentient creature, that it is helping increase climate change as it is sick of humans living on it. Earth has found out that we know..",I_pund_you_n00b,"There's a concept called multiple discovery, where two or more people discover the same thing, at around the same time, but in different places, without knowing of each other. Like the theory of evolution. We know about Charles Darwin, but not too many know about Alfred Russel Wallace. 

The same thing happened again when humans found out that the Earth was sentinet.

Earthquake. Three dead. Volcanic eruption. Three dead. Tornado. Three dead. Hurricane. Three dead. Sea storm. Three dead. Lightning. Three dead.

No one put it together like I did because no one was as personally involved as I was. I should have died at sea but the Earth - for some reason - likes to kill in three's; and I was the fourth man aboard that day, just a college student doing an internship.

The Earth is alive, but it doesn't want anyone to know. And I know you won't believe me. I'm writing this in a Reddit writing prompt *because* I don't want you to believe me. 

Your disbelief is the only reason the Earth lets me stay alive.

"[WP] Humans have just found out the Earth is a sentient creature, that it is helping increase climate change as it is sick of humans living on it. Earth has found out that we know..",I_pund_you_n00b,"""You can always trust the ground beneath your feet,"" people used to say. Before these times. For now, there wasn't anything you could trust. Society crumpled like paper once it found out, and, well, the ground wasn't to be trusted either.

You couldn't walk through a forest without the fear of roots grabbing your feet, pulling you under, never to breathe again. And deserts grew quicker as the world began to heat up faster and faster. You were lucky if you weren't killed for whatever few possessions you had when you met someone. Parents killed their children in futile attempts to get food.

 It only took four years for the population of Earth to die out. Yet there were some that got out.

The International Space Station. A safe haven for humanity. In fact, the only one left after sentience was discovered. Science prevailed there as the people back on the planet rotted, their bodies fueling, feeding Mother Earth. So we found a way to live.

""Mars,"" said Captain Hanley. ""Once, we had a plan of settling there, trying it out. Yet those hopes seemed dashed once the ground below us opened up, killed our friends, our brothers. Yet now that hope is rekindled. We have found a way to live there. And let's be honest, it's our only hope. How long can we survive on this machine. We are the final 48 humans. We have limited resources, unless we do something. So this is us doing something. Any opposed?"" Nobody spoke up.

So we went to Mars. We set up a home there. And life seemed good. For twelve years, we prospered. We had children. We were happy. But there was something we forgot.

It was a few more hours and I was a few more beers in by the time we made our way back up and around and to the backstage entrance. We made our way through the hustle and bustle of the late teens, early twenty-somethings, and coaching staffs till we found our way to the portly fellow.

“HEY G.I. MISSLE JOE!” I yelled, “Long time no see!” He spun around and his eyes went wide! “What in the hell are you guys doing here!?” He popped off his look of shock turning into a big toothy grin, “It’s been ages, what are y’all up to these days?” He waved us over to a less trafficked area, and we heard it all what he had been up to since he had moved on and we shared updates of our own. “But why are you all dressed up back here?” Jake asked. We were then told how he wasn’t content being retired from gaming and he wanted to get back into it but with the way, gaming is that he figured he would be better as a coach. That is when he dropped it on us, we all knew that Downpour’s previous coach had decided to retire and the team had been interviewing around, “You didn’t hear it from me but as of this week this is my final ‘interview’ for that position,” he blathered on, “If I can take DP to the top 3 I’ll be signing on that dotted line the day after we wrap things up here. “Well good for you, that’s a great accomplishment and we wish you all the best, but we should go though it looks like your team’s next match is coming up soon” I replied, trying to rally the group to leave. As I turned on my heel to leave something out of the corner of my eye caught my attention.

It was that kid from before in the Downpour jersey still scrolling away on his tablet, and he was walking up to Joe. “Dad, Ribby’s replay footage shows he was out of position that last match and that’s why that newb picked him off. I think he’s getting his role confused with Ascension.” “D-Dad?” I said still not putting two and two together, “Oh yes this is my son Joe Jr,” he said, “Joe, these are some of the people I used to play against back in my day feel free to say hello.” Jr looked up from his tablet and without missing a beat blurted, “Aren’t you that blind fucker who ran into me earlier?” Really now, that’s how we’re going to play this…”Listen, kid, I was going to apologize for earlier but I can see your manners are as bad as your awareness of your surroundings. Quite the kid you’re raising there Joe, I see he takes after dear old Dad.” “Oh is that a bit of jealousy I detect,” Joe puffed, “Jealousy…JEALOUSY, Clean the fat out of your ears you moron, we ran into each other literally but your kid has piss poor manners and I see that evidently, the only thing you’ve changed is your waistline,” I knew right where to hit him. “Oh you piece of shit, I’ll kick your ass in front of God and everyone, just because you couldn’t hack it and adapt like some of us can doesn’t mean you have to be jealous!” Why was he going back to the jealousy thing, it didn’t have anything to do with this situation, I looked to my friends and they were just staring between the both of us in stunned silence. “Listen, man, I used to prove it to you year after year as we wiped the floor with your team that you’re the only jealous one here. If anyone is to be jealous it’s your man, just living out your glory days wishing you were better. You’re like that kid in high school that continues to wear his lettermen’s jacket 40 years later. Dude, good luck to you and I hope we never see one another again.”

The next few seconds were a blur, he picked up an idle tray of sandwiches and hurled it at the whole lot of us, “Fuck you guys! You name a time and a place and I can kick your ass, hell Jr here could probably do it by himself. You’re no good anymore, you never evolved to keep up with the times, you won’t do it because you’re a scared little bitch. Huh, bitch boy? Too scared to play someone better than you?” Spittle was flying every which way as he turned more and more red in the face. I was hoping that the top button of his dress shirt was threaded with steel at that point because I was sure it was going to pop off and kill someone. I could have left well enough alone, I could have walked off and never seen the prick again, but I’m a sinner, I’ve always been and I just am far too prideful for that kind of challenge.

“You’re on!” I exclaimed much to the dismay of the rest of my shocked or face-palming teammates, “I can’t wait to see you try to squeeze your way into one of those bodysuits, what do you do? Get a running start while coated in Vaseline?” laughing through the whole sentence.

And that’s when he clocked me right in the nose.

Things were relatively quiet from that point on, well quiet in a sense I would describe it as less eventful. Downpour opened…and closed the first match against Team Tilt rather quickly in a 3-0 sweep in a best of 5 format. Now I have to say a good portion of the fun was had watching what the teams were doing in-game but have you ever watched someone playing VR? They look absolutely ridiculous, running but never going anywhere, holding nothing yet showing visual recoil while firing an imaginary weapon, and the best has to be when there is an explosion that takes out a player and they just kinda jump and fall over; it’s absurd.

It was halfway through the 3rd match of the day that Jon tapped me on the shoulder and pointed out a guy in a suit standing barely offstage. “Holy shit, is that MissleToe!?” he yelped barely holding back laughter. “Oh, Jesus, really?” Jake chimed in, “yea it does look like him, what the hell is he doing down there all dressed up and 100lbs heavier than I remember?”

He wasn’t wrong by any means but his weight estimation was a bit off, there was no doubt about it though, that was MissleToe or maybe now better known Joe Spruza. Joe was the captain of the Starlings when we ran the circuit and often prone to fits of rage during a match, not someone you want to sit next to, but the kid could play. The Starlings were typically the 3rd ranked team for a few years running but were more the running joke of the circuit for their terrible usernames, don’t get me wrong usernames are usually thought up to sound cool and 99.99% of the time they never do but Missle-TOE, I think they had one guy just named Crunk at one time too I mused as I shook my head and laughed. “We should go say hello if we can,” Annie chirped, “I mean we do have these Prime Passes that Cyclic provided when they heard we would be in attendance.” “Do you REALLY want to talk to MissleG.I.Joe!?” I exclaimed in utter mockery of him. “Oh come on man,” Jake butted in, “I’m sure he’s matured over the years, I mean if you have anything is possible.” I shot him a glance but knew I was already outvoted by the team and fighting a losing battle, “Alriiiight, alright....” was all I could mutter before the crowd erupted as evidently, some huge play had occurred while our attention had been focused elsewhere.",Stermz415

I remember back to the days when E-sports was on the rise, teams of players jokingly called “athletes” testing themselves in a battle of wits and strategy. The older crowd always scoffing at the fact that recreational hobbies like games could be seen as anything other than glorified time wasters until it happened. E-sports overtook hockey in concurrent viewership, then baseball, racing, soccer, basketball, and much to the chagrin of the US diehards even football.

Midway through 2025, my team Penthouse had made quite a name for itself in the FPS community we took home trophy after trophy and seemed nigh unbeatable and lived at the top of the mountain so to speak in the game: Wasteland. A game consisting of two 5 person teams battling it out in a large procedurally generated urban landscape. You had all the common classes your Assault, Medic, Sniper, Engineer, so on and so forth. Wasteland was nothing new and inventive borrowing things from games of old like class abilities and user-specified loadouts, but as is the case with most FPS games what made it catch on were its tight controls, regular balance updates, constant character additions and the like.

Sadly like most games, it was only here to stay until something better came along. Around the time Wasteland was at its peak was when major breakthroughs in VR tech started to become accessible. Haptic feedback bodysuits, 360-degree movement platforms, and retina tracking which completely freed the player from being tied into having to use mouse and keyboard. As we were getting older and the younger generations are always able to adapt we were eventually pushed out of the spotlight favoring teens who could adapt quickly.

We all had made a good living and still had relatively good followings while streaming and we all still stayed in touch with one another on a regular basis, but I would be lying to say I didn’t miss the adrenaline rush of a well-coordinated team push to secure a game objective and hearing the roar of the crowd.

It had been years since I saw my old comrades and we had all made it a point to meet up this year at the FMJ Pro-Am to reconnect for a week of fun and leisure. E-sports had evolved in a way that each genre had it’s own yearly season that culminated in a Pro-Am to raise money for charity. We had all made the decision after Cyclic Labs had released Wasteland 2 which had taken the FPS pro circuit by storm as it had in our earlier years and brought us to moderate stardom. Say what you will, but everyone’s a sucker for a bit of nostalgia.

We arrived in Vegas early on day 1 of the 3 day tournament and met up in the hotel we were all staying at Jake (Explicit) had grown a beard since the last time I had seen him, Steph (Bouncing Betty) was telling us stories of her recent trip to Australia, Jon (Riktor) and Annie (Mean Queen) were talking about their tandem bachelor and bachelorette party we were all invited to in Austin the following year and I (Stiggs) just sat there soaking it all in.

We departed and arrived at the arena with some time to get a few snacks and take our seats. On the way to concessions I was talking about that time Jake and I pulled off a three-man comeback, well two man one woman comeback but you get the jist, in the Wasteland quarterfinals in Rio when I ran into a kid scrolling through his phone.

“Watch it dumbass!” he remarked as he faded into the crowd behind me. I turned just long enough to see his bright pink shirt with a raindrop with sunglasses on the back; team Downpour the winner of this year’s championship. Downpour’s team captain (Munch) had jumped the amateur ranks quickly and had just signed with the team the previous year, but like many he was a bit immature for all the fame he had been thrown into and was a bit of a dick, griefing other teams mid-match and being far too cocky for his own good. “Why do the kids always emulate the idiot idols?” I mentioned to the group as we walked, “Uh you had quite the following if I remember correctly,” Annie chortled with a wry grin. “I wasn’t a little shit like the ones today,” I snapped back, “Oh Suuuuure, you were MUCH more mature at that age…If I remember correctly you kept spamming a taunt emote over Miggie till Unsung brained you in the last match of the quarterfinals in Tokyo,” added Steph. “Well that was mid-match and we were already up 2-1….and I forgot to turn off sticky keys,” I replied, much to my dismay I was met with a plethora of eye rolling.

Something caught his eye as he waited for a cloud of his breath disappear. He looked up and saw the girl he had accidentally touched those weeks ago. He felt something click inside and the coldness went away, replaced with worry. He quickly jumped up, pulling off the gloves. He began to reach out to the person, before stopping. He pulled back as she turned towards him.

""Excuse me, do you have a problem?"" she questioned, impatient and annoyed.""

""No, no,"" he stood up, ""Are you okay?""

""Nothing! Now just..."" Al swiped out and barely caught her hand before she pulled away. He felt the emptiness that he had already accepted flood back into him. He could tell by the look on her face that she had the worry he had felt.

"[WP] After Wayne Industries cuts one too many trees down, a new menace arrives to Gotham. One greater than you or I could imagine. He calls himself the Lorax and he speaks for the trees.",TheRabidNarwhal,"Gotham is a hard place to live, but things started to get even worse after one day when the Joker had created a wooden trap to finally kill batman. Two days later the Joker was found brutally murdered, yellow hair clutched in his broken and bloodied hands. 

About a month after the Joker's demise Wayne Industries released a new product known as the ""Thneed"" which was apparently a thing that ""everybody needs"". Soon the cutting down of the trees was interrupted by what the workers could only describe as a god of the forest, a very angry god at that.

On one cold night Batman stood on top of a tree as he looked down he saw the new villain, the one that had managed to kill his nemesis. He leaped down from the tree to begin the inevitable fight against the thing. The orange creature turned to face the bat of Gotham, its grayish blue eyes shining with defiance.

In a voice as majestic as the wind it spoke ""I am the Lorax and I speak for the trees!""

"[WP] After Wayne Industries cuts one too many trees down, a new menace arrives to Gotham. One greater than you or I could imagine. He calls himself the Lorax and he speaks for the trees.",TheRabidNarwhal,"Batman towered over the orange and yellowish creature that stood near him, his masked face drawn into a scowl of disapproval.

“You’ve left Gotham in shambles, Lomax”. Batman breathed heavily, spit flying from his mouth. “I think it’s time for you to leave.”

“It’s Lorax you idiot, and I think it’s time to teach you a lesson!” The furry creature yelled, flying at Batman in a whirl of fur.

Batman swatted at the creature like he would a pesky mosquito, but it was too fast. It leapt above him with the swiftness of a cat, it’s arms and legs a blur as it snarled past Batman’s face.

“I speak for the trees and you’ll pay for what you’ve done!” The Lorax screamed, it’s bushy face flush with anger. “Now you’ll feel the wrath of all the displaced animals and know the pain of a cut down tree!”

Batman chuckled at the seemingly cute creature as it sprung high overhead, it’s razor sharp claws outspread like a fan of knives falling from the heavens.

“You’re like a little ball of fur, its so adorable!” Batman said haughtily, loosing his composure as the creature fell towards him through the air.

“Adorable this, bitch.” The Lorax hissed as it swiped it’s razor sharp claws through Batman’s neck, severing the flesh in a clean, viciously deep cut.

Batman stumbled and toppled over dead. The Lorax nimbly sauntered over to Batman’s lifeless body, and carved a word into his forehead, the blood running freely down his face like a red candle that had been lit for far too long.

“There’s a new motherfucker in charge Gotham!” The Lorax screamed as it grabbed it’s butt, levitating upwards into the air and fading into a cloud.

A crowd of onlookers gathered near Batman’s body, their fear at his death littering the words and phrases that they shared to one another in whispers. They stared blankly down at their caped crusader, pondering the execution they had witnessed. A new question formed in their collective minds, a question that would haunt them for the rest of their days.

The streets are all haunted by pigeons and crows,  
And the sour smell of urine fills everyone's nose.  
There the Batman is fighting the Lorax.

""You fool,"" said the Lorax, leaping into the air,  
his stumpy frame covered with bright orange hair.  
""How can you claim to serve Justice, you dud,  
When all of your toys have been paid for with blood?  
They clear-cut the rain-forest by the hectare,  
but you get your share,  
and that's all you care.""

Bruce Wayne, now exposed as the Batman, stood tall,  
and he said, ""Listen Lorax, that's not it at all.  
It's my right as an owner to profit and take  
what is rightfully mine, for my dead parents' sake.  
It's my duty, in fact, to put profit above  
all else, for the benefit of all whom I love.  
I am the master of workers, you see,  
who need to have jobs, and therefore, need me.""

The Lorax jumped off of a building with grace,  
and caught a Batarang just an inch from his face.  
""Stop lying to me and admit that you are  
just a playboy who's taken his hobby too far.  
Your power fantasy seems like plenty of fun,  
but another mass extinction's already begun.

""Don't lecture me about fishes and trees,""  
Batman said as he landed on one of his knees.  
""I deal with the most pressing threats to humanity,  
like drug use and theft and homicidal insanity.""

""You beat people up just to feel like a man,  
you don't do what's right, you just do what you can.  
You punish criminals, when you pick your fights,  
for endangering others, or property rights.  
Your targets are people society fears.  
Your true victims are voiceless, so nobody hears.""

Then the Lorax flew into the dark, smoky heat,  
leaving Batman without any villain to beat.  
That night, Bruce Wayne brooded up high in his tower,  
wishing only for more and more personal power.  
He vowed to catch Lorax and lock him up tight,  
as if shutting him up would make the world right.

"[WP] Viewpoint of a girl who loves her father, The viewpoint of that fathers love for that girl. She is an A.I in a synthetic body and doesn't know and he is dying.",ThickDiggerNick,"Today I am twenty five.  The same age my pops was when I was born.

When I come down the stairs he is in the kitchen.  The whir of the fab on the oven buzzes blurs in to the sound of him singing.  When I get to the foot of the stairs I see him.  He is wearing mom's old apron.  Smears of butter stripe its front.  Flour dusts his cheeks.  He is holding a wooden spoon that is crusted with cake mix.  And in to that spoon he is singing.  The song is familiar but I can't quite place it.  Upbeat and jolly.

'Ooh, Isabelle.'

He stood when he sees me.  Red surfaces on his neck and spreads over his pale cheeks.  I wish he hadn't seen me.  

'Happy birthday!'

He holds out his arms and walks towards me.  

'I'm a bit buttery at the moment.'  He lowers his arms and instead he kisses me on the cheek.  That's him all over, there's always a way around the problem.

'Half a century.'  His mouth wavers in to a smile.  There is a sadness that always curdles his smiles on special occasions.  I think that's just the kind of person he is.  He never surrenders to happiness.

'Thank you, dad!  Where's my tiara and wand?  Come on, I've been up for ten minutes now!'  I check my imaginary watch before clapping my hands.  'Chop chop!'

His smile loses its pessimism then.  Retrieving his wooden spoon, he starts singing in to it again.  I join in;  we are both tuneless and pitchless and loud.  Joyful.


The cake sinks in the oven.  I told him not to keep opening the door but he assured me it would be fine.  His confidence inflated as the cake survived further inspections without caving.

It wasn't until right at the end.  I hear him bang the oven door shut and rush in to the kitchen.  Cake is on the floor, broken into smouldering chunks.  He is scraping a bowl of pink icing in to trash.  

'Dad!'

'I know, I know Is.  You told me that would happen.'  The spoon hits the trash can with a metallic clank.  

'I'll go to the bakery later.'

I am so surprised to see him give up that hot tears sprung in to my eyes.

'Don't cry, Is.'

When she cries she is reduced to a small child again in my eyes.  It's hard not to weep with her.  Her mother wept when she knew she was leaving us.  I saw how it broke Isabelle, to keep her own tears inside while her mother cried on her shoulder.  I promised I wouldn't put her through that.

Once I have tidied the angry mess I made she sits at the table and I tell her I am going to get her gifts.  As I walk behind her, I grab her by the throat, my forearm restraining her chin so she can't bite me like last time.  

There is a flap of plastic in that hard to reach spot, the one you can never itch yourself, just below the shoulder blades.  I flick it open and disable her functions.  Her head hangs limp, a waterfall of chestnut hair curtailing her face.  This was how she was twenty five years ago.  Model 5-A12.  The Isabelle chip.  I remove that not.  Pinching it between my fingernails.

For a moment I stop and hold the little chip on my palm.  A grey square, no bigger than my little fingernail.  Gold strips running along the bottom.  All of that data; her voice, her motion, the rhythm for her heartbeat.

Sometimes I forget she isn't human.  Her breathing mechanism is remarkably unobtrusive.  Her eyes flicker when she is thinking.  She bites her lip when she is nervous.  For every upgrade of her we have made, from child to teenager to adult, she has always retained that sense of humanity.

Now, I have to leave her.  My lungs are shrunken and bobbled.  Tumours pushing on my ribs, making my back sear.  It hurts all over.  That's why I dropped the cake.  I couldn't hold it anymore;  it hurt too much.

Inside an A6 piece of bubble wrap I place the chip.  Folding it over, I wrap it as carefully as I would have done her gift.  She is still sitting beside me.  Prone and lifeless.  The house is so quiet.

On the envelope is the return address for the manufacturer.  For a moment the thought flits through my mind; of it being formatted.  Everything about her wiped.

The thought of her death is more painful than my impending own.

Licking the envelope, I seal the fold and then call for a mail pick up.  If I don't do it now, I might change my mind.  And that would be unfair on Isabelle.  A parent's love takes many forms, I think.  I am just protecting her.  That's all.",wharmpess90

""Tommy's as happy as a dog can be,"" Adrian answered, voice alight with humor, ""but shouldn't you be more worried about how I am?""

""Right, you too,"" Samuel joked as he leaned down to pet Tommy, Adrian's drug-sniffing golden retriever. ""Come on in, you two.""

Tommy wandered through the door, tail wagging furiously. As soon as he entered, he stopped in his tracks and turned his nose to the air. *Sniff, sniff*. An instant later, he bounded into the kitchen.

Adrian turned to Samuel. ""Uhh, anything you want to tell me?""

""No?"" Samuel responded, puzzled.

Adrian followed his dog into the kitchen, where he was inspecting a cabinet. Samuel was close behind.

""Are you sure you have nothing to hide?"" Adrian asked again, suspicious.

""Oh!"" Samuel said, seeming to only now realize Adrian's implication. ""No, no. I mean, why would I-- heh heh...""

Adrian opened the cabinet, and in it was contained a bag of dog treats.

""Damn, there goes the surprise,"" Samuel laughed, as Tommy snatched the treat bag and trotted happily into the living room.

""Hey, Karen,"" I begin, poking my head around her half-open door, ""Sorry to interrupt but I've got a mistaken brief here--it's a clear code 7, should probably go to a whole other sector, I think""

&amp;#x200B;

Karen looks up from her monitor, gazing at me over her spectacles.

&amp;#x200B;

""Do you have the brief?""

I hand her the folder, and stand silently as she flips through it, then types briefly into her keyboard.

""Nope, this was intended to go to you--no mistake about it. Do you still want to claim a code 7?""

""Well, yeah, Karen, I mean--""

""Joshua!"" Karen yells, cutting me off, and her assistant pokes a head in from outside.

""Yeah, Karen?""

""Can you serve as witness to a code 7 mediation?""

""Sure, Karen?""

&amp;#x200B;

""Karen, I really don't think a mediation is necessary, like I was saying, this brief is actually--""

Karen cuts me off again with a raised hand. ""Let's go by the book, here, Aubrey, ok?""

""Sure thing, Karen"" I say, sighing, then back up and sit in the other chair in her office across from her desk. Joshua enters, wheeling in his chair too, swearing softly when a wheel gets caught in a rut in the tile floor before settling down on my left across from Karen.

&amp;#x200B;

""Ok,"" Joshua says, taking out a small tape recorder and turning it on.

""This is Employee 562, serving as a witness for a mediation between Employee 202 and Employee 423 regarding Code 7: Request for Re-assignment Due to Personal Investment in Target on brief number,"" Joshua pauses, trying to read the packet now lying on Karen's desk upside down.

""On brief 98240."" he finishes.

""It's 68740"" I say, just as Karen says, ""68740""

""What?"" Joshua says, looking at us

""You're reading the brief upside down"" I say, just as Karen says, ""That's not the right brief number. It's 68740""

With a sigh, Karen looks daggers at me, for some reason, then picks up the packet and turns it around so it is facing Joshua and says ""Brief number 68740.""

""Oh!"" Joshua, says, getting it, ""Correct--a code 7 mediation on brief number 68740""

&amp;#x200B;

""Great."" Karen says, shooting Joshua a wry look. ""Now Aubrey, why does this brief satisfy the requirements of Code 7.""

""Because it's me. I'm the target. Can we be done now?""

""Wait, this is you? It doesn't say 'Aubrey Nickelson' on it, it just says 'Snappie'.""

""Yes, I'm sure it is me, Karen, it's at my house, when I lived there, addressed to my nickname as a child.""

""Hmm, I don't know, Aubrey, I think if it were you it would say your name."" 

""Jesus, Karen, Seriously? You know that sometimes they use akas if they don't know the true name-of-record. What, did you think that there was somebody out there really named 'Snappie'? What are we, averting a turtle or something?""

&amp;#x200B;

""Aubrey, watch your tone please, let's try to be civil."" Joshua pipes in, chest all puffed out for contributing.

I give Joshua a dry look before turning back to Karen.

&amp;#x200B;

""Karen, look--this is aimed at me as a kid, which is a clear code 7. So you should reassign the brief to another department. It'll be a small hit to your numbers, but this was exactly what code 7 was designed for--so employees wouldn't be asked to personally avert their loved ones.""

""Give me a moment to think, here, Aubrey.""

""Sure, whatever,"" I say, leaning back in my chair. I'm not sure what there really is to think about, but if Karen wants to play some weird power game then more power to her. 

Karen types for a moment on her computer, and in the reflection on her spectacles, I see she's pulled up my personnel file. She reads it briefly, then turns back to me.

""Do you really want to call a Code 7 on this? I'm not sure there's really that much investment here.""

""What? Seriously, Karen? It's me! I'm the target. How can we seriously be still discussing this.""

""I'm just saying, will it really affect you, you know, considering"" Karen says, trying to backpedal,

""Karen--would you really want to aneurysm your younger self out of existence, huh? I can't believe you're fighting me on this.""

Karen huffs for a moment, looking at me, then says, ""Fine. I'll reassign it to Brett. Happy?""

""What! Karen, no, it's got to go out of the department. It's not supposed to be personal, you know.""

""Oh, I'm sure Brett won't mind""

""That doesn't make me feel better about this, Karen!""

""Ugh. Aubrey, no offense, but this is such a waste of time.""

""No offense! Thats not how that phrase works, Karen. 'No offense, but figuring out how to most respectfully murder you as a child is really not worth the effort' isn't a thing you can say."" 

&amp;#x200B;

I glance over at Joshua and nudge my head like, 'you going to get in on this?' but all Joshua does is look first at Karen, then at me, then do that head tilt, thin-mouthed look that says, 'ehhhh' and then turn back to his notebook.

&amp;#x200B;

""I've got it!"" Karen says. ""I'll just do it right now.""

""Wait, what!"" I yelp, as Karen begins typing.

""Karen, that's wildly inappropriate!""

""It's fine--don't worry about it!"" Karen says, waving a hand at me as the other works the number pad. 

""Karen, really, could you please--"" I cut off as she visibly hits enter. Involuntarily I inhale sharply, wondering irrationaly if it will hurt when my younger self kicks it. After a moment, though, I exhale and touch my face, then look at my own hands.

&amp;#x200B;

""Huh."" I say, looking around. ""Maybe it... wasn't me?"" I posit warily.

""Guess so,"" Karen says. 

&amp;#x200B;

""What a successful mediation!"" Joshua says, reaching over to pick up the recorder. I give him a look that clearly says 'are you out of your mind?' but he's too busy preening to notice. 

&amp;#x200B;

""Oh!"" Karen says, ""Misplaced a 1""

""Wait wha--",heretotrywriting

With a slap, Candice drops the new target's briefing packet down on my desk.

""Errmm--what."" I come fully awake with a start, picking my head up off my hand and furtively wiping away the bit of drool at the corner of my mouth. 

""New target."" Candice says, watching me with a smirk playing about her lips, smacking away on a piece of gum, as always.

""You know you shouldn't sleep at your desk like that. It's unprofessional.""

&amp;#x200B;

""Yeah, well, you shouldn't sneak up on people. It's rude."" I fire back. Candice sniffs emphatically, then with a rattle pushes the mail trolley on past my cubicle and down the other rows of desks.

&amp;#x200B;

After a quick head-shake to banish the last remnants of sleep, I pick up the new briefing packet and read the 4-coord off the front. July 8th, 1974, at 8:23 a.m., somehwere in... Jersey, if my mental GPS is right? I do a quick search for the lat-long-elevation and get out a real address. Yeah, it's at a small cross-street in Clinton, NJ.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm halfway through entering the coordinates in the kill box when I do a touble take. Clinton? I grew up in Clinton. I rack my mind, trying to remember--yes, until I was 9 years old we lived in Clinton, NJ, at...

&amp;#x200B;

I look back at my main monitor. Surely not. 

&amp;#x200B;

For the first time I actually open the packet. Normally I only need the 4-coord; given the time, lat, long, and elevation, the system does all the rest--plus, it really is better to pretend they don't have faces and lives before you bump them off--but this time I need to. 

&amp;#x200B;

Name: Snappie

Cause: Inferred Low Utility Constituent

&amp;#x200B;

That plus a bunch of other jargin I don't understand about validations and checksums and liability and such. I honestly stopped reading after ""Snappie."" My childhood nickname

&amp;#x200B;

Carefully, I erase the partially completed 4-coord from the kill-box before stepping away and exhaling. Then I run to catch up to Candice, packet in tow.

&amp;#x200B;

""Candice. Candice!"" I yell, as she goes to turn a corner.

She turns around and rolls her eyes aggressively enough to be visible half a hallway away.

""Wait up a sec."" I finish my awkward, too-hurried-to-walk-but-too-embarrassed-to-run shamble down the corridor and grab the edge of the cart, proffering her the packet.

""I think you gave this to the wrong operator. Maybe whole wrong floor--point is it definitely shouldn't go to me.""

&amp;#x200B;

""No I didn't"" She says, not taking the packet that I'm proffering weakly.

&amp;#x200B;

""How do you know, Candice, you didn't even check."" 

""I'm sure.""

""Oh, for christ's sake, Candice, this obviously can't go to me. It's a clear code 7!""

""Don't know what to tell you. Maybe you should just toughen up.""

""Really, Candice? Really? I should toughen up? Well maybe you should go off in a corner and choke on your gum, ok?""

Candice gives me a vindictive smile and pulls the cart roughly out of my hand so that I stumble and catch myself on the wall.

""Oops. I'm sorry. Were you leaning on that?"" Candice says with mock sympathy, eyes flashing.

&amp;#x200B;

""Screw it--I'll take it up with Karen."" I turn and head back down the hallway.

""Your funeral,"" Candice calls after me, ""Corporate values people here who can really cut it, you know, not people who go complaining to their boss all the time""

&amp;#x200B;

I flip Candice the bird as I turn the corner, something I'll probably regret later in the form of chewed gum on my chair or something (Candice was never big on subtlety) and head towards the stairwell. Four bland, gray flights later, I pop out on the execs floor and head towards Karen's office.",heretotrywriting

Summoned at a time where pacts were forged and stories were created. I was a force to be reckoned with, a demon of the inner second circle, the only one able to face Azhamut when he was young and brave, the Silent Bird in the clouds, the Devourer of Winds.

I have been here a long time and therefore most people would agree with the fact that I have owned the right to live here peacefully. If anything I’m probably the reason the city exists. First it was a forest with a hut, then a small village and now it’s a damn city. Not a damned city, mind you, I don’t piss where I sleep. I’ve done my share of mischiefs and harrowing but I don’t really see myself going back to hell anymore. Things have changed down there.

For the past 30 years I’ve set up shop in this attic and I don’t plan on moving out for a few decades at least. When pesky human pests come up my way I usually don’t need much. Some scratch noises, a lamp flickering at night or even a broken glass if it comes to it. They all run away. But not with those ones.

I should have seen it coming.

They were all wearing black. Their faces were gloomy and their smile fishy.

Just a bunch of younglings I thought.

But the next day, they started singing.

Was it the bass guitar ? Or the wild drums ? I woke up in some sort of trance, covered up in sweat. The music was calling to me, to my very being. The three of them then picked up their mic. They knew the true words. I appeared in the kitchen, revealing myself to those lower life forms for the first time in 147 years and 6 months.

Their stupefaction could have been funny if we weren’t in a middle of a ritual. Unfortunately there are rules that I can’t escape, it’s part of the game. I just thought that everybody had forgotten how to play.

They seemed afraid, amazed and surprised. I do that to people. However, the silence slowly turning awkward, I allowed myself a bit of theatrics with a red mist emerging from the ground. Quite unoriginal, maybe, but efficient nonetheless. I was about to use my deep charismatic demonic voice when one of those improvised summoner (the drummer if I recall correctly) left out : 

- That is so cool.
- Told you it would work ! replied the bass player.
- Guys, we are literally the best ! to which they began to high five each other.

I’m not used to mortals ignoring me but I’m still bound by their summoning. This highly sucks. I try to refocus the conversation.

- DO YOU KNOW WHO I AM ?
- Arzabeck ?
- IT’S PRONOUNCED AHARZABECK !
- It’s the title of our album, I think we know how to pronounce it.
- BUT IT’S MY NAME !
- Well it’s also our album’s name now.

It is often exhausting to deal with humans.

- WHAT DO YOU WANT ?
- They look at each other.
- We don’t really know, we din’t really plan this thing out.
- We didn’t think it would work.
- Tommy found this old book at his nan’s place, we thought it would suit with our theme.
- YOUR THEME ?!
- Yeah, we’re a band.
- The Lunatic Slayers of the Final Day.
- We’re not completely set on the name though …
- If you have any input …
- We said we don’t take outside inputs Tommy !
- Hey, he looks like the real deal, might as well ask him !

I just want to go back to my attic.

- But don’t worry, we won’t bother you any longer.

That’s good.

- We’ll send you back home right away.

This nightmare was already over, it had been refreshing but … Wait.

- HOME ? WAIT ! WHAT DO YOU MEAN, HOME ?
- It’s at the end of the book, how to send you back to hell.
- NO WAY.
- What ?

They stared in doubt - and the look infuriated him.

“I met him five years ago - he follows me, but never close, he doesn’t bug anybody and nobody bugs him”

They weren’t listening, and one of them tried to interject, “but I heard-“

He snapped back -“nobody say nothing!” He cringed at that sort of speaking, trying to snap them to attention, “I’m not asking you, I’m not asking for anything, I’m telling you , nobody bugs him.”

He eyed the three greasy dirty teens carefully across the campfire to make sure they got his point.

“He lives by three rules, follow a good man, help out, and keep your mouth shut”

They were listening now. 

“out there, he’s been out there on the edge of the wastes, for five years.”

“How do you—-“

The old mans patience was gone, “-Shut up, you’re done talking!”

“, you’re listening now, you leave buddy alone, “

The kids eyes were fixed - the teens were listening, for once.

“He’s done more for me than anyone else out here, saved my life 5 times in five years - why? Because I’ve been a good man, and he chose me to follow, and in those five years he’s only said one thing.”

“What’s that?”

The old man stared him down, “I already told you dumb ass - follow the good man, help out, and don’t speak”

He paused a moment

“Maybe you could do a little more of that now , too right?”

The three teenagers were relaxed now, fire, food and weed helped. They nodded with a careful glance back at their old man, the one they all knew better than to disrespect.. 

The old man knew then that word would get out, even though it was time to move out, buddy was off limits.

He released  the PTT switch - and a few short minutes later , the teens left, and he spoke to the radio again, “they’re gone,” and the radio chirped once, in response.

Buddy heard. He knew, too, that word was out- and there wouldn’t be any harassment any more.

The story the old man told to the three kids was true, but he left out the one detail about that one time when buddy actually spoke.


The old man himself had been half wild, raving into a dead radio, chattering endlessly as if anything in the wasteland could listen, but the solitude would only press back harder.

All he had was chirps on the radio, that responded sporadically , only enough to communicate that they were listening.

Soon buddy , like an elf in the wild, always there, but never seen, dropping off gifts and tools, for discrete drops of goods and services had been just a listening ear back then , a companion to save the old man from crossing the waste only said that one thing, and he said it a time when this old man needed a voice , something or someone to let him know he wasn’t truly alone in the wastes. They had each other , and the terms were simple.

“buddy follow good man, help out , never speak”

What the old man didn’t add, was that the lone voice he heard on the radio that time was the voice of a grown man, but with the timidity and hesitation of a child. Deep, stuttering, and had also added the qualifier - “Daddy says”

It’s a broken world , and how a mute man-child  could survive in these wastes is nothing short of a spark of hope,.

A miracle ? No, but a spark of hope - maybe

I was using the Push-To-Talk radio that I found a year ago yet again in the hopes that someone, anyone else was out there. Yet like most nights, there was nothing but static as a response. The thing was either totally useless, or I really was the last person alive.
The apocalypse had happened a little over 5 years ago and the only thing that had kept me alive was at first, my unit, until ultimately they fell one by one. That was three years ago and I was still surviving due to the training I had received in my first couple of weeks of BT.
Hard to belive I'm only 25. I was 15 when they went door to door looking for able bodied men to fight for their country, The great USA. Except it's really not so great now that there are no countries, that and most continents are minefields of killer radiation. ""The bombs bursting in air"" that is how it goes isn't it?
Most of the animals I have to hunt or trap have normally been affected in some form or another, be it extra limbs or just pieces... missing...
But here I am night after night talking to empty air in the desperate attempt to keep my sanity. Honestly who the hell knows if that's still in tact. The sun was getting low and I decided it would be best to get some shut eye.
12:13 A.M.
*HhHhZtttZsss*
""Hello? Is anyone out there? Please... anyone? I just found this damn radio hoping someone else would be there... I thought I heard something earlier but it was really fuzzy. So please if anyone is there my name is Ana and I would really like some company.""
I was awoken by the initial buzzing of the radio that was supposed to happen when someone else was talking. I sat in disbelief through Ana's entire message. That was of course, the very end where she sounded extremely desperate, almost like she had lost hope that anyone else was there. I was here, who knows how far away, listening, dumbfounded at her message, her voice might have been the best sound I've heard in years.
""Hello. This is Sargent Alexander, Ana I read you loud and clear. How the hell are ya?"" I said, loud and clear into the microphone.
At that moment I heard the girliest squeal before she quickly recomposed herself and said, ""Sargent, I had just about lost hope that anyone was left, but hearing your voice, I mean wow...""
""Ana, all my friends call my Alex, and well, you might be the last other person left so please..."" I responded, struggling to maintain composure myself, it was a real life human being other than myself, I couldn't belive it. Maybe my sanity was worse off than I had thought, oh well a voice is better than constant static.
""Alright Alex, where are you? I'm currently hiding from one of those big black horned beasts on 27th and main. In an abandoned pharmacy that's been picked clean, so I wouldn't mind a little help if you could."" She sounded frantic, like she was in genuine trouble, but her other actions didn't really add up. The squeal, the desperate call for help it didn't really fit. But she sounded sincere enough, and I hadn't fought any of the ""spikers"" in quite some time. 
So I grabbed my solar paneled army issued Jeep and the rest, is as they say, History.",sircoolnos

"[WP] The police has had a sudden shift in tactics.

I open the door to see my dad and brother shoving all the drugs and cash in duffel bags. 

""What's going on here?"" I say in a gruff voice.

My brother John looks at me, rolls his eyes, and says sarcastically, ""Well what do you think dumb ass? The cops are on our ass and there's no way in hell they are going to get their sweaty little hands on my beautiful coke if I can--"" John stops to listen to the loud booming sound coming up the stairs.

Dad looks at me ""Do you know what that sound is Jack?"" ""No fucking clue Dad but I think we should get to moving."" 

As soon as we return to packing everything up, the door is obliterated by a gigantic gorilla. 

My Dad, John and I are all knocked on our asses with the wind blown out of us from the force of this beast of an animal. When I look again the gorilla has two cops behind him, they hold him with a dog collar style contraption. ""COPS RUN!"" I struggle to yell to my dad and brother. 

I get up and make way towards the balcony to jump. The cops threaten to release the gorilla on my ass if I refuse to comply. *Yeah right, you're gonna release a gorilla on me? That's a bluff if I've ever heard one.* 

As I sprint to the glistening balcony, I am about to jump to take the fire escape down to my emergency car. I look down and see a glimpse of orange. I finally make my way down to get tackled by this--this-- orangutan? 

The enormous orangutan screams a loud war cry, and with his cold dark eyes stares me down. Just before he is about to strike me, I let out a wimper knowing that this animal will kill me if he strikes. He backs off, I guess he knew he had dominance over me? As he turns away from me, I run away and don't believe my luck until an attack dog bites me arm and won't let go. *Fuck, how did I get away from a gorilla and an orangutan but I get attacked by a dog? Well, shit.*

[SP] You waved at a blind man. He waved back,SeventhSubCircle,"I decided to ignore it and just went into the bus. The bus was silent, there's no one.  I was completely alone, I put on my earphones and listened to music through out the whole journey. I accidentally fell asleep. Suddenly the man I saw before woke me up from my slumber telling me that I have arrived at my destination. I didn't know how he got there as I'm sure that I was alone. I stepped out of the bus at my usual stop, at a park a couple of miles away from my place. I noticed that the blind guy stepped out too, I thanked him for helping, the moment i shook his hand I noticed his fiery red eyes and walked away slowly. As I was walking to go home I heard his whisper "" I always aid you"" it was disturbing, I couldn't stop thinking about it. As I was walking along the dirt path towards my house, the path seems different, somehow the path had change, the big old oak besides the lake was nowhere to be seen. I couldn't help but panic. Then, I heard the whispers again I couldn't tell what it was trying to say but after a few seconds I found  the path that can lead me home. Arriving at my doorstep, I found my old music box that was given to me by my great aunt. It has been years since I've seen it. Only then did it hit me, that I had released a creature that was trapped in that box years ago. The creature will only help the one who possesses the box. That is the moment I realized that the blind man was my demon and there's something out there that's trying to take it away from me.

[SP] You waved at a blind man. He waved back,SeventhSubCircle,"“Rise and shine sweetie!” His mother sang as she flung open his curtains. 

The sunlight spilled through Wayne’s window, dressing his room in golden hues. Warm September sun glared over his face as he rose out of sleep. 

“Jesus!” Grabbing his temples, he clenched his teeth as the sting of a thousand needles surged their way across his brain. “They’re getting…. worse….. they’ve never been …. *this* bad.” 

Ever since Wayne Earl Hendrix was born he’d suffered from random onsets of chronic migraines lasting from seconds, to minutes, to hours. Some were slight—others brought him to tears. But ever since four days ago, the pain of his migraines had increased to unbearable heights. A high risk brain surgery was his only saving grace to this reality—but in the meantime, as his family and the doctors discussed other medical options a strict regimen of pills and dietary restrictions helped him get through his days. 

“I’m so sorry honey, you heard what the doctors said. Your body just has to take some time to get used to this new prescription. Come downstairs and take your pills. I’ll fix you breakfast.” His mother left his room, humming her way down the hallway—in her usual morning pep. She could never truly understand his pain. 

Wayne inched out of bed as slowly as his body would allow him. As he sat upright in bed peering through his bedroom window he noticed his neighbor Mr. Johnson swaying back and forth in his rocking chair, staring at him from next door.  If anyone else were rocking back and forth staring into Wayne's bedroom every morning, he would have been thoroughly creeped out—but  Mr. Johnson wasn’t staring—he was blind. Every morning the old man asked his wife to help him up to their bedroom window so he could sit and feel the caress of the morning sun. 

To Wayne, sometimes the thought of trading his migraines for blindness didn’t seem that bad. 

By the time Wayne finally made it into the kitchen, his migraine had disappeared. *My Girl* by The Temptations was blasting on the radio as his mother tried to sing in pitch. The scent of turkey bacon sizzling on a skillet filled the room, and prompted his stomach into a growl. Wayne took a seat at the kitchen table. On a small napkin his pills and a cup of orange juice sat waiting for him. He made sure to gulp each one down quickly to avoid the bitter residue they left in his mouth.

“I’m almost done with your bacon honey,” His mom chirped as she danced in place.

 “Is dad home?”

 “No,” the word fell quietly from her mouth a if she’d rather not say it at all, “still at work.” 

“I haven’t seen him since after the electrical box accident.” Wayne said with a sigh. 

His dad worked for an electrical plant company that helps run their city’s power structures. Four days ago an electrical fire broke out at one of the headquarters where he worked--well at least that’s what his mom told him. “What kind of job makes you work 24 hours a day every day?” 

She stood in silence tapping her foot no longer to the beat of the blaring song, but now tapping frantically as if trying to hurry the conversation along to another topic. 

“Also why hasn’t he called?” 

Silence. 

“Mom?” 

“Honey, I don’t know. Let’s not worry abou----,” 

As she tried to finish her sentence, a high pitch screech erupted from the radio. The sound, piercing to the ears, filled their four cornered kitchen. 

“Turn it off!” Wayne yelled over the noise. He could feel a migraine coming on. 

His mother hunched over the counter top had dropped a whole carton of eggs on to the kitchen tiles. Frozen she stood with her fingers jammed into her ears and her white house slippers, now soiled yellow from the broken eggs. 

Wayne bolted to the radio and unplugged the chord from the power socket. 

“Mom, are you alright?” He asked observing her face, which was frozen, wincing in pain. 

She stood—unmoving. 

Wayne reached across the countertop to grab a roll of paper towels. “Here, I’ll help you cle--,” 

“No. Go to your room,” she uttered in a voice like stone. 

“What? The floor is a mess!” 

“GO NOW!” Her voice now amplified like the sound of thunder in a tunnel. Her small body still frozen in place. 

Not wanting to upset her even more, Wayne backed away slowly. Plus, he was sure with all this stress a migraine would make its appearance any second now.

 “Wait! Did you take your pills?” His mother called as he was leaving the kitchen.

 “Yes, of course. Mom, are you sure you’re okay?” Wayne asked one final time not knowing if he should be worried about her or if this was another one of her dramatic episodes. 

She stood, still hunched over the countertop with her fingers in her ears. The only moving part of her was her foot which had resumed its tapping—but now, much more systematic. Much more—robotic. She didn’t reply. 

Wayne shrugged his shoulders and continued up the steps. Trying to shake his mother’s weird behavior from his mind. As he approached his room, he held onto the door frame. He felt another sensation of needles as it pulsed at the base of his neck. Groaning he inched his way into the room and to his bed, plopped down and began breathing in and out deeply. 

“One hundred…ninety-nine…ninety eight....” He mumbled starting his breathing exercises. The light from the window was shining in his eyes making it hard to find any relief. 

“Eighty-two…eighty one….eighty….” He mustered the strength he could to push himself of his bed and across the room to close the curtains. A second wave traveled across his forehead. He stood clenching his teeth baring down on the curtains for support incase he started feeling dizzy. As he was pulling the curtains closed he noticed Mr. Johnson still sitting at the window in the same position as he was an hour ago. Wayne rolled his eyes, though He knew Mr. Johnson was blind, right now he didn’t need some old man figuratively watching him as he suffered in excruciating pain. 

“Get a new hobby ya old fart,” Wayne muttered under his breath as he waved his middle finger and smiled sarcastically knowing Mr. Johnson couldn’t see his disrespect. 

The old man turned his head as if to check his surroundings--then waved back. 

Wayne’s stomach turned cold. 

“What the...?” He waved again to see if it was just a coincidence. 

This time old man bent over to his side to get what looked like a white poster board with sloppy thick writing scrawled across. Though the migraine was getting increasingly worse from standing in the sunlight, Wayne stood squinting his eyes determined to read the sign. It read:

&gt;WAYNE. YOU ARE IN DANGER. MEET ME HERE AT ELEVEN TONIGHT. NO ONE FINDS OUT. AND WHATEVER YOU DO, DON’T TAKE ANYMORE PILLS. 

Wayne stood frozen in place feeling nauseous as his fingers trembled; a third wave of needles danced behind his eyes.",nkota_

[WP] An introverts version of Hell.,bobthebiscuit127,"No, no, no. This can't be happening. Why am I in Hell? Lava sucks.

""There's one thing, though,"" said Satan. He grinned maliciously.

""Hell is personalized.""

Then I fell down a chute and into a dark room.

As I got up, lights started to turn on, revealing a playground. I was eight years old again, surrounded by people but feeling so lonely. Wait- cartoons! Cartoon characters have lots of friends, so I should make friends like cartoon characters do. So I marched up to a kid and asked, ""Do you like chocolate? Because I do. And if you do, then we can be friends. But if you don't like chocolate we can still be friends.""

She just looked at me strangely and then laughed. 

She laughed.

That was just the beginning. 

There was a whirlwind of pictures and videos and moments from my life. One was from when I was fifteen and had reluctantly sneaked out of my house to go to a party that a friend had said would be wild and I ""had to go there or else I'll drag you myself."" Of course, when there, it was painful. People were blocking the door, so I couldn't leave.  

Then there's the awkwardness of the times when I was on the subway going to work and people would just start randomly talking to me. Why do I have to relive all of this? What have I done in my life?

""Please,"" I sob, ""don't do this to me!""

Suddenly, Satan was in front of me again and he was cackling evilly. ""Oh, it's not over yet. It'll never be over.""

A last image appeared. With an intake of breath, I realized what it was going to be.

""No, no, please, have mercy-""

But it was too late. My hand brushed with a stranger's.

""NO!""

I buried my head into my knees and cried until I was too tired to force the tears out of my eyes. Then, I looked up. At least it was over.

""I said, it'll never be over!"" And with a snap of Satan's fingers, the room around me whirled and went all white.

When it settled down, I was back in the playground. It dawned on me: this would go on for eternity.

I look at the handsome man who is talking to me, not quite understanding why I am suddenly next to him, floating over the Black Friday shoppers flowing into the big department store.

&amp;#x200B;

He nods down at the crowd, finally thinning as they spread out to the other aisles. None of them had even noticed my body underfoot; minds laser focused on their discounted toys and tvs. I suddenly understood. ""I knew working retail was going to kill me.""

&amp;#x200B;

He knowingly nods. ""It happens to the best of you. You try to be nice to these parasites, honoring their expired coupons, repeatedly answering their inane questions.

I was, unfortunately, not surprised. The devil continued, ""The big guy set-up a no win game for you mortals. You went to church for awhile, I'm sure you remember the gigantic list of sins that he set forth."" I nodded along with him as he continues, ""I have a proposition for you.""

&amp;#x200B;

Time flows backwards to minutes before I was trampled to death. I am once again standing inside the front doors with only moments until our midnight opening, shoppers foaming at the mouth ready to get inside. I gesture for their attention.

&amp;#x200B;

""Folks, folks, calm down. I have an announcement."" They calm only the slightest, but their noise volume does decrease. ""I have to let you know that there is only one 60"" television going to be available tonight at the $99 price point. The others that were supposed to be available were not received in our shipment.""  The crowed surged forward with renewed screaming about ruining their Christmas. Chants of ""let us inside""  resounded. I looked at the big clock on the wall, about to strike midnight, and pulled out my keys.

&amp;#x200B;

This is where the magic happened last time.

&amp;#x200B;

Just as I turn my key in the door lock, the clock magically rolls back 20 minutes. With hellfire gleaming in my eyes, I give the crowd a devilish smile. ""Sorry folks,"" I explain, ""we can't open the doors until midnight. You'll have to wait just a liiitttttle bit longer."" Shrugging my shoulders as if there is nothing I can do, I turn my back to the crowd and laugh.

She/he? and satan apparently were a thing?

Meh,,,, not the strangest thing I've seen down here. Earlier today I had been a nurse assisting a surgeon but no matter what he did I purposely made it impossible to save the poor dude, I guess the dude wasn't real after all but surgeon Dan sure as fuck wasn't having any of it...
anywho I was essentially balls deep in this dudes sternum trying to stop his heart from ripping itself apart. 
I shit you not this guy,,, holy shit. ""Come on man hold yourself together, we can beat it."" 
I laughed.

I suddenly became aware of my own internal dialogue that was going on and I put a stop to it. As amusing as it was I don't wanna be in earshot of whatever horrible thing satan and our instructor were trying to do. I looked at my pitchfork, which was really closer to a smartphone/A.I.//bottle/opener/doorstop... etc... my tasks list pops up. 

I'm supposed to go visit one of my childhood friends.
The name stuck out because we were pretty close up until about 2nd grade, but then she wronged me. Stole my 64 pack of crayons drew on the walls while no one was home. I got the blame, couldn't figure it out till one day I heard a bit of gossip around the lunch table about this badass that broke into someone's house and drew on their walls. Guess who the badass was...
Figures she'd end up here, but I didn't think she was too terrible a person so I decided to try to think of a way to be nice in a way while still achieving my goal of ""torture"" I mean shit,, Its psychological torture plain and simple but, like..  
Screw justifying it I'm already in hell.

I needed to think...

I wandered through the halls aimlessly, I had tasks a plenty but today has been dragging on for what feels like a few weeks. I could've swore it was tuesday when I got here... I guess time moved differently here, shit almost everything here isn't what I was used to. Theres a 3D elevator. Doesn't actually move yet it gets you where you need to go. Sometimes you feel the movement, sometimes you don't. 

I came across a door, the name posted on it was
Ryan barney the third. 
The third? Wonder if the other two are also down here... 
I was considering wandering till I found them before realizing that this is hell, a place probably  designed so that I could wander for eons without actually finding anything. in fact thinking about it, it was amazing I managed to get anywhere.

The checklist says that the last visit was over a century ago. But the strange part was that it was jeffery's tag that was last logged,, time definitely wasnt the same down here. 
As I began to think of mr. Unassuming again
He appeared almost out of nowhere, but I knew it was an illusion, he probably just stepped out of an elevator. 
The dude looked like he wasn't really here, I mean like he was here physically. Just not all here mentally,, spiritually maybe? 
Maybe more illusions? I call out to him,
He looks up from the ground at me, with oddly grey eyes. I could feel his tiredness ebbing off of him. It made me feel a bit off,, 

""Hey, it's you.""

She leaned back in Her royal purple leather recliner, filing Her claws with a sharpened tibia. Presumably from her enemies, but... I could be wrong.  

“It’s a FEMUR, babe. I can read ya mind. Focus.”

Shit. That’s a sharp fucking femur. 

“Isn’t it?” She laughed and her jaw unhinged, revealing tiny screaming men trying to claw their way out.  “Oh fuck.. *slurp* unruly little dickheads.”

“So, uh, boss.. am *I* ... going to eat too.. or..?”

“Girl I said FOCUS!” 

Her claws gripped the back of neck like a protective mother cheetah grasps her cubs in her mouth. Her grip was surprisingly comfortable and warm, considering they were femur-sharpened. 

She plopped me in front of a massive display of monitors, each focusing on someone around the city. Kind of Truman show-esque but everyone was Truman. 

She leaned over me, Chanel Chance eau de parfum tickled my nose.  Her voice directly in my ear, soft and measured yet stern and loose. 

“What you’re gonna do is throw interference to everyone you see her. Do you see H6 up there? He never throws his garbage away, instead he insists on littering almost daily. Change his mind.”

We watched H6 for nearly 10 minutes. Her warmth enveloping me as if She were behind me and next to me simultaneously.  I wasn’t sure what she meant until H6 threw a cigarette butt out his window. Suddenly an urge over took me and H6 crashed into a utility poll. The crash led to a massive explosion which then led to a 6 acre brush fire. I sat there stunned as several of the remaining monitors flashed wildly as their respective Truman’s were either injured in the accidents or otherwise affected.  It all happened so fucking fast and I began feeling fuzzy and sick. 

“I can’t do this anymore! I don’t... he didn’t deserve all that!” I realized I was shouting to no one in particular as She had exited without warning. I grabbed my face and began sobbing. 

“I told you it wasn’t fucking easy.”

It had only been a month since I had arrived in hell, but my results were amazing.
“Are you, Satan the King of Hell, one to say that?” I replied with a smirk.
“Dude, this isn’t even on my level anymore.” Said Satan with a shudder, “Man I had some expectations for you as a former retail worker, but you didn’t blow then away, you nuked them from orbit.”
“You go on reddit too much!” Is how I wanted to retort, but as I was in a quite jovial mood (and as a former slacking retail worker) I let it pass.

Included in my report was the following new punishments I had included:
The teenagers were to be placed in a eternal lecture on the history of toilets. The boys would occasionally have an hallucination of obtaining a computer and booting up their favorite game, only for it to explode as the game finishes loading. The girls would instead see a phone that had a message from their crush saying “I love you” and then receive another message saying “lol jk”. The phone would explode as well, but the girls were usually too depressed to notice. Of course, to keep the original and sub punishments fresh, we would mind wipe them so they could experience it allllll over again.

The politicians, slave owners, and drug dealers would be worked as starved slaves, while being being continuously laughed at by apparitions of all those they had ruined the lives of. Of course, these apparitions would have fabulous clothes and would be eating all the favorite foods of the politicians right in front of them. Nothing so complicated here, as it is simple but effective.

For vain celebrities, they would spend their days walking down the street, hoping for recognition, only to have everyone ignore them and shoo them away. Another simple one.

For normal adults, I had a plethora of punishments. Watching your wife give childbirth continuously while having your mental fortitude lowered, being under the illusion your terrible spouse is finally leaving only for him/her to return, and waiting in an endless line for the toilet only for it to break down once you reach the end (of course, the recipient has diarrhea) are several of the ones I came up with.

For rude customers however... Oho, where do I start? I made a particular punishment I call “Rollercoaster of life (hell edition)”. First I would have them repeat a life with no memories. The first ten years they would be abused terribly by their parents. Afterwards, they would be adopted and live a happy life for another 5 years until their new parents died in a crash. Next 5 years would be a downward spiral of drugs and booze only for them to recover. They would obtain a dream job, their ideal spouse, their dream house, and everything else they want in life. For 20 years they would be happy. This is what I call, “The ride up the hill”. But after this, hell would slowly descend on them (hahaha nice pun right? Right? Oh never mind...). First, they would be fired from their job for something they didn’t do, then their spouse would leave them for someone obviously worse, and their dream house would go up in flames. I would make every cause for destruction preventable and noticeable, causing massive regret to the victim when he realizes he could’ve prevented it all. This is “The drop”. Afterwards, homeless and without a penny, the recipient of the punishment would be forced to work retail for 50 years, experiencing all the problems I had to face from them. Does that feel good you self entitled-
“You wrote a whole yards worth for the customers huh,” Old, red and evil said as he ruffled through the parchment that rolled around his office and out of it.
“What can I say?” I said with a sadistic grin, “I hated retail work a lot”.

I sit here with Lucifer telling him about my experience working in retail. I tell him about Jason, he was a good guy and the only thing that made retail somewhat bearable during the first few years. He would show me memes and had lunch with me sometimes. I liked Jason. Then I tell him about Douglas. Douglas was the boss that fired Jason and made everything a living hell. He was never on my side and often bickered on the customer's side even if they were incredibly wrong and he knew it. He bothered me during lunch break telling me he did not hire me to sit around for 36 minutes when I have a 35 minute lunch break.

I tell him about that lady with the kid. The kid was running through the store and knocked things on the ground which gave Douglas an excuse to yell at me. I tell him about the lady who could not find the jeans even though I showed it to her around five times. And how she would scold me when I said ""Do you really need me to show you again?"" After showing her the fifth time. She then stormed out after calling me, and I quote ""A rude little fucker who works retail and will never be anything.""

Then I tell him about that fat fuck, who trampled me carrying the tv on sale for 70% off. He asked where the tvs were and smelled like he had not put on deodorant for at least a week or two. He tried talking to me and asked me to show him where the televisions were gassing me further. He then waddled on my body pressing it into the ground. He sent me here and he was rude beforehand.

And there's no way 95 percent of the population think that killing all strays is a good thing, I'd like to see some evidence of that statistic, because if that was true there would be no animal shelters or rescue organizations; it would be legal to run around your neighborhood executing animals on sight if 19 out of every 20 people approved of it.

Killing is wrong, period.  A living, thinking, feeling creature has just as much right to live as any of us, and I find it hard to believe most people reading this wouldn't agree with me, at least when it comes to strays.  If you're going to go after strays in particular, give them homes to go to, don't just grab them and kill them; I can think of nothing else so heartless.

Beavers in Patagonia however are non native and causing irreparable damage to the ecosystem and should be actively culled. Humans are terrible for the environment which is why environmentalism is a fundamental part of my political beliefs (which probably aren't very different from yours actually). Domestic cats have owners so it is 100% their responsibility for the animals they kill. Which can be prevented by putting bells on your cat and keeping them inside sometimes. I've actually called people out on this before and told them to get their shit together. 

I wasn't trying to say 95% of the population thinks killing strays is good, I was saying probably at least 95% of humans think that killing is unacceptable. Also, it actually is legal to kill strays, a guy that works at an animal refuge told me hiself. If I were to turn in the cats slaughtering the local songbirds (which I'm very attached to btw) they would just be locked in little cages, transported, and euthanized. All of which I consider to be much more stressful to the animal than a well aimed gunshot.

Hey, if you think killing is inherently bad and live your life so I completely respect that. I actually just left a small Jain village where everyone is basically vegan and some people don't even eat root crops because it kills the plant and disturbs ground animals. I basically haven't eaten meat in about a month. 

But nothing anyone could ever say will convince me killing is inherently wrong. 

I'll kill an animal to eat it or if it's causing ecological destruction, best case for both reasons at the same time. I do it as humanely as possible, and would never kill an animal with high consciousness levels (primates, cetaceans, elephants). It's always sad, but I've never once felt like doing so is *wrong*. Is it wrong for a lion to kill an antelope? I fundamentally don't consider myself any higher than an animal, simply because *I'm not*.  ",lal0cur4

But that doesn’t say much really, because B12 is already given to animals to raise their levels for humans when they eat them, and D is artificially added to milk. So no, the only other option isn’t to hunt for food, the other option is to not eat animals in the first place. Also, just so you are aware, the majority of poor people already live with nutritional deficiencies. Humans are omnivores, in that they can eat meat for nutrition, but it doesn’t mean we have to.

It was the classic kill or be killed scenario, as I had the thought I must've grinned because satan was now grabbing me a set of keys and a pitchfork.
""I know it's pretty stereotypical and all but y'know the big guy upstairs apparently has a very specific taste in aesthetics"" 

I took my pitchfork and keys down to what I had been informed was the conference room. It was weirdly professional, definitely wasn't like some of those movies where everything in hell is just a  mass of fire, flames and flesh, which made the pitchfork seem extra strange. 

I sat down at a table with 14 other people who also accepted the devils offer.
They looked like I would expect and I stuck out like a sore thumb, a small blonde woman compared to Jonny B. Thuggins. 
There was one other person that stuck out, he was a slight man wearing a bland grey t-shirt and black cargo pants, it was so unassuming it was a tad unnerving. 

We sat for a short while before this tall gorgeous brunette woman hurriedly walked in. I could almost hear the jaws hit the floor as she made her way across the room. 
Upon getting to the front her shape morphed, slowly shimmering slightly before it felt like I had blinked the sleep out of my eyes but suddenly this short portly man was standing at the front of the room. I could feel the general mood of the room go from surprise to confusion, almost anger. 
The short man spoke up.
""I am your guide, I will explain how things work here."" 

After a while, we had been informed about the workings of hell. It ran on the negative, a supposed attempt at balancing the universe. Because of course the more good, the more bad. 
We were the ones that needed to counter all the good and we had endless supplies to do it. I even had the ability to shapeshift and control vivid hallucinations to provoke the negative out of people. 
The worse we were down here the better the universe ""could be"" based on our upsetting the scales. It was an elegant system I guess. and despite my short life as an atheist I was suddenly sure that there was a higher power in the universe, he/she may have been a dick but... he/she's a real dick... so theres that.

It was also made apparent that being new I'd purposely be put on with people that had ""wronged me""  didn't quite know what that had meant but it quickly became apparent that wronged has a very broad and vague definition. 
I walked in on my first appointment, each room had a potentially infinite space packed into a 3foot by 3foot closet, each closet had an iron door with a pad of paper stuck to the front,I eyed the paper.

I open the door. Doc. Tom. Is watching in horror as a father cradles his dead newborn violently shouting at the doctor.
I couldn't hear a thing before I entered, but after I walked in the room changed, doc. Just kinda stared, this was normal for him I could tell he was expecting all kinds of horrible things to happen when the room solidified again.

Something in me felt a mixture of sympathy and excitement, I seen an opportunity to both be a bit less intense while still getting relatively the same result. I changed the room it was night in the mountains, it was chilly, and the doc. Didn't have a sweater, he walked towards a town into a small café one I had worked at and knew very well. 

He enters to find me, smiling behind the counter. 
A bit of confusion crosses his face, too normal?
He walks up cautiously I could tell he knew something was up. 

""Hello, and good evening sir. Did you need anything in particular?"" 
""Uh yes, where am I?"" The confusion seems to be causing him distress. 
""This is the browntown downtown café, we're in downtown browntown."" 
""What?!"" 
""Yes sir! Best coffee in town."" 
I lean in a bit too close ""I heard it's your birthday, free coffee and croissants for those celebrating,"" 
I wink for effect. 
""It's not my birthday..."" 
""Sure it is"" 
""No it's not"" 
""Well whens your birthday?"" 
"" august"" 
""Well its August"" I say gesturing to a calendar I basically pulled out of my ass.
"" 25th?"" 

I hand him a croissant and point to a table, ""yep, happy birthday! I'll be right out with the coffee."" 

I never showed up again. I left him sitting waiting for a coffee that will never come. 

I left the room. Looking at the checklist, 8/10
Pops up beside my name on the room. 
Almost as good as Mr. Unassuming with his 9/10
Suprising considering the vast difference between our individual methods.

**a week(ish) later** 

""you've maintained a 7/10 average on all your appointments, yet the majority of what you do is just leave them waiting one way or another.""
the question felt weirdly personal despite the vagueness of it. 

""I worked customer service for 15 years my guy, I know all to well that most people get triggered when they've had a bad time and then get told to wait for something perceived as good. I.e. a coffee, or cake."" The explanation wasn't good enough, satan raised an eyebrow at me.

""That doesn't seem too bad"" 

He looks at me again with an intensity I'll never get used too. ""Not in and of itself but I've somehow managed to  end up following Jeffery around, the guys fucked up in the head. I've walked in on a lot of dead baby themed rooms, the dude is deliberately traumatizing them like you asked but I feel theres a level of thought to it most of us don't realize.
Even though he's almost hyperfocused on the dead baby thing he too preys simply on the feeling of helplessnes."" 

"" yes I like his work."" He says nodding as he eats an apple.

""The reason both our methods work well together is because his work is more up in your face, deliberately trying to pull the negative, its literal torture for people, to feel completely helpless when your confronted. It's some fight or flight shit but his simulations remove the options to fight or flight."" 

""Yeah, he knows what he wants and he'll do whatever it takes to get it."" He says nonchalantly like this is just another tuesday.

""In doing so he's teaching helplessness, theres nothing they can do about the situation and the people know that, so they freeze. A sort of numbness that comes with the expectation of pain.""

"" Yeah, I've broken many a person before"" he talks about this with a lightness that I could never wrap my head around. Satan must've been a literal psychopath, able to control the emotional response to things. Once seen him chip a chunk off his horn playing with hellhounds, dude was more vain than even arachne (interestingly enough she was real, the story got a bit warped, it wasn""t the gods that killed her it was a man... attempting to rape her, she had been stabbed and bleed out, she to choose to be a torturer rather than a victim)

""Yes well I'm playing one of the psychological sides, they're expecting to get fucked with y'know? And thanks to Jeffrey they're expecting to be made to feel helpless in the worst ways, I just make them feel helpless in some less worse ways. 
Which leaves them with that big black cloud of paranoia hovering at the back of their minds."" 

""So then you know what your doing it's not just that your being a shit torturer that's really lucky..."" 
He strokes his chin as he appears deep in thought for a moment before realizing I was still there. 

""Well get back to it then.""

So I did, I began my rounds again...

It's been four months since I stepped through that mirror. Four months exploring this place that looks like home, sounds like home, and even smells like home. But it's not home. Something's just a little off. Everything is a little too, how do I say this? Sterile.    

*You see, I'm from New York. I'm also in New York. But this ain't my New York. No fukin' hobos rattlin' their cans and spittin' on ya. No goddamn murder cabs cuttin' ya off at every light. I said before it smells like home. I was lyin'. The buildings and homes smell more or less the same, I've always been in the nicer ones anyway. It's the fuckin' streets. They don't smell like piss, yah know? The accent is gone too. I find myself thinking, speaking and writing like one of these happy-go-lucky fucks from here time to time. THE FUCK IS THIS PLACE??*    

In the relatively short time I've been here I've noticed a few things. No one seems to be sick, though there are many hospitals. I guess they don't charge you an arm and leg in this place. The kids are all in schools, no one is hanging around on the block. They must have good parents. There doesn't seem to be any crime, but I can't find any police either. I've seen some of these peoples' TV shows, they're not all that different from ours. Mostly love stories though, usually of clueless men and beautiful women. I suppose some things don't change no matter where you are. No ads either, that's kind of weird. I think I could kind of get used to this, it doesn't seem too bad. Everyone seems happy. People who claim to be ninety, or even ninety five don't look a day past fifty, it must be the healthcare, they don't seem stressed either. Strangely enough, no one is late for anything.    

*If ya ask me, it's all bullshit. Where I'm from everyone's fuckin' late. They got nuthin' to do, but they're always late and ya betta get ya ass outta the way or that Gramma's gonna clock ya with her lead purse. There's no fun to be had here. Sappy TV lovey-dovey garbage. Where's my murder shows, where's the crime, the sex, the PASSION? Either way I need to find a way out of here, this place is so boring, I'm gonna lose my mind!*    

Yes. I like this place. The longer I stay, the more I feel I belong. Pure strangers smile at you in the street. They'll greet you like they've known you all their life. This is amazing. I could see myself settling down here. Finding a nice girl and falling head-over-heels, just like the movies. I'm at the job center now, I see it now, I'll gently slip into this society and it'll be my home.    

*OUT OUT OUT! I need to get OUT of this soulless hellhole. It's been eight whole muthafukin months and I've got nowhere to hide from these fuckers! They're all too nice and borin'! I've tried going back thru the mirra but I can't! Just solid glass. I smashed that shit outta anger but now I definitely have no way back!*    

That's it. I've found my job here, I've found my love. I'll be here forever and I can't wait for the rest of my life.    

*That's it! I've got nothin' here, I'm all alone! I'll be here foreva! I can't wait for this to be over! Fine then!
If I'm stuck here, it's gonna be on my terms!*   
 
My name is Joey Applesauce and I'm going to love it here.  

*My name is Joey Applecider and I'm aboutta fuck this place up!*    



""HE'S CRASHING, QUICK GET THE CART!""

A short while after the panic died down in the room, the attending nurse came to see the family.

""We weren't able to drain the excess fluid in his brain from the lobotomy in time. I'm sorry to inform you, but he has only a short while left. I believe he would like for you to be there.""

Upon seeing the patient, the family asked if he could be sedated to relieve the pain.

""Yes, but he will have lucid hallucinations, are you okay with that?""

His wife nodded. ""I think Joey would like that.""",extrabaddy

"[WP] It turns out that our universe is actually the twisted dimension of another, saner plane of reality.",Martin_Phosphorus,"There is an entry point between universes, a metaphorical door that bridges ours with theirs. It is a bamboozling concept to fathom, for this door is anywhere and everywhere; the roads leading to it are, of course, infinite. One could find it as easily on the dark side of Pluto as in one's flower garden, after taking a left turn at the rosebush - that is, with great difficulty, especially for organic beings whose brains and souls are limited to C-space. And, by some stupendous miracle, if one were to stumble across it, they would be greeted by two beings that look almost exactly alike yet could not be more fundamentally different.

They fancy themselves ""Guardians of the Universes."" Really, they are just fancy doormen that bicker endlessly.

""Your universe is too complicated,"" Doorman A complains. It has an actual name, but there are no symbols in this language to convey that satisfactorily.

""Yours is too simple,"" scoffed Doorman B. ""And too small.""

""Why measure a universe by its size? Better to judge its character. Yours, for example, is twisted and evil.""

""Meaningless words,"" B sneered. ""How can gas and dust and galaxies be evil? They are just accidental collections of atoms.""

""Aren't all things?"" A pointed. ""By that logic, nothing could be evil.""

""That is true,"" B admitted. ""However, I would like to rectify your first claim - after all, *we* are not atomic...""

""Don't be pedantic - you obviously knew I meant all things beside us. Anyway, my point was - your universe is simply too much.""

""And yours is much too simple,"" B chuckled. ""But I'll humor you. What is 'so much' about my universe?""

""Everything!"" A exclaimed. ""Your gravitational constant is too low, your strong force too strong, and just look at all your dark matter!""

""What's wrong with it?"" B demanded. ""I am rather fond of my dark matter, thank you very much.""

""Why, by the multiverse, does it not interact with the electromagnetic force?"" A asked incredulously. ""That's a little absurd, isn't it?""

""What's absurd is how few elementary particles yours has,"" B retorted. ""Only one type of graviton?""

""Now you're just being nitpicky.""

""Well, how about your electron? It's only ever unsplittable, even when orbiting a nucleus.""

""As it should be! What is the point of being able to separate their wavefunction into four quasiparticles? That is over-complicated and unnecessary.""

""Seems we'll just have to agree to disagree about whose universe makes more sense,"" B shrugged.

""Oh, it's clear to *me*,"" A muttered. Then, it grew pensive: ""Though, I wonder: what if yours is not the worst that it could be?""

""What do you mean? Are you just freely insulting me now?""

""What if there are universes far greater in scope than even yours?"" A asked eagerly. ""Thrice the number of particles, maybe even a new fundamental force or two?""

""Again, with that drivel?"" B huffed. ""I told you: if there were such a universe, we would be aware of it - and no doubt, having equally fruitless conversations with its Guardian.""

""Maybe,"" A said doubtfully. Both doormen fell into the silence of their own thoughts, neither one uttering the daunting possibility that perhaps such a universe did exist - and it was beyond even *their* comprehension.

I rolled a big joint, much bigger than the last time. Lit it, and started inhaling. It was gone in a little over a  minute. Everything felt the same. Angela flickered her fingers in front of me, but I was dull and kept looking in one direction. It took a while but  I started giggling. Everything was so funny. 

""Ready?""-she asked.

I nodded with a grin, still half giggling. She turned the lights off then on, continuously. She ran to her laptop and turned on creepy laughing, horror sound effects and what not. My heart started racing. Demons started appearing and embracing me. Again, I was scared shitless. I looked around, and they phased to me, they haunted me. But i was too fast. In a blink I was already across town in a dark alley. I walked out, and felt like everyone staring at me. My phone ringed. It was Angela.

""It worked. It worked.""- she was ecstatic.

""I am afraid.""-i whispered.

""Don't be.""-she tried to calm me, -""They're just a mirage.""

""I know, but it feels real. I can feel my heart in my throat.""

""Just focus on my voice. I will guide you. There is a shooting at the centre.""

""Ok, I'm on it.""

I walked back into the alley and started running, navigating in a instant. The feeling was amazing, time slowed down, and I was able to grab the guns from the robbers, throw them in the river and get back to the same alley. 

""Did you do it?""

""Yes. But I dont feel so good. I see them again.""

""I already told you, they're just a mirage, a bad trip. They can't hurt you.""

""I kno...""

""You know NOTHING!""- a dark voice said. Something started pulling my legs. I was trapped, and breathing fast. 

""Noo!""- i exclaimed and ran off dragging asphalt with me. I stood up, and night turned to day. I was across the globe. I dropped to the ground and fell asleep.

"[WP] For as long as you can remember, you have been able to be inside of other people's dreams alongside them. However, lately everyone you see in their dream has tried to kill you.",Theinternetisdumb,"It's not voluntary. I've been able to do it for as long as I can remember, but it's really more of a curse than a blessing. I close my eyes, and I'm transported to another world, where everything is just so vague and surreal. Where anyone can be a god. It's really starting to sour me on this species.

As a child, I developed insomnia for fear of appearing in another sociopath's paradise. Red streaks painted my eyes, dry as bone. And when I couldn't take it any more, the world faded around me and there I was, face to face with my next thief of destiny.

Most people regard the imagination as something beautiful and capable of great things, but I know that's not true. I know what people are capable of when they don't have to filter out their darkest fantasies. It's like reading minds, but so, so much worse. I thought it couldn't get any darker, until it happened.

I've always been more of an observer. Forced to watch your rape and murder fantasies, but never butting in. A night stalker, lurking in the shadows. But I never had any control over it. So when I was trapped inside of a burning building, I just had to power through the pain of my skin melting. I wish I had known before that those scars would follow me.

Deformed and depressed, I tried to maintain my ghost status, but people started to notice me. They cried and screamed, and they called me a monster. It hurt. Before I had the chance to explain my situation to them, they were already coming after me with any weapon they can muster. So it's only normal that I'd want to protect myself.

Fear is the only way to cleanse our minds of the perverse. Your sick minds will no longer haunt me, because I am your god, and you are along for the ride.

"[WP] For as long as you can remember, you have been able to be inside of other people's dreams alongside them. However, lately everyone you see in their dream has tried to kill you.",Theinternetisdumb," The next night I ended up in a black void of a dream. Black voids normally belong to either an exhausted Dreamer who can't manifest a proper Dreamscape that night or it's the start of a nightmare. You might think nightmares would be horrifying or simply too terrifying to stay in, but honestly nightmares are based around the Dreamers personal fears, not mine. I've seen rooms full of dolls, spiders, dummys, and exs. Dreamers who are afraid of falling, drowning, being buried alive, or the 'going to school naked' dream. Yes, that's a real thing. However, this black void was simply that, a black void. Nothing was manifesting and nothing was falling. That's when I heard the laughter. Children laughter. I know it's not something to be scared of, but something about the laughter of children has always creeped me out. Even more so when it comes out of nowhere directly into my ear. Next, small smiling lips with yellow stained lips surrounded me, now carrying the laughter. As the mouths came closer they started to snap and bite at me. Not enough to break the skin, but enough to leave a mark. In the midst of all the laughter and biting I see the child hanging in the air above me looking down at me with raised cheeks indicating a smile. Either he just got told a good playground joke, or he was laughing at my pain. I didn't really appreciate that.   
    
  ""Alright, I'm done."" I say as a aura of blue light started to emanate from my body, it stunned all the mouths, which had thankfully stopped laughing, and held them in place. ""I've tried talking with you and I've given you the pleasure of both smashing a replica of me and torturing the real me. But, I'm really done now."" With a snap of my fingers, for dramatic effect, the black void suddenly shows itself to be nothing more than the inside of a larger than life card board box as all four walls fall to the ground. ""Either you tell me why you're doing this, or I will make it my personal agenda to deal with you everytime I see you in a dream."" That's when I get a good look at his face for the first time. Up close. His mouth is missing. All that's there is smooth skin.   
    
  ""*Why are you in all my rooms?*"" I heard in a quiet whisper from one of the mouths hanging in the aura. Then they all start to speak at once. Not one saying the same thing. ""*Why won't you leave me alone?""*, ""*Why won't you get out of my room?"", ""When will I see my friends again?"", ""Why do I only see white rooms when I dream?"", ""What are these strangers doing to me? Mom! Dad Help!"", ""Why can't anyone hear me? I'm moving my lips. But I can't speak! Please! I can't move. Why can't I move! HELP! Mom! Dad! Please!""* We hang there in stunned silence. Me at his words, and him at the words he's able to hear himself speak. ""*Why won't anyone help me?""*   
  I gently lower us to the ground. I raise the color blue into the air of my Dreamscape. I think over what I've heard carefully to decide what to do next. ""I'm going to do what I can to help you kid, but I need you to work with me and not to attack me or anyone else you see, okay?"" He nods his head slightly. ""Okay, here's what we need to do...""

"[WP] For as long as you can remember, you have been able to be inside of other people's dreams alongside them. However, lately everyone you see in their dream has tried to kill you.",Theinternetisdumb," The power to mingle and merge into someone else's subconscious mind is a power I hold with reverence. I would never use it to hurt others in any form. So why is it that, lately, when I submerge into someone's Dreamscape I am almost immediately attacked? In the past week I've been almost skewered by unicorns, had super heroes use their powers to try to make me into paste, and black voids suddenly develop child sized mouths, laughing, smiling, crusted yellow teeth that then try to eat me alive. Like little piranha, but creepier.     
    
  I've had this power for as long as I can remember, but have only been able to 'consciously' use it within the past three years. However, about a month ago I was in a child's dream, children are always so imaginative, and simply watching them explore their Dreamscape is enthralling and there's always some nonsensical but charming tune in the air that it has always one of my favorites, when suddenly the child turned and started to stare *at* me. Now that has happened a few times, but the Dreamer usually simply moves on or acts like I belong there. This child however stared on directly looking into my eyes. Within a blink they were directly in front of me and with a quiet whisper I heard ""You don't belong here"". Next thing I know I'm awake in my bed with cold sweat running down my back.     
    
  Let me tell you *that* was odd. I've seen dreams of people being murdered, to being murderers themselves, to murdering a younger or older version of themselves, and beyond, but I could always tell it was simply part of the dream. This. This wasn't wasn't part of the dream. The kid hadn't been talking to some imaginary goat that they saw through their own eyes. No, they saw *me*.     
    
  I didn't really sleep that night. I simply stayed up until the next night, and when it rolled around, I slipped into a peaceful slumber and was in a bright colorful world that smelled vaguely like the color blue. It'd make sense if you've seen the things I've seen, but let's just compare the smell of blue to the most beautiful day you could imagine with a little bit of every wonderful symphony ever written all coming together perfectly. That's the how blue smells. As I strolled around I suddenly heard the sound of hooves charging over cobblestone, turning around just in time to jump back from being skewered by a charging unicorn. I fell onto my butt and watched as the horned horse reared back in attempt by the rider to turn it around only for it to get caught in some branches. I hadn't noticed them immediately, but now that I was on my butt, stunned from the sudden charge, I had ample time to look at them. To put it plainly, it was the child.     
  ""You could have poked a hole in me kid."" I said, grunting as I slowly got off the ground. With a thought and in a showy shimmer of light I summoned a chest high wall, that matched the cobble stone path, in front of myself. In a Dreamscape I hold just as much power as any Dreamer. To be put simply. Limitless. The only one with more power is the Dreamer them self.     
  ""*You don't belong*"", the wind around the child ominously carried the words without the child them self speaking.   
    
    
  ""*I can do that too. Now, what are you doing""* I carried my words on the wind right back at them. That caught their attention and they stopped struggling to control the now completely tangled unicorn. ""Now, are going to explain what you mean or just struggle with that toy horse?""     
    
  The child's face took on a confused expression when they suddenly realized they were on the ground with one of those sticks that would normally have a stuffed horse head on the end. The reigns were wrapped in a mess around their legs. For a bit of added effect, I left the horse head the same as the horse they had just been on. Minus the pointy horn. Unexpectedly, the wind started to shriek, starting around the child and moving outward quickly. ""*Get out getout getoutgetoutgetout GET OUT!""*   
  ""No."" I stated flatly, and within another blink, a glass jar was placed over the child and their screaming winds. ""Now be quiet or you'll wake the Dreamer."" I watched as the wind around the child started to turn into a literal dust storm inside the jar, but the jar didn't budge. Turning back to the Dreamscape I left the child to deal with their 'temper-tantrum'. I spent the rest of that dream with no further issues. Just wandering and enjoying the blue. I saw the Dreamer in the distance and while what was going around them looked wonderful, I didn't want to risk disturbing them in case the child somehow got out of the jar. Dreams like this were very rare. Precious.   
    
    
  The next night I saw the child in another dream. The Dreamscape consisted of tall glass buildings, with an orphanage, a cemetery, and a mansion on the outside of the city all in a row. In the distance I saw various distinct shapes smashing through buildings all gathering around some dot that was spewing some black lasers. Definitly a super hero dream. I pulled a golden stop watch out of the air and watched as the second hand ticked away. It was less than a minute when I suddenly heard the wind carrying a familiar sound I was really getting tired of hearing.     
    
  ""*Getoutgetoutgetoutgetout!""* I turn to see the child flying at me as quickly as they think they can go still kicking up as much dirt as before even though they were at least a mile above the ground.     
    
  I threw the watch into the air where it faded out of non-existence, ""Didn't I leave you under a jar?"" I replied ""What are you even talking about? This isn't even your dream. If anything, with all the noise and mess you're making, I'd say *you* are the one who should 'get out'."" With another gust of shrieking wind all the specks in the distance started to stop being specks and quickly began to gain form. Within the next second a giant fist connected with my face. Well, I say 'my face' in actuality I had simply moved myself and my watch to a taller building for a better vantage point. It'd also be more accurate to say 'my puppet' got less punched and eviscerated. ""You got that out of your system? You're ruining a Dreamer's dream. Could you be a bit more considerate?"" Within another blink a tiny purple light floated in the air between myself, the child, and the heroes who all floated in the air. A slight glimmer and the purple speck shot out a tiny beam that made a giant explosion in the far off distance appear with a giant mushroom cloud in its place shortly after. It then shot off in the opposite direction and the Heroes flew after it.     
    
  Super heroes are very simple. The goal is simply 'stop the big bad' and what's worse in a world of super heroes than a tiny speck that can make giant explosions? The child had a stunned look on their face. Peering up at the explosion, and then staring back at me. ""Don't worry, I didn't actually destroy anything. That speck is even less real than this Dreamscape. All it does is create fake explosions that look big, but aren't really [there.](https://there.now/) Now, do you want to talk, or are you going to do your little-"" With another shriek of wind and the per usual ""*getoutgetoutgetout*"" I woke up in my bed. No cold sweat this time. Just the annoyed expression I felt growing on my face. As I sat there pondering the dilemma of a child who refused to speak, but could still at least partially control a Dreamscape I could only conclude that...they were a child who refuse to speak, but could still at least partially control a Dreamscape. Not really much to work with, but I'd have to make due and make a plan for the next night. ",GenesisWriter

[WP] A superhero gets drunk and forgets they're not meant to show off their powers unmasked.,Yngvar_Stormblade,"There’s a time at a house party when the party is over, but no one has realised it yet. An odd stasis descends and quiet punctuates every conversation. Those who are standing hold their empty beer bottles and exhale, people seated pat their thighs and say sentences that start with “Well...”

The people who are at the party to socialise, have exhausted all conversation, those who came to find their life partner have given up and vowed to come again with a new, better personality. The only dangerous group of people at these events are those that came for the sole purpose of drinking, because their sub-party does not have a foreseeable end. 

This group had been protesting the lack of barbecue that they were promised. There was no lighter fluid, or wood or coal, or way to get it (the city was half-destroyed after all) and their protests were getting fiercer. 

The normally timid Verta had grown bolder and subsequently louder in fifteen minute intervals. Everyone surveyed their meek friend, who was only invited to these occasions out of pity and how she loudly waggled her finger in people’s faces and made several pithy points about various subjects. But it appeared that there was one subject she felt particularly strongly about.

PowerBro, resident muscle bound superhero had stopped the destruction of the city yet again against attacking reptilian-locust-termite armies and had saved the day. The party had quickly been cobbled together to celebrate the impermanence of life (yet again). 

Now someone had raised a final toast to PowerBro and it really set Verta off. 

“That over flexing dumb-fuck” she screamed , landing hard on the consonants of her words. A gasp went around the party. No one criticised PowerBro, he was a super-human that fought against evil. He had saved their lives repeatedly and most recently like an hour ago. 

“I mean come on dude...you’re going to wrap the attacking army in power cables? Are you an idiot? Now there’s no power in half the city...what a turd” said Verta as she continued chugging from the bottle in her hand. It was now that everyone noticed that she was drinking straight Gin. 

“I mean they’re pests, fucking talk to scientists and poison them you idiot” she continued, and her next sentence was unclear because she said it into the bottle while drinking. 

A loud voice expressed the concerns of the audience present. “Look it’s easy to criticise...But you’re just some waitress. Let PowerBro do what he does and maybe keep your thoughts to yourself?” The snide remark was cut short rapidly.

Verta turned the bottle of Gin she was holding into blue flame. Everyone could feel the heat coming off her. She pulled the flame from the bottle and held it hovering formless and radiant in the palm of her hand. “Y-You were...you were saying?” She slurred. “There are a lot of super humans pal...you’ll just never hear about us because we’re quiet and shit”. “...fucking politics” she added for no apparent reason. 

Everyone who was uncertain about their presence at this party had taken the drunken display of super ability as their cue to leave. They would discuss this on their WhatsApp groups as soon as telecommunications towers were back online. 

“Go you losers!” screamed Verta after them. “No one appreciates the real heroes”, she said sadly. Her sadness grew when she went to take a swig of Gin and realised she had set it all on fire.

The only group that remained around Verta were the confirmed drinkers, who were too drunk to be surprised by what was happening. And while other people were considering the politics of Verta was saying, they were hatching a very simple plan. They told Verta they appreciated her and the contribution people like her made silently in their every day lives. Would it bother her too much to do one last thing at the party?

Verta was only too glad to oblige, and that was the inception of the now world famous Blue Gin Flame Grilled Chicken Barbecue Ltd. chain of restaurants and casinos. ",TraditionalSorbet

The man thought nothing of it, simply taking oht a pen from his shirt pocket and writing the first name to come to mind. Of course the first president was the first name. He wasn't very creative, so he sloppily wrote it down, throwing the notebook down afterwards and walking off.

&amp;#x200B;

*Goddamnit*

&amp;#x200B;

My day always starts with my mother yelling at me to get up; nevermind the fact that my alarm would have sounded 15 minutes later anyway. Shuffling out of bed, and throwing on my uniform as fast as possible usually follows. Running down to grab some Orange Juice, and some toast is the only excercise and nutrition I receive on most mornings. I live a fairly average life.

I attend a private school in the rich part of town, and my mother works 2 jobs just so she can afford tuition. It's monotonous, but bearable.

While walking to school with my earphones in, I like to stop and admire the scenery. The birds, the sky, the trees; all of it. Today, my eyes happened to cross a strange sight. While stopping to admire the birds soaring through the air, I saw what seemed like a white book fall from the sky. It landed a few meters away from my feet

""What the fuck"" I mumbled to myself as I walked over to it

It had strange lettering emblazoned upon it, spelling ""LIFE NOTE"".

*Life note?* I wondered *Like the Death Note?*

I was a fan of anime so I was intrigued. As likely as it was to be someone else's property I slid it into my backpack and headed to school.

School was boring as usual, full of preppy nonsense and spoiled brats, but I deal with it for my mom's sake.

During Lunch my curiosity got the better of me. I took the said ""Life Note"" out and thought to myself ""So it's the opposite of the death note? Like it'll bring someone back to life?""

*Yeah right* I thought. *Who should I put in? Tupac? or Biggie?*

And then a random thought crossed my mind. Why not my favorite president, the one who shares my name? Laughing, I wrote down the name of George Washington.

...

""WAKE UP GEORGE""

*Another day* I sighed

I repeated my morning routine, but I had a little bit of extra time today, so naturally I turned on the T.V. and navigated my way to some CNN. I sipped my orange juice, and nibbled on my toast groggily.

Until my eyes fell to the headline of the current story. I woke up with a jolt.

""No fucking way"" I said under my breath

GEORGE WASHINGTON CRAWLS OUT FROM GRAVE? REAL OR IMPOSTOR?

I couldn't believe it. That notebook is actually a fucking Life Note!? How could this happen?

I couldn't comprehend the divine mess I had gotten myself into. I needed to test this more

I grabbed the Life Note and ran out of my house. Instead of turning to go to school, I made a sharp turn in the opposite direction. *There was something I had to do*. I crisscrossed through streets, and pathways; maneuvered around bikes and pedestrians while at a running speed. Until I finally made it.

&amp;#x200B;

ST. PAUL GRAVEYARD. *School can wait* I thought.

&amp;#x200B;

I walked through the rows of tombstones, and navigated the confusing architecture of the cement cemetery until I found the person I was looking for.

HERE LIES GEORGE WILLIAMS SR.

*I'm here dad*

Nervous, I took a pen in my hand and opened the Life Note. I carefully wrote in George Williams Sr. while picturing my father's face in my head. You see, my father died when I was 10, and we've been suffering ever since. *I,* no, *we* need him back.

I finished writing his name and waited, George Washington must have come to life immediately after I wrote his name right?

I waited and waited for what seemed like hours, and even checked if I had the right tombstone, but I did. I remember it as if it were yesterday. *This is his grave, it has to be.*

But nothing was happening.

I didn't understand, with tears welling up in my eyes I wondered, why isn't this working? The only reason it wouldn't work is if he was ali-

Wait.

"[WP] One day, as you’re walking home from work, you find a white “Life Note” on the sidewalk. Having seen the anime, you jokingly write “George Washington” in it. He’s on the news the next day.",beep_boop_warrior,"I wasn’t born to anything great, I live in a middle class family and my life is really just the same as everyone else. I’m sure many of you have had the same thoughts about someone you miss, maybe it’s a family member or a close friend, who’ve left in a tragic way. We still think about these people, but deep in our minds we truly understand they’re not coming back. Until, for me of course, today. 

I can tell you this, of course, I’d never thought it possible, but as I walked down the street back to my house, I saw what looked to be very much like a diary in appearance next to one of the sewer holes at the sidewalk. I’m sure anybody who’s seen something on the ground out of the ordinary picks these things up - like coins, money, wallets, basically anything can peak someone’s curiosity when its out of the ordinary in most people’s dull lives - so naturally, I picked up the book. It read ‘Life Note’ on the cover. 

 I opened the cover and on the side of the cover, it read ‘How To Use The Life Note for Dummies: If someone who has died has their memory and name embedded into this notebook, they will be brought back to full health, and their organs given more time before expiration. In addition to this, if you write a date, you can postpone the time before said person is brought back, meaning you can write the name of someone who’s currently alive, then dies before the expiration of the date. If someone who is currently alive has their memory embedded into the notebook, nothing will occur.’

Jokingly, thinking this was a prank, of course I thought up of the person who would be most hilarious if revived: George Washington. So, naturally again I wrote his name in the notebook, and forgot about it for the rest of the day, holding onto the book in case someone came looking for it. Who knows if there’s something important inside?

The next day, as I make my breakfast of eggs and toast, as I turn the television for the news on, suddenly from the other room I hear ‘... there’s a crazy man in Mount Vernon area in Virginia claiming to be a George Washington. Supposedly he bypassed all the security to the original presidents grave and defiled it, stealing his corpse. He’s currently under questioning right now. How horrible is that, John? Lemme pass you the mic...’ 

I’ll admit, I thought it was some crazy coincidence, but I connected the dots, and was so freaked out I burned the book. Not one of my best moments. But, now I can say that for certainty the real reason that George Washington is an immortal dictator of the current U.S. is because of me, and if that’s a bad thing, well at least I’m the only one who knows. I’ll sign back on in a couple years to fill you guys in, if you care.

That's can't possibly be right!

But one's gotta act. I stuff the tattered, off-white little notebook into a hidden alcove, grab my phone, and quietly hid myself behind a closet. The kids have just left for school (phew!), so it's just me and the robber. I was about to dial 911, while wishing I had a gun license, when a panicked male voice hollered.

""HIRO! Where are you? And WHERE'S THAT DAMNED BOOK?!""

I poke out of cover to see an unkempt redhead, wincing, completely out of breath, and holding his busted shoulder. The flimsy lock on my front door might have lost, but the woodwork was clearly the final winner. 

""Dean! What happened?""

My best friend Dean K. Washington stares at me in relief and shock. His eyes are still drying from earlier tears. His beloved mistress is in his hand. An old Marlin 60 gifted from his father. Not the best, but his first and well maintained.

""Fuck! Hiro kun, haven't you seen the news yet?"" 

I shake my head. Single fathers of three don't really get much down time between sunrise and nine am.

He throws me a net link and I put my phone on loudspeaker.

""...is pouring in on social media, as viewers across the country upload their encounters with this strangest of undead uprisings. The trending hash-tag is #prespocalypse across Twitbook. Even  cops are participating with their beatcams...""

My face goes completely grey. Prespocalypse? Washington? George Washington? I think of the notebook Dean and I picked up yesterday.

""...anywhere near a graveyard, please stay in doors and alert the authorities. Call the local police, especially if you know of a George Washington expat who was buried nearby. The Census Bureau has announced that there are thousands of George Washingtons registered with the USA, and we are obtaining figures from the UK as we speak...""

I had heard enough. I switch off the stream and look with concern at Dean. His brother is a grave keeper, so his family house is near a graveyard. We go visit every Thanksgiving.

Dean looks back with the most harrowing expression I had ever seen.

""I shot George. I shot my father. With his own gun.""

He breaks down, and I grab hold of him in a big hug. A couple of neighbours are now looking in through the broken frame, making signs of silent worry. The lack of gunshots, not to mention the rise of Georges, gave them courage to break social taboos.

""There, there.."" It was trite, but it was all I could think of amidst the chaos of implications. Yesterday, we wrote George Washington in jest. Today, every single fucking GWs rise up from the grave. Will the guards shoot their own president too?

""Hiro... where the book?""

Dean's still sobbing, but was holding together. Sandy from next door motions a ringing phone. I wave them off. The uniforms are needed elsewhere, and them too.

Once we're alone again, I instinctively glance to my right in the direction where the notebook was hidden.

""I've hidden it.""

""...We gotta burn the cursed thing. Right now. Maybe the things will rest in peace.""

""...I don't know if that's how magic works.""

""What were we thinking, Hiro? A random notebook buried in the woods. We could barely read the cover. And we took it, then wrote in it.""

""We thought it was a dead man's book, Dean. And we thought it said Life Note. And we've never seen magic, until today.""

""...Hiro, I didn't just shoot my father. Matt's busy re-burying quite a few of our ancestors. Patriotic ancestors, it turns out.""

A slow cold creeps up my spine. I... had written more names.

""A whole lot of liberated African Americans too. Named themselves or their children after our founding fathers, in honour of our great country... I had to shoot them too."" 

I gulp. There's still a few Abrahams around, even today.

""What have we done? Hiro... please tell me you didn't write anything else.""

Yes, I did. John Smith, for laughs. Bin Laden, Stalin and Hitler, for shits and giggles. Harun Al Rashid, because I was watching a history doco. And more.

I thought even if it did work, you had to be specific.

Jesus Christ. Oh God.

The line bulges in the middle. At the very centre it dilates into a sphere of light. The sphere grows slowly. I don't like it. I was used to the darkness, used to using my other senses. But this light intrudes on me. It cannot be natural. 

It must be a horizon. Colours swarm around the enlarging sun. They swirl faintly, but begin to pulse vividly. Swirling faster. 

Forming shapes. The colours split apart, and blackness bleeds back through. Not natural darkness, not the lack of seeing. Something rather than nothing. And it shapes itself into spidery slivers, twisting and combining with other slits of darkness. I watch, unable to shut it out, for all this is happening within my blind eyes.

"[WP] You were blinded in an accident when you were younger, and have since then been able to see nothing but darkness. However, one day, you see something in the distance...",hazel-the-catgirl,"I remember the day of the accident. I remember the scream I let out. I remember the burning pain on my face. But I didn’t see what happened. I could only feel. I could only hear. 

I was only a child. A child with their entire future ahead of them. But I wouldn’t be able to see my friends. I wouldn’t be able to see my graduation. I wouldn’t be able to see my future child. The only thing I saw was darkness. An empty, vast darkness. 

I entered school every day, not being able to do anything that the other children could do. I wasn’t able to play since I couldn’t see what everyone was doing. I couldn’t read. I had to get books in Braille. I couldn’t see the whiteboard. I had to take special classes for the blind. 

I wasn’t able to live a normal life. 

Years went by with every day being the same. 

I was laying on my bed one day, just thinking about how nice it would be to get my vision back. To be able to see the beautiful world again. 

And then, I saw something in the distance. In the middle of the darkness I was so used to at this point. I didn’t know what the figure was. But it looked oddly human. 

I got up from my bed, reaching out for everything around me. I was hoping that by moving I would get a closer look at it. 

I was shocked when I realized that when I moved, my vision of the figure would also be affected. If I turned my head the opposite direction, it would not be there. If I moved closer, it got closer. 

I found myself running towards the figure, desperately seeking what it was. 

And when I reached it, my heart rate went up when I realized it was me. Me as in me right now. 

I was never able to look into the mirror, so I never knew what I looked like. But I knew it was me. I had the same features I had when I was younger. Before I went blind. 

I reached over to, well, myself. But as soon as I did, the figure disappeared. And I opened my eyes to see light pouring through the curtain of my bedroom. The first time I’ve seen it in 20 years.

A stampede of footsteps echoed around the orphanage as the 13-18 year old orphans made their way quickly to the dining room for food.

""Quickly now, it's all here!""

The children made their way around her quickly, grabbing food and playing with the toys left around. It was Stephen's birthday.

""Thanks, Ma'am!""

Steven was very polite, his parent's were too, on the day they left him here, worrying whether he will be okay. There was nothing wrong with him, only he had bursts of uncontrollable speed, but now he was here, he knew how to activate it to his use, though he was still practicing.

Lucy was a special one, she was the smallest in height, but by no means the weakest. She was once being bullied in her old school, and as a result decided to pull a tree from the ground and throw it to show the other students what she could do. She is handling the transition well, especially since she moved in 5 weeks ago.

Madam Gomez did a quick head count, all 13 children were present, and she sat back and began to relax as all her work was done. She picked up a book and was reading, and suddenly 3 hours had passed. It would have been more, but Gabriella, the genius of the orphanage, was teasing Lucy about her inability to solve a quadratic formula question. It was evident Lucy was close to losing her temper.

""ENOUGH!!""

The room fell into a deafening silence under Madam Gomez' glare.

""The party is over. Line up to be taken back to the dorms.""

Everyone fell silently into cue, as they knew better than to argue. Madam Gomez counted the children.

""Where the fuck is Johnny?""

""Here Ma'am""

Madam Gomez sighed and pulled a bottle out of her purse. She held it in the air.. and it was taken from her grasp, opened, and drank from, causing a short blond boy to appear.

""Thank you Madam.""

Madam Gomez nodded, and escorted them to bed.

After lights were out, she made sure the dining room was clean and went to bed herself. She sighed out loud. She wondered why she chose to look after these children, but quickly remembered as she saw the room beginning to brighten. Her own father had been a miner and repeatedly ran out of batteries for his head torch, so instead took a potion to help him see in the dark. That is why she cared so much for these children. She was exactly the same, but had no guidance such as she is providing. And with that she fell asleep, ready for more shenanigans the next day.",Left_Behind417

I can feel the sun beat down on the husk that's left of my body. *Oh for fuck's sake. Come on an expedition, they said, never work another day in your life, they said.* An itch begins to fill my mind. *Oh not yet not yet for f-.* My thoughts are washed away by a wave of pain as consciousness returns to my body. *Dry, so dry.* I manage to crawl a ways forward, where to I don't know. I'll be stuck like this until I can manage to find some water. My lips and throat are on fire, body burned up from the heat and the wind. I manage a few feet before my body collapses once again, and my mind is sucked out like water from a glass. The process of dying is relatively quick, but it usually takes quite a while to revive. Of course immortality does not mean invincibility, and dying over and over again was what the curse had been designed for. *It's only through luck I managed to make it to the desert at all. At least here I have a chance to get out. If it ever rains*....

I go through this process a few hundred more times. Death, limbo, life, crawl. The wind tosses my limp body back, and now it's all I can do to keep my body above the sand. *If I am buried here.*... No, best not to think about it. Death, life, crawl. Crawl. Crawl. Keep moving. Fuck's sake. It burns. Exhausted, I finally make it to the shade of a small outcrop. I stay there for a few days. It's the safest shelter I have, and at least it's easier to keep above the sand. The itching fills my mind again, but this time I feel something else. A drop lands on my head as I open my eyes. *Rain*, I think *rain*, as I look into the eyes of several drooling hyenas.

February 12th, 2019

A hole opened in the sky, spewing forth the angels of Heaven, uncountable in their multitudes.

They swooped to the earth, white wings spread wide. They wore silver chainmail and wielded swords of gold. Their otherwise naked bodies were the essence of physical beauty. 

A pit opened in the earth. From its depths rose the horrendous legions of Hell. Skinless creatures of bone and sinew, of charred muscle and pus-filled sores.

They spread like ants from the pit in every direction, leaving a trail of fire and ash wherever they tread. 

They turned on each other first. Angel and Demon battling with sword and shield, with bow and arrow.

Human governments across the globe watched in awe. Judgement Day had finally come, and with it, proof that there existed an Ethereal Plane. 

It was a full day before the Angels and Demons turned their attention to *us*. When they did, they... struggled.

The Angels’ gold swords failed to cut with any proficiency, acting more like heavy clubs, the soft metal unable to hold an edge. Their wings got in the way of their swords and no less than a hundred suffered mortal injury at their own clumsy swings.

The Demons’ claws broke against our bones after killing only a few of us. Their bows had already been rendered useless, warping in the comparatively high humidity of the earthly plane. Hell was a dry heat, it seemed

And then we retaliated. 

It turns out that silver chainmail is useless against lead bullets. Angels died by the thousands. 

Demons fared much worse. Without any ranged weapons, and using middle-aged battle formations, they simply charged to their deaths.

It took six days to obliterate them all. Seven, counting the first day, when they only battled each other.

A group of elite soldiers entered the pit to Hell. We sent drones into the hole in the sky to Heaven.

We planted nukes inside each fissure of reality, then detonated them. The holes closed inside the mushroom clouds. That was seven years ago now, and not a peep since. ",Darkranger23

You are a newly formed god, but for some reason the other gods are trying to make sure you can’t climb up the mountain to join them",thestuffedalligator,"The world is ending, and I’ve lost track of the years I spent climbing this mountain. People are at war with each other, hunger is rampant, and while they suffer, I’m here--climbing this mountain. I look down at the miles of rock beneath me, and wonder if there are any people left to save at this point. It was supposed to be a short trip.

During my skirmish with War in the fifth year, I lost two of my fingers, I haven’t been able to keep track of time well. Binthe never taught me how to count without them. The only saving grace is that in the last few days the journey has become more of a hike and less of a rock-climbing journey, so I’m using my hands a lot less.

Finally, I could see the summit. I was shivering, partly because of the excitement, but also because of the perpetual gale force winds. Looking at the odd transition between snowy weather, to this sunny and grassy plane at the summit, I found myself smiling for the first time in a while. I would finally be able to repay Binthe for believing me into existence. Through all the attacks from the Gods, I was never entirely sure why the belief of an 8-year old, frightened them so much, but I had a guess.

Sustenance and Love mentioned something about it briefly, during the hallucination trials in the second year. “You will be the end of us.” They said, as they afflicted me with an intense hunger for rocks. I chewed voraciously and lost most of my teeth in the process. But eventually, they stopped. They always stopped.

As I sat, I thought about her words. “What I do to you, and what you do to me all counts. It all matters to us.” Because of her, I became Unity. The force that Binthe breathed into existence days before she died. Power, Poison, Pain and Joy. We create it and receive it, and we are all connected by it. The thought of there being separate Gods, or people different from us is what hurts us. She is me. I am her. They are us. I will bring this to the Gods, then bring it back down to the people. It’s within all of us. They fear losing their identities after I become a God, but the truth is, we will all still exist, as one.

War and Disease started to attack me with sun-powered arrows and flesh rotting plagues. I stood and charged at them. My heroic sprint slowly turned into a limp because of my rotting calves. It was enough however, to close the distance, because it’s me, they eventually felt all of the pain they inflicted. To ease the hurt, I hugged them, and they became a part of me.

It felt natural for us. We reversed the rot slowly eating at our legs. We used the arrows to surround, Love. He shouted “But I’m not a threat…” We responded. “You’re not, but the belief that a single entity should command it, is.” I touched him on the shoulder and he melded with our being. We looked up at the other Gods, staring at us with a mix of excitement and fear, ready to fight us.

“Only 14 more to go…” we said.",lyltsoup

Dispersing in a brilliant display of colors, the ether revealed a frail body. The new being looked over his body confused, he sensed his followers being nothing more than just a handful of devoted humans. Around him, new beings were formed, but faded into nothingness just as quickly. A blast of lightning stole the being's attention from off in the distance. He saw the mountain that raged with constant strife and knew what he had to do.

As time passed, the being felt his followers grow. With each step, his strength and power grew. He felt his influence spreading throughout the plane of existence below his. He stood at the base of the mountain, looking around no other god gave him the luxury of attention and he started his ascent. The first leg of the journey was uneventful, a slow incline with the occasional god falling past him to the bottom of the crag. Despite all the other questions one would have, one question rang through his mind: ""Who am I?""

Most gods paid no attention to him, most were ancient gods from civilizations lost to time. He finally met his first challenger, a bloodthirsty war god from Aztec origin. His followers were long dead, he only lingers because his name is still remembered, still alive from feeding off of what little ether the weaker gods had. A pitiful existence indeed. As the war god charged, the new god held out his hand and a spark flew from it. The hit landed, but it was a different kind of defeat. When most gods are defeated, they're usually sent flying down the mountain. All eyes were on the new god now as the ancient god crumbled to dust, the ether drained from his very being.

This upset the others, but there was no way to stop the new god. Even Zeus, a proud god that once stood at the top of the pantheon, found no way to hurt this new being as he slowly made his way up the mountain. Lightning bolts flew, fire rained onto him, not even earthquakes could shake his balance. The old gods knew that they were fighting a losing battle. As they felt their followers die out, they could feel this new god's influence gaining a strangle-hold on the world below. It choked out the humans' belief in these old gods, and depleted their power. Every god that this new god would defeat would just crumble away. As he reached the top, the old gods asked him his name, a question he hadn't thought of since the start of his journey. He looked at the world of the humans below, and listened for what they had been calling him all this time.

He turned to the old gods and the new gods that followed him, ""My name is Internet.""",silvarium

What is so important to remember and yet something I forgot? 

I climb the stairs and write down my path so I won't forget it the next day. Sometimes I lose my journal, so I have to start again, but I steadily make progress. 

Today is the day that I finally reach it, and I find myself confused. There are people atop this mountain and they do not know why they are here.

You are a newly formed god, but for some reason the other gods are trying to make sure you can’t climb up the mountain to join them",thestuffedalligator,"I opened my eyes for the first time. The air was still around me, and as far as i could tell, there was nothing around me, living or not. I sat up and looked around, and saw nothing but grass and an occasional boulder.


Of course, I knew exactly what was happening. I am a god, after all, just created from the energies of widespread belief of the commoners in the lesser world. And of course, having just been created, I need to pass the test of godly power before I can take the mantle of your people.


You stood up, preparing for when the test arrives. As if on cue, all the rocks in the field began to shake and gravitate towards me, stacking on top of each other and shedding pebbles as they began to form a shape. Soon, an archway was formed in front of me, with a guard armed with a spear made of the pebbles standing in front. Taking in a breath, I approached the guard.


“Halt.” she exclaims, “I am Gaia, the Greek god of the earth (gods are big on titles). State your name and religion”


As he stated this, the details of my creation came flowing into my mind, and I repeated them to him as they appeared. As soon as he heard my name, his proud stance immediately fell apart, as he took on a look of shock or fear. “I'm sorry… what?” she finally muttered.


“Is there some issue?” I innocently asked.


“I… well… no, I suppose not, i just… well… just, follow me”


As she said this, she touched her spear to the archway, which caused the scene within it to change. Gaia went through the archway, and I followed, and found myself to be at the foot of the mountain if the gods. Gaia began a spiel on what the mountain was and the challenge I needed to overcome on it- rather half-heartedly, I might add- but I was barely listening, rather being shocked at the size of the mount.


Not that I needed to listen, since I knew everything about it already. I was going to need to scale the mountain and overcome the challenges within it with nothing but my wits, slowly gaining my godly powers as I approach the peak, until I finally reach the summit and am accepted into the house of the gods.


Gaia finally finished her speech, wished me luck, and left, leaving me to begin on my own. I finished sizing up the mountain and approached the beginning of the trials, a steep five million stair climb. Taking a breath to calm my nerves, I took my first steps - and immediately fell.


Dazed, I tried to pick myself up only to slip again immediately. Looking down, I saw why this was happening - the stairs were covered thickly with oil. This confused me, as, according to the information I could currently divine about it, the only aspect of the challenge was supposed to be the endurance of having to climb the stairs. Suddenly, I heard a crackling behind me, and as I turned to look at it I briefly caught the image of someone dressed in bizarre neon green robes diving into the bushes. Once I saw this, I knew that someone had put the oil on the stairs to try and stop me. However, realizing I had no other option if I wanted to reach my godly status, I gritted my teeth and started up anyway.


The oiled stairs took two weeks longer than they normally do, which wasn't made any better once it was lit on fire halfway up. Once I past that, it never got easier, as more things I could not pin on being a part of the trial began to slow me down, from random sinkholes or quicksand pits, rock climbing walls that suddenly began spewing tar, to, weirdly enough, suddenly being swarmed by tax collectors and oddly dressed politicians (I wish I was joking). However, after just after 4 years, I finally reached the peak of the mount, named the fountain of new gods. Once I reached it, a wall of fire appeared to congratulate me on succeeding in the trial, and granted to me my full power. Once that was over, I was engulfed by the wall, which took me to the house of gods.


The house was jam packed when i arrived, from some of the ancient mythology gods from places like Greece or Egypt, to some of the more modern gods like aequalitatem, the god of equality, or wageous, the god of labor unions. I expected applause, cheering, or at least any form of kudos for completing the extra hard challenge given to me, but all I was met with once I appeared was silence, which carried on for a while until some god (I suspect either Apollo or Loki) broke it by exclaiming, “Oh bloody hell, he actually made it?!” 


Once I heard that, I put two and two together and realized just why it had been so hard to finish the climb. “What?! You were trying to stop me from claiming my rightful status?” I angrily yelled to the crowd. I used my power to summon a weapon and pointed it to the nearest god to me, Zeus, and asked, “What is the meaning of this?” Zeus responded by zapping the weapon out of my hand and saying, “well, no offense to you, but most of us here really hate what you stand for.” Astonished by this, I fell to my knees as he continued, “However, since you did complete the challenge somehow, you will be… allowed… into the house of gods.” Then, turning to the crowd, he asked, “who here is willing to perform the acceptance ceremony”


After lots of awkward debating between themselves, the god of social media twitticus finally agreed to perform it. Coming up and taking my hand, he turned to the crowd and announce, “gods and deities, let welcome here, the next to complete the trials of the mount and reach the state of full godship:

 Karen, the god of anti-vaccination.”

You are a newly formed god, but for some reason the other gods are trying to make sure you can’t climb up the mountain to join them",thestuffedalligator,"Tens of thousands of leering faces, of beasts and mankind, glowered down upon the lowest reaches of the mountain. A treacherous climb that seemed unending, soared into ephemeral clouds, ice and loose rock awaiting the unwary. Shattered at the foot of the mountains were the broken bodies of failed divinities and concepts that fell to inconsequential nothingness.

A new being arose from a swirl of starlight and a warping of space that seemed to threaten a collapse of the world it was being born into. The universe made an inaudible snap, a ripple moving through the mountain alerted all the gods to a new brethren, one they immediately feared.  A figure of incomprehensible depth, their body seeming to be a vision of the universe itself, stepped forth and touched the craggy mountain with a purpose.

The lower reaches held old faiths, spirits and beasts, and heroic ideals in humanoid forms. They gathered their weapons and fangs and charged at this newcomer, only to find themselves adrift in places beyond their comprehension. The slung stones that became meteors for civilizations untold, lashed out and becoming part of the endless night. Every step, hand hold and foot hold, the mountain seemed to give the newcomer purchase.

Most younger gods mocked the old, but a a few watched and began to understand the fundamental of this new being. Zeus called to arms, Titans arose to strike down this invader, while Odin watched, and Allah knelt. The mountain trembled as elements were joined and brought to bear, but the newest divinity moved up as if they were unopposed. Lightning cracked down and vanished, fire and ice disappeared, and stone seemed to become as dust within the figures body.  Deities that fought wore themselves out, those who touched the figure seemed to stop existing on the mountain, though their powers lingered.

The Christian’s God stood at the peak of the mountain and knew, for the first time in his existence, true fear. His host of angels were but buzzing flies, the legions of devils that were his fall men, but mice before a titan of true power. He called upon his believers, make war upon the believers of this new being, spread lies and silence the truth, but that only slowed the being slightly. Soon, it stood before him, and Yahweh asked it, “Who are you to try and join us?”

The being could have been looking anywhere, but the Christian god felt the weight of trillions of stars upon his shoulders. “I am inevitable, as the beings on earth finally touch the stars and learn. I am Veritas, the only thing left worth true faith.” It raised a hand, and smote the final heathen known as Yahweh.",Gyrosummers
"[WP] You’re an immortal, and humanity has died out, due to a epidemic, and only you’re alive but, the disease still effects you, and there is still life, just no humans.",AnAsianGuyWhoEatsDog,"Frozen dewdrops glistened on the new morning’s grass as the sun rose ever higher into the sky. Even in the depths of winter, I felt its warmth revive me from my nightly slumber. I wanted to shiver, to throw off my blanket of snow and greet the day head-on, but as I opened my eyes, I found myself in a jungle of impossible questions. Where am I? Who am I? What am I?

I was petrified with fear. I had no home. No life. I had nothing. I was desperately alone. I wanted… I wanted to sleep. I wanted to live as I once did. I wanted my family and friends, but I knew that was impossible.

I felt a slight tremor from the earth below. There was something big coming my way. Ten body-lengths to my left. Should I hide? Should I run? My heart beat through my chest. I could feel my ribs pulsing and my tail twitching. My ears perked up and unconsciously shifted toward the oncoming behemoth. I could hear it rustling the foliage.

*Run,* my mind thought. *Run now. It’s the only way!*

No. I am not an animal. I will not allow myself to move based on instinct alone.

I knew my fur was white. I could hide. I used my paws to dig slightly into the earth, careful not to tear the fabric of snow that would be my only defense against whatever creature was stalking me. I tried to calm my nerves and freeze completely, becoming one with the tundra I called home. I had to wait.

The rustling became louder, and suddenly a dark trunk of matted fur fell before me. It was roughly the size of my entire body and extended far above, occluding the sun’s light. 

*RUN! FLEE!* My mind thought.

No. I am not a rat. I am human. I will prevail over my own instincts.

I didn’t dare to even move my eyes to look closer, but I guessed that the beast was some form of wild dog. If I was lucky, it still remembered the day humans ruled. If I was luckier, it would even remember me before the virus.

The leg moved. Another took its place. The dog kept moving without a second thought.

Relief welled within me as I shook off the snow and any lingering thoughts to run. I would no longer be hunted. I was human. I would win. Humans always win.

I looked towards the dog, now sniffing the ground a few feet in front of me. I could make it. I took a deep breath and bolted as fast as my four legs could carry me, latching onto its hind leg. It growled and tried to shoo me off, but I held its fur and climbed to its back.

It ran a bit and tried to shake me off before tumbling to the ground and rolling on its back.

*RUN RUN RUN RUN RUN*

No. I would prevail.

I got to its forehead and tore into its skin using my sharp teeth. My nostrils flared as the iron taste of blood filled my mouth. The dog barked and growled, but it was almost over. I had won.

I scratched at my forehead, removing a small metallic crystal, about the size of my paw and jabbed it as quickly as I could into the dog’s head. In that instant I lost control of my body.

*RUN RUN RUN RUN RUN*

I ran.

I could feel the adrenaline pumping through my veins. I had never moved so quickly, but the dog was faster. I felt the warmth of its breath as it growled, whisking my body into the air. This was it. I felt my bones crush and pain overwhelmed me. I squealed and felt my consciousness failing.

I was dying, but I had won the battle. Soon, I would be…

*ding ding ding*

As my consciousness faded, I saw a blue light in the distance and my pain began to subside. Soon, blue was all I knew. There was no snow. No dog or mouse. No humans. Just blue. 

White text scrolled across my vision, “HUMAN V4.03 Nevada Release. All rights reserved to BSDSoft, year 3141”

A feminine voice appeared, “Would you like to update to HUMAN V4.04, Alabama Release?”

“No.”

There was a slight pause before she said, “Your OS will be incompatible with future software released after November 3rd, 3142. Is this okay?”

“Yes.” It was already 3324.

“You will not be able to upgrade until another hard reset. Is this okay?”

“Yes.” A hard reset was death. 

“Okay. Understood. Here is your current preview...""

The blue screen became slightly transparent and I saw the world from the dog’s eyes as it pawed at the corpse of a small, white rat. “This is fine.” I said.

“Okay. Enjoy your life. Please contact BSDSoft for a hard reset if necessary.”

*ding ding ding*

I opened my eyes to a familiar scene: a frozen tundra as far as the eye could see. My nostrils flared again at the taste of blood and I clacked my mouth in an attempt to remove it.

A dog was a big step up from a rat, but quite far from the body I used to have. Dogs are hard to reset, after all. It’s next to impossible to remove the sentience drive from their forehead without a lot of calculated action, but I wasn’t complaining. I hated being a rat. A few years back, I was a monkey. That was pretty good.

I was the only human alive. There was a virus during the big 4.04 update that I missed due to a premature hard reset. When I came to, there was an error…

"[WP] You’re an immortal, and humanity has died out, due to a epidemic, and only you’re alive but, the disease still effects you, and there is still life, just no humans.",AnAsianGuyWhoEatsDog,"When will it end?

The suffering... the pain... the sorrow...

When I decided to take the experimental immortality vaccine, I had no idea what it was going to cause. It was experimental, sure, but what could possibly go wrong?

The extinction of the human race, apparently.

The immortality vaccine had worked. It's been decades and I'm still alive. Though aged and infirm, stuck on a bed, and halfway to hell, I was alive. Aged past the average lifespan of the human race over 20 years.

Well, the average lifespan before I was injected, anyway. Cause when I got injected, it released some sort of pathogen that travelled through the air, killing all humans it reached. Except me, because I was immortal. I was Patient Zero, and I would be the last to die. The Alpha and the Omega. If I can even die, that is.

You know how there's a trope about an immortal that wants to die in nearly every story with immortals? Yeah, that's me. I see now why that's a common writing trope. Yeah, definitely makes sense.

Nothing I can really do to save myself from this agony. I've tried starving myself, stabbing myself, jumping off a cliff, but no dice. Those last two took forever to heal though. At least I have robots bringing food in for me, which is nice, since my legs broke from jumping off that cliff.


Maybe there's a way I don't need to die but I can just never see the light of day again. How much drugs would one have to take to go into a near-permanent comatose? Would I be conscious in a coma?

Who knows?

Saw a note on the fridge by my mom ""Lunch in the fridge, School closed today, lucky you"" Strange, why would school be closed?  I microwaved the lunch and turned on the TV while I waited for the food to cook, set it to the news, news channels always helped me with a wakeup.

[WP] A Great Old One tries online dating.,Somebody_once_toldme,"“Bobby?” The old man called. “Bobby, get in here!” He barked. 

From a family room Bobby was a vegetable on the couch. Lost to video games streaming on a  television screen. A headset covered both his ears, but it didn’t help to mute the complaining. He tried to ignore it. 

“Bobby!” Grandpa called again. “Bobby don’t make me get up.”

“What is it grandpa?”

“I’m trying to join Plenty of Fish.” 

“Why are trying to join Plenty of Fish?”

“Because I’ve heard a lot about online dating.” 

Bobby had never tried online dating. He was only fifteen years old and didn’t have a personality for approaching women, so the prospect had crossed his mind, but like everything in his life—taking a girl on a date, kissing a girl, going to a party, smoking cigarettes in the bathroom with the cool kids—there was always something that made it obscure.

For the date, since Bobby had no personality and couldn’t start a conversation with women, he met the ooga booga lady from his class. Bigger than him with blonde hair and a fair complexion. Hulking and salivating over their dinner of KFC at the local Korean Fried Chicken joint. Before she kissed Bobby, she smiled a KFC (Korean Fried Chicken) grin at him. Then she smooched him.

The party Bobby went to was mostly soda pop, juice boxes, and cardboard pizza. The popular kids that smoked cigarettes in the bathroom blew the smoke into the toilet, then ran out. They didn’t even bother flushing the toilet after taking a drag of their cigarettes. 

And now Grandpa wanted Bobby to set up his dating profile. “Bobby get in here! Is Grandpa looking for friendship? I’m an athletic build ? What’s a lifeline?”

Bobby sighed, set down his controller, and went to help Grandpa with his dating profile.

"[WP] When you meet a person for the first time, you hear a song fitting the relationship you will have with them. When you met your significant other, you heard wedding bells, etc. Today, as you shook your new coworkers hand, all you could hear was a funeral march.",SquooshyMarshmallows,"""Nice to meet you, Mundo,"" Perry shook Mundo's hand. He distracted himself from the somber funeral march playing in his head by admiring her attractiveness. Over the years Perry learned to ignore music during the handshake, then reflect on it later. 

""If she's gonna be the death of me, what a way to go,"" his mind rambled while he concentrated on her cute button nose. It sat perfectly between her two bright, sparkling yellow eyes and her soft, full lips. 

""If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask,"" he smiled.

""Thanks!"" Mundo leaned closer to Perry and whispered. ""Where's the best place to hide a body?"" Perry immediately gave a full, hearty laugh and patted Mundo on the shoulder. He was pleasantly surprised they had the same sense of humor.

""Thank god I finally got someone with a sense of humor,"" he chuckled. ""Everyone around here is so stiff.""

""So kind of like a morgue, but less fun?"" she asked with a large smile. Perry shared another laugh with her, then cleared his throat. 

""Alright, I should be a boss I guess. Get to work,"" he said. Mundo nodded and returned to her cubicle. Perry finished the walk to his office and sat down.

""Funeral march, eh?"" he wondered what it meant. He learned his ability wasn't as straightforward as he would have liked. He heard wedding bells when he met Sarah, his ex-wife. Perry assumed they'd be married forever. It wasn't until a year after the divorce that he realized all it meant is that he would marry her. The song hinted at the greatest impact that person would have on Perry's life. While he tried to give it a meaning, a soft knock came from the door.

""Come in,"" he shouted. The door popped open and Mundo poked her head in.

""I have a question, is this a bad time?"" Perry shook his head and smiled. He realized he loved the way her eyes half-squinted when she wasn't sure about something. 

""Come on in,"" he waved her forward. ""I just met her, why do I like her so much?"" he wondered. Mundo nodded and slipped in, then closed the door behind her.  She sat down on the chair in front of his desk.

""Do you know what you are?"" Mundo asked. Perry started to laugh, but then he realized he did not get the joke. 

""Your boss?"" he asked. Mundo shook her head.

""Nope,"" she smiled. ""You're #15, La Pera. You're a Unique Soul that probably has some special powers.""

""How do you know?"" Perry never mentioned his ability to anyone. He spent a few years trying to hint at it, but no one ever got the hints, so he guessed no one else could do it.

""I'm a Unique too, #37, El Mundo."" 

""Not very Unique if there's two of us in the same room,"" Perry laughed.

""Actually, that's the point. Uniques are drawn to each other.""

""What's your ability?""Perry asked. Mundo shrugged.

""Knowledge. I don't know what powers you have, but I have an idea about how most abilities work.""

""I hear music,"" Perry said suddenly. ""When I meet people for the first time, I hear music.""

""Music?"" Mundo asked. Her eyes squinted while she thought. Perry's heart fluttered. ""There's nothing about music for Pears, but you said it happens the first time you meet?"" Perry nodded.

""Is it always the same kind of music, or does it change?""

""It changes."" Mundo nodded.

""Okay,"" Mundo sat up straighter. ""For you, the way your power works is tied to your emotions. If it happens when you meet someone new, it's usually a good indicator of your mood while you know them. It's not about the actual song so much as what feelings that song inspires in you. Concentrate on the emotions you feel when you hear the music.""

""Really? It can't be that easy,"" Perry said. He held his hands up to quiet Mundo and closed his eyes. In his mind, he replayed the wedding march. Now that he was paying attention he felt a definite sense of obligation form in his chest and weigh him down. He shook his head to get rid of the feeling and opened his eyes.

""Wow, things make more sense now,"" he said. 

""What is it?"" Mundo asked with a curious smile.

""When I met my ex-wife, I heard wedding bells. I assumed she was meant to be forever. Now that I think about it I heard a lot of wedding bells growing up. My parents were wedding planners. As a kid, I attended a lot of weddings out of obligation. I did it for my family. When I met Sarah, she was the perfect kind of woman my family would have wanted me to marry. So I felt obligated too..."" he said. ""Wow. This changes everything.""

""What about me?"" Mundo asked. A small flush or red grew on her pale cheeks. ""What did you hear when you met me?"" 

""A funeral march."" 

""Really?"" Mundo shrank in her seat, and her sparkling eyes clouded over. ""What do you think it means?""

Perry started thinking about that right after he realized what the wedding bells meant. He was now in his mid-30s and had never attended a funeral. The only real associations he had for death was the funerals he saw on TV and a song that his father listened to all the time. On TV every funeral looked so peaceful and calming. The song his father over-played buried itself in Perry's subconscious over the years and gave his death a sense of purpose. Thinking about the song along with the new information about his powers made Perry grin at Mundo. He looked into her eyes and knew exactly what the funeral march meant.

""That's easy,"" he said. ""I'll love you 'til I die.""

I heard the Halo soundtrack when meeting my best friend, before the game even came out. Those games solidified our friendship. 

Duel of the Fates when I met my college roommate, always hated Frank.

Of course it was right with my husband Dave, wedding bells and all. I didn't even know I was gay yet. But the music was right and we fell in love. It's always been right.

So what the hell was I supposed to think when I heard a funeral dirge when meeting Mike? My boss introduced me to him one day. He'd be sitting next to me, one cubicle over. My first thought was he was going to kill me. Second thought was that he'd kill someone I knew. I kept Mike at arm's length just to be safe.

When it was his birthday I called in sick. I asked HR to move my cubicle, made up some reason about his breath. I started wearing headphones while working, unlike my usually talkative self. My old desk neighbor had been ""Hall of the Mountain King"" and all that added up to was him humming the tune to himself every day. I'd prefer that over the constant reminder of death. It wasn't that I hated Mike, it's just the music was always right. 

I finally let my guard down last August at the company softball game. We were next to each other in the batting line-up. He started small talk and we both found out we hate softball. He was a nice guy, like 6 years younger than me. Played much of the same video games I liked. We had a good conversation about Bloodborne while we played outfield. I started to think maybe the song was wrong or maybe it was an inside reference I didn't get yet. 

A week later Mike and some of the guys from work went out for drinks. I went with them. I started playing Battlefield with him on the weekends. Eventually we even went on double dates with his girlfriend and my husband, Dave. I tried to force some jokes about death, hoping they'd stick but it didn't work. Mike didn't have that dark of a sense of humor and neither do I. I was searching for anything. I bought him a Santa ornament that looked like the grim reaper when Christmas rolled around but even that was a forgettable memory.

I'll admit that I got pretty worried. I even bought a bigger life insurance policy. I bought a handgun in secret and kept it under the night stand. As time went on I got more and more nervous. I even timed Mike's arrival to work each day, who knows why. 

Then yesterday, he didn't come into work at all. The other people that sat near him were confused but I began to understand. They thought he might be hung over from the weekend or stayed up online too late. I knew before I even looked at my phone. His girlfriend was calling me. He got hit by a drunk driver late last night. The funeral is this coming Sunday. The music is always right.",maniacalmonocle

It played Jaws music when i  first saw my bully in first grade. It played 'everything is awesome' when i first met my delightful teammates at my first job. And finally, a joyous chorus of bells rang out when i first encountered Jennifer, and two years later, we were married. 

So far, life had been a breeze, as these insightful tunes, as i liked to call them, helped me handle those that i saw in life. Bullies and traitors were easily weeded out, while true friends and lovers pointed out right at the start. Therefore, it was with great delight when i stepped into my new office and greeted my new colleague, Bill, Who had replaced me in my old position. But instead of the usual Jaws theme or 'everything is awesome', the melachony tunes of a funeral march sounded in my mind. 

My heart skipped a beat. ""How the hell am i going to die"" was one question i loved to ask myself, and i sure was NOT going to die to some little shit named Bill. Well, i could not say these words out loud, and just simply smiled at him and went to my desk.""

One question: Would he die or would I? A second question: Could I prevent fate? 

Past relationships answered the second question. Katy Perry’s *Hot and Cold* rang true when I met my first girlfriend. I would need two set of fingers to count the number of times we broke up and got back together. 

In the fourth grade I met Derek and Simba singing “I just want to be King” flooded my ears. Derek did two things. He raised his hand to answer questions and he talked about becoming president. In the 5th grade his dad died, and his mother moved out of town.

When my first child was born I frowned with some dismay as *I Love you I Hate you* bombarded my ears*.* Would I have a romantic relationship with my own child? Whatever it meant that day I vowed to always love her, but not in a bad way. Eventually, I slammed the door on her. Now, I write letters to her every day. She never replies.

The first couple days at work were tense. I avoided all contact with the man until the second week when he approached me.

I was pouring myself a cup of coffee when Joel greeted me, “I see you like your coffee as black as death.” 

Surprised I turned toward him. 

He extended a heavily tattooed arm, “Hi, I’m Joel, and you’re the first person I have ever met in office who likes the same coffee.”

I faked a smile, shook, and shuffled back to my office. I feared that man. I didn’t want to die.

Every-day afterwards Joel would come by my office with an extra cup of black and a smile. I learned many things. We both enjoyed hiking and fishing. He loved the movies, so did I. He needed time to burn, and I needed to get away. Slowly we became my friends. 

I went to his wedding; he comforted me after my divorce. 

Years passed, in complete friendship. Only one thing could separate us. I called her a witch, but Joel called her the love of his life, and also his wife. 

When his wife died we decided to move in together. 

Now, we are old men. 

Today we went for a hike. After summiting the lone peak, we climbed back down together. Before we reached the bottom, Joel had a heart-attack.

Now, I am an old man. 

And now I only wish that I had been the first to die.

“Have you ever tried to divide the numbers 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9 by three?” Dr. Penflower asked after taking a sip of his coffee. He grimaced and set the cup back down with a loud bang against the table. “If you do, you can divide it again by three and still get a whole number.”

“That’s great.” Jenny said with a forced smile. She looked around the paper strewn room. Dr. Roger Penflower seemed to like his office in a perpetual state of disorder. This was ironic given that his doctorate had been: Entropy and the Natural Order. Books, journals, and papers littered the floors, tables, desks, and she imagined that if she opened the small mini-fridge sitting in the corner, she’d find a few folded scraps of paper cooling inside.

Why had she been assigned to Dr. Penflower? Was this her punishment for publicly disagreeing with the Dean’s latest paper on gravitational waves? Maybe she had been a little too tactless in stating her opinions. She cringed as she remembered calling the mistakes he’d made in his assumptions, ‘As large as the two neutron stars that created the waves in the first place.’

“Now, if you rearrange the numbers… say… 3-1-2-9-7-8-4-6-5, you can divide it by three an additional time!” Dr. Penflower smiled and picked up a piece of paper. On it Jenny saw hundreds of combinations of the nine numbers, most of them crossed out. “I’ve been trying to find the right combination of numbers that is divisible by three an additional time, a fourth time.”

Yes, this was punishment. Jenny was sure of it now. She closed her eyes and rubbed the bridge of her nose with her finger and thumb, moving her glasses up to touch her forehead. She pictured Dean Lewis in his office, holding his sides as he belly laughed at his cruel retribution. 

It was her own fault. Her mother had always warned her about her quick tongue. Said it would only get her into trouble. Oh, how right she’d been.

“I know that look.” Dr. Penflower pointed a finger at her and gave it three quick wags. “Allow me to demonstrate the importance of these numbers.” 

He turned in his chair and opened a desk drawer. Jenny leaned forward and peeked inside. She almost gasped at the neatness displayed inside. Papers were stacked and labeled next to straight rows of pencils.  Dr. Penflower ruffled through the contents, mumbling to himself, until he found what he was looking for.

“Here we go. Do you recognize this?”

Jenny leaned closer and squinted at the small print. “It looks like various formulas for the Standard Model.”

“Exactly!” Dr. Penflower shook the paper in the air and then laid it flat against the table next to his cup of coffee. “If you look here at this variable, that’s the energy required for the Higgs mechanism.”

Jenny looked but couldn’t help shake her head. How this had anything to do with the numbers was beyond her. She put a finger next to the variable and then traced it along the paper that brought her to the next equation involving the vacuum expectation value of the Higgs field. 

Her mouth dropped open as she snatched the paper with the numbers from his hand. He laughed and sat back in his chair. If she understood correctly, this could mean a change in everything they understood about the Standard Model, about quantum mechanics.

Using a pencil nearby, Jenny started writing the calculations using the different sets of numbers Dr. Penflower had mentioned. The more a number could be divided by three the weaker the Higgs field became. If they could build a machine with the correct phasing…

Dr. Penflower looked around the room as if for the first time. He saw the terrible clutter that had consumed his office. He rubbed his head and tried to think back when he’d first noticed the numbers, but found an emptiness where his memories usually were. He looked at the young woman beside him scratching furiously with her pencil.

A voice that sounded half a universe away, but still audible whispered, “She has the numbers now. You’re free.”

Dr. Penflower rose from his chair and backed himself up against the wall. The young woman… what was her name? Jeanette? Janice? He reached out to place a hand on her shoulder, but pulled it back.

*What if the numbers take hold of me again?* An icy shiver traveled up his spine. His mouth felt dry, as if it had been stuffed with cotton balls. The lights in the room seemed much too dim. The pencil in the young woman’s hand had been worn down to a nub, but Jamie?... Jen?... didn’t seem to notice. Chunks of paper tore apart as she scribbled what she could. The scratching of the pencil tip was like nails being raked over the soft tissue of his mind, causing him to flinch with each shriek it made against the paper. 

“Maybe if I can write a proof of the divisibility of these numbers I can find a combination divisible by…” Jenny mumbled to herself. The words lost to the ether as her inner monologue took over.

“You have to…” Dr. Penflower again tried to reach for her, but again he stopped himself short. He looked over at the door. Freedom! He gave Jenny—Jenny!—one last look as he rushed to the door. He didn’t know how she had ended up in this room with him, but the numbers had taken her. There was nothing he could do.

*Yes there is*, that voice called to him. *You can find someone else to take the numbers…* Like a lonely wind blowing in a hot desert, the voice was gone. 

A joke he’d heard years back came to him as he turned the door knob to the world waiting outside. *I hate to leave, but I gotta make like a proton in a particle accelerator—and split*. It didn’t seem so funny now, but had it really ever been funny?

The door closed behind him with the finality of a closed coffin. With each step he took, the business with the numbers seemed unreal. A nightmare, but made of dream stuff. He could turn around and go back into his office to see if any of it had ever really taken place, but it would be like checking underneath the bed after a scary dream. No, it was all a part of an overworked imagination, that’s all.

First thing tomorrow he would call Dean Lewis and announce that he needed to take a break. Maybe an extended leave of absence. Yes, that would do. A good, long overdue, vacation. 

As he walked out into the sunshine, he smiled and couldn't for the life of him remember what he'd been so troubled about.

"[WP] Death appears before you and says, ""I give up.""",TheLertTheWorldNeeds,"3:30p.m

The wristwatch said as she took a sip from her tea.  She glances up from her book and says “It’s about time.”  Death sighs in frustration and defeat, setting on the couch next to her and puts his hands over his face.  After Laura went back to reading her book for a few minutes Death finally looked up at her, sorrow and acceptance in his eyes.  Laura noted he looked like he was about to cry as she sipped her tea once more.  After staring at her he finally utter out “We have been doing this for years Laura, this game of cat and mouse.  You always have found a way to avoid me and I don’t know how, is it magic?  Have you made a deal with a demon secretly what is it?!?”  Death at this point had risen to his feet and his voice rose up to where he was yelling in her face in absolute fury and hatred.  

Laura remained completely neutral during this, the only indication she even heard this was the slight raise of her eyebrows as she nibbled on her last biscuit while flipping to the next page of ‘Around the World in 80 Days’, page 146 to be exact.  After finishing the biscuit she cleared her throat and closed her book, looking at Death with a lazy expression.  “You should already know this.”  Death looked at her with a mix of shock and ferocity as he froze in place. “You insolent little maggot!  How dare you!”  Death reaches for his floating weapon and held it up against her neck in fury.  Laura just looked at him with a slightly annoyed but mostly neutral expression as she craned her neck so he could get a better angle.  “Do it Death, see what happens.”  She muttered as she held up a knife that Death recognized as her murder weapon of choice.  They stared at each other in complete silence until Death screamed in fury and plunged the scythe into her neck.  

Laura crumpled to the ground as she choked and gasped for air as the thick blood rolled lazily from her neck.  Deaths stared, he did not expect that to work.  He watch her for a few minutes as she struggled and clawed for her knife to either stab him or herself, he after minute 2 he chuckled in glee and kicked the knife away from her grasping hand.  “You have caused me so much grief you pathetic insect. Countless hours of planning, scheming, searching for a way to kill you!  I am going to enjoy sending your soul to hell and watch you suffer for eternity.""  Death lifted his foot and put it on the gasping girl as her movement slowed, still reaching for the just out of reach knife.  ""You know they have a v⃣e⃣r⃣y⃣ special place for people like you."" He continued on, pressing his foot down on her ribs to make her cough up blood.   This made him chuckle more.  ""But since you made my schedule so hectic I am going to personally request the best of the best to take good care of you during your stay.""  Laura at this point stopped moving and just breathed in labored breaths, each one getting more and more spaced out.  Death took his foot off the girl and continued on rambling, ""Heck I might make you my secretary so I can just make yo-""  He was cut off though, he would never finish the sentence because Laura died.

Laura sighed as she looked over to her full plate of biscuits and filled tea.  ""God damn this is going to take awhile to figure out.""  She clicked her tounge as she checked her watch which read 3:23p.m.  Laura picked up her book and flipped to page 146 as she waited.  'This going to take at least 20 tries' she thought.

"" It's been 6 years!."" She shouts as she lays her scythe down next to your gun and pulls her hood back revealing her  piercing blue eyes glaring at you.

""Yeah , I know, but I can't go yet. I'm not finished."" 
You say as you point towards the door.

"" You know, this won't be the end of it right? You can't  stop him, not like this.."" she begins,  but is interupted by the sound of foot steps coming down the hallway.

You look over at your gun and back at the door , any second now it will open. You hear the key turning and lock opening.  You want to look at her picture one last time, but you can't,  he's here.

The door swings openand the man nonchalantly walks in , before he even looks over at you,  it's over. You pick up your gun, pull the hammer back and shoot him right between the eyes. He stammers back and falls into the hallway. Just as you planned , the only thing off was death, but wait where did she go ?

It doesn't matter anyway, you pull out your wallet and look down at your wife's picture one more time. Killing these men wouldn't bring her back, but it felt damn good.

Lost in thought you become almost oblivious to the noise in the hallway, but you snap to just in time. 

Based on the ruckus in the hallway and towering man running through the doorway,that must be Gerald's brother.

You stand up and  draw your gun to shoot him twice in the head, the first bullet grazes his cheek but the second goes straight into hospital right eye. 

Relieved you made your shot,you sit back into the chair  as he falls to the ground at your feet. 

That was the last of them , Gerald's brother  Eddy didn't take part  in those unforgivable acts on your wife,but he watched so he had to die too. 

It was almost poetic, it took 6 years to achieve,but it was worth I...

Before you knew it Eddy grabbed your leg and snatched you out of the chair, your gun flying against the wall. Picking you up over his head like a feather he throws you into the ceiling, you bounce off the ceiling and  back down through a wooden table like a sack of bricks.


Gasping for air you scramble towards your gun ,but 
inches away ,Eddy grabs you by the back of the neck and pulls you towards him .

As he pulls you in ,you turn around to try and uppercut him , but it's pointless. He headbutts you so hard your vision goes black and red and you fall to the ground. You hear Eddy walk over and pick up your gun and pull back the hammer inches from your face.

You try to move, but you can't.  A thunderous bang erupts from the barrel.


Complete silence overtakes you  and what seems like just a few seconds later you jolt up .


But you're not in that crummy hotel in San Diego anymore, your back where you ""belong"".


"" I told you ,you wouldn't kill them all  that way ""  death says as she  looks down at you leaning on  a throne.


""Now do it like you used to,  before you abandoned your throne, and settled down with that human wife of yours ."" She said with a smirk as she bowed down arms extended and handed you your pitchfork.",budgingturnip9

And then it starts moving in reverse.",welcometononnormalcy,"""You excited for a new year?"" Jane asked, slurping down another thing of eggnog.

""For sure,"" I said, taking a sip of my own drink. ""This year's been pretty shit.""

That was for sure. My mother had died in early March, followed by my father in July. My girlfriend broke up with me in August, and the landlord kicked me out when I didn't make payments in October. Jane, my sister, was the only one who had been around the comfort me. It hadn't been easy.

""Yeah,"" she replied, ""That's for sure."" The year hadn't been easy for her, either.

We watched our clock, sitting at the dinner table. We would've watched the television, if I could've still afforded it, but money was tight nowadays. Had been for most of the year. We were just half a minute away from the new year. Maybe it could be a fresh start for us.

""Got any resolutions?"" I asked her.

""Get a boyfriend.""

I chuckled. ""Haven't heard that one before.""

""It'll happen this year! Probably! If I get out of the house!""

I fully laughed at that, glancing back to the clock. Twenty seconds. Odd, that conversation had felt a little longer than that.

""What 'bout you?"" Jane asked.

""Get a girlfriend.""

""Ah.""

""What can I say? They're nice to have around.""

""Is something wrong with you clock?""

I looked down to it. Five seconds... four, four seconds, wait. ""Uh, seems to be,"" I said, leaning in, watching as the second hand slogged slowly across the clock.

""I guess 2018 doesn't want to die quite yet.""

""Guess so. Hasn't done this before, though.""

""Eh, maybe its bust.""

""I dunno.""

The second hand landed on just a second before midnight, and stopped.

""Sheesh,"" Jane muttered. ""No new year for us, I guess.""

""Guess not.""

Then it started going backwards.

""Fucks sake, I don't want to do it all over again!""

""Yeah, neither do I.""

""Eh, I'm sure it's nothing.""

And then it starts moving in reverse.",welcometononnormalcy,"The second hand of the clock was inching toward twelve, one echoing tick at a time. It felt unbearably slow, but all too fast at the same time. As I fumbled for the velvet box in my coat pocket, my eyes shifted from the gleaming clock to Stacey, her brilliant eyes staring back at me, reflecting the neon colors that lit up Times Square. She smiled at me, and everything around us seemed to slow down. It felt as if time were some kind of syrup, hardening as it dripped, approaching some surreal, everlasting moment with just her and I. I smiled back at her and listened as the collection of voices around us counted down. Holding the box assertively in my hand, I knew I wanted to be with Stacey for the rest of my life.    
The crowd chanted ""one,"" and I descended onto one knee, sliding the box out of my pocket. But Stacey hardly seemed to notice. I reached up to brush her hand, but it did nothing. She was smiling, but not at me; she was still looking at some fixed quantity in front of her. I turned around, but there was no one meeting her gaze.    
Then I looked up at the clock. The fireworks and the cheering had never gone off. Instead, the second hand seemed to be moving backwards, one tick at a time.    
""What the hell,"" I muttered, rubbing my eyes. But it was real: the hand was moving counterclockwise. I stood back up and looked hard at Stacey. For a moment I thought she could see me, but it became clear her eyes weren't matching with mine. It was as if she didn't recognize me. Like she was just a robot, standing there.    
The ticking grew faster. I stared in shock as people around us began to walk backwards. I looked back at Stacey, but she wasn't there.    
Panicked, I searched the crowd for her face. After a few seconds I saw her in the distance, walking alone, but talking to someone. Herself? I ran up to her and grabbed her arm, but she kept walking, letting out a bizarre laugh, like a tape playing in reverse. ""Stacey!"" I yelled, shaking her arm, but she just kept moving away from me, chatting with herself.    
Then I realized she was talking to me.    
The clock was growing louder, ticking furiously, as if about to burst. But it just kept going, faster and faster. I suddenly felt someone shove into me, knocking me onto the ground and mindlessly stepping over. Laying on the cold concrete, I watched as he ran backwards with a girl beside him, their hands interlocked, smiling, oblivious. Then I remembered Stacey and scrambled to my feet. But she was gone.    
I tried to retrace our steps before arriving at Times Square. Dozens of people were quickly approaching me, their backs turned, so I quickly ran to the side of the street, hiding myself in the doorway of a pawn shop. I thought back on where Stacey and I had been. We started walking to Times Square at seven, I thought. We came from the hotel two blocks away. The hotel number was...fuck. What was it?    
I scraped my brain for the number, but to no end. The mass of people passing my view from the doorway was a blur now. I squatted in front of the shop door, waiting stupidly for time to fix itself. I looked down at the velvet box still nestled in my hand, and opened it. The ring sparkled, each facet reflecting a different color from the square. I lifted it out of the box and tilted it between my fingers, catching the distorted face of the clock in the diamond. After a moment, I threw the ring onto the street.",skylinetoo
