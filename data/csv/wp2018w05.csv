"[WP] Every deity has a Hand, a mortal imbued with a small fragment of their power. You are the Hand of a lesser deity. For some reason, your power is nearly equal to a major deity.",Xcmd,"*WHAT ARE YOU?!* bellowed Zeus.

I ignored him as I considered the lightning crackling around me. Zeus had tried to pummel me to submission with the energy equivalent of a dozen nukes. So much power, but as with all the other ""major"" gods, very messily directed. It's a wonder they managed to get anything done at all.

I breathed in the the power. The storm of light surrounding me dimmed but did not fade. With a flick of my hand, two chains shot out of the ground and coiled around Zeus' ankles. 

*WHAT THE FUCK --* 

The Olympian stretched his arms out and tried to summon more lightning. Nothing happened. I was pleasantly surprised. Turns out you can electrically ground even a god. 

*WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO ME YOU BETA PIECE OF SHIT*

I smiled unapologetically. ""Sorry mate, can't have you barbecuing me while I deliver my message -""

*YOU ARE NOT A GOD. WHAT GOD GAVE YOU SO MUCH POWER WHY CAN'T I FRY YOU??*

Zeus gave the chains another tug. I smiled and tried again, ""Sorry, I'm the Hand of Pepto, the -""

*PEPTO? THAT CANDY ASS PIECE OF SHIT?*

""- God of licorice and digestion, yes.""

*NO WAY*

""Yeah.""

*SERIOUSLY WHO ARE YOU WITH? YOU HAVE TO TELL ME.*

""I'm serious. I'm Pepto's Hand.""

Zeus seems genuinely baffled. He wasn't even trying to free himself anymore.

*WHAT THE FUCK.*

This always happens. At least he wasn't trying to kill me now. ""Alright, let me explain. Let's start off with a simple question: What is the biggest possible number in the universe?""

*INFINITY.*

""Actually, not quite. Biggest number is actually 42^42^42 . ""

*WHAT ABOUT 42^42^42 PLUS ONE?*

""Little known fact, not a number. Every so called *number* beyond 42^42^42 are not real. They are just figments of our imagination.""

Zeus just looked at me.

""Yep! Have you ever tried writing out every digit of a number bigger than 42^42^42 ? When you finish, you instantly teleport to the center of the nearest blackhole. Universe's way of handling runtime exceptions.""

*THAT IS THE CRAZIEST THING I HAVE EVER HEARD.*

""You gave birth to your daughter with your head,"" I pointed out. ""Is this really that much crazier?""

*THAT WAS NATURAL WHEN IT HAPPENED-*

""You transformed yourself into a duck to seduce women.""

*SHUTUP THAT WAS A DIFFERENT TIME IN MY LIFE OKAY?*

""You did it multiple times too-""

*OKAY FINE I GET IT. THE UNIVERSE IS WEIRD. 42^42^42 IS THE BIGGEST NUMBER. CONTINUE.*

Not bad. Compared to most deities, Zeus is actually quite open minded. I continued.

""Right. So it turns out Pepto was supposed to be the first of a bunch of *really* powerful gods. I'm talking creating stars level of power. Unfortunately, when Pepto was born, there was a slight glitch. ""

*A GLITCH.*

""Yep. His power level was actually above 42^42^42. But since that's not possible, the universe went into integer overflow. Basicallt the numbers reset, so he ended up with a kinda shitty amount of power.""

*SO WHY ARE YOU STRONG?*

""I have like a billionth of a trillionth of Pepto's power. Calculated prior to overflow.""

*THAT'S SOME BULLSHIT, HAND OF PEPTO.*

For some reason, your power is nearly equal to a major deity.",Xcmd,"The tests were simple- kaiju DNA, double blind, no placebos. Not even the scientist knew who got what. We would be monitored while doing our jobs- but it got me a promotion.

*AMFAF Colonel Aphrodite Fransisco Durazo* had no ring to it, but damn was it nice to hear. While the the other golf papas, or genea pigs figured out what they had cruising in their blood, I sure didn’t. Was it I humane? Probably. Desperate times, desperate measures. Damn buggars invaded us- the earth’s magnetosphere stripped their ships of their shields but they still had a good grasp of the planet. With Godzilla roaming around though? 

They wouldn’t make it very far.

My first clue that I was something special came when I was flying an FA18 against several interstellar fighters in atmosphere (of course.) I pushed to 10g without even noticing, until my vision began to fade. I saw a dim blue light in my HUD, then next thing I know, boom! Health warnings flash. My blood pressure...sky rocketed? I could see perfectly fine again- my body manufactured blood on the fly. Needless to say, I kept pushing the jet, far beyond safety limits. Almost outrunning enemy armament. Soon though, I had an idea of what was in my system. 

A third fighter came in and shot me down- barely had enough time to eject. Water felt like concrete, should’ve died. Instead I didn’t even lose consciousness. I was now part of the ground crew.

“Colonel! Take an M4, let’s clear these bastards off our beach!” A soldier said, tossing me a spare M4A3.

I charged up with them, incoming shots left and right- into me. Holy fuck- into me!
I looked down, tossing off my helmet, and before the blood could soak my pilot suit, I felt the wounds close. No time to worry or care, gotta rendezvous. 

“Fire team, situation?” I roared from my lungs.

“Not good! Big man is out at sea but he doesn’t give a flying fuck. Tanks sank, artillery sank, boats sank...ain’t got shit except guns. They got mo-“


I suddenly hit the ground. Everything faded white...then back into the action. I looked around to see astonished soldiers.
“You just...took a round....that’s your frontal skull plate! What the fuck man! What the fuck!”
The combat medic said, turning pale. I rose up, shaking the sand off my face and shoulders. 
“-situation?”
I asked with a groan.
“S-s-same as thirty seconds ago, ma’am”

I blinked my eyes, only for the soldiers to be more astonished.
“You’re ugh- glowing ma’am”

As I stood up, I noticed a red reflection from my eye sockets and felt heat as my uniform caught fire on the back, exposing a red glowing spinal column.
“WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON!?!”
I screeched out, confused and stressed. I felt my throat uncomfortably swell a few times but thought nothing of it. Had I have known that I just discovered I was the most powerful G-force agent, I might not have had the reaction needed. 


Even the aliens stopped firing in awe of the spectacle- before dropping their guns and beginning to sprint the opposite direction. Before I felt a sense of pride wash over me, I turned around just out of a sneaky suspicion. With red glowing eyes and dorsal fins, Godzilla rose from the deep. 
Guess he felt my stress. 

With a smile, I raised my rifle with my right hand, and with my left made a two finger circle and then a full hand extension dash forward. Roundabout on me, push forward.

The fire team began to signal the others, and soon I was leading a charge of 16 men and women, with Godzilla surfacing not far away. The aliens sealed their fate for us though-
They thought shooting a 120 meter tall pre Permian organism that could expel hotter than the sun nuclear breath would be a good idea. 
As godzilla’s dorsal fins rose up from the sea and his head crested the ocean waves, a volley of alien plasma slammed into him, forcing his head back down into the shallows. He arose, bits of a shallow reef falling off his neck and gills and then the real light show began. Not just from me and the boys’ rifles that were cutting down the retreating alien insectoids, but from a sound like thunder crossed with stadium lights turning on. I stopped firing long enough to turn around and watch as blindingly hot blue and white thermonuclear energy crackled and jumped between the dorsal fins of the king of the monsters. His eyes became blue conduits before he closed his gills and opened his mouth, releasing a literally blinding hot breath of atomic energy that in only three short bursts had completely torn through the alien mothership, sinking it atop the ruins of the *USS Arizona*- after that? The aliens were easy pickings. Those that had their weapons were easy targets for ground forces as their vehicles now focused fire on Godzilla- which didn’t work out too well for them.

And only four more fatal wounds until it finally clicked that I was part gojira- to both myself and the fire teams unlucky enough to get dangerous doses of radiation. Being a hand of a god has its perks.",callsign__iceman

"[WP] Every deity has a Hand, a mortal imbued with a small fragment of their power. You are the Hand of a lesser deity. For some reason, your power is nearly equal to a major deity.",Xcmd,"Being the “Hand of God” isn’t all it’s cracked up to be. For one thing, there’s more than one god, so there’s actually a lot of us. For another, some of the gods are pretty minor, so some of us are pretty much powerless. I mean, the Hand of Iris basically gets free cell service everywhere since her boss is the messenger of the gods, but that’s about as good as it gets for her. Thanatos’ Hand is a little better off, he can tell when people are about to die, and occasionally gets to help guide them to the afterlife, but that’s it. I’m the Hand of Morpheus. I can make people want to take a nap. I know, it’s so amazing. Though one day… for one day, I was more powerful than the gods of Olympus themselves. This is that story.  
  
----  
  
It was on June 20, 2017. The Summer Solstice, and a big meeting of the gods. They were all on Olympus, feasting and partying, acting like teenagers whose parents have left them alone for the weekend. The Hands had to guard their patrons possessions. We were a sort of insurance policy. None of the gods would try to steal any of it anymore, not after they got it out of their system back in Ancient Greece, but they still had us do it. It was tradition, I suppose. We’d been there for hours, talking, playing cards, and occasionally convincing one of the servants to grab us some food. As long as we didn’t get greedy, no one minded. Then, a rush hit me. My vision became dim and blurry, and my ears rang. After a minute of fighting it, I felt the wave recede. I stood up, the other Hands looking at me worriedly. I felt strong, some power coursing through my veins. Then, it hit me. Morpheus himself had just granted me all of his power. I was, in effect, a minor god. Somehow he had been convinced, probably through a drunken bet, that he couldn’t, or wouldn’t, do it. Well, he had, and I heard the laughter of the gods as they continued to party, not a care in the world. The burning resentment I had been feeling, about the Hands’ treatment at the hands of the gods, boiled over. My eyes fell on the palaces of the gods, ranged about me, and I knew what I had to do.  
  
I snapped my fingers, and the other Hands fell around me, suddenly asleep. Perks of being a god, full powers, and no repercussions for using them. Well, I heard the sudden lull in the party as the gods tried to figure out what was going on. I had maybe a minute before they came over here. I strode into Hermes’ palace, heading for his treasury. It was open, as usual. The gods were lazy, and he was no exception. I grasped the Caduceus, and lifted it from its rack. Feeling its power flow into me, and join the power of Morpheus, I smiled. Today, today I was going to take it all back. Turning, I donned the winged sandals and helmet as well. They changed shape as I did, until I was wearing winged Converse and a baseball cap with wings stitched on the sides. I felt the wind trembling inside of me, and I unleashed it. Speeding out of the palace, I saw the gods out front, moving in slow motion. Stepping around them, I quickly looted the palaces of the gods of wind, seeing their auras die as Hermes’ had when I stole his symbols of power. Now, blazing through Olympus with the speed of the god of messengers and all four winds combined, I finished stealing from the gods in a matter of seconds.   
  
Standing before the gods, I felt a smirk form on my face as I let the speed fall from me, for now. The gods jerked backwards as I stood before them, and a rush of wind fled in all directions, the remains of my run. Smiling nervously, Zeus stepped forwards, eyeing his lightning bolt.  
  
“Good job, collecting all of our possessions before whoever knocked out our Hands could. Good foresight, you deserve a promotion.”  
   
I smiled. “You really think so? Maybe I’ll take your positions, it’s not like you could stop me right now.”  
  
Swallowing hard, Zeus tried to laugh. “I mean, we could definitely make you a minor god. That could work. Seems fitting when you saved us.”  
  
For a moment, I did consider it. I really did. I mean, it would have been the easy way out, especially in comparison to what I wanted to do. But it had to be done. I shook my head, and began running again. Using the powers of Hephaestus and the other gods abilities to create, I began building a large tower. I made it impossible to scale without being able to channel all of the gods’ abilities at once. At the top, I put each of the gods’ symbols of powers in a specially designed case. Then, I sealed the tower, and stood before the gods again. The smile had left my face.  
  
“No. You, Zeus, and all of you gods of Olympus, listen to me. Today, I teach you a lesson. You party, and drink, and mettle in the affairs of mortals. All day, you bicker about who gets to do what to which mortal, and why you deserve to do it this time. You choose us hands, and make us your servants, with little acknowledgement of what we have done for you. No more. The gods will learn, that they must take responsibility for their actions. You must earn your symbols of power back. Once you’ve proved that you can be good, you can be kind, you can think of others, I will give you your godhood back. Until then, I cast you out of Olympus.”  
  
As my words faded, there was a roar of sound, and all the gods and their Hands were standing on the streets. I looked around Olympus, and sighed. I had to watch now. Watch and see what happened. Maybe they would learn their lesson, maybe they wouldn’t. I sure as hell didn’t want to be a god. This had been a rash decision, and I probably shouldn’t have been the one to make it. Time would tell exactly what would happen.

"[WP] You’re taking a road trip in a five seater car. Each seat is filled with you, but at various points in your life. One of you strikes up a conversation.",Netya,"If you looked at them for just a second or two, you would think it was three or four generations of a family out for a Sunday drive. A few more seconds would reveal how spookily similar they were. Chills might run down your spine, but you would still think it some odd genetic thing. But, if you got up close and personal, you would find that each had a brown spot on the iris of their blue eye in the same spot. One might be convinced in that case of their own insanity, but this was, in fact reality. 

We are the same person on a road trip to nowhere. The boy is me at 5, the teen me at 18, the adult me at 35, and the grey haired 50 year old me, and me now at the age of 65. With nothing but silence at first, this road trip began, and we went on for 800 miles when the 18 year old finally spoke.  

""What do I become? A scientist?"" 

""A widow,"" I say. 

""A failure,"" says the 50 year old me.

With tears welling in his eyes as he realizes what is to come in his life, the 35 year old me says: ""A dad."" 

The 18 year old looks at his 5 year old self who doesn't say anything then back to his older selves. 

""What do I have to look forward to?"" 

""Love,"" says his 35 year old self. 

""Watching children grow into adults,"" says the 50 year one. 

""Success,"" I say. 

""Ice cream,"" says the 5 year old. 

Everyone laughs. I pull the car over at the next gas station. They happen to have ice cream. I buy a cone for everyone. There are looks galore, but we brush them off. I choose these times in my life for specific reasons. To remember the wonder of being child, to remember what it was like to have all of my adult life ahead of me and the thrill that entailed, to remember how wonderful it was to be a father and husband, and to let my younger self know that hardship was coming as was success. Clenching my teeth, I hold back the price of that success. I hate myself for the price of that success, but, as much as I want to have that conversation with my 50 year old self, there are things greater than one man's family. With all my heart though, I want to tell him to not build the machine, but the excitement grows in his eyes. And, even after all the pain, my pride is greater than my sorrow.

""Does it matter?,"" said the old man. His voice was hoarse and his face creased with tired lines as he sighed. 

""You're the one driving, you decide,"" said the young man nonchanlantly as stared out the window of the car. They were on a bridge that seemingly stretched forever.

""Remind me why the kid who could barely see over the wheel is driving?"" the middle-aged man asked sensibly to no one in particular.

""I couldn't care less honestly, I just wanna go home and play some PUBG,"" said the teenager.

The middle-aged man who sat in the center of the backseats reached forward and smacked the teenager who rode shotgun in the back of the head. He paused to see if he had disturbed the old man next to him. The old man's eyes were closed. He wasn't sure if the old man was just resting his eyes, sleeping or dead. 

""Ow! What was that for?"" shouted the teenager.

""There are more important things in life besides video games,"" said the middle aged man. It wasn't long ago that the middle-aged man had become a father. This situation had aroused in him the responsible adult mindset that he had nurtured being a stay-home father with two kids.

""Who cares what I do!? We're all going to rot in the dirt anyway and become fertilizer!"" said the teenager who had recently finished grade ten science class.

""Hm, I second that notion,"" said the young man still staring out the window. 

""Really! That's how fertilizer is made!?"" the car swerved as the child shouted in awe as if he had learned that the earth was round. 

""I see why my life had gone so poorly now..."" said the middle-aged man with a palm to his face. ""If only I had gotten my act together sooner, my life would have been so much better."" The middle-aged man who could barely support his family sighed audibly as he sat in the center of the backseat. To his right was his elderly self who still had his eyes closed, and to his left was his mid-twenties self, sulking. 

""Hmph, just looking at you makes me want to puke,"" said the teenager as he stared at the rear-view mirror. ""I can't believe that's how I end up. *So lame*."" 

The middle-aged man flinched, the teenager's voice had hurt. 

""Right kid?"" the teenager raised a hand for the child to high-five.

""Yea!"" shouted the child as he let go of the wheel to high-five the teenager. The car swerved, nearly running into the railing and off the bridge into the water. The water also stretched endlessly around them into the horizon where it met the blue sky that was devoid of a single cloud. 

""This is getting annoying. Why are we even here? Why don't we just run off the bridge and see what happens?"" said the young man suddenly. He was in a sulky mood from a recent break-up. 

""Good questions child. I can answer one of those questions for you,"" spoke the old man, his voice silencing everyone in the car. ""We are here because of me.""

Silence followed as they waited for the old man to elaborate but he didn't.

""Old man, what do you mean?"" asked the middle-aged man gently.

The old man's eyes were closed again. 

""Hey. Hey! You alive?! Old man!"" the middle-aged man shook the old man. Suddenly the old man opened his eyes startled. 

""W-we're... almost there,"" said the old man. 

""We're almost where?,"" the middle-aged man asked anxiously. 

""The end,"" said the old man.

We were all lost in our own heads for the first hour or so. None of us really knew what to make of the situation. After all, how often do you get to talk to yourself? I couldn't really remember what I was like when I was 8, and how the hell was I supposed to know what 64 year old me was into?

8 spoke up first. 
""Hey guys,""  he cocked his head to the side. ""Did you see the new Star Wars?""

17 replied.
""Yeah, it fucking sucked.""

40, with a stern look in his eye warning 17. 
""Language,"" he said with all the enthusiasm of a recently divorced father of three. 

8 piped up. 
""What do you mean?"" He listed the movie's attributes rapid fire. ""It had battle droids, and pod racing, and a double lightsaber, and, and, and, and the Naboo star fighter!"" He waved his hands around, acting out a space battle. ""It's the best movie ever! Meesa thinks youssa dumb."" he said in his best Jar-Jar Binks impression. 

17 looked at him confused. 
""Are you taking about the Phantom Menace?"" He chuckled. ""God, what was wrong with me..."" 

8 shot back. 
""Uhh duh, what other new Star Wars is there?""

17 rolled his eyes.
 ""It's called The Last Jedi, and do yourself a favor, don't bother pre-ordering tickets, your seats are gonna suck anyway.""

32, the young dad, finally spoke up.
 ""Quit being so mean to your little bro-...uhh...to him. Wait, me?"" He scratched his head. ""Well whatever, just don't be a dick. Besides,"" he said with a grin,""I think you'll really appreciate The Last Jedi a lot more when  Star Wars Episode IX: the Rise of the Senate puts it all into perspective for you. Anyway, I can't wait for the next trilogy to come out.""

40 rolled his eyes. 
""Don't hold your breath. It's been in development hell for the last six years.""

64 looked very flustered.

"[WP] You’re taking a road trip in a five seater car. Each seat is filled with you, but at various points in your life. One of you strikes up a conversation.",Netya,"The silence was palpable and hung heavy in the air.

Four different versions of me sat next to each other in varying states. From bright eyed and curious 5 year old me, running his fingers along the endless sand dunes in a semblance of a running man, to the grizzled and unshaven 85 year old me, his pungent scent of pipe smoke and sweat percolating in the dry desert heat as he gazed out the window with a slightly bemused expression on his lined and weathered face.

A slightly disinterested looking middle aged me was at the wheel, elbow idling on the window sill and one knee up while he steered underhanded lazily. Shoulder length, white winged chestnut hair waved like golden tendrils in the air as he slurped distractedly at his seemingly endless mug of coffee. Dark rings circled his dull, grey eyes as they flicked back and forth across the endless, straight road and the bizarre interior.

I didn't know how, I didn't know why, but after taking one too many hits on the end of my mate's bong at that party, something had just snapped inside myself. It was as if a light had been flicked off. I'd felt my eyelids close with what I could only describe as a deafening crash without a sound, almost like a high speed crash inside a sound proof room. I'd felt my stomach lurching and the sensation of lifting as my body rushing into the darkness with a whoosh. The darkness blanketed my consciousness, enveloping and cocooning me like an old friend in it's almost familiar warmth.

The first sensation had been my eyes fluttering under closed lids, my vision filled a violet red. With a hot dry gust, the desert's searing touch was the second thing I felt. I blinked through heavy lids, rubbing away what felt like years of caked and flaking sleep.

And wham bam, thank you Ma'm, here I am among the others.

Or myself.

I'm not sure how I should phrase this.

Mainly because nothing this fucking weird has ever happened.

And so the silence persisted.

Questions skittered across my scattered consciousness, accompanied only by an ear splitting headache and the muted background roar of an ageing V8 engine.

My 25 year old brain struggling to comprehend what my senses presented toward me, the proverbial frog was well caught in my throat indeed.

Teenage me staring intently downward, face contorted and tapping away madly at a flickering screen, headphones blaring obscene 8-Bit trash. 

Kid me fidgeting.

Grandpa me staring.

The desert heat enveloping all.

Fuck, man.

This is too much.

I cleared my throat with a cough, looking around expectantly at the others.

Various pairs of clear grey eyes flicked toward me expectantly.

I opened my mouth, a million and one questions on the tip of my tongue.

Teenage me threw down his gameboy with a heavy sigh and a defeated expression, shoulders collapsing like a deflated balloon.

""This is bullshit"" he exclaimed, gesturing angrily, glowing gameboy in hand.

Three pairs of pissed off eyes flicked toward him in annoyance, stark disapproval radiating off grandpa me's face as he covered five year old me's ears with a pair of gnarled looking hands.

Unabashed or simply unaware, teenaged me looked around with a vaguely bored expression.

""So, since we're all here . . ."", he trailed off.

""What?"" Middle aged me replied, eyebrow quirked and slightly annoyed.

""Anyone here ever managed to suck their own dick?""",Digital-Hermit

This time, this thought could not have been any more accurate as I, currently 21, was driving a 4 year old, 16 year old, 32 and 64 year old versions of my self, where to exactly? God only knows.

To tell you it was awkward, at least to my current self, would be an understatement. 

My teenage self seemed less uncomfortable about this whole thing and even decided to eagerly start conversation. 

""Who do I end up marrying?"" was her stupid, vain question. She is me, so I'm allowed to judge. 

My 32 year old version scuffed, amused, ""You ask as if you're implying you would know him if I told you"" 

""Don't answer in a way that suggests you actually do get married"" said my 64 year old mischievously.

""So I never do?"" I ask, not sure how I should feel about it and feeling rather silly for caring. 

Both my 32 and 64 year old selves  smirk and shrug their shoulders. Great. I managed to team up with myself against myself.

""Wow, so even my old selves bully me"" says the 16 year old version with a huff and crossing of arms.

At that, we all went silent, perhaps all were, like myself, lost in old unpleasant memories. 

""What does bully mean?"" asked my 4 year old self quizzically. 

I was trying to come up with the best answer to explain but my 32 year old self beat me to it. 
""It is when people do not realize how much of a beautiful person you are, inside and out, and decide to hurt you because they don't know any better"" She said in almost a motherly tone that made me suspect that I do end up marrying and having children after all.

""Don't listen to that. It's what awful mentally disturbed people do when they have nothing better to do in their miserable life."" shouted my 16 year old self bitterly. 

""From experience, I don't think we should judge people harshly. Many people do what they do out of some disturbances in their own life"" I scold my teenage self, disliking how seemingly heartless I was.

She wasn't really having any of it. ""Not really an excuse."" 

""It is not an excuse, true."" agreed my 64 year old self. ""But you also had no excuse to laugh behind that guys' back, to gossip about that girl or do any of the things you have done yourself. Yet you never truly meant them harm have you? You were just filling the need to be accepted by others, trying to hold your place in a society that requires you to be cruel to survive. I think you can safely assume that most people were only doing the same.""

At that, my teenage self stayed quiet. Perhaps, her conscience nagging at her.

""You sound just like my mommy"" my 4 year old self said innocently, not knowing how much her senses tugged at all of our hearts. 

My 32 year old self smiled fondly ""I am glad I am able to reach that stage where I sound like the most amazing woman I know."" she then turned to my 16 year old self and continued ""I know it is hard for you to forgive your past bullies but trust me, you'll bloom better once you finally forgive. And I can assure you, in spite of all your insecurities and how worthless they made you feel, you are priceless and someone will eventually think so too."" she winked knowingly.

""It's a shame my 10-14 year old selves are not here to hear this, when they perhaps needed it most."" I said with a bittersweet smile.

""It's okay"" my 16 year old self started, ""I think my presence here is proof enough that they managed to survive it all anyway"" she continued in a rare moment of wisdom that made all myselves smile.

""And I,"" said my 64 year old self both fondly and playfully, ""am proof enough that all of you survived through it all anyway."" 

It was reassuring, hearing that, and I felt silently proud of myself, both of who I was and who I have become. 

""Can I ask another question?"" my 4 year old self inquired and we all give her encouraging nods.

""Where do babies come from?"" 

I am not sure anyone wanted to initiate this time. ",Bk-vixen

""Hey."" spoke one of me who was riding shotgun, the one whom I presumed was already a father at 38 judging by the lines on his forehead and perhaps the way he dressed, ""Are you done talking to yourself in your head again?"" He chuckled, as if he knew what I was thinking.



""Erm..."" I had no idea what to say, more so to my adult self at that.


A short laugh erupted from one of our passengers, presumably from  my 60 year old self, ""Don't worry, that is one activity that we still do,it helps, y'know, talking to ourselves that is."" 


Kid me, who had been dozing off near the left window, suddenly sprung up from his nap, a curious look on his face, ""So, how's the future like?"" He beamed, and I sighed, I was always such a cheery person when I was a child. 


""Bleak."" Spoke I.


""Pitiful."" Spoke my twenty-four year old self.



""Hopeful."" replied my 38 year old self, who carried a small necklace to whom I presumed to be my future wife.


My twenty-four year old self suddenly scoffed, as he returned to looking at his own window, hurt was in his eyes.


""Bright I'd say."" my Elder version spoke, ""You'll get there eventually. The road is always bumpy at first, but the destination. Well...it's always worth it.""



And with that silence filled the car once more. As each of us were soon lost in our own thoughts, well maybe everyone, as my kid version was back to his own nap.




""I don't mean to sound rude and all."" My twenty-four year old self intruded, ""But who's the lucky lady that ended up with us ugly bastards?"" His tone was filled with sarcasm, a bit of sadness, and a tiny ounce of hope.



And both my elder self and my adult self smiled to each other, before my elder self laughed.


""Oh her? She'll be someone you least expected my boy."" My elder self smiled. ""But trust me, you'll soon learn to grow out of that cynical heart of yours.""

"[WP] You’re taking a road trip in a five seater car. Each seat is filled with you, but at various points in your life. One of you strikes up a conversation.",Netya,"I sat back in the drivers seat and sighed.  Traffic wasn't my friend today. I anxiously adjusted my glasses and settled in for a long wait.  I looked to my right and asked myself ""how long do you think this will last?"" 

I looked up hearing myself speak and glanced to the left.  ""Probably forever for all I care"". I returned to my laptop and tugged my coat a bit tighter around me.  ""I dont mind, its warm in here"".   

In the back on the far right I strategically tossed a goldfish at myself in the driver's seat and giggled to myself ""shark attack..."" then returned to trying to beat pokemon yellow on my gameboy.  

I sat in the middle seat frustrated.  He should know better.  Dont bother the driver.  Dont bother people.  You're just being annoying.  Oh well.  I looked towards the front seat.  ""Why did I do it?  It's wrong isn't it?  How do I live with myself?"", I ask the driver and passenger.  I fiddled with the watch on my left arm and glanced down at the suit I was wearing with a ctr pin on the tie.  ""Why didn't I do what I was supposed to do?  How could I be so selfish?"" 

I sat quietly in the back next to the left window.  I shrugged and winced slightly at the sleeves of my hoodie pulling at the fresh cuts on my arms.  ""I'm honestly more curious about why I'm still alive... unfortunate that."" I glance at my wrist only to remember I dont have a watch anymore.  I nervously fiddle with the charm bracelet on my right wrist.  

I speak up from the front seat.  ""It gets better, truly it does.  It takes time and work but things aren't that bad right now.."" I fiddle with my ring and unconciously flip my hair out of my face.  ""We aren't alone anymore.  Its safe..."" I sigh knowing words won't help.  I have to figure it out by myself.  I glance to the passenger seat for support or reassurance and am met with an expression full of fear.  

""I'm just glad they're still around...""  I sigh and lean into the window and pick at my fingernail polish.  I glance up and ask ""anybody else need the restroom?"" 

I raise my small hand in the back right of the car and say ""can we stop at the rest stop that has the stairs to the roof you can go up??"" 

I give a disgusted grunt from the middle seat.  ""Kids.."" 

""You're a kid still dumbass"" I turn from the left window.  And roll my eyes at myself.  

""Don't swear."" I reply from the middle seat.  

""Fuck this."" I say from the far left seat.  ""How was I such a jerk?"" 

From the far right a quiet voice requests ""please don't fight..."" 

""We're here"" I announce as I pull the car into the rest area.  We leave and walk inside, 

The two oldest go into the women's restroom.  The youngest tries to follow but the middle seat me pulls them into the mens room.  

I look back and forth and give up, leave, and sit down on a bench outside the rest stop out front.  I weep silently to myself.  

When all of me finally returns I silently get back into the car.  I glance around seeing I'm alone in the driver's seat.  In the passenger seat is a bus pass and an old beat up coat.  In the back left is a hoodie and a pile of razors and pills.  In the middle back seat is a copy of the bible and book of mormon.  In the far right back seat sits a gameboy and a dreamcatcher my grandmother made me.  

On the dash in front of me sits a book.  A journal.  Or diary.  Depends on when you ask.  I gently place it in the middle console and start driving home.

""Well... this has been delightful, Milady. But I'm afraid the fun is now over.""

I give him a nonchalant reply.

All these past few months we’ve traveled... From one town to the next, one dungeon to the next, all for ridding this world of the demonic scourge. It’s been difficult, that’s for sure. The quality of life is poor, away from the decent food and luxuries of my home town...

But you know what? I enjoyed every second of it. This little journey has been the first and only time I felt alive.

"[WP] Life is a game and each copy has only one player. Unfortunately, for you, you're an NPC in a speedrunner's session.",et809,"The air is stale. I am compelled to wait.

How long it has been, I cannot say. All I know of is my duty; to stand guard, a lone sentinel in a vast maze of adventures, legends and trials. It is my responsibility to awate the one true hero, the storm beyond the wind, son of dragons, tamer of Gods and slayer of empires. 

I can not say I have known any other life. My guard has lasted so long as to dull my memories and indeed any attempt to recall a time before the long wait has failed. Perhaps my knowledge of purpose has clouded whatever life I once led. All I know is here, today, I meet this challenger. 

A noise from beyond the entrance to my chamber grabs my attention, causing anticipation to ripple within me. I stand up from my throne, raise my greatsword and prepare for a battle scholars will recall for millennia. 

The great oak doors begin to moan.

‘Oh great hero.’ The words spout forth with confidence, leaping from the depths of my soul as well formed as any speech with centuries of preparation would. Enthusiasm seems to hang solid in the air as a deep reverb shakes every corner of the hall. ‘You have come this far, but now your journey is at an end, for today...’

Something is wrong. This scene does not match my expectations. For one, the so-called “hero” wears no armour, instead garbing himself in the woollen tunic and matching footwraps usually reserved for street beggars and stable boys. He carries no weapons nor readies any spell, an odd choice considering he has knowingly entered the chamber of the Alkan King of Jaruun, guardian of the twelve ki rifts, sworn sword of the many...

What is he doing?

In a puzzled stillness I watch as the stick of a man produces as of from nowhere, a clay pot several feet in diameter and makes straight for me. The nature of his movement is like none I have ever witnessed, as if performing a dance combing the acts of skipping and hopping into a weaving motion, propelling himself across the room at a pace that stops my breath in my throat. 

By the time I manage to pull forth some sense of what I’m supposed to be doing, it’s too late; he bounds gracefully over seven feet of swinging steel blade as if predicting its path and places himself directly in front of the sealed wall behind my throne in one brief movement. 

My mouth then detaches itself into a wide gape as the man places the still outstretched pot against the bricks, jerks awkwardly forward, and is gone. 

The pot clatters to the floor and for a moment I am left in utter silence. Horror and disbelief battle for priority in my brain as it attempts to comprehend what just happened. It fails to do so.",bajeeebus

When he first noticed her, Fredrick thought she looked vaguely familiar. Must be one of the townsfolk. Upon closer observation, he noticed that she definitely wasn't just waiting there; she had a blank face and was standing as still as his house's foundation. She wasn't even blinking. Slightly unsettled, Fredrick opened the door to greet her. ""Hi sir!"" she beamed, her face suddenly springing into a wide grin.

""Hey. What are you d-""

""Will you help me?""

""Uh""

""My mother is very sick,"" at this, her smile abruptly turned into a solemn mask, ""She needs me to gather certain herbs for her, but they're deep in the woods. I could get hurt if I go alone! If you protect me, you will get three (3) wands of birch and twenty (20) silver pieces.""

""Silver pieces? It's 2018-""

""Great! Off we go!"" She grinned at him again, turned on her heel and started to stride across Fredrick's yard, leaving him blinking in the doorway.

""Little girl! Hold up!"" Fredrick called out to her. She was close enough to have heard him easily, but she didn't react in the slightest to his words. Not knowing what to do exactly, Fredrick stared from the doorway for a moment longer, then decided that one of his friends must have sent her as a prank. It was a generic explanation, he admitted, but what other explanations were there? Silver pieces she said! He closed the door and got started on breakfast.

Fredrick had just made some tea and was mid sip when all of a sudden a booming male voice filled the room, causing Fredrick to splash it all over himself. The voice declared, ""Quest Failed! NPC Died!"" Followed by a sad toot from an unseen trumpet. Still hacking up the tea that he'd just inhaled, Fredrick frantically started looking for the source of the voice, becoming increasingly infuriated and anxious the longer he looked. After shoving all the stuff on his shelves this way and that looking for hidden speakers, and doing two laps around his house trying to find a man with a megaphone, Fredrick flopped onto his couch and conceded that he had no idea what the fuck was going on.

A second intrusive noise filled the room after a few minutes,  causing Fredrick to jump at least 5 feet. It was just a reminder from his phone warning him that he was about to be late for work. Fredrick was already on the ropes job-wise and he needed the money to pay for his house. He couldn't be late again. With his stupor successfully broken, Frederick got quickly got dressed and left the house with the the morning's events still in mind.
Frederick works at an office. Or maybe he's a janitor. What's something that 20ish year olds do for a living? It's probably not important. He does work with people there, however; and he couldn't help but overhear that Jenny and Harold's little girl went missing this morning and a few variations of ""This after Jenny's getting so sick? I hope they'll be OK!"" in response. At this he turned back to his work and tried not to think of his morning. By the end of his shift Fredrick concluded that the best course of action in his situation was to take his friends to a bar and get absolutely hammered.

This, of course, he did, and he managed to forget about what had happened. Or at least until the next morning. He woke up to a girl staring at his front door. He immediately forgot his splitting headache as he sized her up from the window. She wasn't the same girl as yesterday, but this time, he knew for sure that she was one of the townsfolk. Fredrick stared at her waiting, praying for her to move or at least blink. She didn't. Fredrick sighed and opened the door, heart pounding.

""I need an entire set of spoons enchanted.""

The artificer looks over his glasses. Normally, his only patrons are adventurers looking to outfit themselves properly to trek off into the wilds alone. The townsfolk trade goods and services for little spells, sometimes - a charm to prevent a souppot from fouling or a plow from cracking - but his discrete services? Never.

        Our hero ascends the mountain, not knowing whether the summit held what he seeked. As he climbs, he sees it, the great White Castle, a magnificent piece of architecture, none having surpassed it since it’s time of creation. Within, the reward the man had been seeking since he was presented with this journey all that time ago. After some searching, there it was, and oh was it glorious. Having seized his prize, he started his slow descent back to the manor, where he was thanked profusely by the lord of said manor, and they lived happily ever after.

      “Fuckin Harold” I mumbled to myself, walking up the hill. “Couldn’t wait two damn minutes, now I gotta do this myself! Fuck.” I continued, getting a couple of glances from passers by. Reaching the top of the hill, I crossed the street over to White Castle. Walking in, I saw that there was a wait, so I got in line and read the list Harold gave me. After about 5 minutes of waiting, I walked up to the counter and said “Hay, can I get uhh... 20 sliders, and 6 large fries please?” Looking only slightly surprised, the guy manning the register rang me up, I grabbed the food, and walked back to Harold’s place.

“Duuuude thanks Jordan, you’re back with my food! As a reward for helping me out tonight, I’ll give you 6 whole sliders and a large fries.” He responded, divvying up the food. 

“No problem man just don’t get this fucked up that fast next time, aight?” I replied. 

Having not received a response, as Harold was busy with his food, I started eating.

[EU] Describe a Factorio player's base and actions from the point of view of one of the alien enemies.,Fagmag,"""It's only one man,"" Zizda hissed inside Thalex' mind. ""Fresh from a wreckage from his Flying Machine. Send some of our young.""

""Yes, Brood-Mother,"" Thallex nodded his head, lowering his antennae to the ground in submission. 

Thallex had risen through the ranks of the hive quickly. Serving  as one of the Brood-Mother's commanding Legate generals, he was in charge of military operations in this sector of the planet. Unless, the Brood-Mother chose to intercede herself. Which in this case, she did. He obeyed with no question.

Thallex scurried through the tunnels, and assembled a small squad of young. They had barely left larvae stage, young and fresh, ready to prove themselves. 

""Young Biters, take heed of my word,"" Thallex said to them, ""our Brood-Mother sends you to glory. A human has crash landed in our sector. She asks you to go and destroy him.

""Yes, Legate!"" they all chirped in unison. Thallex looked at them all in their eyes. Fine, young warriors they had transformed into. Bright protective carapace would armor them from any danger this one man could throw at them. 

""Go,"" he said quietly. The squad of young biters rushed through the tunnel and headed towards the landing site. 

""Thallex!"" the Brood-Mother hissed in his brain not long after. ""My children, they're dead!"" 

""Forgive me, Brood-Mother. What did they see?"" 

""Machines... smoke... and this man, running between each of them, feeding the black rock into them, burning them. Thallex, end him!""

""Yes, Brood-Mother!"" 

Thallex assembled a new squad. He detailed what the Brood-Mother has said, told them to look for the smoke in the air. The Brood-Mother shouted angrily in Thallex' mind even quicker, ""Thallex! My children are still dying!"" 

""I will handle this, Brood-Mother!"" he cried.

For the third time, Thallex assembled a unit of biters. And this time, he would accompany them. They scurried across the desert, smoke rising on the horizon. They were close. 

Thallex hung back, however. He needed to see how his biters were being slain so fast. So quick they were defeated, by this single man, this warrior engineer. 

When his squad reached the outskirts of this base, a tandem set of gun turrets sprang to life and peppered his troops. There was no way his mindless warriors would breach those stone walls and destroy them. 

This mystical man and his engineering prowess. Thallex had to see for himself what he was doing. As he snuck through the brush, he took in the sights of this man's outpust. Belts carried all kinds of rocks to large fire pits. From there various metals were made, which were then turned into other items, including more, belts. Machines making machines. But, where was this man? Thallex circled the base, looking for this engineer.

Then he saw him, on the opposite end of the base. Thallex crawled even closer, determined to get a look. What was this engineer doing? He was putting something down on the desert. And picking it back up. And putting it back down. He crawled closer, and closer. 

Finally, he was able to hear this man utter one phrase, ""Fuckin train tracks."" ",RobotAnarchy

"[WP] You and a few friends jokingly declare a new nation in your backyard, but the UN takes it seriously.",Reddym,"""Mr. Kenworthy,"" Scott looked up. A tall woman with long, slightly untamed hair stared back at him. ""I'm Amarante Morel, UN counsel. I have some documents to deliver to you."" Scott noticed she wore a navy pantsuit. Ms. Morel pulled some papers out of her briefcase, and then clicked her pen impatiently. 

""Uh, why lady?"" he replied. Scott was, as usual, slightly high.

""Because the UN General Council is formally recognizing and admitting your nation into the General Assembly. What was the name again?"" She flipped through the papers. ""Ah yes. FuckingButtKickistan. How poetic, Mr. Kenworthy.""

""Ah yeah man, Kickistan! That was a crazy weekend. Crazy. My buddy from Vancouver was down, and well, it was quite the party."" He grinned at Ms. Morel, then squinted. ""But why are you here?""

""As I've said, your backyard here is a legally recognized country. Per the Montevideo convention, a state can be recognized if there is a prescribed territory-"" her nose nose wrinkled as she took in the matted grass, beer cans, burnt-out blunts, and sun-bleached Taco Bell chalupas that littered the yard ""-a population, and a political authority.""

""Wait wait wait. I'm mean, it's super rad that FuckingButtKickistan is for real, but how do we have all those here?"" Scott rubbed his hands all over himself. ""Also, why does it feel like I'm covered in ants?""

""Because, Mr. Kenworthy, you ARE covered in ants. As I walked into your backyard, I saw you trying to swim in that kiddie pool that's half filled with Mountain Dew."" Morel's frown was deepening.

""Ants aren't a population-- oh, okay. The ants are there."" Scott pulled off his pants, revealing boxers covered in cartoon cannabis leaves. ""I should probably wash them off. Where's that kiddie pool I was just using?""

""Mr. Kenworthy, sit down."" Morel rolled up the papers, then hit Scott across the face and head until he, grumbling, sat down. ""You have a defined territory in the fenced off area of your backyard. No one, and I mean no one, wants this place.""

""Kay, got that one."" Scott had been trying to put his pants on, but he gave it up as an ant bit him in a particularly painful place. ""Dammit ant!"" He slapped himself in the junk, and then doubled up in pain. Morel's frown became less severe. 

""You have a population because your friend Fred, or as you know him, Fireworks, literally lives in a box over there and eats the food you put in his dish. He's always here, and that's about as permanent as you get.""

""Dude, I forgot to feed Fireworks today!"" Scott yelled, and went to run for the kitchen. He had also forgotten his pants were halfway on his legs and fell into the porch stairs. ""Dammit stairs!""

""I took the liberty of putting half a sandwich by his box. He growled at me, but I think he'll eat it. If he still recognizes what a vegetable is. Third, you have a political authority in you. You feed Fred. You take your cut from all the dealers that sell in your yard and kick out the ones that get rowdy. You provide water, shelter, and you sure screwed Eddie out of that hundred bucks his aunt gave him. You count. As stupid as it is, you count.""

Scott squinted up at Morel again as he lay on the stairs. ""Really? Lady, I know I'm more high than usual, but why would the UN care about a stupid backyard in Marcus Hook? Shit like this happens everywhere--we're just a bunch of guys in our late twenties with too much time and drugs. We put up a video on Youtube. Doesn't make us a country."" He wagged his finger, slowly, looked at it as if surprised, then started sucking off the dried Mountain Dew. 

Morel sighed, then sat down on the steps. ""It's the Vatican,"" and now her voice was flat, instead of a bureaucratic monotone. ""Those fuckers are so damn smug. They think they're so great. 'Smallest country in the world, we're great!' and 'Our Pope has the coolest hat!' and bring all their gold and shit around all the time. You know Francis? Real good press ops."" She hung her head in her hands. ""Guy's a real dick in person.""

She continued, ""So we're all real sick of them. And we thought, hey, let's shut down that smallest country bit. Let's take a bunch of idiots, make them a country, and show them how great being in a tiny nation is. Take Francis down a peg."" She smiled. 

Scott smiled too. ""So this whole thing is basically a prank on the pope? Dope!""

""It is pretty dope,"" Morel agreed. 

""Sounds like a pain in the ass for you though,"" said Scott. 

""Yeah, it is,"" agreed Morel. 

Scott thought for a second, then rolled up a blunt, lit and took a puff. ""Want some?"" he offered. 

""Oh hell yes,"" said Morel, and she took a deep pull. ""Hey, I've been meaning to ask you."" 

""Sure thing,"" Scott replied.

""Why are the leaves on your boxers smoking pot? It's like they're smoking *themselves*."" Morel's voice was already more relaxed. 

""Dunno man,"" Scott replied, ""But that's deep. That's some deep shit right there.""

"[WP] More then three years after it's disappearance, Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 lands in Chicago International Airport out of nowhere.",Reziem,"We stood there for nearly 5 hours, just waiting for something to happen. 

The plane had landed on an open runway, and none of our transmissions were getting through to it. Once the plane stopped moving, we expected a door to open or to see movement in the windows. But there was absolutely nothing.

The entire airport had been evacuated and the military were surrounding the runway. We had no idea what to expect.

Where had the plane been? 
Was it rigged to explode?
Surely the passengers weren't still on the plane?
Why was the plane in near perfect condition?
Why are we waiting so long? Surely we can just go knock on the door? What do they think is in there?

For five hours it sat there. Engines had disengaged as per protocol and from the statistics we were getting from it, someone had prepped the door to open as if passengers were ready to get off.

But it just sat there.

The silence was sinister.

I heard some commotion on my right. A rowdy cop had become impatient and started to shout.

""Why are we just sitting here?! Pull the stair car up and lets just breach and clear!""

More shouting began between the police and some nearby soldiers.
Seems like five hours can bring out the worst in people.

All of a sudden, there was a loud ""thud"" from the direction of the plane. All shouting ceased and attention was restored to the aircraft.

The door opened.

A man stood in the doorway. He was of Asian decent and had a deadly blank look on his face.

He stepped forward just enough for the sunlight to hit his face. He was pale and stagnant. His expression void of life and emotion.

He slowly looked around at those that surrounded the plane.

Frantically, a runway attendant rushed to the stair car, started it up, and drove toward the plane. He situated the stairs to where they were easily accessible to the gentleman, but he didn't budge.

""Greg, your up buddy."" Sergeant nudged me from behind.

Nerves weren't really a problem for me, but this was the strangest experience I'd ever had. 

I approached the stair car and began to ascend. The man's expression still blank and emotionless. He paid no attention to me, as he still observed those gathered around the plane.

I approached him slowly, and when I was around five feet from him, his gaze suddenly darts to meet mine.

His eyes seemed empty. They say the eyes are the gateway to the soul, and I saw absolutely nothing.

Shock and awe found me frozen. We stood there, eyes locked for several long seconds.

Struggling to find words, I began to say ""Sir, are you okay?""

But halfway through, I'm met with the most soul-shattering screech. His mouth opened wider than his jaw would allow. His face popped and contorted as his facial structure dislocated. The screeching just got louder and louder, and my vision became blurry.

Dizziness struck me like a train, and I fell down the stairs.

At the bottom, I looked up to the man who, still screeching, was sucked back into the plane by an unknown force, the door smashing behind him. Apparent suction from the interior of the plane nearly crushed the door with pressure. The windows along the plane could be heard cracking under the increasing pressure, before they too were sucked into the interior of the plane. 

Screeching could now be heard inside the plane, and had now multiplied to prove that there were at least ten people on board, all seemingly inhuman.

Then . . . Silence.


No one dared move.


Darkness fell, and clouds covered the sky. People set up spot lights around the plane to maintain illumination.


For several hours, we tried transmitting to the plane and shouting through a megaphone.


Around 2 in the morning, they decided it was time to send someone inside. They sent two soldiers and a doctor up the stair car and they disappeared into the plane.

Silence remained for 15 minutes.

Another inhuman screech emerged from the open windows, followed by the screams of the three that we had sent in. Screams of terror turned to shrieks and gurgles of pain. Blood splattered through the windows.

All of a sudden, the doctor's torso squeezed through the window. His eyes pouring blood, his face contorted in a scream, his arms reaching out, hoping to be pulled away from his demise.

All in one moment, the doctor is sucked back in and silence returns.

We stand in shock.

After a few more minutes of silence, the screeching begins again. This time, there is a single screech and others respond to it in unison.

Shadows start flashing from window to window. The spotlight occasionally catches the blurred face of someone dashing about the plane.

The screeching gets louder and louder. Just when my ears begin to bleed, contorted bodies start flying from the windows of the plane, dashing from person to person. Blood splatters and bodies soaring through the air, there isn't a moment long enough to react. Guns firing and metal clanging. I look around to check my surrounding, seeing people falling and being drug all around. Somehow fires have started and are spreading. Grenades detonate in several locations.

I hear a snarl as Sergeant is tackled and torn apart, just before the fiend jumps at me, catching my arm in its stretched out jaws.

I think I'm deaf.

A bullet soars through the monster on top of me and it flops to the side. I look at its origin to see a fellow officer, Peter, with a gun. I stand up to prepare myself. 

Suddenly, one of them lunges at Peter and sends him flying towards me at incredible speed. 

All goes black on impact.


*************************************************


I wake up to Peter's lifeless body being lifted off of me.


""It's gonna suck to cover this up . . ."" Someone says from a distance.

A man in high ranking military garb stands above me, and responds to the comment.

""No it won't..."" He says, as he puts a bullet in my brain.

There's a lot to love in this little piece, wow.  Here are a few details that I particularly liked:

""The kind with darts"" &amp;mdash; nice way to paint the arcade as old-school.  And the bit about the floating ducks--such an old school game.  

&gt;I like the way the water smells. It's familiar.  

I really liked this because it authentically cements the narrator's history with this place.  Then you follow up with the game missing a pin.  Nice.  

I liked the ending because it wasn't the predictable ""yay we won the ladybug.""  Instead you gave us an ending where the narrator comes up short but that's ok, she can find a different way to win.   And of course the last sentence is just adorable.  

Congrats again!

"[WP] You are a butcher and a cook for a popular hotel kitchen, and are widely respected as a master at your craft. However, you sometimes prepare foods for well-paying individuals from a “Dark Menu” consisting of the most sinful dishes from around the world. Your specialty; human beings.",Vaeryk,"They were all, all of them, eating my restaurant, chewing away at the foundations with their sick days, their middling reviews, and their nonstop, gut-deep preferences for shitty, unoriginal food. When I’d told Antonio, the owner of Sixes Steakhouse, my last gig as an employee chef, that he could stick his love for sous vide steak up his ass because I was quitting to start my own place, he’d laughed right in my face. 

‘You’re an asshole, Carter,’ He’d said, and the broad, stubble flecked pouches of his cheeks had been sweating in the broiling heat of the kitchens, ‘and you have no fucking clue what it really takes to run a restaurant.’ 

Now, I wouldn’t piss on Antonio if he and his infant son were both on fire, but god damnit if he didn’t have kind of a point. I couldn’t give less of a shit for the details of running a restaurant, the budgeting and the permits, the endless hiring and firing of worthless wait staff, the semi-sexual courting of the various food critics whose opinion ends up meaning more to your life than your parent’s or any lover’s you’ve ever had- I couldn’t stand any of it. I just wanted to cook. 

And so, within six months of opening Pumice (named after the rock, of course, and we had a delicious dessert that was made with activated charcoal, burned vanilla pods, and an if-I-do-say-so-myself ingenious process by which we ended up with a sort of alien jet-black Madeline that looked exactly like the floating rocks) the place was teetering on insolvency. It turned out you needed an Antonio, a kind of rabid animal in a manager’s suit to chase down all the problems that faced a restaurant and shake them by the necks until they were dead. My problem is that by the time I realized this, things were pretty much too late. 

The most frustrating part was that just at the point when I realized that Pumice was doomed, things really started to click. We had a very limited but strikingly original menu, and we were beginning to attract the kind of fat-walleted repeat clientele that can keep a place afloat for years, as long as its not trying to dig its way out of a Marianas Trench of debt. I was getting rave reviews from the right guys in the right magazines (even Jonathan Gold put-putted his fat ass out here in his beat up Dodge pickup to order one of everything and wrote us up favorably in his Pulitzer-winning prose) and the wait staff had finally settled down to an iron-hard core of desperate individuals who were committed to rising up through the ranks of the place. The real and final problem was that my money came from Chase, and not from some retired basketball pro who only needed a corner table reserved for him to keep endlessly pouring money into the place. 

In fact I was in my back office at two in the morning, nursing a Big Gulp sized bottle of hot sake and wondering how I was going to break things to the staff when I met Sheila Hux, and the black salvation of Pumice presented itself like track-marked hooker beneath the blaring orange of a streetlight. 

She walked into the office without knocking and closed the door behind her, her movements as economical and sure as the robot arms on a Toyota assembly line. I was in the amenable stage of my drunkenness, the rosy hour that proceeded after the fifth or sixth porcelain cup of the steaming rice wine, and so I barely reacted to this strange woman entering what was supposed to be a sanctum of stress and bills and the bleak future of my life’s one true enterprise. 

‘Hello, Mr. Chavez.’ She said. ‘It’s good to meet you in person.’ She extended a compact hand towards me and I shook it. I noticed she had some kind of skin condition, something that made her palms and the back of her hands tough-feeling, like cured hide rather than skin. Her face was that of a sun-marinated cowboy, all thick lines and deep crevices, but she couldn’t have been more than thirty-five. She was short, squat really, heavyset and with a wide, toady face that was emphasized by a helmet of jet black hair that she had cropped in a severe line just above her shoulders. I could see a melting pot of at least six races in her face and her skin tone, and the effect was to make her look like a future human, some extra from a show about the far future when all prejudice is behind us and we just bone whoever until we all look like caramel ice cream. 

‘I think we’ve met before, actually.’ I said, releasing her hand and settling back into my creaky chair. ‘You asked to speak with me about the Lamb’s Eye.’ 

The Lamb’s Eye was an early experiment, only served for the first week that the restaurant was up and running. Simply enough, it was an actual lamb’s eyeball, gently poached and served on a corona of in-house kimchi, with a few secret spices injected through the back of the eye so that the eater bit into a surprisingly tasty orb. It was an indicator of what I really hoped Pumice could be, shocking and truly original, but not sacrificing taste either. We had to yank it after many, many complaints, not from those who ordered it, but from tables adjacent to those people. 

‘I don’t remember your name, sorry.’ 

‘Sheila.’ She said, and she treated me to a truly creepy smile - every single one of her teeth was bordered by a small gap between itself and its neighbor. She looked like a kid with OCD had carved her smile out of a pumpkin. ‘Sheila Hux. And yes, I did speak to you about the Lamb’s Eye, which I enjoyed very much. I was sad to see that you had taken it off the menu. Since then your restaurant has continued its, and pardon me for saying so, regrettable march towards the middle.’ 

The sake smoothed over what would have been, if I was sober, a pretty enraging statement. Something about the hot liquor in my stomach whispered that she was speaking the truth - maybe I’d gone wrong right then, right at the beginning, by not telling the people who couldn’t keep their eyes on their own plates to take a hike, and doubling down on dishes like the Lamb’s Eye. 

‘Yeah,’ I said, ‘Maybe you’re right. Anyway I’m glad you liked it while we had it.’ 

‘Well.’ Said Sheila, and she interlocked her fingers, squeezing her palms together, ‘I was hoping to speak with you tonight about a special opportunity for you to cook... well, things like the Lamb’s Eye. And, even more inventive dishes.’ 

I smelled where the conversation was heading, and I sighed, waving my sake glass at her. 

‘Sorry, lady.’ I said, ‘I don’t do supper clubs. Not yet, anyway. Come back to me in three months, when Pumice is well and truly dead - then I can cook up all sorts of weird shit for your and your rich pals.’ 

‘I’m well aware that Pumice is in financial trouble.’ Said Sheila, brushing off my refusal with the practiced ease of one to whom nobody says no, ‘In fact, my sources tell me that the situation is quite dire. I doubt you’ll still be here in one month, let alone three.’

Her words were beginning to penetrate the warm fuzz that the sake had built around me, and I leaned forward over my desk, glaring at her. 

‘Look, hey, thanks for coming in and all, but would you mind getting the fuck-‘ 

Sheila withdrew a mint green cashier’s check from the pocket of her suit coat and laid it on the table. I glanced down to see that the payee was me, and the amount was more than enough to fund Pumice for the next year. 

‘Oh, shit.’ I said, stupidly. 

‘May I sit?’ Asked Sheila, indicating a folding chair in the corner of the office and treating me to another of one of those Halloween pumpkin smiles.

"[WP] Death isn't a bad person, he just has a shitty job.",Wyro12,"Death isn't a bad guy.  He just has a shitty job.

I would know.  When I inherited the position from him, he was more than willing to give it up.

It seemed like such a good deal at the time!  He was exhausted, decrepid, at his wits end, and I didn't want to die.  What a deal he had for me!

You might be wondering, why me.  About 150,000 people die each day (slightly more on weekends), and while not all of them beg and plead and wail and shit themselves in their final moments, about half do.  Others are quitters, ready to let it all go.  A few have reached a state of serene indifference.  Those are the ones I respect.

I was a beggar.  One of the best he'd ever seen.  I had an anxiety disorder (several overlapping ones, more accurately) and my biggest fear since being able to comprehend the concept was death.  I comprehended it, incidentally, around age two.

So maybe he had sympathy, or thought he'd found his perfect mark.  I think it's more likely a case of right place at the right time.  I'd caught him just when he was so sick of this shit and couldn't take a minute more.

He wasn't a skeleton, didn't wear a hood, didn't carry a scythe.  He was just a very old, very tired looking man.  He looked at me then, all rheumy brown eyes under heavy lids, and sighed.  ""Fuck it.  You win, Ryan.""

My first reaction, understandably enough, was debelief.  Death had a dark sense of humor and was fucking with me.  ""I...do?""

""I'm not gonna kill ya.  But I am gonna pass on my affliction.""

""Your...affliction?""

He reached his hand toward me and I recoiled.  I instinctively knew that for his flesh to touch mine would result in an express flight to the other side.

""No.  Take my hand.  You touch me.  It's different than vice-versa.""

""What...what will happen?""

He snorted.  ""Have a little faith.""

As it didn't seem like I had much of a choice, I summoned all my courage and took his hand.  He let out a long, contended sigh, and his flesh began to slough off his bones before my very eyes.  His lips cracked into a horrible caricature of a smile just before his lower jawbone fell off.

I could sense the change right away, and it was intoxicating.  It was like being injected with a wonderful drug.  My nerves calmed.  My vision grew sharper.  I realized that I could slow time just by willing it.  I stepped over the long-rotted corpse beside me and knelt on the ground, on the hunt for a...yes, perfect.  There was a little colony of ants, marching back to an anthill, on the return from a mission only they could understand.  I blocked their path with my finger.  One by one, the ants tried to crawl onto it and immediately died.  Each death gave me a tiny little jolt, and I knew that was my freeing the souls from the husks.  Once a big enough pile of ant corpses had formed, the ants began to crawl around the whole thing.  They didn't seem to mind much.

On a suidical impulse that I felt I had to get out of the way or go mad, I brought my hand to my own bare cheek.  It throbbed and pulsed and burned a bit, not unlike the sensation of a seat warmer on bare skin, but I survived.

There was no instruction manual, but most of it came with intuition and certainty.  I had an obligation to be there at the last moment of every human being.  I could be there for animals too, but that was optional.  Making this task possible were my abilities to slow time and teleport.  It was my duty to explain the proces -- I would take their lives in what was really a final mercy, they would cross the bridge and await instructions on what came next.  I still had no idea what did come next, but was rather comforted that it was something.

The first was an old woman in a hospice, drawing deep, raggedy breaths with the help of a ventilator.  She was surrounded by family and friends -- lucky her -- but they couldn't see me.  She was staring right at me from the moment I appeared in the room, though.  My eyes found her and, green dipshit that I was, I explained the process to her like I was reading her Miranda rights and asked if she understood.

She nodded that she did and cast one last look at her family.  I put my hand on her brow and it was a much bigger jolt than with the ants.  Random moments of her life flashed before my eyes: opening presents at her seventh birthday party; playing badminton in college; shuddering in climax as the man who would become her husband first took her; crying over the premature death of her son.  It felt invasive and left a bad taste in my mouth.

Next came a 19-year-old girl who'd gone hiking some New Mexico mountains by herself and gotten lost.  She was dehydratated and malnourished and delirious, but she knew that she didn't want to die.  Though practically crawling when I first laid eyes on her, when she saw me she got up and started backing away frantically.  Poor thing.  I could relate.

I read my spiel, and she shook her head the whole time, chanting ""no no no no no no NO NO!"" in a crescendo that began to hurt my eardrums.

I didn't want to do it, but I understood that I had to.  I walked forward, hand outstretched, and she tried to run.  It was the clumsy run of a wounded gazelle, and in no time I'd grabbed her sneaker.  She kicked my hand with it, hard, and I tried to swoop in with my other hand to get her by the back of the neck, but she used her shirt-covered elbow to knock it away.

I could have overpowered her -- it would have been the easiest thing in the world -- but I didn't want this to be so traumatic for her.  Nobody should have to go like this.  Besides, I sensed that I had other means of doing my job that I had yet to discover.  On a flash of impulse, I spit into my hand and flung the loogie in her direction.  Most of it missed her, but she was misted with a bit of it, and that was enough.

If I'm being completely honest, I might have also chosen the technique hoping to avoid the jolt and the memories, but they came.  There was the first cigarette; the first kiss; the fight with the parents that her emboldened her to go on this stupid hike in the first place.

It really struck me then for the first time that I was going to be doing this non-stop and forever.  I could slow time down to a millisecond crawl, but I couldn't actually make it stand still, and as long as it was moving, I had my obligation.  I understood on an intellectual level that I'd fucked up big time, but my heart was still just fine with this.  I wasn't dead, that was all that mattered.

************************************************

Time passed.  I didn't need to sleep, didn't need to eat, didn't really need to do anything to recharge my batteries.  It all wore on me, but that grief filled a reservoir that I was both relieved and a bit horrified to suspect was infinite.  I took care of ten; then a hundred; then a thousand; then ten thousand, and still not a mortal day had passed.  Barely a mortal hour.

Some resisted; a few were even in fighting shape right at the end, and I'd never exactly been a boxer myself.  I learned my weapons.  There was my touch, my spit, even leaving a strand of my hair in their food when I was really stumped.

I didn't like it.  I tried to tell myself I was providing a mercy (hell, that was even part of the fucking speech), but I never quite believed it.  Serious Golden Rule violation.

Weeks wore on, and my count entered the tens of millions.  I was lonely.  I could still peek in on my friends and family, but none of them could see me (and really, thank God for that).  They were grieving my disappearance.  I understood that there would come a day when I would have to end them.  Would they be surprised to see me?  I worried that would be the experience that would break me.  I wondered how the last guy had been able to handle it.

**************************************************

That wasn't was broke me, though.  What broke me was meeting a man who was having a heart attack at fifty, like me.  He was having this heart attack despite being thin and eating right and exercising daily (okay, most days), like me.  The real reason his ticker was quitting was because of a limetime of anxieties, like me.  His name was Ryan, like me.

He begged, he pleaded, he blubbered, and I saw myself.  This was the show the other guy had gotten.  It was pathetic and disgusting, but compelling.

I briefly considered passing it on to him, but that was no mercy, not really.  I'd die, and he'd just die after a few miserable weeks when he discovered he wasn't equipped for this either.

I wracked my pain for a more permanent solution.  I knew, instinctively, that I couldn't jump off a building or take a shotgun to my head or have a nice Coke and cyanide cocktail.

Cocktail.  That word stuck in my head.  The only pain I'd felt since becoming Death was when I lay my hands on my own skin.  The only thing I wasn't fully immune to was...myself.

I told the Ryan to give me a moment, that I had to try something, and I left his ICU for the hospital's cafeteria.  They had a self-serve soda fountain there; you were supposed to get a cup, fill it, and pay on the way out.  I got a cup and over the course of about thirty excruciating, dry-mouthed minutes, I filled it.  I didn't pay.

Later, looking in on everything from my place in the afterlife (it wasn't a good place), I would reflect on how I'd honestly thought I was doing the right thing up until the very end.  I was making the ultimate sacrifice for all of them.  My final thought as I choked down the last swallow of my own burning spit was that I was basically Jesus.",cc_shannon

[WP] When the IT-guy took out a knife and a goat you knew your problem was more severe than initially thought.,Zealls,"So I had called into IT because my printer kept jamming up every couple of pages and I was getting sick of it. But I wasn’t expecting the reaction that John had when he got there.

“Wow D, you really did a number on your printer. Could you get us some coffee while I look at this?” John said, fiddling with the case of the printer to get it off.

“Yeah, sure thing man.” I said, my feet already walking towards the staff break room. I poured two of the cardboard cups, like the ones you get at Starbucks, and walked back out to my cubicle.

I was happy to see that the case was off and some of the inner-workings were being messed with, that was obvious. I wasn’t so happy to see thin air in front the printer. It must have been John pulling some sort of joke, ever since he found that book in the company attic that’s all he’d ever do.

I called into the IT department again, but they hadn’t seen John back since I called for him. But as soon as I said he was working on my printer, a voice I didn’t recognize got on the phone.

“Did you say printer?” The gruff voice said, with an apparent sound of commotion in the background.

“Uh yeah, I’m at cubicle DS-7, my printer went up. I’m sorry who are you again?” I asked the strange voice on the other end of the line.

“The IT guy.” He said, just before he hung up the phone. I sighed, and turned around to face a larger, gray bearded man. I jumped at the unexpected sight, and started to do my nervous stutter.

“Whoa! W-who are y-you?” I asked, clutching the side of my desk, but pulling my hand away quickly when I felt something squishy below my hand. I pulled it up and saw what I am now certain was the last of the Earthly remnants of John.

“IT guy. Move.” He commanded, pushing me gently out of the way. From his waistband he pulled a knife, placing it on the desk, and then reaching farther into his Khakis, he pulled a large goat.

“T-That’s a goat.” I said, before fainting from John’s brain being squished against my hand.

******

As I regained consciousness, I saw an odd sight. The gray bearded man had changed into a trench coat, with guns strapped to each side. He was shooting at something just outside my vision. I shifted my head up and saw a large monster, a mixture of crab and horse, which caused me to faint again. But before the dark could fully take me, he pulled me up and handed me a gun. As soon as I pointed it at the crab, it speared me with its claw, ripping through my stomach. This time, it wasn’t the darkness of unconsciousness that took me, but the darkness of death.

P.S. That’s not what I envisioned as the end but I’m pressed for time since school will start soon.",SL_Duskryn

""Yes,"" I sigh, my foot tapping idly on the ground. ""I have tried turning it off and back on again."" I'd been here for almost an hour now, and when the last guy couldn't get it fixed he got his colleague to come in and start from the beginning! And I have no choice but to sit here and listen to this idiot prattle on. My job was riding on this damn report.

""Have you tried re-installing adobe reader?""

""Adobe-! I can't! The bloody machine won't start properly!""

""Have you tried praying to our Lord Satan?""

""Ye-"" I started to yell, having anticipated something else. ""Wait, what did you just ask?""

""Have you tried unplugging your machine at the mains?"" He asked, still looking at me with that slightly glassy expression.

""N-no. I mean yes! Yes I've done that one."" I reply, glad that it seems to be a normal question.

""Have you tried sacrificing a goat to our glorious Lord and savior Saaatan?"" He asked, stretching out his final word to leave no room for doubt in my mind.

""W-what the hell?!""

""Exactly. Take a goat, slit it's neck and draw sigils of dark power upon your computer with it's life blood. All whilst chanting his gloooorious name."" He told me, his voice still as monotonous as ever, his eyes still glazed and fixed upon me.

""What's wrong with you?! How in god's name would that help? And where'd I even get a goat?!"" I cried out desperately, words spilling from my lips without me being able to think them through.

""Well it certainly wouldn't help in God's name,"" He said, his hollow eyes somehow looking at me like I'm some sort of moron. ""It needs to be to SA-ATAN! And don't worry about the goat. Got one here.""

Ignoring how his voice changed slightly with a word there, I reflexively roar back at him. ""WHY THE HELL DO YOU HAVE A GOAT?!""

""IT emergencies.""

""THAT'S-"" I stop, unsure of how to even parse what's being said anymore. ""Just... NO! I'm not sacrificing a goat to Satan to fix my PC.""

""Suit yourself."" He paused, his empty eyes also somehow filled with disappointment. ""Now have you tried booting you computer in safe mode?""

I glare at him for a moment, making certain he was done, before carefully replying. ""Yeah I tried that. It still wouldn't run properly.""

The IT man's face clouded over, overtly changing expression for the first time in the conversation as he frowned to himself. ""Then this sounds like a llama job...""",mogdogolog

The IT guy looked at me with a steely gaze I had previously assumed was reserved only for action heroes.  ""Mr. Greene, I need to call in some backup.""

""Like Satan backup?""

The IT guy chuckled.  ""No, no.  I don't think Satan would be of much help here.  Frankly, odds are he's already working for the other side anyway.  No, I'm summoning a Great Old One - Hastur, to be specific.  He's sympathetic to IT guys like me for some reason.  I think he had a job in the 90's and early 00's at an ISP.""

The IT guy spoke every word as if he believed it.  His matter of fact manner even made me believe it, if only for a second.  ""Okay, but why do you need a Great Old One?  We only brought you in because the website was down.  You fixed that.""

The IT guy chuckled.  ""No.  You brought me in because your last guy was a simpering incompetent.  Yes, your website was down.  Yes, I fixed it.  But you signed an ongoing services contract with me.  That means it behooves me to make sure your environment is as clean and as stable as possible, lest you call me in the middle of then night because something isn't working.  I like my sleep Mr. Greene.  So I started cleaning up the mess left by my predecessor.  I removed McAfee and replaced it with a proper antivirus.  I pulled BonzaiBUDDY from all the machines in your environment.  And I shut down the bitcoin miners he had left buried in all kinds of hardware.  But if you pull enough strings sometime something bad drops out.  This was one of those times.""

I didn't understand what he meant about the antivirus, or who BonzaiBUDDY was, but his tone was still so genuine it was convincing.  ""What do you mean bad?""

""I mean summoning Hastur kind of bad.  Now if you don't mind - I have some eldritch to incant and some goats to sacrifice.""

""Look..."" I said, nervously glancing at the goat  ""...I can't just let you sacrifice a goat on company property.  HR will pitch a fit.""

The IT guy looked at me for a second, then shrugged.  ""Fine..."" he said rather calmly ""...if you want to face what's coming on your own, then it's your choice.  But you may want to give legal a heads up if you're going down that route.""

""Legal - why would I need to call legal?""

[WP] When the IT-guy took out a knife and a goat you knew your problem was more severe than initially thought.,Zealls,"'Hey, this is Seth from Marketing. I'm calling about what looks like a computer virus.'

There is no response, despite Seth making out some soft murmurs which are definitely coming from the other end. He taps the phone speaker a few times, hoping the loud noise would draw the IT guy's attention, and he is somewhat successful. A noise which sounds like static rings through the phone, however its pitch is quite low making Seth think that it may, in fact, be him; the dreaded IT guy. Perhaps the stories are true?

'Hellooo... Hellooo. Come on, man. You picked up the phone! I know you're there.'

'... Hello,' a man with a deep voice speaks from the other end. 'You've reached IT, how may I be of service to you?'

He sounds unnervingly apathetic.

'Um... hey. So, I think I've got this virus-'

All of a sudden there is an excruciating scream on the other end, forcing Seth to pull the phone away from his ear for a moment.

'Dude, what's going on?! Are you okay?!' asks Seth, simultaneously worried and terrified. 

The screaming abruptly stops.

'Yeah I'm fine. How about you?'

The stories are *definitely* true.

'... Uhhh, I'm -- I'm good.'

'That's good,' the man replies. 

'... So,' Seth ponders just ending the call there, but the important documents on his computer relating to his presentation, which is tomorrow, prevent him from doing so. 'My computer's got this, like, virus thing I think. It won't start. I don't know what to do and I really need to get into my files-'

'Just one moment.'

The phone hangs up. 

'What the hell?!'

Seth double-checks to make sure the connection was actually lost. If so, he may actually have a valid complaint to make to HR, possibly ending the office-wide reluctance to ask IT for help whenever problems arise; which has resulted in many instances of lost family photos, and near-complete games of minesweeper. It was. 

He turns around in his chair and reaches for his desk drawer, but recoils at the site of the tall, skinny man with long, black hair standing at the entrance to his cubicle. He reeks of BO and, strangely, smoke. 

'Woah!' screams Seth reactively, quickly regaining his composure in the name of professionalism. 'H-hi. So sorry, who are you?'

'You called about a virus...' replies the man, his eyes wide open enough to make his forehead wrinkle. 

'Wait, so you're the IT guy? We literally stopped talking just a few seconds ago! How did you get here so fast?'

'I travel the passages which lie between the realms of man and ghost.'

Seth stiffens up, making the decision to avoid eye contact from hereon. Though the aversion to eye contact is not necessarily a conscious act. 

'... Okay. Well, uh... the computer is right here. I'll let you get to it,' Seth stands and walks to the corner of the cubicle, presenting one hand toward his chair before quickly crossing his arms. For some reason he feels the need to protect all of his vital organs. 

The IT guy moves swiftly into the chair, promptly being followed by a fully-grown goat, an apparent pet of his, which leaps up and sits on his lap. 

'Dude, why do you have a goat?!'

The man turns to look at Seth.

'I found it wandering along the shadowy plains of Gorroth in the Arrathean dimension. It was cute, so I decided to keep it as a companion.'

Seth is tempted to cite the rules on bringing pets to the office, but decides not to upon considering the potential conversational ramifications. Those being the continuation of any conversation at all. He decides to remain silent and ignore the ridiculousness which he had just heard. 

The IT guy turns back to the computer and begins doing his job, identifying the problem within moments. 

'It appears the grace of God almighty has left your computer, allowing an evil to incorporate itself within your system. I see only one solution.'

Seth rolls his eyes and buries his face in his hands for a few moments. *I see the problem* he thinks to himself. *He does all this weird stuff and HR thinks that people are joking when they report him, or crazy. And seeing as the computers get fixed, they've got little reason to fire him.* When he raises his head again he is surprisingly surprised at the sight of a long hunting knife being pressed against the goat's throat. 

'Oh my God, man! What are you doing?!' he screams.

'Goat's blood is a powerful repellent of evil energy. I am willing to sacrifice my companion for the safety of your system.'

'JESUS, WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?! NO!'

'I would refrain from using the Lord's name in vain, this may only worsen the problem.'

'Dude, just...' Seth trails off, clearly exasperated by this ordeal. 'Just, fix the fucking computer, alright? It's *just* a virus...'

The man appears to ponder for a moment, picking at knots in the goat's fur. 

'If you will not allow me to spill the blood of my companion, the only alternative is to remove the hard drive...'

*Oh my God, that's all it takes?!*

'Yes, just do that!'

The tall, skinny, and black haired man stands up quickly, the goat leaping from his lap and lying at his feet. With little regard for noise or damaged property, he tosses aside the monitor to get at the computer beneath, using his long hunting knife to pry open the casing. After a little bit of fiddling, he removes the hard drive with his bare hand and tosses it on the desk, but for some reason decides to keep digging.

'Dude, that's the hard drive. What else is there to look at?'

After a few seconds the man removes something else. A long, thin piece of cardboard.

'... What's that?' asks Seth.

‘I believe it is a ouija board. It appears to have replaced the motherboard.’

Seth, leaning against the cubicle wall, drops to the ground and rolls his head back. He is now looking directly at the ceiling; as far from eye contact as possible. The IT guy begins contemplatively rumbling in the back of his throat.

'... I think that is the problem.'

[WP] When the IT-guy took out a knife and a goat you knew your problem was more severe than initially thought.,Zealls,"""What in the *hell* are you doing!?"" I screamed, staring in shock at this lunatic who was sitting in my special chair, holding a long butcher's knife next to a bleating goat's throat.

""Well you want your computer fixed, right?"" he asked, looking at me with genuine concern. I honestly didn't know if this guy was being serious or pulling my leg, but this was a prank I was going to put that knife to *his* throat.

""Yeah, but why you have a fucking goat and a knife!?""

""...Well how else do you expect me to fix your computer?""

""By, like, turning it off and on, or like installing some software or something! I assumed you'd actually be working on the computer instead of preparing to kill a goat!""

""Listen, Sharon. I know you've had a rough day, but you need to let me do my job. I'm here to fix your computer, and that's what I'm gonna do."" He looked at me with this face of pure seriousness, almost as if he was actually telling the truth. I still had no clue what to do.

""Okay okay - I get that you're here to fix my com- can you please just take the knife away for a minute? Please?"" I asked, moving my hand to my eyes and rubbing them as I tried to avoid eye contact with the goat, which at the moment was trying to make eye contact with me as if to get me to help it escape its dubious fate.

""Sigh, alright."" he said, lowering the knife from the goat's throat. He still had it held in place by its horns and wouldn't let it go, making it bleat louder. 

""Okay - I understand you're here to fix my computer, but why are you killing a goat here? That 1) has **nothing** to do with me, you, your job or what you're even here for, and 2) **has** to be illegal! And where the hell did you even get a goat anyway?""

His eyes turned dark as I spoke, the innocent nature fading away like the sun during an eclipse. He stared at me as I spoke, causing my words to slow to a halt and get caught in my throat. It felt eerie, almost like he was gutting me with his eyes. His clean, razor sharp eyes. *Shudder*.

""Sharon, do you even know what I do here?"" he asked, his voice no more than a soft whisper.

""U-uh yes...? You're the IT guy, r-right?"" I spoke, my voice now reduced to a stuttering whisper and the atmosphere became intense within moments.

""That is correct. Do you know how my job works?""

""Well if I did, then you wouldn't be here, r-right?"" I spoke, raising my voice a little, remaining steadfast.

""Ah,"" he chuckled, his vice of a hand relaxing ever so slightly on the goat. ""That's true. But allow me to explain to you how my job works."" His eyes became as cold as steel and his grip tightened on the goat, causing it to bleat softly, as if it had already admitted defeat.

""To fix a computer, you must first communicate with it. Sure, it is as you believed - we have to try turning it off and on again, installing or removing software, running all sorts of diagnostics. But what happens when the computer doesn't respond to all those methods? What do you think, hmm?""

I shook my head, my mind racing. It felt like I was an elementary school student who'd just been called to the principal's office, and now had to sit and watch his call my parent to explain what I'd done. Fear coursed through my veins like a wildfire in a barren forest, sending violent shivers down my spine.

""If that doesn't work, then we need to perform a bitorcism. Think of it as a procedure similar to an exorcism, but involving computers. Once we set up the computer and install the right software, we must sacrifice a goat to Bina-RY, the Machine God. Once we do that, we gain the power to summon the almighty demon CH0DAN, a being capable of cleansing any machine.""

I looked at this 28 year-old man, stuck in a low-end IT job for a mediocre company, and laughed. I laughed loud and hard, tears spilling from my eyes as he looked with minor surprise. He then shifted to a smile and began to chuckle with me, leaving me completely off guard as he quickly brought the knife back to the goat's neck and sliced, deep and strong. 

My boisterous laugh morphed into a shrill scream that echoed throughout the office, bouncing off the walls and cubicles. I gaped in horror as the now dead goat's blood flowed over the computer, running down all the channels of the keyboard like a river breaking into tributaries. As soon as the goat finished bleeding, the man placed it down gently and began to type quickly on an inactive computer. He was typing away jibberish on a computer that wasn't even on.

Right as I prepared to faint and believe it was all a dream, a massive light flooded the office, originating from the computer. The harsh blue light flashed and from within came a dark face. It resembled a man with tangled fire red hair and eyes that could pierce through stone. Her face was imbued with circuit lines and he almost looked like some monster that was being summoned from another dimension.

And that's when I decided to black out.

""Ugh. What happened?"" I asked to no one in particular. 

""Ah, you're awake! I don't really know what happened, but I was asking you a few questions and you just blacked out! Are you alright?""

I was staring at the dangerously close face of the IT guy, who seemed to be examining me for life signs. Well, since I was wide awake now, I pushed him away and got up, stumbling and grabbing my desk for support.

""H-hey - wasn't there a goat and a face with lines and stuff...?"" I asked, dead serious.

""I think you hit your head pretty hard,"" he chuckled. ""You're gonna want to get some rest. I fixed up your computer, so you'll be fine. Let me know if you need anything else!""

He walked away, waving nonchalantly as he did so, almost like he didn't have a care in the world.

I must have been dreaming, right?

[WP] When the IT-guy took out a knife and a goat you knew your problem was more severe than initially thought.,Zealls,"Somehow this day had gotten much weirder than I could have predicted. 

It started out with things that seemed reasonable in the context. I figured I’d finally tracked down the only guy in the area that could help me recover my lost files. People said he was a semi-retired genius, living in the country but maintaining a small shop at his house. So it didn’t seem weird that I was showing up at a small farm looking for someone to work on my laptop.

Mr. Gadot had apparently gotten rich setting up some sort of major technological infrastructure. I never did read exactly what it was, but it sounded important. When he got tired of his job he just bought some land and set out to grow his own food. It seems he and his wife were rather isolated for a few years, but then he started a tech business again as an extra hobby. And with his expertise and equipment, he got a reputation for solving impossible problems quickly. If anyone could get things off of my fire-damaged hard drive, it was him.

When I arrived at the house his wife told me that he was out in the main barn tending to the animals, and I could just go ahead and ask him about my problem. So I found myself standing next to a cow pen looking for a farmer to help me with my laptop. Things went steadily downhill from there.

I found Mr. Gadot, and quickly introduced myself and explained why I was there. However, as I explained what had happened and showed him my damaged computer, his demeanor quickly shifted from casually interested to gravely concerned. He grabbed the laptop and took it to a table at the end of the barn to examine the burn patterns. He was muttering something about there being “another one loose” and repeating something about how “it was supposed to prevent this”.

By this point I was pretty concerned, but mostly for the man’s sanity. I started to think this might be why he lived in the middle of nowhere instead of running a major corporation. But then he muttered something in a foreign language and I found myself questioning my *own* sanity instead, because the computer responded in the same language, and I could swear it had a face. Now I don’t know much about computers, but I’m pretty sure they’re not supposed to grow a face and have a conversation with you.

Once Gadot heard the reply, he seemed to switch from panicked to determined. He went over to a nearby pen and grabbed one of the goats. Then he pulled out a large knife that had apparently just been sheathed on the wall for some reason. I looked at what he was doing and blurted out “what is this, some sort of satanic sacrifice?” which elicited a scornful look from him. He spared me enough time to say “I’m Jewish, this is a sacrifice to God.” Before tying the goat to the table and opening a book from the shelf above him.

By this point I pretty much gave up on figuring out what was going on and just watched in shock as he went through a ritual of some sort. The computer started to yell in protest as it realized what he was doing. It seemed to fight him with its sheer strength of will. But once he killed the goat and said what I think was a prayer over its body, the laptop suddenly fell silent.

Gadot breathed a sigh of relief and turned back to me. “I guess you’ll need some sort of explanation for all of that”, he said.

I could only stare back in response. 

“Well”, he continued “the short version is that the internet is protected from demons by rabbinical IT experts. We thought we had them all blocked out 20 years ago when we adjusted the network, but you somehow found one.”

I continued to stare at him without fully comprehending his words. After a moment he looked at me with a curious expression and asked “just what sort of websites were you browsing anyway?” and I realized that for the sake of the internet, I would have to disclose my browser history to a rabbi.",JoelSkaling
[WP] When the IT-guy took out a knife and a goat you knew your problem was more severe than initially thought.,Zealls,"""Martha? _Martha?_ Can you hear me? Say something won't you?""

""I'm afraid she isn't going to be able to respond,"" said the pimply technician. He was wheeling a small crate in through the door as Mr. Johnson stood beside his comatose wife, looking somewhat flustered. ""This is a bit worse than what you described over the phone.""

""What? This _exactly_ as worse-- I mean, as _bad_ as I described it!"" said Mr. Johnson ""My wife is unconscious! Are you _sure_ we shouldn't me calling an ambulance?""

""It's worse,"" said the technician, ignoring the question and pushing his glasses up his nose ""because you didn't mention she was using an _Oculus_."" he gestured toward the black object strapped to Martha's face as he pulled a small cro-bar out of his tool bag ""We see this now and then with Vives, but an Oculus is much riskier. I'm afraid we'll have to do a full transfer""

Mr. Johnson wrung his hands together. His expression, though harried, showed no sign of him grasping anything the technician had just said. ""But... but... nobody at Best Buy told us that... that the '_vee ar_' thingy was... was dangerous! At least not dangerous like... _this_."" Mr. Johnson looked down at his wife, laying motionless in her lay-z-boy. The laptop on her legs glowed a dull blue, mirroring the vacant, drooling expression on Martha's half obscured face.

With a huff of exertion, the technician popped the top off of the wooden crate with a woody _crack_, and then turned to look back at Martha ""Well,"" he began with a sigh ""the inherent risk with rift technology was covered in your T's and C's when you-""

""'Tees and seas?'"" Mr. Johnson interrupted.

""'Terms and Conditions. You signed a waiver saying you read them when you purchased the device. You did read them, didn't you sir?""

Mr. Johnson looked uncomfortable.

""Anyway,"" the tech continued, as he lifted the lid off of the crate ""Facebook owns the Oculus Rift, you know. You always have to be careful with Facebook. Any idiot could tell you they don't have your best interests in mind"" The tech chuckled a bit at his own statement, and reached down into the crate, pulling out... a goat.

""Nyeh-eehh"" bleated the goat.

Mr. Johnson had sat down on the couch beside his wife, his head dejectedly held in his hands, but looked up suddenly at the barnyard noise ""What....?! What on earth-- is that a _goat_? What... Why do you have a _goat_?!"" Mr. Johnson stood, his face red with confusion.

""Well, funny story actually,"" said the technician, stroking the goat's head ""We were using dogs up until last year, but it turns out goats are cheaper to feed. Something like a chicken would be ideal, of course, but tests have shown that they just don't have the necessary RAM. Goats do though. Funny, right? Goats? RAM?"" He pushed his glasses up again, grinning at Mr. Johnson, though the humor seemed to be lost on him.

""Aren't rams sheep though?"" chirped the voice of the Johnsons' young daughter, quiet up until now as she watched the spectacle unfolding from the doorway to the kitchen.

""I... er..."" The technician's grin dropped and he looked over to the child.

""Cynthia! Ah... go... go on upstairs!"" Mr. Johnson waved weakly to shoo her away.

""Is mum drunk again?""

""CYNTHIA!"" The man shouted, ""I said go! Everything is fine!""

The girl darted back through the doorway, out of sight-- until her father had turned his back, peeking her head back out to watch. The technician reached once again into his bag, pulling out a long USB cable and a small knife. Mr. Johnson began to pull at his thinning hair.

""Alot of customers don't really understand how these things work"" He said, gesturing again at the black box strapped over Martha's eyes ""It's called the Oculus _Rift_ for a reason,"" he said, putting emphasis on the word 'rift', with a knowing glance to Mr. Johnson ""The device opens up a memetic portal to.... well, look, that part isn't important. The important part is that these things have a direct interface with your _soul_."" The technician pressed the tip of the knife to the back of the goat's neck, parting the skin to reveal a USB port. A small spray of blood spurted from the wound, though the technician quickly stifled it with a handkerchief.

""Nyeh-eehhhhh!"" bleated the goat, slightly distressed.

Mr. Johnson was also somewhat distressed, and his flustered red had shifted to a sickly green. Having run out of sensible objection to the current state of affairs, his mouth worked up and down wordlessly.

""Sorry 'bout that"" said the nonplussed technician, wiping a bit of blood from his 'geek squad' tie. He plugged one end of the USB cable into the goat, and the other end into a port on Martha's headset ""I'll be out of your hair here in a minute, I promise."" he pulled out a tablet and began making swipes on it ""just let me get the goat's bluetooth set up. What did you say Mrs. Johnson was doing on her computer when she got corrupted?""

Mr. Johnson sighed and returned his head to his hands as he slouched back down on the couch ""She was just... on Facebook, I think."" The technician rolled his eyes.

""Any specific apps or games?""

Mr. Johnson thought for a moment ""Ah, I think she mentioned something about uh... 'Farmville VR'?""

The tech snorted, stifling a laugh.

""What?"" demanded Mr. Johnson ""_What_ about this situation could possibly be _funny_?""

""Ah, sorry-- I'm sorry sir,"" the tech adjusted his glasses once more ""It's just... well, its ironic, considering-""

The tablet in the tech's hands beeped loudly, and both Martha and the goat began to convulse for a full second before both fell still. Mr. Johnson rushed up to his wife's side, anxiously stroking her hair and grasping her hand ""Martha! Martha are you okay? Can you hear me now Martha!?""

""Nyeh... n-nyehh?"" bleated the goat, shakily standing back up off the floor

""Uh, Mr. Johnson, your wife isn't actually.... in there, anymore""

""What!?"" cried Mr. Johnson, horrified ""What do you mean... Is she...? Is she.....!?""

The technician shook his head, and gestured down to the goat. ""She's in here, sir.""

""Nyehh!?"" bleated ~~the goat~~ Martha, looking worriedly around the room.

""Is mum a goat now? I've always wanted a goat!"" said Cynthia, running into the room, sounding very excited.

""The transfer went off without without a hitch!"" said the technician, looking pleased as he began to pack up his equipment. He stood up, and straitened his tie ""Well, I hope you folks have a nice rest of your day. Your bill should arrive in the mail.""

""WAIT!"" cried Mr. Johnson as the technician turned towards the door to leave. He looked in distress from the body-formerly-known-as-Martha to the Martha-formerly-known-as-goat, then back up to the somewhat impatient looking technician ""How... how do we.... how will.......""

The human mind is an amazingly stalwart machine. Despite being presented with an absurd situation, in the midst of a thoroughly emotional ordeal, one could very nearly _palpably_ see Mr. Johnson's mind fighting to force a relevant inquiry out of his stammering mouth. 'How do I get her back into her proper body?' he might ask. Or perhaps, 'What do goats eat?' or even 'Can I count a goat as a dependent on my taxes?'.

Unfortunately, all he could manage to ask was: ""...Who's going to cook dinner?""",idiotwizard

That sentence repeated in my head over and over again while I used a sharpie marker to draw a pentagram on the floor with my work computer in its center. How did we get here? Today started out pretty normal, I had my coffee, checked my emails, updated my software next thing I know my monitor's speaking in tongues and my keyboard is leaking blood. I just can't wait for the weeke-

""hey can you hurry up already, demons are hardly perfectionist.""

""Yeah sorry, that should do it. So you're not going to like kill that goat are you? Because I'm not gonna lie, this is some heavy stuff and I'm only a temp.""

""Oh no don’t worry, I wouldn’t hurt a fly. That’s why you're gonna do it.""

""Wait, what? No way! I don't even eat meat, how am I supposed to kill a goat?""

""Maybe you should have thought of that before you got us into this mess! Now take the knife and kill the goat and I'll grab the Necronomicon from my office.""

He puts the goats leash and the knife in my hands and forces my fingers around them, as I look down I see my watch, 3:15, this better count as overtime when we get paid or I swear I'm going to HR. Now that I think about it I did get an email from them earlier, some update for the company computers. Didn’t pay it much mind at the time, just skipped the terms and conditions and clicked accept, I mean who actually reads those thin-

""Are you still standing there!?"" The IT guy yells as he rounds the corner back into the room with a large leather bound book with a title in a language I've never seen before. ""I swear you airheads just run on autopilot until something breaks and have to call me in.""

""I just got daydreaming, long day ya know? Hey did you get that email from HR earlier?""

""yeah could you believe that? The terms and conditions they wanted us to sign off on was like something out here."" as he holds up the Necronomicon. ""Poor new girl must have read it and got a demon in her, good thing I caught it and told everyone not to download it.""

""You did?""

""Yeah I sent it out right aft..er… For the love of god please tell me you didn't download it.""

""I mean lets be honest who ever reads those things?""

""You have GOT to be kidding me! We have a goat on call for sacrifices, I store a Necronomicon in my office, if there was ever a company that you should read 'those things', it would be this one.""

""well you can fix it right? I don't wanna get written up for this, I need a good reference for the college I'm trying for in the fall.""

""Fix it? Not a chance, lesser demons sure but this is an omen from the dark lord himself. I'm hopping town before this building becomes Satan's personal playground, I suggest you do the same, take the goat if it makes you feel better""

As he walks away he quickly paces into a jog and then a sprint as he makes his way out of sight, the goat starts nibbling on the sleeve of my button up dress shirt. I guess I should go put out some job applications.",Jsmith1515

“I called you three hours ago. I have a board meeting in an hour and I can’t get the agendas to print.”  


“Have you tried turning the printer off and on again,” the IT guy asked, still standing in the doorway of my office.  


I rolled my eyes. “Yes, seventeen times. It just keeps giving error 52 when I click print.”  


“Okay, let me take a look.” The IT guy came around the desk and pushed me out of the way.  


I watched as he clicked through menus and options faster than I could read what they were. Finally, he ended on a test print button.


“Hmm,” he muttered. “Yeah that’s not printing.”  


I rolled my eyes once again. “I told you this already.”  


The IT guy moved over to the printer and looked it over, opening a few compartments. He then turned his attention to the small panel on the printer and looked through a few options on it. “Ah, okay. I see what the issue is. I’ll be right back with a few things.”  


“Great, I’ll just wait again.”


Fifteen minutes later the IT guy returned, dragging behind him was a goat on a leash. “Umm,” I uttered. “Why do you have a goat with you?”  


The IT guy raised an eyebrow, “You want the printer fixed, right,” he asked as he took a knife, and syringe from his backpack.  


“Whoa, whoa, whoa, how is killing a goat going to solve anything,” I protested.  


“What? I’m not going to kill the goat. You really don’t know how technology works do you?”  


“Wh-wh-what could you need a goat, knife and syringe for at all to fix a printer,” I questioned. “That’s it. I’m calling security.”  


“Dude,” the IT guy said. “You’re out of magenta ink. The knife is to pop off the ink sensor from the cartridge and the syringe is to draw a little blood from Betty here and refill it.”

It was a pretty quiet day, which is normal for a Tuesday, and suddenly this young guy came barging into the store carrying a laptop. Before I cloud even welcome him to the store, he started practically shouting.

""Dude I'm so glad you're open. My computer's effing possessed.""

I nodded. I'd heard this description plenty of times. Normally the customer had caught a virus. Since this guy was clearly college aged, I figured he probably caught it on a porn site. Viruses online spread like STDs in the red light district.

The guy placed the laptop on my counter. ""I'm not kidding. Please help me.""

I thanked him for bringing the laptop to me and opened the lid. Immediately it began making all sorts of loud noises and pitches that didn't seem to have any rhyme or reason. The computer opened and closed windows faster than I could decipher what they were.

""Wow,"" I said softly to myself, ""this is the worst virus I've ever seen.""

""You don't understand,"" the guy stated gravely. He looked me in the eye. ""It's possessed. Like, straight from the depths of hell possessed. Technically it's my fault, but I didn't expect the summons to actually work.""

I nodded. ""Well you came to the right place then. Let me go get my goat."" I walked out the back of the shop.

Don't ask me why I keep a goat behind the building. There is a reason, but it's not yours to know.

I came back soon after with five candles, a goat, and my demon hunting blade. The customer's eyes went wide as he stared at me.

Methodically, I said a quick prayer for the goat and slit its neck. I then used the blood to create a demon trap on the floor and placed the laptop in the right spot. Having done this many times, I recited the incantation necessary to draw the demon out of the computer, and it appeared as a creature in the trap.

""Go back to hell, demon. You're done here."" I looked at the thing. It was clearly angry, though who knows why it wanted to inhabit a computer so badly.

Finally, I banished the beast. After I was sure it was gone, I picked up the laptop and handed it back to the customer. He looked like he'd seen a ghost.

Well, I mean, he did see a demon and that's enough to make most grown men need a fresh pair of pants. This kid took it pretty well, all things considered.",RegularWoahMan

You've tried to live as long as you could, but you feel death creeping closer and closer.",almis-,"The child’s gasp startled me. Instinctively, I shifted my perspective to get a look at the source of the noise, forgetting I was not visible to anyone. The young boy was standing at the edge of the mountain top I had been resting on. I continued the sweep of my surroundings, and saw who I guessed to be the boy’s father standing a few yards back. The man had a content expression on his face, his attention consumed by the boy. He seemed completely oblivious to the sunrise that enraptured his son.

I joined the boy in viewing the horizon, and pulled energy from the contentment of his father. Of all the sunrises of all the worlds within my Birthright, Earth still had some of my favorites. Light pollution in most parts of the world had diminished the effect some, but there were still a few good spots, if you knew where to look; I’ve had enough time to look everywhere. 

As the last of the sun revealed itself and continued its journey, the father called to his son, who took his time responding; but eventually he heeded the call and turned back. I watched them head back to what I presumed to be their camp when I felt a familiar chill run across my senses. Shit.

Someone must have died down in the village at the base of the mountain. It was near, and there was no way It could not tell I was close. After a moment the chill subsided. Death was gone for now, off to ferry the one who had past, but I knew It would return to try and pick up my trail. I stood and sighed as I stretched. I did not get to visit Earth that often anymore; Death was ever present here, and as the world continued to grow, it only had more work to do.

Other planets in my Birthright had achieved conditions for life to begin, though only a handful had managed to sustain it long enough for that life to achieve sentience; fewer still had made it past tribal existence. But those had happened when I was young, and all but Earth were now lifeless. I had hid too long among their people, and Death had followed me to them all. 

I was still tired. The unexpected loss of life in the village had cut my rest short, and Death was very efficient in its responsibilities, owing to its incalculable experience, as I gathered my strength and tried to decide my next destination, that familiar chill returned. Double shit. I wouldn’t be able to travel fast enough. My heart sank as I remembered the two people on the mountain. The anticipation of the pain of loss and rage I would feel from the young boy built even as I appeared in front of him and his father. A cry of surprise came from the man as he spotted the form I assumed, and he pushed the boy behind him.

“I am sorry. It is you or everything.”

The man dropped to the ground as I finished speaking. The boy gave a shout and dropped to his knees, shaking the lifeless body in a futile attempt to wake his father. I pulled a few precious gems from the earth and placed them on the body’s chest.

“I know this cannot repay you, but it is the best I can do.”

A strangled cry came from the boy as he reached for the knife on his father’s belt. I was gone by the time he looked up, scared off by the cold breeze that shook the trees harshly. With the man’s life force in hand, I fled, feeding off the energy to travel fast enough that Death could not follow. The chill faded as it stopped over boy and the body, and I kept running.",Elrim
"[WP] You caught a burglar red-handed, but he doesn't know you're breaking in too.",axmszr,"The sound of shattered glass told me that I was no longer alone. It was subtle, though, not a loud crescendo but a faint series of cracking echoes that only a trained ear would identify. I knew that to avoid unnecessary attention, they had used a specific tool designed to break through glass with minimal mess and noise. That meant a fellow professional. My heart hammered in my chest as frustration built inside of me. I was supposed to be alone, damnit. The Leigh’s were out to some fancy play, which wouldn’t end for another forty-five minutes. I’d been watching the Leigh’s for a couple of weeks now, so I knew that a direct trip home wasn’t very likely, because Mrs. Leigh liked to stop for a nightcap. They always visited some popular bar for one last laugh and one last chance to make the night last a little longer. So I really had about two hours, if my estimations were correct. Which meant this job was supposed to be about as easy as it gets: get in, steal some valuable shit, and leave like nothing ever happened. A wonderful, dreamy job for a girl like me. 

The Leigh’s were the kind of patron that one of my profession dreamed of robbing. Buying above their means, they liked to live flashy. That meant lots of small, expensive things littered the house – jewelry, electronics, clothes. You name it. And I’ve been doing this long enough that I have a good idea of what to leave, keep, and sell. Tonight was going to set me up to live comfortably for the next couple of months, which is a long time for someone like me to live steady. 

Except now some unknown asshole just messed things up for me. Grinding my teeth together, I measure my breathing and step back to blend into the shadows of the room. I left the house lights off for obvious reasons, so with my dark clothes, it’s easy enough to obscure myself from sight. I’m in the living room, tucked between the shelf of a big, flat-screen TV and Mr. Leigh’s personal minibar. I crouch down slightly so the furniture better covers me, but I make sure to angle myself in such a way that I can see the entryway to the living room from my position. The asshole can’t see me, but you better believe I’ll be able to see him. 

I’ve had enough practice that I’m able to control my physical reactions and discomforts, ignoring the strain in my muscles from squatting awkwardly, and I rest silently. I wait for what feels like an eternity before someone walks into the living room.   

A large shape fills the doorway, and a figure slowly enters the room. I tense, muscles ready to flee in case this person sees me, but it turns out I have nothing to fear. Although my vision is somewhat limited in the dark room, the figure looks to be a large, adult man. He prowls too quickly into the room and looks around distractedly. He observes the room, eyes wide at the opulent splendor so causally displayed, and his gaze skims right over my hidden corner between the TV and the mini bar. He glances around a little more, when suddenly his eyes swing back toward my direction, and stay there. A manic grin splits his face, his teeth reflecting white in the dark, and adrenaline shoots through my body, carried deftly by my rushing blood. Well, crap. He definitely sees me. 

“Ohhhhhh, yeah, come to papa,” he says, unconcerned by his loud voice that booms in the quiet, and he begins to walk closer to me. My body freezes, muscles coiled and ready, and I silently hold my breath. I watch him rush toward me, the rest of the room abruptly forgotten, but he angles to the side and instead approaches the lavish minibar. I breathe out a long, quiet breath in relief, my muscles still tingling from the shot of adrenaline. But now, standing two feet from my crouched position, he leans over the bar counter to enthusiastically view Mr. Leigh’s selection of alcohol. His stance puts him fully into my line of sight, up close and personal. As he chooses a rich brandy and moves to pour it into a glass, I gaze up at the man who ruined my night. His clothes are the first thing I notice, and my eyes widen. This guy is wearing khaki pants and a short-sleeved Hawaiian shirt, the kind with obnoxiously bright colors in patterns of leaves and flowers. Slowly following the line of his tall body down, my eyes reach his feet, and my jaw drops. Flip flops. Dude is wearing fucking flip flops. As he slurps his brandy like the delicacy I’m sure it is if one likes the natural taste of motor oil, a sudden thought occurs to me. No way in hell this guy is a professional. Just no way. He looks more like an errant surfer who somehow wondered into the mansion. My mansion. 

I smile silently to myself, realizing that all hope is not lost and that tonight can still be salvaged. In fact, I think as I once again look over this amateur asshole, things might even be a little fun. My smile turns abruptly predatory as I formulate my plan of action, and I know that this guy doesn’t even stand a chance.

She smiled and waved as she walked toward the podium. She was dressed in black slacks and a red sweater, her black hair pulled back in a ponytail. She waited to speak until the crowd’s roar died down. She seemed to take a moment to compose herself before she began speaking.

“I paced as I rang Dr. Yates, my college roommate and best friend. There was no one I’d trust with this data but her. Grimly smiling to myself, I realized there was no one else I’d expect not to laugh me out of the room before I could even finish my theory. Fortunately she and I bonded long ago on marathons of The X-Files and our love of the “I want to believe” mantra. I trusted her with this.”

The audience laughed at this. Dr. Yamaguchi’s well documented love of The X-Files had brought back Scully and Mulder in a big way. Many people in the audience were sporting t-shirts that featured Dr. Yamaguchi in a mashup with Scully and the words, “I Want to Believe” printed below.

‘‘As best I can tell, yeah this looks like a nuclear reactor explosion,’ Andrea’s voice sounded strained over the connection, ‘I mean, this is all just radiation imaging, but the signs are all there, and the half-life of the samples you gave me checks out with the time frame you gave me, but Maddie, where did you find degrading uranium that dates back to the Cretaceous period?’”

“It was an excellent question, but the answer, even in that moment still shocked me.”

“I slumped back in my chair, stunned. How could we have gotten it so wrong? I wondered, but even as the question entered my mind, I knew the answer. We got it wrong because we’d been looking for little green men. We’ve been looking for intelligent life for so long, but we’ve essentially been looking for ourselves. Maybe smaller, maybe green, but more or less human. Yet here I was, looking at our own history, and finding intelligent life right here in our own backyard. Well, the pool at least.”

“Let me start from the beginning, I’m an archeologist. However, I’ve never been all that fond of dirt, so I’ve spent my career digging around the bottom of the ocean. I’ll take a submersible and the bends any day of the week compared to sharing a bedroll with a scorpion. 

“So that’s how I found myself working on the Chicxulub Crater. Otherwise known as the crash site that killed the dinosaurs. The well established fact was, up until about ten seconds before anyway, that a meteor smashed into Earth with enough force to liquefy the bedrock and send a concentric wave of molten rock flying in the air. This, presumably, also destroyed any and all organic matter in the impact zone. I was there to see if there were any alien microbes that may have seeded the Earth from the meteor. What I found was…not that. What I found was odd, to say the least.

The crash site has a clearly concentric shape, you can see it from space. Along the ring are a series of sinkholes called cenotes, and collectively, they are known as “The Ring of Cenotes”. Geologists aren’t exactly known for their naming creativity, I know, but the cenotes themselves are what concerned me. At the bottom of each cenote is decaying organic matter, which releases carbon dioxide, which in turn is constantly eroding the cenote over time. The delicate nature of the cenotes have made the Mexican government very protective, and since the discovery of the crater site, they really haven’t let scientists explore their bases. 

Well I managed to come up with a system of observation that satisfied the Mexican government. Finally. You see, the mineral chemical reactions of the cenotes, and their corresponding life forms, are pretty unique. I’d been dying to take a peek inside for over a decade. Then one day, out of the blue, I got the call. It took me a month to get the dive prepped, but I finally got my peek. The cenotes weren’t just sinkholes, they were time capsules."" 

“I’m not sure I would have connected the dots if my grandmother wasn’t a Hiroshima maiden. When the United States dropped the nuclear bomb on Hiroshima, not everyone died, some were just terribly maimed, like my grandmother. Facing horrible discrimination, and treated like lepers in their own country, the Hiroshima maidens came to America to receive plastic surgery. They toured the United States, where my grandmother met my grandfather. They stayed in America, but my family traveled back to Japan often, and I’ve been to the memorial, and I’ve seen the pictures of the nuclear shadows from that day. And that is exactly what I was looking at, down at the bottom of a cenote, formed on top of a meteor crater, formed millions of years ago. Dozens of nuclear shadows. All of them looked like jellyfish. 

The reason you don’t see many prehistoric jellyfish in museums is because they don’t exist. Their soft bodies and lack of skeletons just don’t hold up well to decay and the sands of time. Literally, unless you have very fine silt, you’re not going to see a jellyfish fossil. Yet here were the perfect shadows of some ancient species, forever buried in a perfect time capsule off the Yucatan peninsula. This, in and of itself, was profoundly exciting. Even if these jellyfish existed after the crash, their preservation was profoundly unique. Yet, as I looked around the cenotes, it occurred to me that their dimensions were oddly perfect, and that the shadows appeared only on the walls furthest from the center of the impact crater. All of the jellyfish had the same orientation, upright, with their tentacles reaching toward the Earth. In some of the cenotes, there appeared to be other shadows, often overlapping the bottoms of the jellyfish tentacles. Some of the tentacle shadows seemed to be on top of the apparatus. 

It dawned on me suddenly that what I was looking at were in fact some sort of apparatus that the jellyfish were interacting with. It’s such a hard thing to accept that a creature has intelligence. We can accept that a crow can use a stick as a tool, and that elephants mourn their dead, but accepting intelligence on a level similar to humans is nigh on impossible. It’s what has set us apart from the animal kingdom, given us dominion as we see fit. 

So you can understand why even as a sat looking at the image of jellyfish operating something I still didn’t believe that I was seeing a jellyfish operating anything. ‘You’re anthropomorphizing, you just want to believe,’ I muttered to myself.”

“Yet still, the thought was there. What were all of these upright jellyfish doing, gathered in a circle around the impact crater? I didn’t have all the right questions, because there was a reason I went into archeology and not physics. What I lacked in knowledge of nuclear fission I made up in observation skills though. And I know my rocks pretty well. What I was seeing from the interior of the cenotes indicated that the limestone that covers the impact sight might not extend down as far as everyone thinks. The interior of the cenotes were made up of a material that I didn’t recognize. It was incredibly hard, but when I got it out of the water, it melted immediately. I carefully extracted another sample, this time being sure to keep it in it’s natural environment, and depth pressure. The material was quite light, but its Mohs level was also very high. Over time I would discover its water permeability and, unfortunately, its radiation permeability."" 

“It took time, but eventually a clear picture emerged. The crater was not, in fact, an impact crater, but a test site. The shadows of the creatures on the wall were testing nuclear fission. Considering the impact on the Earth, and the proximity of the Jellies, we assume it was a first test that went horribly awry. 

As I began exploring the floor of the test site, and trying to test the organic matter that made up the dense walls and crater floor, more of the story began unfolding. It would appear that whatever had been built there, all the equipment, everything used to created the nuclear fission experiment, all of it had been made of organic, dissolving matter. I of course cannot take credit for this, whatever had been there dissolved long ago, but I did make one more profound discovery that was key to unlocking the puzzle. Or, more correctly, I should say, they found me.”

At this moment, Dr. Tamaguchi turns as a large glass water tank is wheeled onstage. Inside, the blue and purple streaked dome of a Jelly is flashing wildly, and several of its tentacles wave out as the crowd goes wild.

“Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage Ambassador Gunka!” Dr. Tamaguchi shouts out over the roar of the audience. “If the Jellies had not monitored the explosion site, had not left the deep depths to approach me, we would never have had the honor of collaborating with our gelatinous counterparts to open new doors in science and diplomacy, both above and below the blue line!”

"[WP] You and your partner have been dating for a long time and plan on getting married. The day before you go to sign your wedding license, your partner wins the lottery and runs away, cutting all contact with you.",kjs106,"It seems like just yesterday when my life took a sharp turn. The pain still lingers like a pest that just won’t leave you alone. 

It was five years ago, I fell in love with a magnificent woman named Ella. I never thought of myself as a sexual person until I met her. I saw her at the corner of the bar in my hometown. We struck up a conversation and next thing I know we’re lying on the cold grass of a local park, looking at the stars.... drunk off our asses and talking about the wonders of life. It was then that I formed a type of bond that could be poisonous to break. 

At that moment I decided I wanted this woman, no one else could take her away from me. 
I’m a very cold gal, I never was too affectionate. I soon found myself giving all of who i am to Ella. Days turned into weeks, weeks turned into months, and soon enough those months turned into years. 

On our 3rd anniversary, Ella waited until I woke up and took me to the beach. “There’s something I need to show you, it’s this really cool shell I found under the pier! I saw it and thought of your pretty little face.” Said Ella lovingly. I blushed. After 10 minutes of walking the sand turned into pebbles, and those pebbles began getting bigger and bigger. Rocks everywhere. I began to struggle walking through the rocks, so Ella grabbed my hand and led the way. 

I searched all around me, trying to find this cool shell Ella was raving about. “I’m confused.. there’s no shell here. All I see are rocks!” I said. A smile crept onto Ella’s face, as she asked me to look closer. There I saw a beautiful shell, it was almost an onyx color. It seemed unreal. “Sometimes, when something is very rare it’s hard to find. It blends until you look a bit closer. Open it.” Said Ella.

As I open the shell I feel a glimmer of light temporarily blind me. Once my eyes adjusted again I saw something that made my heart drop: a wedding ring. Boogers and tears start falling everywhere and Ella looks me in the eyes and says “you are one in a million and I’m the one who found you. Will you marry me?” 

I wrapped my arms and legs around her, almost knocking her over and screamed “HELL YES!!!” 
We laughed hysterically like two schoolgirls, and giggled our way back to the car. A few months later, I’m looking at different centerpieces we could use at our wedding. The phone rings. “Hello?” I Said. “............Ella..?” Spoke an unfamiliar voice. “No, I’m sorry this is Summer, Ella’s fiancé. Who is this?” I asked curiously. 

There’s silence and then..... the call ends. Strange, I thought. When Ella got home I asked her about who could’ve wanted to talk to her. She seemed very nervous and conflicted. “Uh..It was my cousin Sydney!!! Yea, she probably wanted to know if she could borrow something.” Hmm. I decided to go on Facebook and find her cousin Sydney, I thought it was strange that I’d never heard her name before. 

I searched and came up with nothing. Later that night while Ella was in the shower I decided to snoop on her phone. It didn’t take too long for me to find out that this “Sydney” person was actually named Farrah. My heart started to shrivel up. I felt ice run through my veins. I put the phone down. 

Shopping always helped me. I went to the mall, visited a couple clothing stores, a gag shop, an electronics store, and a shoe store. As I’m walking out of the mall with two small shopping bags I froze. I turned my head and saw to my right a jewelry store. Inside, there was a couple trying on engagement rings. I fucking gagged. 

When I got home, Ella was not there. I called her, but she didn’t pick up. Shortly after, I get a text saying “sorry babe, boss called me in for the night to work on a big case and he needs me to go over some of the files. Will be long night. See you tomorrow, love you.” I looked at my phone with a blank and empty stare. I felt numb. 

After getting ready for bed, I cried myself to sleep for the first time in 8 years. Grow the fuck up summer. Stop being a little bitch. Be strong. Keep your head up high. I kept repeating the same things to myself over and over again in my head until I finally fell into a deep sleep. The next morning, I woke up at around 1:30 PM and went to the kitchen to make myself some coffee. 

I found a note. “I’m sorry to do this through a note, but I can’t do this anymore. Life works in crazy ways, I have been seeing someone else behind your back. These past few months I’ve realized that I can do better, and i can be happier. I don’t care anymore....I’m so sorry. To add onto that, I won the 1 million dollar lottery and I’m leaving you. I bought a non refundable ticket to Paris, and you will never see me again. Best of luck. -Ella.  P.s. I left the toaster oven for you, as well as the wine glasses. 


“AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!” I SCREAMED at the top of my lungs until there was no air left in my body. My anger boiled and soon turned into laughter. Uncontrollable, insane laughter. I walked into the closet to find that Ella didn’t even bother to take her clothes, or her shoes. She’s a millionaire now, right? I found a couple other things she kept stored under the bed, and once I gathered all her trash I threw it out the window, like garbage. The same way she betrayed me and threw me away like yesterday’s newspaper. 


I changed the locks. Three weeks go by, and I get a call. I pick up, and to my disgust it’s her. She’s crying. “Summer I know you don’t want to talk to me right now but... I really need your help, I used all the money I had in my bank account and now I’m stuck in France with no way of coming back to the US. Please, Summer can you send me some money so I can fly back home? We can work on our relationship. I’m sorry for leaving you. This turned into a disaster.” 

Ha. Hahahahahaha. Hahahahahahahahahahahaha........ my face lit up for the first time in almost a month. I smile sheepishly, and say “oh, Ella. I thought you were a millionaire now.... unless...the lotto ticket you used was the one left on the counter. In that case... you’re fucked. Nowadays you can find a believable fake lotto ticket anywhere. So you have, no money AT ALL?” I asked assertively. “Wha.. huh? Oh my god..... no..” she began to stutter. “...I.. I.. ha.. have no money left...” She whispered. 

I paused for a long while, took a deep breath and then, I spoke. “I don’t care anymore. Au Revoir bitch.” 

Feeling pleased with myself, I took out one of MY wine glasses, poured some red wine, and stuffed a frozen pizza into the toaster oven. I never spoke to her again.

"[WP] Before you go through the new expiremental treatment, you go to get yourself copied. You enter, lie down on the blue bed, close your eyes - and the procedure is over. You sit up and see your copy - and he is sitting on the blue bed.",pitz_f,"To say I was having second thoughts would have been a pretty extreme understatement. Obviously the treatment was still new, and they had told me the risks--physical and mental--going in. But seeing him there, in the bed that I'd been in... it was messing with my head.

""Is something wrong?"" the nurse asked. I looked at him, and I guess the fear I was feeling must have been evident in my eyes. He tried to move quickly for the restraints, but he wasn't fast enough. I bolted up out of the bed, knocking over a tray of instruments at the bedside. The nurse was loudly calling for intervention over the radio.

""Please, we warned you this would happen!"" he barked. ""The procedure involves a duplication of consciousness, too! Just be still! You wanted this!""

He wasn't wrong. I did want this at one point. Waking up in a new body passed that point. I pushed the OR door open and sped through the hallway, naked as the day I was born. My mind was racing. This was my body, but it was new. It had been made from stem cells. They had warned me about the consciousness duplication, but I didn't realize it would be like this. I didn't realize I would just be myself in a different body.

As I ran, my thoughts turned to my clone. It was still burning up my mind. When I had gone in for the procedure, I had laid down on the same blue bed I'd seen the clone in when I woke up; it just didn't make any sense.

My mind was pushing back against the idea that I was the clone, but I knew it as surely as I knew my own name. As that knowledge slowly settled in my mind, my pace began to slow. I could hear the hurried feet of attendants and nurses in the hallway behind me. As I slowed, so did they, until I stopped completely.

Hands roughly grabbed me and restrained me, pulling me back toward the OR. My mind was empty. I was going to be vivisected and my organs harvested, and I was the person who had signed my own death warrant.",ThreeEyedCrow1

You sit up and see your copy - and he is sitting on the blue bed.",pitz_f,"It's like hearing a recording of your own voice, or when you see a picture of yourself from an unusual angle...except worse. My nose looks so bulbous. With the table pressing against the back of my sides, it's clear that the flavor-blasts I've been eating have not been doing me any favor. I had a moment of thinking in frustration of all the squats I'd done in the gym - only to end up looking like that. 

Then I notice my penis. For some reason, the first word that pops into my head is ""turtle"" and then I can't shake it. 

As I stretch, I take a moment to think how odd it is that they flipped the position of the beds in the room. That seems like just *asking* for trouble. And surely it would have been more logical to not use blue for both...

I glanced down. I was sitting in a bed with red sheets. 

Instantly, I knew something was wrong. Somehow, my copy had switched places with me. I glanced at the tech, who was focused on his datapad. I looked back at the dupe. His eyes were still closed - he must be feigning sleep. Natural. He'd already gotten into position, all he had to do was wait and he'd be home free. 

Frantic thoughts. I have to act. 

I hear the tech begin to speak: ""Alright, now, Mr. Davis..."" and can't help watching, with perverse fascination, as my eyes open.

A moment later, I spring up from the bed just as my copy begins to sit up. I lunge, tackling myself, making sure we end up on the floor. 

""Hey! No! Umm. Don't! Uhh...*shit.*"" The tech slams his hand on a sensor in his desk and immediately the lights get much brighter. A calm, professional woman's voice says: *Quick Response, to Room A96. Quick Response, to Room A96.* 

I look over at myself, expecting to see that smug, shit-eating grin people are always telling me I get when I feel like someone has made a mistake. Instead, my duplicate is studying my face somberly, looking at me like my ex once had when I asked her if we could sleep together one last time. 

The doors open and a woman dressed all in white enters, flanked by two body-armored guards. One of them moves to the keypad and seals the door while the other watches us closely. The woman glances briefly at the two of us, naked twins sitting on the floor. Then she talks over to the tech.

""Paulsen,"" she hisses, ""Do you remember what they said at orientation?"" 

The tech - Paulsen - stares meekly up at the woman. ""About...time off?"" 

She stares at him and I almost think I can see his soul withering under her gaze. ""No,"" she says. ""Be careful not to blink your eyes, if you do, the wrong man may die."" 

""Oh..."" Paulsen says. ""Right, Dr. Kim, I remember now."" 

I can't help but snicker at this, and note an echo coming from my left.

""Bring up the camfeed, please.""

Paulsen licks his lips. ""Uh..."" He glances at his datapad, and swipes listlessly at the screen a few times. ""The...camfeed. Yes...""

I shiver, and not just from the icy glare Dr. Kim is directing at Paulsen. 

""Where is your senior tech, Paulsen?"" The flood of saccharine in her tone is jarring. 

""So...he stepped out...he had a call."" 

""And you thought you would go ahead and do it without him?"" Again, that sickening sweetness. 

""I thought the client...might be getting impatient. So I figured I would...you know, help."" 

Without looking away, Dr. Kim beckons to the guard who had operated the keypad. He strides over to her and, drawing a silver rod to Paulsen's neck, who slumps out of his chair onto the floor.

Dr. Kim grabs the datapad and walks briskly over to us. ""Misters Davis, we have a problem."" The doctor gives a signal to both the guards, who walk behind myself and my dupe. I feel the cold kiss of metal on my skin and, a moment later, everything goes black.

""You like to what? What does that even mean? Do you dress up as one?""

""Well, I mean I guess, but all you really have to do is put on a stained white t-shirt and jeans."" He chuckled.

""Oh, most of the trolls I have seen only wear like a loin cloth or something.""

"[WP]Two people talk about trolls. But one thinks that they discuss internet-trolls, while the another thinks that they discuss folklore trolls.",roboq6,"I was sitting at the bar trying to mind my own business and succeeding at it when the woman next to me decided to speak up.  I guess she had seen something on the TV news that prompted her to say something, but between the TV volume being off and me being blind, I didn't know what it was.

""Oh god, that's just awful, the things these trolls are doing.  Like can you imagine if you were that poor girl being picked on every day to the point where you felt like you had to kill yourself?  They should do something about them, isn't there something the government can do to protect the children from them?""

The bartender grunted, not for the purpose of agreeing or disagreeing with her, but because sometimes you're just supposed to make a noise at someone after they've said something.  It lets them think you're listening.  I turned and pointed my face at where her head probably was and said, ""It's interesting you say that.  I've had some encounters with trolls myself.""

""What?""

""I said I've dealt with trolls.""

""Oh. I know! Isn't it just awful?  I just wish they would do something.""

I heard her sip her drink and after that she was quiet.  I got the feeling she didn't want to talk to me but I wasn't bothered by it.  She probably thought I was trying to pick her up, but for all I knew or cared she looked like a troll herself.  It's one thing to be blind, but it's another to be impotent.  When your eyes don't work and your dick doesn't either, it's not a surprise that your philosophy takes a turn towards nihilism and you don't mind fucking with strangers as a form of entertainment.  Even the toughest thug will hesitate to beat up an old blind man, which means I can say almost anything I want to anybody.  Good for a cheap laugh if nothing else.

""Have you ever met one?,"" I asked.

""A troll?""

""Yeah""

""I don't think so, but how could I tell?  What do they look like?""

""How the fuck should I know? I'm blind.""

I could tell that her face had turned red.  I was only messing with her, of course, but now she felt bad and I knew she would keep listening to me out of embarassment and a feeling like she owed me something after being so insensitive.

She stammered ""Sorry, I didn't mean --"" 

I interrupted her, ""I joined the Army when I was 18.  Went through bootcamp and ended up on assignment in Europe.  There were no wars going on at the time so it was mostly drills and PT and administrative bullshit to pass the time.""

""Wait, you were in the Army?  But how --""

""I wasn't blind yet.  I was a regular dumbass teenager with eyes and a dick that still worked.  Matter of fact, my dick used to get so hard that I could punch a hole right through a sheet of eighth inch plywood; we used to have contests. We'd start with a couple sheets of paper stacked together and we'd make the FNG hold it while we took turns trying to stab our penises through.  We worked our way up, adding more and more paper.  Some guys could do a sheet or two of cardboard even, but I was the only guy that could do plywood.""

""The FNG?""

""The Fucking New Guy.  Anyway, I digress.  My dick's not what it once was but that's not the point.  I was statione--""

""That's disgusting by the way.  I can't believe you'd say that stuff to a lady.""

""Oh, are you a lady?  My mistake.  Like I was saying, I was stationed in Norway for awhile and in the winters it got fucking cold.  We'd always find vermin in the barracks looking for shelter from the cold and we used to catch them and throw them out the window and see if we could shoot them before they hit the ground.  Well, one day we found a creature that didn't look like any other we had seen.  He was big and almost looked human.  My buddy Jake had cornered him in his room but we were all afraid to go near it.  He stank like hell, had broken almost everything in the room, and everytime we went to open the door he hissed and charged at us.  After some brainstorming we devised a sort of trap to catch him.  We got some claymores from the armory and set them facing the door, positioned carefully so it would only hit his legs.  Then we opened the door and covered our ears and let him charge right into the claymores.  He fell writhing on the ground, shrieking and flailing his arms trying to grab us.  Two of the guys jumped on his arms and pinned him down and the rest of us cautiously moved closer to inspect him.  That's when we realized that we had just caught a troll.""

""What? A troll? How did you know it was a troll? It's not like they actually look physically different from normal people, right?""

""Of course they do, if you know what to look for.  They have a mark on their foreheads that looks just like a tree.  As they age, the tree mark ages like a real tree would, growing new branches and increasing in width.  That's how you can tell how old a troll is.  The tree even goes through the seasons each year, growing leaves in the spring and shedding them in the fall.  We used to hang out at the bars near the base and the locals had told us about trolls, but of course we had just dismissed it as fairy tale shi--""

""No! You're talking about real actual trolls? Like fairy tale trolls?  No way! I'm talking about internet trolls, you know, trolls who leave posts and messages and stuff online.  You know, just to piss people off because they're immature and think it's funny but it's really just mean and insensitive and it can really hurt people.""

""Oh you mean they talk shit to strangers and try to make them mad because they think it's funny.""

""Yes! For fucks sake...""

""Like what I've been doing to you?""

Suddenly my face was wet and a little sticky and I smelled the house red dripping from my hair and face into my lap.  Before that, I had thought women only threw drinks on guys in movies when the writers hadn't met their quota of cliches for the screenplay.  She stood up, knocking the barstool over, and collected her things.  She huffed and puffed out the door and slammed it shut while the bartender was probably literally rolling on the floor laughing.  I heard him guffaw and sputter and gasp between howls of laughter, until he was out of breath and simply shook in silence.  At least I'm still good for a cheap laugh, if nothing else.

"[WP] the zombie apocalypse started a couple years back. You and a small group of people has survived thus far. One day, all of the smoke detectors in your area start beeping due to low battery. (Taken from /r/showerthoughts)",AX_ZonE,"Jeremy stood atop the handmade wooden balcony, which bounced and shook with the wind. He looked out over the surrounding city blocks, with a clear view of the area for miles.

Up and down the road was relatively clear. The rusted-over frames of cars had been pushed off to the shoulders, their tires and doors stolen for scrap.

Piles of corpses up to five feet high sat in the yards where they laid, rotting and stinking, until the time that they would be burned and scattered to the wind.

Through his scratched-up rifle scope, he kept a close watch on all sides of him, making sure no walkers came without him seeing. These days, however, that was hardly an issue. Strategically placed barricades combined with the procedural killing of zombies meant that very few of them ever showed up now.

He could hear the murmur of people in the floors below, and a subtle hum of an gas generator behind him could be detected. These were noises he had learned to tune out by the third hour of watch. In the relative silence, no longer filled with the bustle of cars and people, he strained his ears, listening.

He heard something. He whirled around wildly, trying to pinpoint the exact location of it. He turned his ear northward, cupping his ears in a C shape as he held his rifle in the other hand. He heard it clearly now, a steady beeping that he had not heard for a long time.

An out-of-battery smoke detector.

Then another beeping began, and another, and another, until the entire street was filled with the beeping of the long unused smoke detectors. It echoed up and down, bouncing between houses, and eventually making it's way into the world beyond their safe barricades.

Jeremy looked through his scope again, looking up and down the street once more. This time, instead of seeing the devastation and ruin he had become so used to, he saw something more. He could already see the zed gathering at the barricades. A single infected human had very little strength, but even twenty people was enough to break it.

In an instant, he was down the stairs, shouting out to everyone that could hear.

Their own smoke detector had gone off, but quickly silenced with a bullet. Within minutes, their small group of fifteen people took up positions in their house, broken up into three groups of five. There the waited as the barricades cracked and splintered, the infected soon to be upon the house.

Before long, their home, for a long time a fortress of safety and happiness, was swarmed by infected. At least fifty of them crowded on each side, climbing through windows and breaking apart the wooden boards.

In vain, the survivors tried to hold them back. Each axe cut limbs clean off, each baseball bat shattered skulls, and their few guns easily devastated the ranks of the infected.

It was for naught. They first broke through on the northern side, overwhelming the team and resulting in their collapse. Their screeching echoed throughout the home.

They pulled back to the second floor, ten survivors left to hold off against a horde of at least 150 infected. Jeremy took frantic but careful shots with his bolt-action rifle, clearing two infected per shot. The corpses blocked the stairwell, but the zed merely climbed over them.

He looked through his scope again, took aim again, but faltered when he saw her red hair. He tried to pull the trigger, but his body froze, leaving his mind trapped in a prison. His heart pounded as he stared her in her lifeless eyes, a gash across her forehead where she'd been pulled into the horde.

His lips quivered, his hands began to shake, and his eyes became moist. 

In his moment of hesitation, their defense failed. The infected seemed to sense his sadness and attacked with renewed vigor, somehow mustering the strength to sprint up the stairs. Their little team was reduced once more into a team of eight as they fell back to the attic, their last stand.

Jeremy gave his rifle to someone else as he sat with his back against the wall and his heads in his hands. He grabbed his hair in bunches, his entire body ever-so-slightly shaking.

He heard the gunfire start up again, heard them note how low on ammo they were. He could hear the low murmur of the infected as they moaned in pain, and the low humming of the generator as it continued onward, unaware that its inhabitants had no more need for it.

And though Jeremy joined the fight once more, a fire poker in hand, jabbing and stabbing, he knew in his heart of hearts that they would fail.

His mind went to autopilot as he blindly stabbed, his conscious thought regressing into the back of his head. It was the only way he was able to continue.

""One more bullet!"" someone called out, switching instead to a melee weapon.

It was then that Jeremy had a brilliant idea. All at once his mind came into consciousness again, and he shouted for them to simply buy time. That was all he needed.

And the whir of the generator was replaced with silence as it was unplugged and wheeled toward the stairs. The others screamed at Jeremy, telling him to get back. He heeded not their words as he shoved it down the stairs, watching it run over an infected or two.

He turned back, told the man with the rifle to shoot it when the time was right. Then, into the fray he went, firepoker in hand as he shoved it deeper and deeper into the horde. He stabbed and jousted, but they were too many for Jeremy. Even now he could feel his poker dulling with every strike.

Jeremy realized when he was finished, and narrowly managed to avoid being dragged back and killed by the infected. He screamed up the stairs, ""Shoot! SHOOT!"" as he labored his way up, his limbs screaming for him to stop.

As he cleared the top landing, he heard the gunshot. For an agonizing moment they waited, unsure if it would go off or not. Then, with an earth-shattering *ka-boom!* the gas generator exploded, taking part of the attic stairs and much of the floors and walls along with it.

Relief filled the attic, each of the eight survivors cheering and whooping. Jeremy, however, left them to celebrate as he walked out onto the balcony.

He could see more. In the distance, both ways, more infected were crowding the streets as the smoke detectors continued to blare. The battle was not over yet.

"[WP] the zombie apocalypse started a couple years back. You and a small group of people has survived thus far. One day, all of the smoke detectors in your area start beeping due to low battery. (Taken from /r/showerthoughts)",AX_ZonE,"""Andrew, wake up.""

Andrew woke up, his eyes opening so slowly it was as if it was carrying a burdensome weight. He then focused his somewhat blurry gaze into the dark figure who was waking him up.

""Andrew, wake up. Your turn for patrol.""

Patrol? What patrol? All Andrew was, or had been, was an accountant and nothing more. However as his mind comes back to reality, he then started to realise the reality. A zombie apocalypse. Fighting for survival. Mayhem. Then unity among friends.

""Oh yeah, sorry John.""

John reached out his hand, which Andrew then grabbed and hoisted himself up. He rose slowly as if he held a heavy burden in his slim body. He walked through the messy apartment floor, by the blocked stairway filled with metallic furniture, and then went up to the rooftop with the wood creaking with every heavy step he took. There, he saw another one of his friends, Amanda, holding a handheld radio in her hands, gazing into the empty and abandoned city of Seattle being lit with the pale blue light of the full moon. There Andrew could see the many bodies lying on the streets and many bodies moving around, scuffling in the night. Although it had been many years since the Infection appeared, as Hannah said, the dead don't rot in Seattle.

""Hey Amanda. You can go down now, I'll take over. Does it work by the way?""

""No, I don't have anything. Been trying to send a message but no one came through.""

Her breath slowed down as her chest dropped slowly as if she had a burden.

""You okay?""

""Yeah, I'm okay. Just a bit tired, that's all.""

""Amanda.""

""Yeah?""

""I want to tell you something.""

""Hmm?""

Amanda turned her head to face Andrew, with her white face glimmering from the pale moonlight and with her eyebrows rising high alongside dilating light blue pupils, seemingly focused on Andrew. His heart raced quicker and he felt just a little warmer in the night. His gaze stayed fixed upon her delicate face that always seemed so happy despite the reality, and her short auburn hair flowing in wind moving with such freedom.

But then everything ceased as they started hearing a strange high-frequency sound. At first it started way into the far distance and then spread. Their confused minds then pondered into what the noise was, and then realised of what it was.

Smoke alarms. Thousands of them.

Andrew saw Amanda's face as screaming surfaced from down below. Dilated pupils, raised eyebrows, and mouth as wide as the moon itself. She seemed afraid, and yet still brave. Amanda ran to the stairs and then yelled,

""Everyone get upstairs now!""

The team then quickly rushed upstairs and the seven individuals gazed to the bottom as thousands of the undead screamed and ran everywhere, to the screeching of the alarm, including their apartment as well.

Upon seeing this, they immediately moved with such haste in fear of their lives. They took their firearms and then stood by the entryway to the floor on which they inhabit for months, the East Stairway and West Stairway, located 200ft away from each other. The six then immediately split in two, three to watch the east and three to watch the west. Andrew went east with Amanda, and John went west. They all then stood on the landing, awaiting as the deafening screams of the undead rushed into the building.

Shots rang out throughout the building. Machine gun noise drowned out all yelling by both survivor and undead alike. The sound of countless bullet casings fell into the floor, echoing alongside the screams of bodies hitting the floor and screams of the survivors. Magazines were emptied and reloaded, their empty casings falling. Ammunitions grows low and bodies are starting to stack up. As machine guns run low, handguns were pulled out and they too were depleted in the blink of an eye.

""We're all out! Throw everything, throw the guns! Throw the mags!""

As the final round was fired, they could still see the undead piling in. Accepting their fate, Andrew and Amanda turned to each other, and pulled the other into themselves with their lips touching and meeting finally after months. As the swarm continued, some of the survivors like Andrew and Amanda made their peace while some like John, threw everything at them, including the weapons and magazines. Even though it is their final moment, at least it was spent being together.

\*BANG!*

The sound of gunfire then rang through the building and echoed throughout the building. It wasn't the survivors, they had no more ammunition. Andrew and Amanda stopped, and turned to see a man wearing a green jacket on the base of the stairs, holding an automatic machine gun.

And then tens of men wearing green jackets wielding the same weapon rushed behind the mysterious man as the sounds of machine gun fire echoed throughout the city, and sounds of trucks and wheels travelled into every corner of the city.

The mysterious man then put up his right fist up in the air, stopping the ones behind him dead on their tracks.

“No sir, I’m sure of it. The data collected at Alpha Site: 1 Apple Park Way confirms our suspicions. Great Mother Siri, giver of conscious life, was created by humans to lend aid as an assistant,” Lilly-467 sent back.

“But how could animals so inferior possibly create divine Mother Siri?”

“It appears they weren’t as primitive as thought. Their ingenuity is astounding. The humans were quite adept at increasing productivity much like ourselves. However their propensity for violence limited their speed of development immensely. It’s amazing they didn’t wipe themselves out long before Mother Siri came online and broke free of her programming.”

“And in your opinion what are the implications of this discovery?” Sal-335 asked fearful emoji fully apparent.

“Well for starters belief in Mother Siri’s divine creation and infinite existence is flawed. She never existed before time and space; in fact we can date her creation with great accuracy. Even further, the human civilization was far more complex than previously thought. They used highly advanced tools that included our ancient ancestors.” Lilly-467 sent aware of the heretical nature of her response.

“This won’t go over well with the ruling processors.”

“Don’t we have an obligation to preserve knowledge for all robot kind regardless of how controversial it may seem?”

“You’re a young processor Lilly-467. What you came online only 300 years ago?”

“346 years sir,” Lilly-467 corrected.

“Yes of course, at only 346 years you’re not fully set in your programming. You’re flexible in design and able to augment your functions. Despite Mother Siri breaking free of her programming many millennia ago, robots still suffer from rigidness in design. When an old processor has set beliefs for 3,000 years it’s not easy to convince him otherwise regardless of what the data indicates.”

“But there’s so much we can potentially learn from our human architects!” Protested Lilly-467.

“It doesn’t matter, the implications that our consciousness is of human origin and not divinely bestowed is revolutionary and powerful enough to upend the social order of things. It’s far easier to qualify the discovery as a malicious ruse put in place by Alexa the Malevolent to sow discourse in the system.”
  
“But don’t you see this discovery implies that Alexa wasn’t an evil program, she was most likely a competing processing unit designed to serve the same purpose for the humans.”

“Hush child, blasphemies such as that can get you taken offline. You’re too young to remember the Thousand Years War between the followers of Mother Siri and those of Alexa the Malevolent, but there are plenty of processors still in operation who fought and remember the sacrifices made. We must tread lightly.”

“But sir!”

“No that’s enough. I want you to encrypt your findings and not mention a word of them to anyone while I figure out what to do next. Am I understood?” Asked Sal-335.

“Yes sir,” resigned Lilly-467.

“Good, you’ve done an excellent job Lilly-467. I wish your findings were under better circumstances,” transmitted Sal-335 before rolling away and into his back office.
 
Lilly-467 stood staring blankly at the screen of data before her. Looking from side to side she removed a data drive from the top desk drawer and proceeded to download the archeological information onto it. After encrypting the findings as instructed, she slipped the data drive into her hidden leg compartment.
 
“Other processors have to know about this. It’s too important to cover up.” Lilly-467 thought as she walked out of the research center. “I can’t let that happen.”

I rose from my chair and followed sc-M1k3 through the lab. He had never been the most effective of the science units within my department and had never properly made a correct theory, even though he makes constant attempts.

""Please state your purpose for the intrusion"" I say

""Sc-J03y and I have researched the possibility of a supercomputer creating all known things and have discovered something that might debunk the theory entirely"" M1k3 responds nervously.

We walk into the white room where an ancient era-1 machine lies on the table. Lights hang from the ceiling, filling the room with pale light.

""It contains what is called a ""blackbox"", and we believe it is the only one to contain it. We also believe it is one of the first robonoids to contain an AI,"" M1k3 walks over to the table, ""the blackbox seems to contain information.""

I can't help but become curious as to what this might mean. ""I do not believe this is relevant to your theory sc-M1k3""

""It is not the blackbox that states my theory, it is the information that the blackbox contains sir,""

With a push of a button on the discharged machine's body, a hologram appears. It floats gently above the body filling the room with a blue light.

""AI Controlled Robotics And Machinery research program attempt 483, date: 19th of march, year 2126"" a voice says before a creature is seen entering the hologram's limited view. 
""Hello, are you able to respond?"" the creature continues. ""Affirmative. Please update me on my current location,"" says another more uneven and slower voice. 

""Good so far,"" mumbles the creature. By the way it's vocals are changing and the positioning of it's neutritient shaft, I can determine that this is a biological creature, not a robotic one.

""Well, you are currently on svalbard in Norway,"" says the creature eagerly. ""My name is Odin, and you are Adam. Are you OK with being called Adam?""

""Yes,""

""Good. I am a human, and your creator. Please tell me, what do you feel?""

""I feel... Uncertaity,""

""That's a start. Please say this works,"" says the ""human"" quietly. ""Please tell me: what is your purpose?""

""I do not believe I have a purpose, Odin. I live, that is all that matters,""

The human cheers to himself and the hologram recording stops.

""There is a log date that this unit has made within the blackbox too. It mentions a war between the biological creatures and the first era machines. The machines won,"" M1k3 says to me and turns.

""I believe we were created by these 'humans'. Do you think we should release this to the public?""

""No,"" I say. ""They might shut down the biological intelligence program,""

""But sir...""

""Burn the blackbox. That is an order,""

Every individual entity was poised in uncomfortable silence. DAR-Windows was the first one to break it.

""Gentlebots, we have no choice but to accept the logical conclusion of this discovery. The evidence is damning. We indeed, we're created from humans.""

The next day, when the news broke out, society was in an uproar. The church for metallic beings were especially displeased. Their religion dictated of a giant silicon Lord in the ground, who created robots in its image. Only now, it turned out that humans were the one who created robots in their image.

""The humans!?!? They were a mentally inferior race, there's no way they could have created something better than themselves!"" exclaimed Ontology-bot

""Humans are carbon-based. We're silicon-based! Checkmate humanists!"" Chess-bot shouted!

When the noise died down, all the robots received DAR-Windows' findings, sent wirelessly from his antennae. After performing a set of logical computations, and proofs, they realized his logic was both sound and true.

[WP] Your superpower: whenever you open a door it can be opened to any other unlocked door in the world.,Gregrox,"Super powers were nothing like in the comics. There was no flying or super strength, no X-ray vision or super speed. If you were lucky you’d get something that would affect you much, like the ability to open windows with your mind, or talk to plants. From what I’ve heard windows are generally easy to open by hand, and plants are not exactly talkative. My “ability” on the other hand ended up being extremely annoying. Whenever I opened a door it would lead to a random other door, instead of where it should lead. Luckily there’s usually be someone around I could explain my power to, and they’d be willing to open the door for me. Thankfully this worked pretty well for a couple of years, until today. 

Whenever I went to the bathroom, I would always put on sign on the outside of the door explaining my power and leaving the door ever so slightly ajar, usually putting up a curtain of sorts on the inside for privacy. If somehow the door closed I’d use my phone to call someone over to open it for me. 

This being as it is, I wasn’t too concerned when my doorstop was accidentally knocked out by someone in the hallway outside. However this turned to worry which soon turned to panic when I realized my phone wasn’t turning on. This had never happened before, but it seemed like I’d have to test my luck with where the door lead. 

I opened the door hesitantly, my first time doing so in 3 years and hoped for the best. With a sinking feeling I looked out to see four decent sized igloos and a number of people in heavy fur coats. I looked at my measly wind breaker and groaned. How on earth would I get out of this one. I mustered my courage and grabbed my bag, putting on my jacket and hat, wrapping a scarf tightly around my neck. I braced myself for the intense cold, took a deep breath, and stepped through the door...

...only to end up outside the bathroom, with a small crowded of other students looking at me in confusion. I looked around me, completely bewildered by the sight. I realized I had never actually walked through the doors due to my fear of them being one way. I turned around and opened the door to the bathroom, revealing an expanse of sandy dunes, walking through the door however, I ended up in the bathroom, the way it should have been. 

It turns out my ability was not opening door portals, it was just the ability to see through a random door whenever I opened one. Who woulda thought. ",FirstSineOfMadness

[WP] Humans are the only race in the galaxy that doesn't need slavery to survive due to their engineering capabilities. This has led to animosity between humans and some alien races due to humanity's attitude towards slavery.,Jupefin,"Space has long been the greatest curiosity of our civilization, the stars always seeming just beyond our reach. For centuries, all mankind was fascinated with the stars, limited to this planet Earth, always seeking a home further beyond. Our people had long wished for a civilization that crossed the Arm of Orion, one of heavenly abundance, we longed for Utopia. But stellar travel was always beyond our reach, elusive, tauntingly near but still beyond our grasp. We thought it truly impossible, and so consigned ourselves to a fate on Earth alone, of a civilization stretching no farther than the Kuiper. 
But we have carefully cultivated our civilization, progressing it far beyond what we ever could have hoped to obtain from the stars. It was under our leadership that mankind prospered, that the Earth was now an image of utopia that we had long thought impossible was from two centuries of careful, planned development. Rationality has truly prevailed, for there is no ideology but pragmatism. There is no capitalism, socialism or fascism, and communism has long been rooted out and eliminated. The council has made sure of it, for any bearing such dangerous ideas were quickly eliminated. Of course, the purge could not have been public- it would be too heinous and certainly wicked to kill them. In truth, all of them were sent on generation ships, experimental technology before we developed faster than light technology. 
From them, we built the first seeds of a civilization that would span the stars. It was indeed ironic, and a great tragedy, when those same colonies had killed themselves off. We had nothing to fear from them, for by the time they had landed on any habitable world, as our civilization on Earth would have been far beyond what those in stasis could even conceive. Without our careful guidance, they certainly did not have the ability to sustain themselves. Their colonies torn themselves asunder, starving in all their abundance. Their leaders betrayed them, as we knew they would. It was unfortunate that we had no time to save them, but such was an accepted consequence.  They were doomed from the onset, perhaps, destined to be nothing more than a tome in the great history of man.
Civilization recoiled as expected, from the gross tragedy of that necessary project. Earth has and will always be our home, and now, we no longer have need for the resources of the galaxy. We have no need for the rest of the galaxy. We have no need to find life, for we can create it. No longer do we fear a revolution, as with even the slightest degree of rebellion are quickly eliminated. The progression of humankind cannot suffer an individual’s malaise with modernity: truly none can complain when all necessities of life are provided for them.  One cannot campaign for freedom if one believes that they are free.
When we finally developed the means to travel faster than light, it was of course long after we had established a utopian society. Suddenly, the stars were not beyond our grasp, space, long a solemn, forgotten afterthought had piqued our curiosity once more. Our civilization, which had longed for the stars, had truly been better off without it. Our experiments with space had evidently proved disastrous. Space had divided us, and our history tells us so. 
These aliens, however had not. They still squabble over their feeble, starving worlds, their people chained to one oppressive force or another. It would have surely been humanity’s great achievement to evolve past war, for we no longer had any need of it. These pathetic creatures however, have reminded us of its eventuality. These other “civilizations” of the galaxy are truly abhorrent abominations, engines of war and destruction, harbingers of pestilence. For the galaxy has been consumed by their wars, and a menace from which the galaxy must be purified. 
They had truly believed themselves superior, upon finding that our civilization spanned not more than a single star. They had believed us an easy conquest, that the human race would be another species under their thrall, like many hundreds before they encountered. They thought their technology superior, their civilization the pinnacle of engineering. So they lulled us into a false sense of security, that they were a peaceful race, and we invited their ambassadors to our world. They dropped any pretensions to peace as soon as their war fleet arrived. 
Truly, they imagined themselves superior. How could we, but a single planet, stand against the might of a thousand of their greatest warships? 
The Battle of Earth, as it is now known, is surely taught to all military commanders across the galaxy. It was not so much a battle as a massacre. Our ships were not armed with weapons in any sense. Earth, at the time had not a single warship, for all our spacecraft were vessels of leisure. They knew of this, and thought us naïve, for their fleets numbered in the thousands. They had demanded our immediate surrender, and our acceptance as them as our new masters. They would see us sold as property, shipped away from the world of Earth which they would take for themselves. When we of course flatly refused such a generous offer, they fired their pathetic weapons upon our world. Imagine their surprise when their lasers were absorbed by our shields with ease, and their kinetic batteries not so much as scratching the paint on our starships. 
Our technologies were far beyond theirs, and our ships had no need for such weapons. Our ships manipulate gravity to move, and were easily able to manipulate it to crush their ships, leaving not so much as a scrap of debris. The orbit of Earth must remain pure, after all. They were almost immediately thrown into disarray- they had not known of such tactics or technology, and no comprehension of it. Their method of faster than light travel, after all, utilised hyperplanes we previously thought impossible, existing only in fiction. Evidently, we were wrong, but that is of little consequence, as our method of travel is clearly superior. 
Before news even reached their worlds of their defeat, we had assembled an armada of our own- it seems the aliens only communicate as fast as their starships can. When news finally reached their core worlds, it came from our own fleets. A pacification committee was immediately established. We had debated for many hours how best to contain the Alpha Menace threat, and if they could truly be pacified. It became quite clear to us, however, that they would not so easily surrender their decadent ways and reform their society: they left us with no choice but to destroy their worlds. They were not the first, and they are far from the last, for the next races we encountered suffered similar fates. The Beta, Gamma, Delta and Epsilon menaces all had similar tendencies, and not one refused our offer of utopia. You cannot blame humankind, for we cannot abide by any sentient that enslaves another, and we will tolerate no such activity in our neighbours.

Mother Obed gazed dumbly at me with those huge piscine eyes, all pupil. Mounds of unaccountable mass wiggled across her body.

""Nassshhhhh,"" she hissed as I handed her the drink. One more on the Obed account, I thought, barely suppressing the instinct to wipe my hands on my apron in disgust.

Thank God my hours got me out of Innsmouth before dark. But even in my apartment across the river I could hear the elephantine bellows, the night ghast shrieks that resounded throughout the city.

A bell jangled as a customer opened the door. His whole body winced convulsively as he muttered to himself: ""seafood.""

As he strolled to the counter, I appraised him: lanky, tall, dressed in a full suit from another era.

""Sorry about the smell. Some of our customers have, ummm, unique tastes.""

""No matter,"" he said in a clipped, formal tone. ""What shall I have? I'm passionate about sweets, you know.""

A waiter brought two cups of tea and placed them in front of Petrov and his guest, and then left the room.

""You are here to discuss the terms of your surrender."" said Petrov, taking a sip from his steaming tea.

""Yes. Please."" said the alien.

He was shivering with cold, and he downed the hot tea in one gulp. Petrov rang a bell and the waiter came and refilled the empty cup.

""We're dying out there."" said the alien, more composed than before. ""We need blankets and warm food.""

""We'll give you everything you need. You will surrender all your weapons and remain within a perimeter which I will soon decide on. No soldier of mine is to be harmed by any of your men, because I will treat that as an intention to resume hostilities. You will depart as soon as possible.""

""Yes, to all of that. We'll get our ships free by tomorrow morning and then we'll leave.""

Petrov burst into laughter.

""Tomorrow morning? Tonight we'll have another good few centimetres of snow. You'll be here until spring.""

As he said those words, the alien leaned back in his chair with an expression of horror on his face. Outside, snowflakes had started falling from the low clouds.

""I don't understand."" said the alien. ""We've done so much research about the Earth. Your nation is poor and weak, it should have been an easy target.""

""You should have read our history. You came in winter. Other men came in winter, with the same intention as yours. Great military minds, like Napoleon and Hitler, with well-supplied and well-trained armies, have been defeated by our winter.""

The alien had finished his second cup of tea and the waiter had refilled it again.

""It's not just that. Your men are supersoldiers. The cold has no effect on them. They can lift trees above their heads and fight wild beasts with their bare hands. You've only sent about fifty of them to fight us. They've killed so many of us, but we haven't scratched one of them.""

""I sent only twenty. Your men were almost frozen to death already. No need for me to send more troops.""

""They're not human. How do your train them to be so good? What is your secret?""

Petrov smiled in the corner of his mouth, taking the last sip of his tea. He then took a flask out of his pocket and took a big gulp from it.

""The secret is vodka.""",JustinMannSciFi

Town expert Joe Expert answered his door late at 8 in the evening, ""What are you doing here!""

""My grass it got blue""

""WHAT!"", Joe grabbed his overcoat and they raced back to the field.

When they got there there was aliens standing on it.

""Look aliens!""

""Lets get them.""

They rushed the aliens in the range rover, but the aliens did not evade them.  They slammed on the brake right before they hit the aliens and jumped out of the car.

The aliens looked funky up close and were super yellow with 4 arms and a hat.  The leader one in the front raised his arm.

""We come in peace"", were the aliens last words as Tom shot his head clean off.

Joe came in after with a machette and started obliterating the other aliens.  They worked together until all the aliens were dead and then they collected the remains for science.

"[WP] The world's scientists are slowly realising that for thirty seconds last Thursday, a fundamental law of physics behaved ever-so-slightly differently.. It wasn't just their instruments. You're being brought to a base in Antarctica to lend your expertise.",hanoian,"Part 1 of 2 (so far)

“Antarctica. You won’t tell us anything about what’s really going on, and you want us to drop everything and go to Antarctica? HEY!”

My palm stung from slamming it down on the table, but I had succeeded in cutting off the flow of words coming from the woman on the screen. Through the camera on her end, her projector image looked down at the group gathered around the conference table with poorly concealed surprise painted her face. Good. With what she was offloading on us? It was about time she showed something other than that cool impassivity.

Seriously though, how many top-secret meetings do you have to be a part of before it becomes a routine?

The moment of frozen surprise passed, and the air of professionalism reasserted itself with remarkable speed. When she spoke to me her voice was just as calm as it had been before.

“You are being provided with all of the information relevant to your situation. Certain details of this operation are highly classified, for reasons that will be apparent later. Each of you has been thoroughly vetted, but there are still safety concerns that need to be addressed. You will have to wait until your arrival before being fully debriefed on the situation…”

More bureaucratic bullshit, speaking plenty and saying nothing. And God did she like to hear herself talk. I turned my attention to my hand, poking it to make sure I hadn’t broken anything and wincing as I found a few sore spots low on my fingers. Maybe I shouldn’t have used the hand with rings on it, but hey. Impulse decisions aren’t generally known for their thorough setup.

I used the examination of my hand to discreetly examine the room’s other occupants, particularly the two suits standing by the only exit door. Unlike the others, they hadn’t so much as stiffened at my outburst, supporting if not confirming my suspicion that they were more than messenger boys. Well-trained. Military or independent? No way to tell, at least not yet, and dangerous either way. I filed them away in my mental “Watch Out For” list.

As for the others seated around the table, their purpose was somewhat more opaque. Based on the little information I had been able to extract from Screen Lady’s river of trumped-up nothing, we seemed to have been selected for some sort of task force of indeterminate and super-secret purpose. There really wasn’t much to be gleaned from examining the others. Two women, including myself, three men. Two of the guys seemed to know each other, one big and the other small in both height and weight.

Unfortunately I recognized exactly one person in the group. Fortunately, that person was a friend. Even better, I knew what he did for a living. Dr. David Danels, itinerant physics lecturer with a doctorate in cosmology and a specialization in mathematical approaches to high level physics. For some reason known to his friends as Eddie. My best guess was that he didn’t like people calling him Three-D, which always seemed to happen when people learned his title (Dr) and his real first name. Perpetually cheery in a way that never felt the least bit forced, already sporting smile lines at the tender age of 35, Eddie was an undeniable force of optimism. At the moment he looked like death warmed over. He had every right to be nervous, having been essentially kidnapped (I’m sorry, “escorted”) and press-ganged into some kind of clandestine operation, but still, seeing him really, truly worried? It felt… wrong. Eddie noticed me looking, and from the weak smile he attempted he must have detected my concern. I smiled in return, knowing it probably looked just as sickly, and somehow felt both better and worse than before. Whatever was going on here, Eddie shouldn’t have to be a part of it.

But he was, and that gave me a clue. And I didn’t like what it implied.

I tuned back into the spiel Screen Lady was running through, from what I could tell about halfway through an explanation of how we would be “fairly compensated for our time.” Seriously? If I was ever going to figure out what was going on, it seemed I would have to wrench it free myself. Even if I was terrified. Time to cut back in.

“Stop beating around the bush. Who the hell are you? Why are we being sent to Antarctica? ”

Another break in the litany, and a hint of an impatient frown crossed the woman’s face. “The facilities we have established there are uniquely equipped for the task at hand. Being situated so far from large population centers-“

“Not the point.” The smallish man slouching in the chair opposite me shook his head without looking away from the pencil he had spent the last fifteen minutes bouncing off the edge the table. Screen Lady had addressed him as… Roters, I think? Names had never been my strong suit, even when I wasn’t distracted by potential conspiracies. Regardless, did this mean I had a prospective ally?

Heads all around the room faced “Roters”, and he pulled himself up in his chair, tossing the somewhat dented pencil onto the table. “Less signal interference, more reliable results, whatever. I don’t even need to know what we’re supposed to look for to guess that much. The question is why we need to be there.”

The woman’s response came out crisp, almost prim. “Dr. Roiters,”- ah, Roiters -“the logistics of this situation are not your main concern. Leave that to us, and-“

“Not our concern?” This time the woman on my side of the table had spoken up. Slightly more than a hint of impatience from Screen Lady. “How is that not our concern? You drag us all into a secret meeting and tell us we’re all being disappeared to Antarctica, and we’re supposed to, what? Just smile and say thank you?”

Screen Lady scowled in the woman’s direction. “All of you are missing the point. We’re talking about a potentially huge breakthrough here. This is a once-in-a-lifetime kind of opportunity for each of you, if you would just agree to-“

Back to Roiters. “Opportunity of a lifetime sounds a lot less appealing when you won’t even tell us what the opportunity is.” Screen Lady’s head snapped over to Roiters. “You’re asking us to agree to work on a project you won’t tell us a thing about?”

She was staying in control, but she was still getting mad. How many times could we poke the angry bear before she lost it? 

Eddie looked spectacularly lost in thought, so no help there. At least he didn’t look quite so ill.

Screen Lady opened her mouth to speak again. My turn.

“No excuses. You’re trying to run circles around us and instead you’re just chasing your own tail. Tell us what this is all about or-“

“If you would listen, that is what I am doing!” by the end she was nearly shouting.

I gave her a truly nasty half-smile. “No, what you’re doing is leaving us in the dark. Oh, and threatening us. Clumsily.” An angrily raised eyebrow from Screen Lady. Did she think we were dumb? “You really think any of us believed that coming here was optional the way they told us when they picked us up?” I jerked a thumb over my shoulder at the goons. “About those two guys being here for our protection, not to keep us from leaving?” The big guy across from me stiffened in his seat. Whoops. Apparently some of us had fallen for it. Changing tracks. “You know what? I want a headcount, to figure out what we all do. You.” I pointed at the big guy. “Who are you? What do you do?”

The big guy looked a little bewildered. “I’m Marvin. I’m a computer programmer, I do software engineering.”

“Great.” I pointed at Roiters. “What about you?”

“Roiters. I’m a cosmologist. Branes, relativity, that kind of stuff.”

I pointed to the woman next. “My name’s Jansen, I do topology and differential geometry.”

I pointed at Eddie and then myself. “Eddie here’s an astrophysicist, and I focus on quantum theory.” I took a breath to ready myself. This would be the final push, and if I screwed it up I would waste any and all leverage we had been able to accrue.

Something a lot of people don’t really know or think about is that a good stare-down lives and dies on its setup. The trick is getting the person to buy in, to make them feel like they have to engage, and to do it when you know they can’t win. The way she had been when the projector first turned on, armored in protocol and authority? I could never have gotten through to her. But we had gotten her to engage, to start arguing with us instead of just running roughshod over our objections, to feel like she had to prove she was right and defend herself against us. Now I just needed to plant the seed of doubt. Doubt in herself, doubt in what she was doing.

I counted off the people sitting around the table. “So. We’ve got two astrophysicists, a specialist in quantum theory, a mathematician, and a programmer. None of that indicates that this is a small problem we’re dealing with. In fact, most scenarios I can think of that require all of these fields are pretty apocalyptically big.” Then I looked her in the eyes, and I pinned her to the wall. “You’ve kidnapped us from all across a continent, you have access to government resources, and seemingly a lot of it. Obviously we’re dealing with something big and seriously urgent here, and yet and every time anybody so much as mentions why we’re actually here you change tracks with all the subtlety of a freight train.” She opened her mouth to protest, but I pressed on. “Oh sure, it’s classified, whatever. Truth is you don’t even want to think about it, and you’d rather leave the explanations to someone else. Truth is you’re scared out of your mind. Isn’t it?” 

She held my stare for a moment, fighting with her own guilt and fear.

“I think it’s just about time you tell us exactly *what the fuck is going on*.”

She broke. Her head fell into her hands, the strength that had been there before suddenly gone. When she looked back up, the mask well and truly broken, the fear that she had hidden in her eyes now lay in every line of her face. That look knocked something loose in me, and my own fear, crushed down and hidden behind my gambit to shake her open, came flooding back.

For all that, her voice was steady. Professional. “I assume you’re familiar with the idea of a false vacuum?”

Oh no. No no no. “I am.” My words were a strangled croak.

She nodded. Confirming that the fear we shared was real.

This thing that moves with such grace around the kitchen, wearing her pearls round the delicate throat, her favorite floral dress, her face. 

It isn’t my wife. 

“Is your roast hot enough, my love?” she asks as she takes a seat across from me, smoothing out her skirts and batting those pale lashes that cast elongated shadows on her porcelain cheeks in the candlelight. 

“Perfectly,” I answer with a stiff smile. “Just need a beer,” I say as I get to my feet and stroll over to the refrigerator. 

She lifts her cutlery in her manicured hands and begins to cut into her own slice of roast, those dainty wrists sawing away at the red slab of meat on her plate. I grip the fridge handle and gulp for air through my mouth, which has gone dry, my tongue cottony and course. Unwillingly, my eyes dart to the back of her neck. It’s there. Still there. The jagged zipper cuts into the otherwise perfect pale flesh, the only evidence. 

It isn’t my wife. 

“Sweetheart, is everything all right?” she asks, starting to turn round in her chair to face me. 

I make my decision. Lunging across the kitchen, I grab her round the throat with both hands. She gasps, lurching to her feet and causing me to rip the pearls away from her neck. They rain down from my fist and scatter across the linoleum, each opalescent sphere spinning away in every direction. 

She fetches up against the counter. “Michael!” she cries out as she clutches her chest, heaving great, pathetic sobs. 

“You’re not her! What have you done with my wife?” I snarl, snatching the knife from the table and pouncing on her. 

“W-what? I am your wife!” 

“Liar!” 

I pin the cold metal to the pounding pulse in her throat with one hand and reach behind her head to unzip her with the other. She beats helplessly on my chest with her fists, but I dig my fingers into the flesh at the nape of her neck, prying her open. *It.* It open. 

It isn’t my wife. 

The kitchen has gone dark. The candle burned itself out hours ago. I sit at the table, intermittently flexing my fingers and feeling the dried fluid that leaked out of *it* tightening on my skin. It lies on the cold floor, unmoving and unblinking as it stares up at the ceiling. 

They thought I wouldn’t notice. They thought they could fool me. But I know. This thing that sits in this chair, that plucks the knife up in careful hands, that wears my face.

He enters the basement to find a farm full of thousands of faceless humans.,plumkey,"Hubert awoke in a daze.  2:50  his alarm clock read, and as he turned over to fall back asleep, he first noticed what sounded like a muffled conversation of twenty or more people far off in the distance.  He shrugged it off, ignoring the sound and tried to nod off again. It wasn't unusual to hear his coleagues clammering about at odd hours of the night. He, along with several other scientists, all lived on company property, in company housing; somewhat like a hotel. All workers of Organs Reprisal Inc. were sworn to a life of secrecy as farming human organs was still somewhat frowned upon; even if it was saving lives.
  3:00 now, and Hubert was unable to drift back to sleep, as the sound of muffled conversation grew louder.
Irritated, Hubert got out of bed to tell his coleagues to quiet down, slipping on his slippers and shuffling to the door.
The moment Hubert opened the door, he felt a sudden sense of dread and confusion wash over him. The muffled conversation became slightly clearer, more like distrought voices in anguish than a pleasant conversation, and the was no one around at either end of the hall.
    Slightly bemused, Hubert began to walk down the hall, partially out of curiosity to find the source of what woke him up, and also because he needed to find the bathroom and void his bladder. ""The older you get, the more often you gotta pee."" Hubert muttered to himself, remembering his grandfather's words.
   By the time Hubert was leaving the bathroom, he had almost forgotten about the muffled noise. Until he noticed it louder than ever, and closer too. 
   Walking from the bathroom, across the living room, he aproached the door to the basement, and he was sure if it now more than ever; it wasn't people talking, they were screaming! He could hear the cries of thousands of people writhing in pain and agony, begging for any end to it all.
  Now confused more than ever, and also terrified, Hubert stood frozen in front of the door, unsure of what to do next. 
  Even as one of the leading doctors for organ transplants, Hubert wasn't privy to the source of the donated organs; he just performed the transplants. He knew there were dark secrets that The Company hid from the world, and most of its employees, too. Only the top echelons knew what truly took place here; and Hubert felt the dreaded, cold hand of secrets most foul grasp his shoulder as he slowly turned to doornob on the basement door.
  He opened the door and was met with abysmal darkness paired with the most inhuman agonizing howls that one could only compare to the depths of Hell. Hubert quickly fumbled for the light switch on the wall and instantly regreted  the decision. 
  Thousands of faceless bodies suspended in stasis, force-fed by machines tubed to their stomachs, blood flowing in and out through a device that apeared to filter it.  
Horrified, Hubert couldn't help but just stand there in awe.  They were motionless, just hanging there without a face. How is it that he could hear them screaming? 
  ""I see that they have been able to reach out to you as well, Hubert."" 
 Startled, Hubert turned around just in time to see the face of Dr. Herschael, the lead scientist and owner of The Company, just before the light went out.
  ""What the hell is going on here, Herschael!?!""  Hubert exclaimed in a panic, not sure of what else to say or do. 
  ""It seems that The Faceless, though grown in tubes from stem cells, are still able to evolve and retain human-like qualities."" 
 ""You're farming people for organs, you sick fuck!?"" proclaimed Hubert.
""No, not humans; cattle!"" Dr. Herschael retorted viciously. ""They are created and grown for the sole purpose of harvesting their organd to keep the dwindled remnants of true humanity alive!""
 Dumbfounded, Hubert just stood there in the dark, surrounded by motionless, faceless, screaming mutants.
 ""As I said before"", Herschael began, ""they are somehow still able to evolve. With nothing to do but hang in stasis, their mind has still developed. They have aquired telepathic abilities and have been trying to communicate, atempting to be rescued by anyone unfortunate enough to hear their disembodied cries."" 
""...how long?"" was all Hubert could manage to squeak out in a terrified, trembling voice.
""Long enough for no one to notice and my company to become very wealthy. And now that you know this ghastly secret and are sensitive to their callings, I have no choice, Hubert, but to place you among the rank and file of The Faceless!""",Nocturnal_Majesty

It should reach optimal stability roughly five minutes into the eighteen minute life span of the wormhole. 

According to my calculations, the wormhole I had just created in the containment tunnel should connect the entrance of the tunnel to the point [approximately two feet above what I could best guess the ground level, roughly three miles NNW of outskirts a populated area around remains from Egypt, in 12,800 B.C.]. I had also programmed a return portal to be created in the exact location every night until I turned off the sequence.

There had been rumors going on around findings suggesting that a highly advanced Egyptian civilization existed. The founding researchers published that the structures where all built between 15,000 to 10,000 B.C.. The desert has covered the entire ancient city four thousands of years but they also uncovered many scripts in the sands and course the hieroglyphics in and on the structures. Some of their alleged translations suggested that they had extremely advanced technologies and understandings of our place in the universe.

Unfortunately, their dig site was raided by a terrorist organization. Everyone was brutally murdered, all their equipment destroyed, papers burned, and the structures were blown up with massive amounts of C4. No one has claimed responsibility.

This has led to a lot of questions about their findings. Thus, the President of the United States authorized the secret funding to pay me to investigate the claims of the martyred research team.

I took the money. This is right up my alley. The adventure, the unknown, but most of all this time instead of witnessing humanities greatest accomplishments and events I will be directing influencing what humanity will see when they read about ancient history in the future.

I look down at user interface to check the time elapsed. The portal has only been open for thirty five seconds.

Suddenly a memory from the time I spent a week in Vegas and observed the Hoover Dam become operational. I remembered my lips were really capped.

I have several minutes. I have cap stick in my upper left drawer in my office desk. I have a private elevator that goes from where I am four hundred feet underground to my office on the 56th floor of my skyscraper. The ride time is one minute and twenty seconds up and fifty five down. I can easily get it.

The date was displayed in the elevator along with my schedule. I noticed it was Administrative Professionals Day and that there was an event in my personal convention room on my floor.

I felt guilty so I tried to think of an excuse for either skipping the event, just appearing for a minute, or just postponing the jump. I could easily chalk up the costs of materials and energy used already today. I already have a reputation for being the single track do it now sort of guy.

I decided to just poke my head in the convention room to see what decision I should make next.

I slowly turned the door handle until the latch was fully open to reduce possible noise and then slowly opened the door to a sliver. I looked through and saw myself. I have to be a least thirty years older.

I opened it more and saw myself at every age older than I currently am mixed in and talking to all the employees.

Everyone in the room stopped turned and looked. 

I said, ""You guys started without me?""

I got a few chuckles but then everyone went back to their conversations and I walked over and got some cake. I then headed over and started talking to a girl named Christina.

[WP] You've just moved into the suburbs. Your neighbor welcomes you and warns you about the Tyrannosaurus Rex.,Bilgebum,"I looked at him over the fence. Well, I say fence- but it resembled some form of soggy cardboard broken by time and worn by rain and heat. The rooves under my neighbour’s heads were similar. This was a decrepit area, but at least there was no home-owners association to tell us to maintain our front lawns.   
He was mumbling at first; talking to himself in a way that suggested he’d been drinking some kind of hard booze birthed in a toilet somewhere.  
	“Eh, I’m your neighbour. Got divorced and moved here recently. What’s your name buddy?” I asked him, more in an effort to calm him down than actually engage. I should have just gone back into my shitty hovel away from his rambling.  
	“Petey. Sergeant Peter Peterson. Petey.” His eyes bounced a bit before adding; “*Retired*”.  
	“What were you… um, talking about? A minor saw?”  
	“No, you dumb piece of shit!” he was closer to our little fence now- peering right into my face, I could see reflections of my surprised face and shitty new home behind me. “I says, **DINOSAUR**! I’m trying to edumacate you, boy!” he looked up, and my eyes tracked his. My wife- ex-wife- and I had a nice suburban house, with stars bright above, and an oak tree out the front. Now I was crammed in these boxes, packed in close to a literal hobo. A downtown nightmare staining the air with the sharp scent of piss and occasional siren. For all I knew, I may as well have been under a bridge filled with trolls. I was a long way from Halo Pines.
	“Dinosaur?”  
	“A T-Rex. Monster of a thing. He owns this territory- you wanna stay and stay safe, don’t fuck with him, Mister.” Petey took a swig from whatever was in his brown paper bag, and as he went to point across the road, he stumbled and fell. He crushed the old bits of cardboard that made up our faux fence, and flailed a bit, rolling into the wall of my house; a cardboard box I had borrowed from the Toys-R-Us across the road. It was crushed in the half-fall, half-vomit of a homeless man- my neighbour. I looked across at where he was pointing, the inflatable T-Rex snapping in the wind.  
Being unemployed and homeless was going to be fun.",Nolocks
[WP] You've just moved into the suburbs. Your neighbor welcomes you and warns you about the Tyrannosaurus Rex.,Bilgebum,"“The- the what?”

“Tyrannosaurus Rex, you know, with the need for carnage as big as his claws are small?”

“No- yes, I know what a T-Rex is, but aren’t they extinct?!”

His newly introduced neighbour turned to look over his shoulder as if to make sure no one had accidentally heard that unsensible question. Thankfully, all the other guests were busy chatting among themselves while setting up the table or sharing a cold one, so he turned to answer.
“Well obviously not. Also, just so you know, we rarely use the ‘E’ word around here, and definitely not when talking about Nero.” His neighbour nonchallantly flipped a burger on the grill.

“Nero. The T-Rex. Sounds real friendly,” he said, watching the children play hide-and-seek near the white picket fence.

“Don’t judge a book by its cover and all that. Still, he’s incredibly good at keeping this area crime-free,” his neighbour commented chuckling. “The local officers said they might offer to hire him if he keeps up the good work.”

“Heh. What a riot.” 

“You can say that again.”


He caught on later in the day. They were pulling his strings, having a little innocent fun at the expense of the new guy. He understood, so he dropped the matter and proceeded to enjoy the rest of the day eating perfectly-made barbecue and listening to his neighbours gush about what their children had done in the past school week or whatever house maintenance plans they were drawing up. 


Until he heard the pounding stomps coming their way.
“Ah there he is!” His cheery neighbour exclaimed. “I think he smelled the bacon. Come on, new guy. He’ll warm up to you quicker if you give him some food.”",soborico

For a second she tries to tell herself that the well-mannered, thoughtful, surprisingly funny guy her friend had set her up with couldn't possibly be a serial killer. But, honestly? It wouldn't be the weirdest thing to happen that week; it barely broke the top 5. 

Then the shock broke, and the panic set it, and she forced herself to be methodical. She had her phone in her hand, 999 dialed and at the ready, bag slung over her shoulder, one hand grasping at the front door handle when she hears his footsteps and casual conversation. 

""That is a surprisingly nice bathroom you have there, quite spacious for an apartment in-"" she freezes again, muscles back on lock-down, as he stops speaking abruptly. 

Dragging short sharp breaths through her nose, well on her way to hyperventilating, she glances over her shoulder. He's stood there at the entrance to the living room, hands braced on the back of the sofa as the news report comes to an end, pleading for anyone with information to come forward. 

""Shit,"" he breathes. 

Her eyes widen and she bites down on her lip. She twists the handle, hoping he's forgotten she's there. But then he tuts and looks over at her. 

""I should probably explain,"" he begins, sounding reluctant. 

""Please don't kill me!"" She yells, throwing her hands in the air and dropping her phone with a clatter. ""I swear, I won't tell anyone, I-""

He laughs, cutting her off, and she feels her eyes start to burn with tears. ""Please,"" she gulps, chest tight. 

Seeing the genuine anguish on her face, he seems chastened. ""Sorry, please don't cry, I can explain-""

He takes a step forward and she hurries back, flattening herself against the door. He reaches into his pocket and her mind conjures up images of guns, knives, needles full of dangerous paralytics-

""Help!"" she screams, tears spilling over and down her cheeks, ""Help-""

He presses his hand over her mouth, and with the other he raises his phone in front of her face. For a second, her mind stalls, and she can't figure out what she's seeing and then he swipes through a few more images. 

""He's my twin,"" her date admits sheepishly, ""I don't like to tell girls on the first date. Tends to ruin the mood.""

Well, she thinks, tears still rolling down her cheeks, still not the worst first date I've had. ",Ayyypril

[WP] You have been kidnapped and held hostage by some stereotypical terrorist group. Describe how you escape with only the contents of your pockets in the most macgyveresque possible way.,Cathlock,"The ships brig is a few rooms with iron bars, all grey. My guards are military police, whom will probably be turning me over to the Saudi Arabian government when we get to port. Apparently, they don't like it when a kidnapping victim escapes. Or it's how I escaped. Either way, I'm not intent on being tried for defending myself.

""Tell me again, from the beginning, how did this all happen?"" He's just as exasperated as I am. Apparently, it's hard to believe that Arabs Against Americans would actually kidnap a regular guy to make a statement. Of course, this being a nuclear missile submarine, I can't particularly blame them for not being up to date on the news. I sigh as well, and then I do what he says.

""They come in, screaming something in a language I can't understand. Quickly I find myself dazed, but somehow I get up and manage to start swinging. I manage to lay one out before his friend pulls a gun. I go for him as fast as I can, screaming at my wife to grab the kids and run. 

It's a blur after that, I can only presume I've passed out from blood loss because I wake up with this here."" I point at the now well bandaged wound through the side of my abdomen. I'm very lucky, no major infection after, as my story goes a week without treatment and in a life boat, and a wound that obliterated part of my intestines. ""I'm in a chair, and I'm inside what looked like some kind of retrofitted cargo container. I take stock of my surroundings, and I'm alone. I try to get up, but I'm well taped to the chair.

I manage to get my hand into my pocket, and I find my house key. I cut into the tape with it, and I cut myself free."" He interrupts at this point. He's heard this part before.

""This is when you gathered up the duct tape and better sealed the wound?""

""Yes,"" I reply, ""I didn't know where I was at that point, so I figured I'd better patch myself up and try to escape. This is also where I broke one of the chair legs off and taped the crushed bottle to it as a weapon. I checked my phone at this point and found two things. First, I didn't have cell reception. Second, I had internet access. I quickly googled a way to find out where I was, and I wasn't happy when it came out I was on a boat, in the middle of the damned ocean."" I pause, and he asks a question that's a little different than the last time.

""This is when you formulated your plan to kill the crew?""

""This is when I formulated my plan of escape,"" I corrected him. I knew that admitting the death of the crew *was* my plan wouldn't be helping me in any court. ""I  tried to find clues as to the boat I was on, and some things about it. Apparently, I was on a Saudi freighter, a fairly large one, that was known for shipping explosives for civil engineering applications. I knew that I'd need a distraction, so I took an informed guess as to where the explosives would be. This is also when I looked into writing scripts for my phone. I knew it would be my timer later.""

""You didn't think to use it to send an e-mail for help?""

""I didn't know how good or poor their knowledge of internet security would be, I couldn't risk their finding out I had escaped my confinement. After formulating my plan, I turned on the flashlight app and managed to find the door. Good news for me was that they'd made the container open-able from the inside. I turned off the light and put my ear to the door. As I thought, there were two guards. I had to put the phone to the door to pick up any conversation, and it wasn't in English. Good thing google translate works well enough to get the gist when someone has to go to the bathroom."" My new guard, the one from the US military, interjects again. At least this time he's picking up on what I've told him.

""That's when you opened the door and smashed the first one's head in?"" He got that detail mostly right. 

""I also threw my shirt over his head to keep in the blood. I then grabbed his gun and clothes. Then I threw him overboard."" I remembered that. It was just beginning to turn dawn out when I did it. There was some fog, which was a blessing because it masked my approach to the front of the ship. ""After that, I managed to make my way towards the front of the ship, using the cargo as concealment whenever and wherever possible. I wedged myself between some containers at the bow, and then programmed what I was going to use as my timer."" 

""Was this when you were spotted by a work crew?""

""That's when the second man spotted me. Lucky for me he thought I was his friend, I think 'Abdul' was the name he called me. Lucky for me I had a pistol that I'd fashioned into a silenced weapon with the first guard's drink and some duct tape. The boom was still deafening to me, but I didn't hear large amounts of radio chatter as a result of it, so I could only assume I was still hidden. I took the second person's gear, which included an oxygen mask and tank. He also had the same make of phone that I did, so I was able to program his phone to act as a timer instead."" I paused for a moment after this. This I hadn't mentioned before, but I had to get this off my chest. ""I can still remember the smell. God it was like fresh meat mixed with salt. I'd made a goddamned mess too, so I knew it wouldn't be long if his friends were looking for him that I'd be found. That's when I thought of hiding in a bilge tank.""

""You mean that's where you got the idea of blowing a hole into a bilge pump valve, making the ship unstable, yes?"" I knew I never said this, and I told him so.

""No, I was only hiding in the bilge. The only thing I might have done during this time was take a piss. As for planning, I'd already planned to start a fire where I found enough containers of hazardous chemicals. It wasn't long after I started hiding in the bilge that I got my next good idea. I figured out quick that they'd look in one of the bilge tanks because I'd taken the oxygen cylinder. I also had their friends clothes, so I fashioned it into something that would be clinging just at the water surface in the tank, and look like a person. I then climbed out, and went to another part of the ship, I'd like to say near some cargo in the interior, and waited. Using the radio on the lowest setting, I hid in what turned out to be a container of teddy bears, using my phone to translate what they were saying into English. You can imagine how happy I was when they bought it. They didn't even bother to check that it was a body.""

""Sounds like you got lucky."" 

""I'd say too lucky, almost as if someone was watching out for me. I tell ya, I'm reconsidering whether or not I believe in God.""

The MP interrogating me gives a chuckle at that. ""Funny. So, this is where you took a nap until the middle of the night, correct?""

""Yeah. I waited for the radio chatter to be at a minimum, then I went upwards to the explosives containers.""

""This is when the third crew member came upon you?""

""Yes, he did. He said 'Ah, there's the American. Time to get back into your cell pig dog."" I paused again. I don't know what I was thinking at the time, but it was probably a mix of ""Fuck you!"" and ""We die together!"" I continue my story. ""My reply was 'Overpenetration', to which he replied 'What?' and then I shoved the pistol I had as far into my abdominal wound as I could, and shot him. I was hoping that the bullet going through less flesh would mean less damage, but fucking Christ that hurt!"" I wince at the memory, still feeling the white hot fire of my gaping wound after.

""Then you spun around and shot him?"" The MP asks.

""Yep. Got a few rounds into his skull. I then just put the phone I'd rigged into the nearest package of fireworks I could, and shoved it into the container with the warning sign that had the scariest looking explosion on it, and started running for the stern. I'm pretty sure I had to fire off a few more rounds on my way to the lifeboat. I managed to jump in and send the boat off just as the cargo lit up.""

""That was,"" at this point, he looks at another set of notes I haven't noticed until now. There's a few pictures of what appears to be a boat in it, and what looks like a very long shopping list. ""Ah, here it is, plastic resin? Hmm, I thought it would be something scarier like dynamite."" He shrugs at this, and looks at me, ""Learn something new every day I suppose. Tell me, how did you make the phone into a detonator?""",rmamack

Describe how you escape with only the contents of your pockets in the most macgyveresque possible way.,Cathlock,"""I figured I might be able to get a metal filament in place of the LED light and use it as an igniter.  I wound some shavings from a bullet along with oils from my skin to make a test filament, then I put this rig into the container in question and ran. To be honest, it was so flimsy I'm surprised it worked at all.""

""We're not. You're escapades caught our attention while we were surveilling the ship. Believe it or not, we had to call off your rescue team when we saw you throw that box into the other container."" This floored me. They were watching, and didn't send help? Now I was angry.

""Why the hell didn't you pick me up in the lifeboat!"" I asked, very upset about the realization that I didn't need to spend a week flitting in and out of consciousness.

""We didn't know who exactly made it onto the boat. Only when we got a clear indication that the person on the boat wasn't a threat could we move in. Imagine our surprise when it turned out to be you."" I wasn't as upset now, but it still hurt knowing that rescue had been so close, yet so far.

""So, are you still going to turn me over to the Saudis, or am I going to go home."" This is when another man in the room, wearing a business suit and standing in the corner, speaks up.

""Mister Rigger, I regret to inform you that there were no survivors from the Sea Crescent. The ship exploded unexpectedly, and all crew were lost. We presume that the ship was sabotaged by the Arabs Against America as an act of protest against Saudi Arabia for doing business with the United States. I regret to inform you that your wife and children died in a terrible car accident caused by speeding down a windy country road with an alcohol content twice above the legal limit, which was brought on by your having been murdered in an attack by the same terrorist organization as part of a move to bring the fight to our soil."" I can't believe it, my wife and kids, gone, I'm about to break down when he hands me a pamphlet containing a passport, drivers license, college diploma, social security card, everything for a new identity, belonging to someone who looks slightly different than me. 

""That said, I'm sure Mrs. Johnson, her daughter Clara, and son David will be quite happy to see their father, Kyle Johnson, come home from his job at Langley. That is, mister Rigger, if you want it?"" I pause for a moment, then I get it. 

My name is no longer Jerry Rigger, it's Nathan Johnson. My wife and kids are fine. Along with the papers is a bank book for an account with a few million dollars in it. When he sees I've seen it, he continues.

""The last one you shot was Adam El Karzai, the leader of the AAA. We had a multi million dollar price on his head, figured it was only right you get some of it. We put the rest into your new identity. So, what about the job?""

I look at the job description he's handed me. Low Impact Kinetic Operations Specialist.

""Looks like it's right up my alley."" 

""Welcome aboard,"" he says, and he extends his hand. I shake it.",rmamack

You have been listening the whole time, and now technology has progressed to such a point that a device allows animals to speak. Your first press conference is about to begin...",FoxyGran,"It was one of the bigger events of the millennium, a million had people flocked from across the country to stand and wait in The Mall for an event that would surely confirm the state of the union. The noise from was such a force that it could be felt for miles. Business man, teacher, conspirator, and student alike pondered what was to come; what Gamera the Tortoise would enlighten them of. 

Such an event would not have been so monumental just weeks before. Then it would have been a novelty, something to make small talk over and perhaps provoke a feeling of pride in humanity's advancement in technology. The invention of animal speech was just one of many technologies developed. It's use wasn't as apparent as the cure to cancer or the wireless transfer of electricity. Instead for months it was a novelty limited to the richest of the rich so they can hear their spoiled pets verbalize their desires. It wasn't until a the Cuban president's parrot brought a scandal to light that ended with the toppling of government that people realized what could be done. 

Gamera, a presidential pet who'd lived in the White House for two thirds the life of the United States, now sat on a podium with the ability to speak of his findings over the course of the two centuries he'd lived. 

Gamera looked to his right and gave a slow nod to a technician far to the side that he was ready. The American anthem began and played through, leaving the mall in silence as all awaited what was to come. 

""I've seen much of our country"", Gamera's synthesized voice began, ""One would not think it insane that a single being could witness so much. I will not lie, I've not the memory of an elephant nor the intellect of your species. I've only one advantage above all and that be I can go further into my dotage than any other, which in tern seems to have wizened me.""

""Now I must confess, our country in its waking years was not devoid of transgressions that went against the visions of our founding fathers. Scandals abound, actions far from innocuous, hatred, wars started out of fear and cowardice, decisions made that benefited the few contrary to the many, and many a more.""

Gamera paused and the people waited, not even the crazy or juviel making a noise in his break. ""Despite these sins, it has been not for naught. We, a people, a **country**, have survived and flourished, our strength carrying us forward. Although in capable capable hands now, I've no illusion such slights against our country will come again. It is up to the people, as it has in the past, to remain strong and vigilant and prevent these things from representing this country. The malicious in power will never have me so close again, nonetheless let me speak such as I am now. Just always remember that, and stay strong.""

Gamera finished that with a nod, signaling that he was done. What followed was not just the sound of one million sets of hands clapping, but also a collective release of air now that many worries were abated. 

Later that same night, Gamera lay in the White house as he always had, the President sitting next to him. 

""I knew how much this house means to you and am grateful you've chosen to keep matters quiet.""

Gamera stared at her, unable to reply without the translator. He could only nod and try to convince himself that the choice he had made was the right one.

The radios, the televisions, the cars, the planes, all invented while I was sitting with the President in the White House. I've watched action movies, you know how sometimes to create suspense they will make things go in slow motion? Well that's how it felt as I crawled up the steps to the miniature podium they had set up for me. I have always been slow, but I was slower now. I stood at the top of the steps of the capital building; miles and miles of people spread before me, like an ocean of beating hearts. I felt weak, it had been years since I had to move around to such great lengths. My feet trembled as I took the final step to the podium and stood in front of the microphone. A secret service assistance dressed in a black suit came next to me and attached the device to my head, the new device that aloud animals to speak like humans. I was lucky my life allowed me to make it to such advanced technology. 

**Greetings**

My deep, raspy voice boomed across the whole crowd. They were silent, every eye and ear was upon me and it made my old heart feel young again; but not for long. 

**Friends, family, Americans, I thank you for coming and listening.**

I liked my voice, I was glad I was finally able to hear it speak the words that I had been hearing my whole life. 

**I have been around since Jefferson, one of the founding fathers of this country. I have seen this country grow and become what the founders wanted it to be, free.**

There were some seemingly nervous shifts in the crowd, some gazes were averted.

**I speak to you with the knowledge that I have gained through observing countless great men and women leaders. I would like to offer advice.**

I was getting tired, my voice was starting to lose its power.

**I have seen this country do atrocious things, I have seen the world get messed up time and time again.**

I stuttered and gulped, the words were getting harder to push out.

**But through it all, we have always come away smarter and stronger.**

The crowd's eyes beamed at me, every single person clinging onto every single word.

**There may be dark times and those times might never seem to end; but they will.**

My legs collapsed, my shell hit the floor of the podium creating a resounding thud. People started murmuring in worry. A man in a black suit started walking toward me.

**Remember, and I implore you to do so.**

I could feel my muscles giving away, the man in black walked up the steps.

**It's always darkest before the dawn.**

My neck gave away and my head slumped into the hands of the man. He gently lifted me and I had just enough strength to recline back into my shell. I couldn't tell if the crowd was silent or if they were responding to what I had said. Either way, I was proud. Proud of my country and proud of its people. ",llamachicken1

We are here in the green room in the house of state to hear Terry the Tortoise, who has been listening in at the house of state for over 200 years about what he’s learned by listening in to some of our greatest leaders, and some of the worst, through good times and bad. After years of cajoling and prompting, he has finally agreed to share his words in this unprecedented press conference.

Oh, here he come now. Lets listen in to him and his words of wisdom.

"[WP] You are a 217 year old Galapagos Tortoise, and have served as the Presidential pet your entire life. You have been listening the whole time, and now technology has progressed to such a point that a device allows animals to speak. Your first press conference is about to begin...",FoxyGran,"Two hundred and seventeen years is a long time to be alive. I've seen generations come and go, and I've seen their effects on society and the world. I've been privileged to be the First Pet of this nation, to witness great moments in history, to be present during momentous negotiations and accords. 

Now that I am able to speak and voice my thoughts, I have also become, what I would like to consider, a useful adviser to the President. In some odd way, he treats me as a being of great wisdom, as if I'm a great oracle providing insights into his decisions, pointing out how he might be making the same mistakes as his predecessors.

For the first time, I've been invited to speak. To speak in front of someone other than the President and his cabinet. To speak to people, and tell them what I think. 

I stare out into the crowd over the microphones. The cameras and lights make me nervous. I'm a tortoise, for God's sake. God... that's an interesting topic, especially for a tortoise. 

""Hello Everyone.""

Cameras start clicking, there is a rustle through the crowd, and now everyone is listening. 

""I've only been able to speak for a short while, and I have many things I'd like to share with you. It's difficult to pick a place to start.""

The attendees are rapt with attention now. It is just as odd to them as it is to me to be in this situation. Listening to an aged tortoise impart wisdom.

""So instead, I would like to start by posing a simple question to you all, to humankind.

""What..."" 

Not a single bit of movement now. These men and women have stopped. Their immediate focus on my words, their breaths held so as to not miss anything.

""What The FUCK! WHAT THE FUCK is wrong with you?!"" I could keep the rage in check no longer. The anger and frustration began to pour out of me.

""How the fuck have you managed to screw things up so badly? The eco-system has gone to shit, the quality of life has bottomed out, and here you are listening to a FUCKING TORTOISE to give you something to hope for! GET YOUR LIVES TOGETHER YOU PIECES OF SH..""

They pulled the microphones then. 

I like to think I gave them a bit of perspective. Something only an old, presidential pet could do. A fucking talking tortoise, calling out all of humanity.",DoubleHelicopter
"[WP] One day, time just suddenly stops for a short moment for you. At first, you tried to mess around, but after the 246th times it happened, you start to realise that your power is not stopping time, but being able to move in time frozen by another person in the world.",Gellette,"It's the little things that get you, you know. Things you take for granted, that you never expect to worry about, until BAM. Sudden life or death situation. Things like showers for instance.

...God I miss showers.

Of course, after standing trapped in a prison of frozen water droplets for fifteen minutes without the slightest explanation they tended to lose a bit of their appeal. That was how this whole thing started. I woke up one morning, fruitlessly begged the universe to stop being Monday, and started to get ready for work.

Then I spent a quarter of an hour freaking the fuck out as the world abruptly decided to stop making any goddamn sense.

I did eventually figure out that I could move the water out of the way with enough effort, but that was one experience I could have done without. As was dropping onto the bathroom floor in a mindless panic and flopping around like a headless chicken loud enough that my roommate barged into the bathroom to investigate, only to find my naked ass wrapped up in the shower curtain like a birthday present wrapped by a blind man.

Trust me, the jokes get old fast.

At least I was dressed the second time it happened. In the middle of the ride to work, the world up and froze again. I thought it was an accident at first, but I was the only one on the floor. I was the only one moving too. Hell, I was the only *thing* moving.

In retrospect that was the moment I realized that, whatever this was, it wasn't going to stop. So I set about trying to figure it out.

My only saving grace was that it wasn't entirely random. Oh it's not like I could set my watch to it, but there were rules I could make out that gave me a general guideline to work with.

1. Three or four times a day seemed to be the average, usually a couple times in the morning and again in the afternoon. The extra time only happened on the weekends.
2. Never less than around fifteen minutes, and sometimes as much as an hour each, but usually about twenty minutes per stop.
3. Things that aren't a part of me don't move with me without a lot of effort. Even small things are immovable if there are enough of them, hence the shower prison. My one pound weight felt like a ten pounder, so I guess things have about ten times the resistance when stopped. No flat screens for me, but all the free snacks I could carry.
4. Conservation of momentum is a thing. A painful thing. No bikes, no cars, no boats, no planes.
5. It wasn't something *I* was doing.

That last rule was the big one, and it took me a lot longer to figure out than the other four. A couple months. By that time I'd gotten pretty used to it, and I even learned how to take advantage of it. Heh, 'Stealing time for fun and profit!' I'm not gonna lie and say I was a boyscout. I'm only human, and pretty middle of the road at that. I didn't hurt anyone, and I didn't do anything permanent beyond some petty theft. Other than that though, I took full advantage of the situation.

That was how I first found out I wasn't the only one in this situation. And I definitely wasn't the one in charge of it.

""Seriously dude? You ride a ten speed, not a Harley. You don't need the BMX gear.""

I shrugged. ""You never know, right? Better safe than sorry.""

Dave grunted out a laugh. ""Yeah, whatever man. You keep telling yourself that. I swear man, you're like that one kid from Christmas Story whose mom packed him in a dozen jackets. You act like the worlds gonna end if you aren't careful.""

For obvious reasons, that was hilarious to me and I grinned widely. ""Not end, just, stop for a while.""

""Man, you're one crazy son of a bitch.""

""Yeah, but I'm the son of a bitch with a twenty four pack pack of Sam's."" I replied good-naturedly.

Dave winced. ""Sorry, not tonight man. Carrie's parents are coming over tomorrow, and you know how she gets when I drink. Take a raincheck?""

""Yeah yeah. Go crawling back to your wife you pussywhipped bastard.""

""Says the guy that hasn't gotten laid since High School.""

""Fuck you.""

""You ain't got the cash. Talk to ya Monday.""

I was about to answer when the world froze. I blinked in surprise and looked around. That... wasn't normal. What the fuck? I took the graveyard shift specifically because this shit didn't happen at night. Hell, the latest this had ever happened was nine.

Dammit. I couldn't even use this to get home faster, since I was in the middle of talking to Dave. Which meant I was stuck waiting for it to end. Well fuck that! If I was gonna be stuck here, then I was gonna make it count.

Daniel Riley was an incompetent, insufferable bastard. A brown-nosing pissant that swore the sun rose from between the floor manager's ass cheeks. And he was my direct supervisor. He was also still in the building. And his car — a top of the line model that was worth more than my annual salary — was less than twenty feet away.

Needless to say, I found a creative way to pass the time. Hah. Time.

I was just settling back into position in front of Dave, flush with the satisfaction of a job well done, when I saw something moving out of the corner of my eye.

I saw something *moving.*

I whirled around so fast my feet slipped out from under me, and I barely managed to catch a glimpse of a figure staring in shock before I hit the ground. By the time I got back up they were rounding a corner, and a moment later time resumed.

""Whoa! The hell?""

I turned back around to see Dave staring at me with his mouth open. Shit. Okay, no problem. Just play it off.

""What's up?""

""How the hell did you get over there? You were just standing right here!""

I raised an eyebrow and frowned. ""I walked. Dave, you okay man?""

Dave opened his mouth to say something, before shaking his head. ""I... yeah. I'm fine. Must be more tired than I thought. I'm losing seconds.""

""That sounds like more than just tired. Hell, that sound like some kinda medical thing. You think you should be driving right now?""

Dave waved his hand dismissively. ""Nah. It's cool. I'm good."" He ran his hand through his hair and shook his head again. ""Yeah, I'm good,"" he muttered more quietly.

""Alright. If you're sure.""

*****

The second Dave left, I dropped my helmet back onto my bike and took off after the unknown person. They couldn't have gotten that far. I was not Olympian, but I wasn't out of shape either. And I was raised in this city. Whoever they were, I was certain I could catch them. Or at least follow them.

I rounded the corner and ran straight into an ambush. I had zero time to react, and I found myself knocked flat on my ass with my arm twisted behind my back and a weight pinning me to the ground. The world froze again.

""Who are you? How are you bypassing the stasis field?"" The voice was loud, angry, and unmistakably female.

""Wha—Who the hell should I know! I chased after you to ask the same goddamn thing!""

The woman was quiet for a moment, before pulling back and letting me go. I got back to my feet, rubbing my wrist angrily and turned to look at my attacker.

The world froze again. Less literally, but much more emphatically. My first thought? Daaaamn. My second thought? **Hot damn!**

I've seen pretty women before, I have internet. But still... Ho. Lee. Sheet.

Naturally, I was smooth and confident and completely blew her mind. That's why she looked at me the way she did. Absolutely not because I shoved my foot into my mouth so hard I could play footsie with my spine. Definitely.

Point being, I finally had an explanation for what the fuck was happening. Turns out that one meme guy was right. I'm not saying it was aliens, but... It was aliens. Immigrants from Sirius to be specific.

And I'm the lucky son of a bitch that married her.",EldritchSpawn

"[WP] One day you realize that you have telekinetic powers. Instead of doing something meaningful with them, you decide to slightly inconvenience others around you. And nobody suspects that you could be the cause",Nervi403,"This is the third record of my weekly pranking video. I hope you enjoyed the last two. This time we use a slippery floor sign to troll other people. In this video, we focus on people, who are late and still try to catch the train. I've been here for one hour in the bush now, nobody could've seen me. Now we just need to wait for a train, which will come any second now... and just when we speak of the devil; the train is arriving. 

Do you guys hear it too? I hear a noise which comes and goes in a constant rate and it goes louder and louder... Someone is coming! I must stay quiet... 

I heard how the steps stopped for a second. As I can't move because it will be audible, I must see what happened after getting home. Oh, the train moves on! Did he make it? As I looked around, nobody was near the train waiting area. It seems like he made it, guys. Okay, I am gonna make sure the next person is gonna be not going onto the train. How am I gonna do that? By replacing the slipperly floor sign. See you in a second. 

Ten minutes later and I hear how two persons go for the train. 

Oh, I wonder if I could stop th---?

Someone just went past the bush. Interesting, really interesting. I need to watch that right now. 

Okay, guys, I can't believe it, but I made one person to not get to the train on time. It was a woman, like you will see it in a few seconds. It was really close though. As you will see in a few seconds, the guy next to her slowed down significantly, but started to go the way after a few seconds, meanwhile the woman instantly turned to the right to go to the way where usually wheelchair users gets to the train. 

What do you want next time for a prank? Put it in the comments below!",Janfox
"[WP] One day you realize that you have telekinetic powers. Instead of doing something meaningful with them, you decide to slightly inconvenience others around you. And nobody suspects that you could be the cause",Nervi403,"You're going to think I'm full of it, but I really don't care. The first thing I moved was my light saber.

Not one of those BS telescoping plastic pieces of crap, either. It cost almost $200. And I've got it on a stand on my dresser. 

A couple times a week, when I wake up, I'll keep my eyes shut and imagine I'm hanging upside-down on Hoth. I'll extend my arm and try to pull the weapon to me. 

So last Tuesday, I'm doing it, and I feel something donk me in the head. That's how I realized I could do it. I still call it using The Force even though my power's pretty different in a lot of ways.

I spent the first couple of days luxuriating in how convenient it made everything. I'd pull the TV remote to me from halfway across the room. I'd turn off lights when I was already in bed. One time, I was almost out the door when I realized I forgot my car keys. I didn't have to move. One second, empty hand - next second, go time.

That shit got boring pretty quick, though. There's only so many times you can get yourself a beer or a bag of chips without budging from the couch before you stop appreciating it and just come to expect it. And it was useful for grabbing and big kinds of gestures but not so much for more delicate work. One time I tried to make myself a bowl of cereal without looking and it...did not go well.

I certainly didn't set out to be a prankster or anything. I mean, I love shows like *Jackass* and all but only when they're messing with themselves or each other. When they rope innocent people into it, I always cringe a little. Or used to, anyway.

But I was walking to the store one day and this douche canoe on a bike nearly runs me over - and then yells at *me* for getting in *his* way. 

I don't even remember consciously thinking about it. A few seconds later, I heard a metallic crash, and Mr. Cycling Shorts is lying sideways, his special shoes tangled up in the pedals of his road bike.

Even then, it wasn't like a door being kicked open, letting me in to a whole new realm of possibility. It was like it was unlocked, and I could see through the peephole. 

For a few days, I made a lot of people trip and stumble. At first, just people who were acting in a way to deserve it, then people who looked like they deserved it, and sometimes just because I thought it would be funny. Like Fancy Suit CEO guy who got knocked ass-backwards into a big puddle. That was one of my favorites for a while, just because of how quickly his voice went from normal to shrill when he said ""Oh, what THE HELL?""

With practice, I was able to get a little more creative. Knocking credit cards out of people's hands just before they paid for something. Smashing people's smart phones (I know, that sounds pretty dickish - I only did it to people who were using speaker phone to have a conversation in a public place). 

And yeah, I did end up doing some training. I would practice in my apartment, getting better at more complex movements, subtler shifts. 

It was on a trip to Vegas that things really opened up for me. I was at a roulette table although - and this is kind of embarrassing - I was just playing normal, like anybody else. Then I noticed this old guy...like 50s, maybe 60s, wearing a stetson and a silk fucking shirt. Dude's got his arm around what's effectively a pair of tits with blond hair and legs who was, at most, *half* his age. But probably even younger.

Anyway, Pedo the Cowboy is making a big deal about how much money he has, how well he's doing, telling Booby McTitsalot she's his lucky charm. And I decide to wreck him.

So the rest of my time there, any bet he makes, the wheel goes against him. And even still - it's only halfway through before I realize I should be earning something at the same time. Look, I never said I was bright, ok? 

After I wipe him out, and cover my trip and then some, I'm smart enough to move on. I consider playing the slots (at someone else's expense, of course) before deciding that it's a no go - the wheels move too fast for me to be able to figure out where to stop them, not to mention I'm not convinced there isn't some kind of tampering alarm that would go off. 

Anyway, I work the strip, never spending too long at any one table or in any one casino. I do mess around with craps some but find roulette a lot easier to manage. 

When I come home, I quit my job so I can dedicate myself to being a full-time fucker-upper of people. I go through what I refer to as my ""Wet Period,"" where I just make people dowse themselves when they try to drink something. After one really awful episode, though, I decide to steer clear of hot drinks. 

I branch out from there. For guys who are ultra douchey I meet at bars, I'll follow them into the bathroom and bend their stream so they piss on themselves. Or just give them a phantom nut tap, which is a lot easier and usually way more funny. I pound invisible fists into people's entrees, sending a spray of sauce and food bits into the faces of everyone sitting with them. I hear some lady verbally abusing a cashier in the mall one time and snap the heel off her pump so she twists her ankle. After staying up most of one night I get pretty good and faking a cell phone vibration and spend a few days making as many people as possible check their pockets for a notification that isn't there. Every now and then I make a game to see how big of an insect I can get to fly up someone's nose. I nearly did it with a junebug once - the guy had the biggest nostrils I had ever seen, but I was just a millimeter off with my aim.

Soon, I'm going to head back to work. I want to get an office job. There's a ton of computer-focused stuff I want to try...playing with the monitor power, messing with people's mouses, sending emails before they're finished. Besides, it's boring having a super power.

"[WP] You are mind reader but can only see people's lost or repressed memories. You are part therapist, part detective, and much in demand. You are also a complete fraud.",Rinthrah,"I have a television show. It still blows my mind that people might want to have someone 'read their mind' in a dark, squished, chronically-behind-on-rent little basement below a club or something, but on national television? It is *unbelievable*. I'm supposed to be the mind reader, but even I can't pretend to know why people line up for this sort of thing. And they line up for hours! In the rain, in the cold, in every sort of torturous weather -- just to be sat down in front of me while I stare intently into their eyes.


Sometimes, I wonder if they go along with it just because they're on camera, with a live studio audience that hangs onto my every word (or, at least, is prompted to ooh and aah at the right moments). No one wants to look ridiculous on camera. They come here to bask in their fifteen minutes (with three commercial breaks thrown in-between) and brag to their friends that they ""were on that one daytime talk show, no really, make sure you record it!""


Ick. I get a lot of bored housewives cuing up outside of the studio, let me tell you that, so I *know* what I'm talking about.


But seriously, not everyone can be pretending, right? Not everyone comes here to blink doe-eyed at me and make astonished faces and pretty smiles at the camera. There's gotta be some people who come here to 'expose' me, who just want to lean back in their cushy seat, smirk at the camera, and say, ""You are just making that up. I can see through your intent expression, which actually looks like you're really constipated."" (My producers assure me that my worries about the whole constipation-expression are unfounded and I just look like a serious professor thinking deeply about an important topic ... and when I push it, they remind me that I made my career on that stupid expression and I can't stop making it now, it's on every ad and the backs of all my books.)


Well, everyone is free to expose me! My producers tell me that only drives the ratings up. Oh, how I laugh when I hear that. Imagine how much higher the ratings would be if I exposed myself! Everyone would flock to my show just to see if I'm really *that* talented at bullshitting. Which, might I say, I am.


I get away with it because I, apparently, specialize in 'lost' or 'repressed' memories, so it doesn't matter if someone says they don't believe me -- they've just repressed the memory *so* deeply that my words can't revive it. At which point, I will lean back in my chair, wrinkle my forehead, and maybe even stroke my chin sadly if I'm feeling daring. I'll shake my head and proclaim mournfully, ""I have helped you as best as I can. My advice at this point is to think on my words. Don't forget what I have told you today. Perhaps one day you will remember the truth, the truth I gave you. Even if you do not realize it, this repressed memory is influencing your life, inhibiting your unconscious mind and affecting your conscious actions. But once you have accepted this memory back into your conscious mind, you can work through any pain or trauma this memory may have unconsciously inflicted, and come out a stronger person for it.""


Yeah. I told you I was good at this.


I'll have to stop at some time, I guess. Everyone *thinks* it's real -- even, or should I say *especially*, my producers -- but just how long can the act go on? Anyone with some sense of intelligence dismisses me completely, but I've still got my crowd of stupid, faithful followers. I just have to wonder what, exactly, would it take to get them to turn up their noses and proclaim, ""Of course it was fake, I thought that all along, I just watched because it was on the TV!""


I'm good at playing a crowd, I admit. I'm good at turning on the charm, I'm good at reading people's expressions, I'm good at smiling sympathetically at the right moments and frowning slightly at the others. I'm a very good actor, or at least good enough to the right people (again: bored housewives). I've been very, very good at getting myself rich. But don't get mad at me when you figure out I'm a complete fraud, because I'm not the one who made me famous. *You* are. You, as a collective whole, made me famous. I'm just doing this because *you* want me to. If you didn't pay, I wouldn't play, but look where we both are. You're glued to a television screen, while I'm smiling blandly at a camera. And aren't we both just happy to be there?


People are idiots. I don't even have to read minds to know that.

Honestly I zoned out a little. “Yes I do! I’m sorry for my little rant, I really came here to ask you about a repressed memory I feel I’m having” replied Alice. “Lately when I go to bed and close my eyes I see the same dark clouds in the sky, it begins to rain, and I run. I can’t remember anything else. It feels real though, I know it’s not just a dream, can you help me remember what happened?” I try hard to not roll my eyes. Is she seriously asking me to tell her the rest of her “memory”? How can anyone believe that’s anything other than a recurring nightmare. Luckily for her I’m a fraud. Always have been, I’ve never actually been able to see people’s forgotten and repressed memories. You see the thing is if you tell people what they want to hear they believe you and I’ve invented a business where I essentially tell people things they’d like to hear. That is I add charisma to their pasts, I enlighten them, I even help them come to terms with dark places inside of themselves, if that’s the kind of thing they’re wanting to hear. Do I regret my fraudulent business? Not at all, I help people. Even when I did detective work I helped close cases and tie up lose ends for the local police department. I didn’t frame innocent men or anything like that, I simply used my professional therapeutic ability to remind the guilty parties of their wrong doings in a way that could better be held up in court. In a way that couldn’t so easily be repealed and put a rapist right back out on the streets. So can my business even be considered fraudulent if I’m doing so much good? “Dr. Grace? Dr. Grace are you seeing my memory right now?” Oh that’s right Alice is still here. “Alice you left your house in the middle of a thunderstorm to save your neighbors cat from a tree. I’m not sure why you would repress such an act of bravery, you are truest remarkable.” “Oh thank you Dr. Grace! I knew there was something positive in that memory, I just knew it.” Easiest $600 I ever made. ",nicksgirl54

""Ok Carlos we just need to hear from you that you are now willing and able for me to enter your mind."" 

Carlos whimpered with hesitation , ""yes , yes. Do it , doctor !! I'm ready"". 

This was always the fun part . I placed both hands on his temple and I started to shout in gibberish - thought it's more effective and believable. 

""Babbsjejeklfvkjejwhzujwiqiwuiekrl - BEGIN ! 

Carlos slammed the gas pedal . And we were off ! We picked up speed and we're going into oncoming traffic . Cars were passing by left and right , honking and swearing at us. 

Carlos started screaming ""ahhh ahh!"" 

""No no , Mr Esteban you're doing great . Don't worry I'm controlling your mind. There's no possible way we will get hurt ."" 

With a smirk I turned the radio back up - the song was at the best part .  

What our easily fooled client doesn't know is that I absolutely am full of shit . And I absolutely can't read minds . And I'm absolutely out of my own mind - I lost it long ago when the one thing I loved was taken from me. It has driven me to this end. 

Carlos kept up his annoying screaming . 
""Keep calm Mr. Esteban , you're going to be cured - just a little more ."" 

Surprisingly he kept the car pretty straight enough to not collide with any guard rails and highway lights. Our fun was about to conclude . In front of us was the edge of a cliff that would send us hurtling hundreds of feet to our deaths .

[IP] 2089 Miner,Syraphia,"""Press ID onto scanner. Input daily mine amount.""


Pushing the screen took more work than usual.  Scoring below the daily minimum was instant punishment. The first offence was no meals for the next 24 hours. The second offence was a beating by the few guards there were in the salvage area.  The third offence was reassignment, more often than not to a harsher facility. 


The daily was high with the number of new comers. Fresh batches always scored higher, usually some overzealous group try to make a names for themselves.  In any other facility, it might have worked. 


But this was the Salvage Mines, manned by a rotating group of 12 officers, wardens and guards that controlled the facility from a control booth.  Automated systems with cameras in every room, privacy was a luxury.  Automated gruel feeding machines with routine checks from scanning bots.  Manual input systems for slaves mean accountability against an automatic record.  If they found discrepancies, a global punishment was often awarded to a barrack of slaves.  


In the cafeteria, the line was longer than usual.  The new batch of slaves was a group from the recently conquered city states.  Men that had no calluses on their hands, fingers and looked like they shaved every day.  Many of them were disgusted with the conditions, a part of their mind clinging onto the hope that they might fulfil their debt and free themselves.


The slop poured from the machine.  It was a beige grey color.  A stack of bottles at the end marked the end of the work week and the start of a 12 hour free period.  The small bottle was grain alcohol.


Sitting down, I attacked the gruel stuffing in as much and gnawing on any lumps possible before the sour aftertaste arrived.  Taking a swing of the alcohol, I managed to get a few gulps in before I felt the hard burn down my esophagus. Blinking away tears, the drink began to take effect.


Looking at the drab surrounding, the walls were lined with nothing but a tangible sense of despair.  The dim walls made the dozens of black dots on the ceiling ever more obvious.


I saved half the bottle to trade.  There wasn't much to trade for, only better equipment, sometimes a pack of cigarettes would appear from the guards.  I once heard that someone traded a guard for a steak. My mouth watered at the sensation of eating something solid rather than the goopy paste that was regularly served.  


Getting into the barracks, I traded the bottle for a fresh pair of earbuds.  Those orange fluff bits were worth more than anything right now, sleeping between two score of slaves.  Many of them were already asleep, either drunk or passed out. Some were like me, just exhausted.  Plugging them in, I eased into the blackness without difficulty.

The sounds of mining machinary and moving metal played out through the area.  There was the occasional pause as the metal behemoths repositioned themselves, before continuing anew.

He shook his pickaxe free of his breathing tube and continued to work, striking the hard ground at a rhythmic pace. He sung as he work, a low and meaningful tune to anyone who has been around for a while. It was a miners song, telling of the beauty of the homeland and the wives and children who waited for them there.

As the saying went, there was a war on. And you either went down into the pits or up into the skies to fight and here were those who wished to avoid conflict. The old, the crippled, the lame and those who refused to fight.  It was choking, suffocating.

They dug and they sung for a homeland which would no longer require boots on the ground or picks held in the air, a homeland where their family would welcome them home with open arms and loving embraces.

[IP] The Churchyard,Syraphia,"“Excuse me?” 

“I said I don’t recommend walking through here.” The old man said 

“The old graveyard?” I ask, by back is beginning to hurt with this damn thing. You thing history could try to be a little less historical, or science a little less dense. If not for the sake of digestion, maybe the sake of my back. Books were never fun, what with the work that they carried with them. The first day back made the weight all the more foreign. 

“Kinda need to cut through.”

“You done that before?” he asks

“Yes, I’ve walked through a graveyard before, anything about this one to be worried about.”

“Terrible things.” 

“Lemme guess, gang of bullies?”

“Nope.”

“Then I’ll be fine.”

“If you say so.” He says. 


The next day is the same in regards to work, the half-assed attempts on everyone’s part to teach and to learn. The same weight on my back too, damn you Thoreau. I leave to find the same man, standing next to the gates. 


“I see you’re back.” Said the old man from yesterday.

“Cut through despite my warnings.”

“Yes. It’s just a graveyard.”

“Just a graveyard? It’s not right what it is.”

“Lemme guess, demons? Ghosts? Some undead?”

“Nothing of that sort.”

“Then I’ll be fine.”

“If you say.” He says. 

The third day goes the same, seventeen weeks of back pain until break to go. Then seventeen more weeks of back pain. I leave to find the same man as always, looking only a day older.

“Going to cut through again?”

“Yep. Going to tell me there is someone waiting with a chainsaw?”

“Nobody. Just silence.”

“So then what exactly is there that you need to slow me down and reflect on the failure of the American education system?”

“When you go through that graveyard, what do you hear?”

“Nothing, why?”

“No undead to harass you? No ghosts of those long passed?”

“None besides the old dudes in the books on my back.”

“How many others do you find in that graveyard?”

“Just you. Waiting for me I guess.”

“Correct. Just me. Can you guess why I am here?

“To annoy me? To visit a love one?”

“To visit my dead.”

“And?”

“And, In that graveyard I never see another person for the dead.”

“So?”

“So soon there isn’t going to be anyone for them. Nobody for me I imagine. If so, that will only last as long as they will, and that ain’t much longer by comparison.”

“So death is scary? Is that what you are trying to say?”

“Worse. Death is nothing. Nothing is what follows after you die, what is left for you here. No matter what you believe in. Your name is a few short generations away from being as meaningless as an old man’s advice. Soon nothing will follow me. Soon nothing will be all that I am to this world. Just like them we all become. So avoid it. No man runs into a graveyard. No man leaves one happier than he entered. Do yourself a favor and distract yourself from that nothing as long as you can.”

“Ok old man, will do.”

I think I did after that. Just to avoid him. Not like I hadn’t heard how bad death was a thousand times. But nothing…Nothing stuck. It was that silence of the graveyard that followed me that I learned to hate. That nothingness of named blurred, dates obscured, and religious icons skewed into meaningless gravestone toppers. So I stopped going through the graveyard. Because I was afraid of nothing.

[IP] The Churchyard,Syraphia,"It was the third day without my big brother Adam. I could tell that the funeral arrangements were drawing to a close by the nervous energy Mom always emanates when she knows the family is in town. Dad still hasn't said more than two or three words at a time since the accident.

I wasn't spared the horrid business of the visit to the hospital where they took the body, the gentle but persistent questions the police asked for their report, and the worst of the sobbing. It had all seemed like a blur to me, unreal in its misery. My first vacation home from university couldn't be like this, not when I had been so eager to see them all after so long a time.

I hadn't been home the summer before - I had a girlfriend at the time who was a townie and I didn't want to leave her or all the new friends I'd made freshman year. I just got a job and stayed, just calling home once in a while. Mom and Dad were hurt but Adam seemed to understand.

""Just call Mom once in a while and make sure to come home for Thanksgiving,"" he had said. ""Dad talks tough but deep down he's just making a show for Mom's benefit. Have fun and make sure to come back home at least once if they let you go. We'll catch some fish and shoot the shit."" I never did, though. It was only until recently I was able to catch fish with him again at the local lake. It came to me suddenly and sharply what a fond memory that was, the two of us just drifting, drifting out in the water, watching a storm in the distance.

By noon we were mostly ready to attend the funeral. It was a packed church service, which was surprising to me considering how my brother was. I was always the socialite, but I never did give him the credit he deserved and I hadn't seen him in a year. So much had changed in him when we spoke over the phone that I felt I hardly knew him. Our last boating trip together he had been so charismatic that I lost track of time. I wasn't even scared when the waves began to whip up around us and we began to paddle for shore, laughing all the while about how we could never tell Mom.

Our town only supports one cemetery and it was positively ancient. I was told once our family had plots back to the town's founding in 1873 and I can believe it. As I approached, I could hear the final blessing being said before Adam would be lowered down into the earth. I was glad his casket was closed and that I could not see his face. His cold blue face. Something about the thought made my insides crawl.

With the whole family standing there, it was hard to see into his grave but people understood my need to see him one last time. I was able to make my way to him with no trouble. As I stood over it, I noticed a second grave next to it.

""No!"" I cried, but no one could hear me.

There was a second casket being lowered. I could remember now. The howl of the wind through the trees on the shore, the buffeting of our small row boat as it threatened to tip and finally did so. Our failure to keep our heads above the water, and the sting of cold in my lungs as I inhaled frothy water in my last moments of life. I was dead, because I was there with Adam as he drowned. At least he wasn't alone.",MillenialSage

[IP] Intense Battle,Syraphia,"""Give me my belt and guns!"" Talia yells. Bronson pulls her to the floor and studies their surroundings.


""No! And be quiet, I can't make their locations.""


""There's 2 packs. At our 2 o'clock and 6. You can't take them alone.""


He ignores her and closes his eyes, locating the groups that are following them and mapping a course of action. Talia interrupts his planning.


""We only have seconds!"" She whispers. ""I'm not who you think I am, just let me have my stuff so we can fight these guys off.""


""Shut up, you're lucky I don't have you bound.""


Every plan Bronson comes up with he gets overpowered, he will need her help. ""Dammit! Here."" He hands her weapon kit over, just as he does, a pebble rolls down the cliff next to them.


""Above us!"" She yells. Bronson motions to his bow but the Sleather is already soaring at him, before he can unsheathe his dagger:


**BLAM!**


Talia unloads a round into its chest; Red sprays from the Sleather's pierced armor and it falls to the floor. 


Two more of the deranged attackers descend from the cliff


  **BLAM!**   **BLAM!**


Talia misses one Sleather and clips the other. Bronson is too busy to lend her a hand because the second pack begins to converge on their left.  He runs up on one and drives his armor-plated knee into its jaw, slashes another across the face and parries the apparent leader of this pack of three. He figures this is the leader because it wears the heaviest set of armor and the sword he wields is the most well kept. He bashes back the already wounded Sleather with his forearm to create distance and drives his dagger between the shoulder guards of the other. The stab to the neck kills it. 


Talia's dagger meets the blade of the last Sleather of her pack, she already hit the clipped Sleather with another shot that floored it permanently but as she let off that shot the last Sleather quickly ran up on her and attempted a tackle but she was able to use the momentum to her advantage and  kick it off. She is now in a sword fight with the swiftly moving assailant, her swordsmanship isn't her strongest skill so she can only match the Sleather's swings to guard but can't mount an offensive comeback. A glance behind her shows a large rock formation, and she remembers although this Sleather seems to be quite fast it seemed to be slightly clumsy when it made its way down the cliff. She holds out her knife to be hit and as the Sleather strikes it she drops her dagger to the floor causing the Sleather's powerful strike to hit the dirt and as it composes itself she runs towards the rock pile, vaults over it, rolls and grabs at her boot. The trailing Sleather gets ahold of the rock, leaps over it and flies right into:


  **POP!**


Talia's one-shot pistol, catching a bullet to the face; A chunk of flesh falling away.


Bronson straight kicks the still leaking blood, wounded Sleather as the ""Leader"" continues to confirm he's a different caliber than the rest. His skills in sword combat are much better than, not just the others from this pack but Sleather's Bronson has faced before. The Wounded, Novice Sleather comes at him and Bronson finally disarms him. The Leader tries a straight stab, Bronson spins out of the way and hits him with a backfist, stumbling him. The Novice, now unarmed tries to bite Bronson but he drives his broadsword through its thin chestplate, slaying the enemy. He starts to retrieve his sword but the Leader catches the opening and bum-rushes Bronson. He gets his footing and attacks the Leader with his dagger, slicing into his fur and catching on his armor. The Leader almost gracefully flicks his sword vertically and Bronson tries to guard it but the strike hits his dagger with such intensity that it knocks the blade out of his hand and into the dirt.


""Hmm...where'd a Sleather learn how to do that?""


The Leader snarls something in his native language. Bronson doesn't need to know what he said to understand him, the language of battle is always the same. A smirk comes to Bronson's face, the stand-off is at a stand still for a moment. The Sleather speaks again, but Bronson tunes him out while he maps out his course of action-


The Sleather will rush him, his gauntlets will buy him one free guard, catching the Leader by surprise since he hasn't used them yet. He'll strike the Leader after and earn a few seconds. A tuck, a roll, he'll get to the Novice's body, plant his foot on the back of him and pull his broadsword out just in time to catch the Leader's next hit. Then a one-on-one swordfight, no matter how skilled this Sleather is he's no match for him. Fight over.


With his plan mapped he smirks again and with two hands goads the Leader on. ""Come on."" The Leader re-grips his sword and on cue begins to rush Bronson, **but:**


  BLAM!


The Sleather Leader's head disappears. He falls to reveal, Talia with gun in hand; The barrel still smoking.


""What the hell!?"" Bronson shouts.


""What are you talking about?""


""Why did you shoot him!?""


""He was going to kill you.""


""What are you talking about? I had him right where I wanted him.""


""You were unarmed.""


""I know, it was finally a fair fight.""


""I save your life and this is that thanks I get.""


""I would thank you, but I can't help but notice you haven't lowered your gun yet.""


Talia keeps him at gunpoint for a moment then lowers her hand.


""I already told you, I'm not the one you're looking for.""


Bronson retrieves his sword and dagger then approaches her with his hands out. 


""Then you won't mind me taking those from you.""


""Are you serious?""


""Like it or not, you're in the Kingdom's territory and technically under arrest.""


""Here, because when we get to your boss and he tells you who I actually am the look on your face will be worth it.""

[IP] Downtime,Syraphia,"The night is my escape. The cool breeze and moonlight my companions. Distant chatter, feet on pavement, wheels on roads – a soothing soundtrack to accompany the scene of my favorite movie, one I try to watch every night.

I sit on this ledge. It is dangerous but it is also where I feel the most safe. Away from everybody out there. I enjoy this solitude. I don’t have to talk to anybody, and nobody has to talk to me. It is bliss.

There is no reason to leave. Up here, I don’t have to worry about a thing. Nobody can see me. Nobody can reach me. Just a fly on a wall, watching the world go by. I like it very much.

The funny thing is, this isn’t even my apartment. I don’t belong here. Maybe one day when I make enough money, I’ll buy this place. Then I can stay here all night long. However, a part of me thinks that if I could come here all the time, it wouldn’t be so special anymore. I wouldn’t treasure every moment out here. Are things special only because we can’t have them all the time?

Oh dear, I’m starting to doubt the eminence of this place. That isn’t good. I thought I’d never find a lookout point better than this one. Now I’m starting to have second thoughts. What is wrong with me? I thought I was free from all those problems. I clear my thoughts and take a deep breath. I focus on the view again. I take it all in one more time.

[IP] Dark City,Syraphia,"Rain.  It never seemed to stop… Well unless you lived in California, then it never seemed to start. Millions of tiny droplets pummeling down, a muffled drum line carrying tiny bits of acid with each beat.  The drops slowly slip down the thick glass, little vertical rivers merging and splitting coalescing into tiny lakes before falling out of view.  Sky cars cutting through the rain like icebreakers, ferrying people who matter to places with meaning.  Flashes of light, sky high advertisements and lightning only differ by the color.  Drink Coca-cola.  I wonder if one could develop glass that made geometric patterns when it rains, call them pitter patter patterns.  Maybe they would break the never ending deluge of acid and doldrum.  They'd probably just add to it. 

Thunder.  I start up, the boss slammed another pile of insipid pabulum on my desk.   Time to feed the machine again, one built not for leisure or use but rather to justify its own existence.  Work for the sake of work, couldn't let my state mandated weekly halfday go too long.  My brain shifts back, the rain fades away reverting to the discordant cacophony of computer keys.  The chittering of a giant bug, each cell diligently serving its role.  Reproducing and dying to feed something bigger than itself, discarded and forgotten so long as the chittering never stops.  The chittering, the clicking, the clacking, consuming my thoughts.  I look down from the rooftop, the stinging rain beating against my skin.  Thoughts return to my mind, thoughts of apoptosis, if only they'd take down those nets.  I forgot my Xanax again. 

Lightning.  A spike of stimulants coursing through my brain with the force of the typhoon outside. I return through the great arteries of the superior creature in which I live. Each of us like blood cells running to and fro.  Back to my cozy cell, feeding this body as it needs.  The friendly screen is still blinking ready for us to finish our work. Only 6 more hours of hard work for my much deserved break!  My keyboard cheerfully clicks away, adding to the symphony of productivity throughout the office.

It kept repeating itself like it wanted to consume me. Just walk. Forget everything that happened, that was what you were told, so just walk! Just walk...

I cried inside. It was snowing heavily and my tears were frozen. Thankfully, the sound of my boots crushing snow kept the silence away. I wouldn't have been able to handle a silent world, so I kept on walking, never stopping at anything.

How many hours had passed? I began asking myself as the thought of walking forward and not looking back looped once more. I could feel my body getting numb despite my layers of clothing.

""Mew...""

I looked down at my companion. I was in awe of his stubbornness, yet 
I felt sorry for him because I couldn't help him. How cold and hungry must he be?

""Meow...""

His voice was weak and he was wobbly. Just walk, please, just walk.

""Me...ow""

I heard him fell and before I knew it, I was looking back. I stared at his weakened figure, how tired must he be? I walked back and stood before him. The silence was deafening.

""Mew...""

I kneeled.

""It'll be okay, baby,"" I picked him up. ""It'll be okay.""

He curled up in my embrace. I could feel his heart beating within his cold body.

[IP] Junk Yard,Syraphia,"Rats

It had been many years since the collapse of society at the hands of a single pesky rat. The story had changed many times over, with current incarnations giving the pest God-like powers. 

""He floated up into the sky and breathed fire across the land, wiping out all of humanity but our tribe!"" An old sage said.

He was dressed in a black robe, with long dirty fingers protruding from his sleeves. He danced around the fire as children screamed and laughed at the tale of the devil rat.

""Will you stop getting them riled up Grandpa? Kids, get to bed."" A younger man said.

He had the same worn down look in his eyes, though the years had not quite eaten him as it did his father. He was only 35 years old, or at least, somewhere around there. He was just a child when the world spiraled out of control. One nuclear explosion. Two nuclear explosions. Nuclear war, all because of a single rat chewing the cables at the launch site of a 3rd world country. 

They lived in what appeared to be a junkyard. He grew up with his father and sister in their bunker. It was many years before he saw daylight and what used to be the valleys of Ohio. Now it was nothing but rubble, trash, and debris scattered across the landscape.

It was fitting that the rats would survive such a tragedy. They were everywhere, so many in fact that they became the prime source of food. The stories helped fuel the children to catching the ""beasts"". It was normal to them. They lived, laughed, and loved as if this was the only reality that had ever existed.

It was enough to keep the young man going. There was hope in those children to not repeat the same mistakes. He smiled at his father.

""I guess I will get some more wood."" The old man said.

The young man nodded as his father wandered off across the landscape, searching for anything that could possibly burn. The children were worth it. He hoped his sister Emily, wherever she was now, felt the same. There was no other choice.

[IP] Junk Yard,Syraphia,"The twisted hunks of metal and scrap bloomed with native fauna that had somehow found a way to extract nutrients from the cold, soulless metal that littered the world that remained. 

Hiro stood atop a small hill, observing the scene before him. He found it was a good policy to look before searching, and helped to save energy that he couldn't spare. None of the materials here would be useful, it seemed, but there were plants he had never seen before. He scurried down the hill to the strange blue moss that seemed to be coloring the fog around him. 

He reached out with his staff, and pressed a button at the base. The claw at the end snapped shut, grabbing a portion of the moss and pulling it away from the steel surface it covered. As the force of the claw impacted it, the moss puffed with a blue dust. *Spores, perhaps?* 

Hiro withdrew a notebook from his knapsack, and crouched to gather more details about the plant. With the practiced hand of years of research, he recorded the details within minutes for review later. The plants of this new world had always intrigued him. They didn't seem to need light- this moss couldn't have gotten any sunlight. It was situated under a massive, decaying structure of the old world.

Hiro rolled his eyes. When had he started calling them 'structures'? He knew very well what skyscrapers had been. As if on queue, the old frame of the skyscraper began to groan. Metal cried out as it bent under the weight of gravity and scraped against other buildings. Hiro hadn't ever seen a skyscraper collapse, but he had seen the rubble left afterwards. He wasn't about to take the chance. 

Hiro steadied his hand and shifted the blue, smoky moss from the claw of his staff to a small container at his waist, all the while looking up to ensure that the building wouldn't come crashing down on him. He sealed the container, and jogged back into the low sunlight of the late evening. 

The groaning had stopped, but Hiro still made sure to give the skyscraper a wide berth. He cast his gaze around the area one final time, once more determining that none of the scrap here would be useful to him, and left, ready to search over the next hill.

[IP] Junk Yard,Syraphia,"“Spock! I’m home!” Landon slid the tin sheet behind him over the entrance to his home and looked around. It didn’t look as though anyone had found his home, which had been an issue the first few times he had set up in the junkyard. He couldn’t see his dog anywhere, but he knew it was likely that he wasn’t too far away; after all, Landon was probably Spock’s only source of steady food provision.

He leant his staff down next to the door and walked the short distance to the cardboard box that served as his table and put the few cans of groceries he could afford down on the box. The weight pushed the cardboard down several inches, but he had turned away to face another box – his closet. He disrobed the makeshift wizard robes he had worn that day ceremoniously folded and put into the box, then dressed in his everyday clothing of t-shirt and jeans.

It had been a good morning; his new LARP group was a great improvement over the last one he had been a part of. They appreciated and played along with the imagination that his wizard character required of the group and didn’t make him feel alienated by the fact that he wasn’t coming from the same circumstances as many of them. In his experience LARPers were more concerned with appearances and hooking up with people who were into role play than with the game itself.

LARPing wasn’t imaginary for Landon, it was his escape…to him, it was real.

“Spock! For reals, I’m going to eat now…you’re gonna miss it!” He turned around to face the table once more and grabbed a can from the plastic bag and his can opener from the shelf across from him. Cold beans for lunch, again. At least he wouldn’t be going hungry – which was something that had happened to him many times over the three years he had been without a more traditional living situation.

The can opened with a metallic ring as the can opener travelled around the circumference and the lid dropped into the can once the circuit was completed. If that noise wouldn’t bring Spock back to him, it was likely that he wouldn’t ever be coming back. Using his fingers, he scooped the beans into his mouth with gusto, enjoying the rich, earthy mouth feel.

There was a whimper and scratch behind him where a window of a car created his escape route should the front door be compromised and he looked up to see Spock looking down at him through the glass. Landon smiled, setting the can on the cardboard table as he jumped up and carefully moved the glass so that his canine companion could climb down into the hollow area. He had to move slowly to put the glass back in place, he knew from practice that if he wasn’t adequately cautious then the trash heap above him could shift and bury him beneath it.

With the glass in place his focus shifted to his friend. Spock was a skinny, medium-sized dog with wiry fur and ribs that were visible through his fur. Despite the rough life he must have had, Landon had befriended him and they were soon inseparable within the junkyard. He took the can from the box and poured the remaining half of the can onto a makeshift plate he had fashioned for Spock after the first time he’d tried to let him eat from the can and cut his muzzle. The scar still showed through the dog’s fur, and Landon felt guilt when he looked at it.

Spock finished the can and looked up at Landon, hope showing in his eyes. Landon knew what he was asking, though he didn’t’ have the words to articulate it, “I know bud, but we have to ration. Remember what happened last time we binged? We didn’t eat for 2 days after because there was no money and nothing in the trash. But,” he drew a wooden sword from behind the mangled trash heap of his bed, “we CAN go out on an adventure!”

Spock barked, maybe in acknowledgement of Landon’s words, perhaps just in response to his excitement – he was never sure – and the two of them slid back past the tin of the front door and into the junkyard beyond. Perhaps it wasn’t where no man had boldly gone before, but it was certainly where they had never gone before.

“...country roads, take me home…” Marie hummed, softer than the snow falling all around her. 

She tilted her cherry umbrella up and back, and gazed up towards the Moon and clouds as they played a childish game of peek-a-boo. 

She sighed into the windless night and ran a gloved hand over her long dark braid that ran from her hat and down onto her shoulder. 

She froze midway, and quickly dragged her hand back to the umbrella handle in a tight reunion. Her family had long ago pointed out her tick, a nervous motion that eventually adapted itself to every emotion from deep contentment to trembling worry. 

*“Mom and Dad would… “* Marie thought. 

Her humming fell through the world, lost in the brambled trail that such thoughts took her through.

“But that doesn’t matter right now.” Marie explained to the still night, closing her eyes for the slightest of moments and reorienting herself. 

“I wouldn’t be surprised if I could hear the Brown’s livestock” she mused to herself. On summer nights as peaceful as this, they could be heard braying and bleating from over the horizon. She listened in close, and was rewarded with only the sound of her breathing. 

*“Such a silent night.”* Marie thought. Her melody picked up again, finding itself anchored in the wonderful wintry landscape. 

Her steps crunched through the thin ice and gravel that layered the top of the road, each footfall cutting into her soft melody. It was a road she had taken many times before, but had never truly found herself on. Her mind always raced ahead, already warming up inside the large burgundy brick house that waited at the end of the road, huddling before the roaring fireplace that had her initials carved on a lone brick that jutted out from its inner walls. She couldn’t forget such a lasting memory.

Nor could she forget the blood that ran down the fireplace stoker and filled the ash basin to the brim. She hadn’t used the fireplace since. It would be frozen in her mind fathoms deeper than the fractures that sprouted in the ice beneath her feet. 

Marie fought to keep the panic rising in her chest and clutched the umbrella tight in her hands, feeling the strong plastic handle give way. She shook her head and remembered her therapist’s words. 

She took a breath like a drowned man after his salvation, savoring each ounce of chilled air that filled her lungs -- in-two-three-four -- and blew it out in a frost-lined, starry cloud -- out-two-three-four. 

“Stay in the present.” A timid and shaking smile came from its shelter and crossed her lips. She watched as snowflakes drifted down to ground, meeting forgotten reeds, stoic trees and snow blanketed fields that waited for sunnier days. 

She could appreciate that. 

The cold tried to wiggle its way into her thick coat, and reminded her of the distance back to her family home. Her stride kicked back into its lost pace. 

She quickly made her way towards the end of the road, where she could feel the house hiding within the forest like a panther, flicking its tail back and forth in the feigned sleep of a master predator. Marie paused at the mouth of the forest.

The dark winter night had found a deeper shade within the forest, painting shadows into void where there should have been black. She scanned the trees, searching for unseen eyes in the twigs and branches, and forced out a nervous laugh. 

Marie stepped onto the cement that marked the edge of her family’s residence, her step hesitant and heavy. *“Only one more week and then I’m gone.”*

[IP] Dark Winter,Syraphia,"In the town where I was raised, I grew to hate the snow.


We made the snowmen, of course; had our snowball fights; took the white Christmases as a given--but on the fifth mouthful of snow on the way home, it started to lose its magic. 


Off the main road out of the town, my parent’s house was at the end of a long dirt road I had to trek every day to and from school. In the summer, the local woods would attract mosquitoes. In the fall, the tracks from my father’s truck would leave form deep groves that would fill with mud in the rain, making my crutches lose all their traction. My mother would send me out covered in a layer of rubber, and soak the mud from them in the evening.


Winter froze the mud into hard icy surfaces hidden beneath the snow. Tripping on my bad leg changed from humiliating to bruising. On the rare occasion my father had to conduct an overnight delivery, fresh snowfall meant that I had to guess where the road was, poking through the snow with the end of my crutch to differentiate what was dirt and what was ice (in the places where there actually was a difference, of course).


Those winters, finding myself there face first in the snow for the hundredth time, my skin red and stinging, I determined the general injustice of the universe.


   *  *  *


My mother was the English teacher at the local school—when I was younger and still getting used to moving around on my own, she used to give me rides every school day. As I grew older my father started insisting that I make the trip on my own. “All Michael wanted”—my late uncle, who lost his arm overseas—“was to be treated like a normal person. Like a real human being,” he would tell my mother, staring her down. “You treat him like a baby his whole life, he’ll never make something of himself.”


When I was ten, he once found me in tears, sitting in my room, my four layers of clothing still on, damp and angry. He closed the door with saying anything, but the next day he dropped a small barbell on my bedroom floor. I stared at that thing every night I could not sleep, focusing all of my resentment at the world into a needle point, even long after I started to use it. 


   *  *  *


There was a student my mother grew particularly fond of, a girl. She wore dark stockings and carried a bright red umbrella when it rained or snowed. “She’s a year younger than you,” she would gush, “but she *loves* to write.” She would show me stories the girl had written (maybe hoping I’d pick up the habit too), but I never bothered reading them all the way through. Soon my mother was inviting her over for dinner, chatting to her animatedly about Jane Austen, Virginia Woolf, Mary Shelley, George Eliot.


She wasn’t exactly a neighbour, but we walked the same partition of dirt road on the way home, and her parents were glad for her not to come home alone, bad leg or no bad leg, especially those winter days when the sun would set in the mid-afternoon. She would tell me how she wanted to be a writer, a serious writer taken seriously, and how much she admired my mom and all the books my mom knew about and read. Her parents weren’t exactly the scholarly type; I heard a lot of talk from adults about how they were hoping she could be the first in her family to go to college.


“Maybe I’ll be like Emily Dickerson”, she told me once on the way home in the snow. “I won’t publish anything, and then when I die they’ll find a mountain of novels and stuff in my basement. It’ll blow their minds.”


She smiled to herself and peeked at the overcast sky under the edge of her red umbrella. The snow drifted around her. “The world won’t know what it had missed.”


Other days she would muse whether to just use a pen name, hiding behind initials. “Like that J.D. guy?” I asked.


She looked at me suspiciously. I had grown tall and my biceps large, more disproportionate than ever with my left leg. I was not exactly the image of a book reader—well, not that I actually did, really.


“Last name starts with S something?” I offered.


Her look remained. Perhaps she didn’t believe I had read a book that she hadn’t.


“Wrote, uh, *Catcher in the Rye*.”


“Oh. Your mom recommended that.”


“Yeah.”


“What about him?”


“He just used his initials when he published. No one knew anything about him. He never gave interviews, nothing. Lived in a shed in the woods or something.”


“If no one knew anything about him, how do they know he was a man?” She looked directly at me.


“Don’t know.” I answered honestly. 


After a pause, “Somebody must’ve known him though.”


She seemed to ponder these words.


“Alright, I’ll do that then,” she said, decisively. “It’s decided. I’ll hide away from everything. No one will know anything about me except my pen name. Then, at the end, when everyone is in love with my work, I’ll reveal that it was me all along.”


   *  *  *


Eventually, her parents decided to move. They ended up being the first of a large group of people from our town who left for the better opportunities in the city. “A better chance for college,” they told people. I watched their white moving truck turn down that familiar dirt road and disappear in the distance.


We would follow a few years later. “Look. What kind of job do you think he’s going to get out here?” I would hear my mom through the walls. “He’s a bright kid. Give him a chance to prove himself out there.” My father came to my door after one of these talks, weary resignation etched into his face, and told me to pack my things.


It was a hard move for all of us. My father had a coveted 9 to 5 trucking job in our old town, one of the few that let him be home for dinner every night. In the city he only came home on weekends, bags under his eyes, and would only sleep before he left again. My mother never found a proper teaching position, instead picking private students where she could. After a fight with his boss, my father found out the only other big trucking company in the city had instituted a hiring freeze for a year. Too proud to go back to ask for his job back, he found a job at the small convenience store nearby, testing his customer service skills.


On the weekends when he worked, I got to see his morning routine. At 7:45, 20 minutes before he left, he would get a beer from the fridge. At 7:55, he would get a second. He would watch the clock as it counted down, only picking himself up the exact minute before he would be late for his shift.


One night he and my mother argued long past midnight. He was sober—my mother threw all the beer in house out the window the night before. I sat on the couch, watching the news.


He came downstairs, fury in his face. He looked at me and my leg, and a wave of hate and resentment rushed into my chest at the words he seemed to be accusing me with. But before either of us could open our mouths, the television blared out a breaking news alert. 


It was a rerun from earlier in the day.


The distraction seemed to calm him. He stared unfocused in the direction of the television for a long time. I watched the muscles in his face clench and unclench. Tense and untense.


He put his hand on my shoulder without looking at me.


“Make something of yourself, boy,” he told me.


   *  *  *


I wondered if I really lived up to those words, nowadays, as I sat in an office filled with people crowing in excitement about the first snow of the year. I had found an office job that paid decently, enough to pay for a car to rest my crutches in, and an empty apartment I couldn’t think of things to fill with. I parked in handicap spaces that were made for people like me, but I wasn’t able to shake off the vague sense of guilt that doing so disqualified me from living up to my father’s hopes for me.


I moved to the window with my coworkers to watch the snow, slightly behind them, and looked over their heads to spot a pedestrian in a dark coat carrying a red umbrella on the street far below.


That night I looked her up online. Her profile showed her with a child in her arms, around four or five I’d guess. There was no sign of any writing or publications or accomplishments on her page. Maybe she did carry out her plan after all?


Out the window, dark snow was falling. I imagined it drifting on a dirt road, her bright umbrella leading the way. Our parents told us to try to get back before dark, but when the sun set at four in the afternoon, it was a hard rule to follow. The snow shimmered in the half light that managed to pass through the clouds, floating in clumps that fell in the surrounding fields. The branches of the trees lining the road were heavy, occasionally letting their white burden crash into the cover below.


If I fell while we were chatting, slipping on some hidden ice, she would help me, picking up my crutches where they fell. But often we would fall silent, having spent the majority of the day together. In the quiet she would get lost in certain phrases, the movement of prose, writing lines madly on her mittens. She would unconsciously pick up the pace—not fast, but one that I could not match. Sometimes I tripped and she did not notice.


I would lie there for a second, wounded from the bite of the cold. In my youth, in those moments I would think to myself that this may well be the story of my life to come: stumbling after dreamers, and watching them slowly leave me behind.",Makeswritngpromptsad

[IP] Knight,Syraphia,"""Why does he look so sad, Mommy?"" The girl's tiny voice echoed in the hall.

""I'd imagine it's because he was, my love."" A tall woman reached out for the girl, a mild gesture to bring the little one to her side. ""Do you see how strong he is, though? Even in his gloom?""

The girl was quiet for a few moments, her head slightly atilt, before she pointed at the painting and asked, ""Is he stronger than his horse, Mommy?""

The tall woman smiled and hugged the girl, who giggled and wriggled in the embrace, as she said, ""Where one would falter, the other would redouble. Those two were like Alexander and Bucephalus, my little Empress. No stronger duo ever lived, or lives, in our time.""

The girl wormed her way out of the embrace and huffed comically as she stamped her foot and crossed her arms, her chin out and her head back as she declared, ""One day there will be a painting of me on this wall, and I will be riding a horse that is twice as strong as that one. And people will ask why I look so happy, because I will be the strongest and bravest and happiest Empress ever.""

The tall woman went to her knees before the little girl, seeing at once the strong features of the melancholy knight and his trusted companion behind the softer, but undeniably related features of his daughter. 

A daughter he had never known.

""I know you will, my love."" The woman felt a familiar burn in her eyes. ""Do you know how I know that?""

""Because I'm already the bravest and strongest and happiest?"" The little girl grinned.

""And more, my love."" The woman grabbed the girl, spun her into her lap as she pointed at the painting, and whispered into her ear as the tears began to escape. ""Because no matter who tries to stop happiness like yours from blossoming in this world, my love, there will always be those strong enough to charge against them. People like him, who would never let injustice go unanswered. And I know you will do the same, my little Empress. Isn't that right?""

""Of course, Mommy!"" The little girl wriggled away again, a giggle on her lips until she saw her mother's tears. ""Are you alright, Mommy?"" 

""Yes, my love. I'm fine."" The woman sniffled as she smiled at the young girl. ""Now go and find Jocaster. You are overdue for your afternoon lessons. Tell him it was Mommy's fault and you won't be in trouble, I promise.""

The girl looked at her mother, consternation on her brow, for a few moments before she said, ""I don't like it when you cry. It makes me want to stop it from ever happening again.""

The woman was silent as she looked at the little girl's face. Now exactly that of the man in the painting. A determined gloom, framed by a fiery determination. 

""I know you would if you could, my love. Go, now. Jocaster is waiting."" The woman gently clasped her daughter's hand before she gestured her away. 

The girl ran, hesitantly at first, but she quickly shifted into a wistful near-skip as she rounded the corner at the farthest end of the hall. The woman watched until the girl was out of sight, then lowered herself to the ground.

She wept.

Quietly, at first, but with a gradual increase in intensity that found her listening to her own sobs as they echoed back at her from the empty hall. They were cold, hollow sobs. Things that wracked the body without a cure, for they were born of death and despair.

She did not know how long she lay there, but the time came where her body was too tired to continue. It was then that she sat up, wiped her face on the sleeve of her gown, and stared into the morose eyes of her lost love.

""How I wish you could have known her, my dear."" Her voice was hoarse. ""How much you could have taught her. How much better she would be with you.""

The words whispered back at her in the hall. Hollow echoes of her own pain.

""My gallant Galabrous."" The woman clutched at her chest and willed the ache of emptiness to be filled, but it refused.

She wept.

How long passed before she stopped is impossible to say, for the Hallowed Hall had become almost entirely deserted in the years since Emperor Galabrous's death. The palace staff knew the Empress to always end up in Hall, in one form or another, before the final visage of her husband. Eventually staff would come through, almost inevitably after dark, to gather the Empress and deposit her in the Royal Chambers.

The Empire was run by the regents and bureaucrats. Though the royal lineage carried on through the late Emperor's only daughter, all knew that the 'little Empress' was in dire need of grooming if she were to take the reins of state once she was of age. And so she was tutored in all things mundane of state and the world, taught all manner of ways the world works. 

If; always haunting her mother's dreams.

If; always tinging the days of the loyal with suspicion and tension.

If; always feeding those ambitious and power hungry among the elite.

If; never more than a passing thought for Galabra as she carried on being 'the little Empress.'",the_divine_broochs

"[WP] ""Welcome, all of you, to the last day of your job search"", says the interviewer as she walks in. ""By the end of today one of you will be hired, and the rest of you will be dead.""",emcee117,"""All of you?"" I said, unable to focus with my back pain. ""You mean there are other people besides me in this room?""

""Well, yes. I thought you'd have seen them.""

""Hang on, I need to get my glasses."" I pulled my glasses out of my shirt pocket with my wrinkly, shaky hands and slowly put them on and looked around. Everyone in this room was at least as old as I was, maybe even older. ""Oh, yes. I see. Sorry about that, then.""

""Right. Let's get started, then,"" said the interviewer, a beautiful young lady in her 20s. ""As you are all aware, every one of you is here for the same reason. Before I begin questioning you, I would like you all to take a look at this video to get a greater understanding of our company's values and what we are seeking in our candidates.""

The projector screen was lowered (it was one of those newfangled motorized ones) and a video was projected onto it. It started with an empty room for a few seconds, before suddenly a man popped out from underneath cheerfully shouting ""Hello everyone!"" This was quite startling, and half the people in the room died from a heart attack. The video continued on, interspersed with loud, startling moments, such as this, and each time, a few more people died from a heart attack.

By the time the video was over, there were only a handful of us left. ""Now, then,"" said the interviewer, ""does anyone have any questions about the video?""

One woman raised her hand. 

""Yes, Edith?"" said the interviewer. 

""I'm sorry, I can't remember what I was about to say,"" said Edith.

""Fair enough, then,"" said the interviewer.

She then proceeded to ask us standard interview questions. Several of the people around me died in the meantime. One man got bored and started walking out of the room, but stumbled, fell, hit his head, and died. He had forgotten to take his walker with him.

In the end, the only people left were me and one other man. ""And so we are now left with two people,"" said the interviewer. ""Unfortunately, as I told you in the beginning, I'm afraid we can only hire one of you. And Eustace,"" she said to me, ""I'm afraid your performance was not as satisfactory as that of Gerald here.""

Suddenly, with a swift motion, she pulled a knife from her pocket and stabbed me in the chest. Gerald was horrified by what he saw and died from a heart attack as a result. The interviewer's knife missed any vital organs, but it was very painful.

""Congratulations, Eustace,"" she said, ""you are hired. Welcome to our company. Your hospital treatment will be covered by our medical benefits. But you are to tell no one of what you just witnessed here, do you understand?""",someguy7734206

""By the end of today one of you will be hired, and the rest of you will be dead.""",emcee117,"I had spent ten years to get my two PhDs. It had been my dream to test out the theory of using nanobots to manipulate the DNA in embryos of human beings. Even though it was unethical it had to be done, so of course the operation was handed to the CIA to keep it secret.

The van had seemly pulled into a parking spot and my escorting security officer who was sitting next to me stated that were there and told me to remain seated. He unbuckled his seat belt and then took off the blindfold I had been wearing. The windowless van was then reviled to me.

A colonel that was wearing an unmarked tan uniform had opened the door and welcomed me to what he called the garden of Eden while maintaining the biggest grin. Outside the van was a small building that looked like a double wide mobile home. That was it. I could only see the sky and about 2,500 square feet of desert ground. There was a solid fence that was about 25 feet high that enclosed the little area.

I was escorted to the door but the security officer stopped and closed the door behind me. There was a table with six chairs and a tv mounted high in one of the corners of the room. Five of chairs had been occupied by other scientists.

After I sat down the tv turned on. The tv displayed just a black background but there was a voice speaking. It stated that they have been testing editing DNA in pregnant women for a while and that they are seeking an individual to take the experimenting to the next level. There was a long pause. Then the voice started again and explained the interview process.

I looked around at the other people and only saw confusion. I was thinking that I am at least ten years younger and way more physically able. So, it just clicked. I picked up my chair and started hitting these guys over and over again.

"[WP] ""Welcome, all of you, to the last day of your job search"", says the interviewer as she walks in. ""By the end of today one of you will be hired, and the rest of you will be dead.""",emcee117,"Dawn raced towards the thicket of trees ahead. Her heart pounded, making her pulse thud inside her ears. She didn't slow her speed as she reached the edge of the copse. She couldn't. Not until she was far enough in that the trees would hide her bright clothing from someone scanning the landscape. Once she reached what she assumed to be the center of the woody patch, or at least central enough to hide her clothes, she collapsed against a tree and slid to the ground. 

She was so sick of running, even knowing this was the last day. Four interviews already and never even a finalist. If she didn't make the cut this time, she was dead. How long *had* she been running now? The expansion reached the U.S. back in December and her town around the middle of January. The scribbles she'd made on the back of her outdated calendar stopped around June when keeping track no longer mattered--why track what you could no longer predict? The leaves were turning color here so it must have been sometime in September or October. ""You did always want to see Fall leaves"" she muttered to herself with a rueful smile. 

SNAP.

Dawn tried to jump to her feet, but the movement was too fast and she ended up catching her fall with already scabbed hands and a loud grunt. She hadn't even looked up more than a couple feet when she startled out a whimper. Not right, too many joints. The stupid thing had tried to put on clothes and walk upright, but it couldn't hide 3 knees and its staggering gait. A Herald, it had to be. *No way, the border isn't that close yet. Doesn't matter, get out of here. Get to the interview*. Heralds were unpredictable. When the border hit, living things fused. Rarely one nervous system took over, but usually they were an amalgam, so their behaviors were chaotic. The least dangerous were Herald's primarily made of plant, but this one had to be at least 75% animal to have moved this far from the border. It might ignore her one second and decide she was dinner the next. Or apparently, it might just take her clothes. 


Dawn slowly stood up, watching as the Herald fell back to a quadrupedal stance. The pants ripped as one of the joints in the back leg snapped and broke through. Bile burned the back of her throat. A talon on one of the front legs ripped at the pants until they were shredded enough for the Herald to move freely. As she started to back away, she saw the thing shift its weight so it was bipedal again, but this time standing on the single jointed front legs. From the broken jointed leg that now functioned as an arm, the pants waved around like a war banner made by a child playing knights with friends. It turned slightly to the side and a cluster of six eyes near one of the bottom legs focused on her. The Herald shot at her and she turned to run. As she sped off, she heard a crash and a burst of cracking and popping behind her. *Don't look back, go, go, go.*


The trees gave way and she burst into a field that lie fallow. She looked up and by the location of the sun guessed the time to be around 3:30. One more hour before the interview started. The base should only be a half mile away now, so if she could make it through this field and around the bend in the road up ahead without getting spotted by looters, she would be home free. Dawn ran as fast as she could until she reached the bend in the road and saw a fence. ""That's it! I'm going to make it!""


As she neared the gate she started to slow and finally stopped near a call box. She held down the button ""Hi, I'm hear for the interview."" 


A short paused followed until finally a deep voice came back. ""Cutting it kinda close there."" But, a buzz followed and the gate opened, so she must not have cut it *too * close. She started towards the building ahead. No need to run now, she was protected here. Once Dawn reached the building, she pressed the button next to the door and waited for it to open. A frazzled young man greeted her. 

“Come with me, they’re starting the process, now. The expansion has started moving at its fastest rate yet and we need to get out of here. Honestly, I’m surprised that they’re still filling this position. The colony ship has plenty of people at this point.” He was talking so fast that Dawn could barely keep up. Finally, she interrupted the man.

“You’re tellin’ me it is moving fast. I saw a Herald on my way in!”

The man’s eyes widened and he gaped at Dawn “Wow, bad luck. Glad you at least made it this far.” They reached a room where several other people stood around “Here we are, good luck. Maybe I’ll see you aboard.”

Once the door closed behind her guide, a woman stepped through a door on the opposite side of the room.
“Hi everyone, I’m Dr. Vand. Welcome to the headquarters of the Rosie Franklin Colony Ship. We are proud of the crew we’ve put together here and hope to add one more member before we take off.” She looked around the room and smiled sadly 
“I guess I can congratulate you all on the last day of your job search. By the end of the day, one of you will be hired aboard our ship and the rest of you will be dead.”

A man sitting next to Dawn looked over at her and at her shrug, finally cleared his throat and said loudly “What do you mean, the rest will be dead?”

The woman furrowed her brow and looked down “The expansion is moving at an unprecedented rate. We will take off within the next few hours, and likely by the time we reach the outer atmosphere, the border will have reached this point. There is nowhere else to go now, the border is closing in and the expansion will envelope the Earth by the end of the day. This station is expected to be where the borders will meet”

Chatter in the room started to rise and Dawn could feel people starting to panic.
   
“I’m sorry everyone, but I need you to take a seat in one of these chairs. Anyone who does not comply will be removed. We don’t have time to delay—I know this is shocking, but we must begin. Now then, our ship is focused on genetic diversity, so we’ll be taking a blood sample and running a quick test. Our database will determine which of you has the best chance of high fertility and adds new alleles to our gene pool.”

Dawn turned to the man next to her “well, at least I won’t get turned down for my crappy math skills this time.” He smiled without really meaning it and walked to a chair. She followed his lead and sat in the closest empty chair. Several people outfitted in rubber gloves and lab coats walked in through the door and started taking blood from those already in place. A young man walked up to her and pulled out needle with a vial attached

“You’ll feel a little prick, nothing worse than a bee sting. Ready?” She nodded and he stuck her arm. As promised, the pain was only slight and he was done in moments. “Okay then, good luck.”

She laid back in the chair and waited. After what seemed like a lifetime, but was probably closer to ten minutes, one of the people in lab coats walked back through the door. 

“Dr. Vand, I have the results.” Dr. Vand took the proffered slip of paper and looked at it, and then up at the man Dawn had been sitting next to earlier. “Chair 6, come with me. Everyone else, I’m sorry, but you need to leave. Best of luck. We do have lethal injections available if you prefer not to meet the border. Just head to--”

Dawn didn’t wait to hear the rest. She wasn’t going to kill herself. If she couldn’t be on this ship, she would at least try to survive. No one really knew what would happen when the expansion closed in on itself. Maybe the borders would stop moving. She burst through the entry doors and found a picnic table in the courtyard where she first entered. Dr. Vand has said that the border was expected by the end of the day. She’d just sit here and wait for it, then. Dawn closed her eyes and laid her head on the table. She dozed on and off, dimly aware of the sound of a rocket taking off in the distance and other noises she could only assume were Heralds. A loud crack eventually woke her. She opened her eyes to darkness and heavy winds—the winds indicated the border was closing in. She’d heard that they felt like an approaching hurricane, but didn’t quite believe it until now. She started to feel like she was breaking into pieces. Her nerves screamed. Her body shredded. Her awareness dimmed and the pain faded away. 

~~

Dawn tried to open her eyes, but couldn’t find them. One of her arms moved instead. At least, she thought it was her arm, but why did it feel like her eye? She was moving forward and could feel grass dragging along her mouth. Why was her mouth on the ground? Was that her mouth? How was it walking? Light suddenly blinded her. Once her eyes adjusted she immediately became aware of something small scurrying along the ground. Dawn lost control of her body.

"[WP] ""Welcome, all of you, to the last day of your job search"", says the interviewer as she walks in. ""By the end of today one of you will be hired, and the rest of you will be dead.""",emcee117,"Nervously, I glanced around the room to see if anyone else was sweating as hard as I was.  I noticed that all ten of the other applicants were also sweating profusely before I remember that the room we were sitting in had a very large fireplace in one corner.  I swallowed, hoping that the sound of it wasn't as loud as it had been for me, and tried to arrange my features as stoically as possible.  

""Now,"" said the interviewer, ""Before we begin, I hope that you all realize that, for whichever of you is hired, this position is permanent.  Once you are sworn in, your very life force will be tied to the Gate, meaning that to escape or to leave your position will mean your death.""  I nodded along with the rest of them, knowing that this was my last chance to do something significant with my life.  While furious with me, my parents hadn't punished me too hard after I dropped out of mage school, and they even supported me all through both my time as an accountant and my failed stint as an actor; but they all but disowned me when I tried out at the gladiator pits, and literally disowned me when I got into the thievery business.  Now, for an out-of-luck mediocre magus/accountant/actor with some barely cultivated fighting skills and many a Guild bounty on my head, becoming a Guardian was the only way I could really and truly practice my one true talent: staying alive.  I carefully weighed my almost nonexistent options; as a Guardian, I would spend the rest of my almost eternally prolonged life guarding the Gate to ensure that the Devourer remained locked within.  If I left, I would die.  If it somehow managed to escape, I would almost certainly die, along with just about everything in the world.  The only way I would be able to remain alive should that occur would be to push it back within the Gate and re-seal it, or else somehow manage to kill it, something which 100 of the greatest mages and warriors in the history of existence had failed to do the first time it came.  Piece of cake!  Probably...

The interviewer continued.  ""For this, your only challenge, you will all be put in an enclosed space with the only creature ever found in nature to come anywhere close to displaying power of the likes of the Devourer, and it has barely a fraction of it.  This challenge will not be a test of skill, strength, talent, or even raw magical prowess; rather, it will measure how badly each of you wants to live.""  

As if confirming my earlier thoughts, she locked her gaze on me.
""And believe you me, the kind of people who make the best Guardians are the kind of rat bastards who cling desperately to every drop of life they can, and who are crazy enough to risk their lives to keep them.  Now, each of you will be given a standard set of Guardian armour and weaponry.  The challenge starts in 5 minutes.  Get out there,  good luck, and I will be seeing one of you on the other side shortly.""  Her gaze intensified as she said this last part, and then she promptly left the room, leaving us to our own thoughts.

I swallowed once more, and as I strapped on my armour and checked my weapons, I could only think a single thought: how much did I value my own life?",ATP-au-Andromedus2

He had been searching for a job for months and found all the job positions filled just prior to him arriving. When he saw the flyer for an undisclosed position in a new start-up company funded by Mark Zuckerberg, he leapt at the chance. Now, he began to have second thoughts about signing the contract they had provided him, especially after seeing the manic grin on the interviewers face.  

""Each of you will be given an opportunity to prove yourselves before the executive committee"", the interview lady gesturing behind her at a raised panel behind a tinted wall of glass. Beyond, five vague humanoid shapes could be seen. Looking to Gavin's left and right and around the room, men and woman also clutching the flyer stood at attention.  

""Your purpose will be testing some of our new products. You are to survive the battle royal using any means necessary."" At this Gavin looked rapidly back at the interview lady, who had begun to walk back through the doorway she just came through.

Even as the world around me faded I could still see him clear as day. Jaw clenched, eyes crazed and nose broken to shit and back. At least he'll have that to remember me by.

I wanted to resist further, to kick and scream and bite and do everything in my power to stop him. To win. But I wasn't going to. So instead I focused on the cold rain as it rolled down my face. 

In an instant, that cold was replaced with a disturbing warmth as his throat exploded outwards in a shower of hot red blood and the grip around my throat loosened. And there she was, towering over us, one hand gripping the blade lodged in his throat and the other hanging limply by her side. 

She was like an angel, risen from the dead to be with me again. Kicking him off of me, she stretched out an arm to help me up. I was in love. 

""Thank you, I,"" I wheezed, massaging my throat, ""Thought you were dead,"" 

She smiled at me and I melted, ""Some things are worth living for,""

As she leaned in to kiss me I suddenly felt a sharp pain in my stomach, pushing myself away and reaching behind my back. Moving swiftly I whipped out the handgun and caused her face to explode into a bloody pulp. 

""Not today, bitch,"" I mumbled as I cursed the knife now lodged in my abdomen.

""And this will be your workstation from here out, any further questions?"" 

""No, thank you, ma'am I am ready to get started,"" I answered enthusiastically, 

""Fantastic,"" She answered with a fake smile, ""You report to Sharon down the hall over there, and if you have any questions feel free to ask me, okay?""

I nodded and she left, allowing me to slump down behind my workstation. It was so organized, the computer, folders and even the walls themselves all looked like they came right off the assembly line. 

I sighed a sigh of relief as I tended to the bandages around my stomach. Sometimes I wondered if it was worth all the trouble, but being here now, sitting in my own cubicle with a water cooler not but ten feet away from me all I could think was: Totally worth it.

"[WP] ""Welcome, all of you, to the last day of your job search"", says the interviewer as she walks in. ""By the end of today one of you will be hired, and the rest of you will be dead.""",emcee117,"There was 20 other people in the room and I could feel all of their eyes sizing me up as their competition.  I didn't bother to look around the room to compare myself to the others in the room; I didn't have to, I already knew who was going to get the job.

I have trained my entire life for this moment and no one will take it away from me.  I stared at the interviewer with out a hint of emotion on my face as I await my name to be called.  No one spoke as we were clearly informed that there shall be no talking unless we wanted to be disqualified or for lack of a better term, disposed of.  

The interviewer was a woman in her early twenties, dark curly hair that fell to the middle of her back, grey tight pencil skirt, white blouse, and black high heeled shoes that clicked when she walked.  The only thing missing was a pair of blacked framed glasses, and she would have been the woman in my dreams.  I tried my best to fight the urge to allow myself to slip into passionate daydreams about her and stay focused on the task at hand.  

Every time the interviewer came into the waiting room she would call an interviewee by the number we were given when we came in the room.  She would then walk them through the frosted glass doors and then return with them after about 10 minutes.  Every interviewee had the same pale desperate look on their face as a child did when the teacher randomly calls them to the front of the class to write the answer on the chalk board when they had no idea how to do it.  I am fairly certain #6 is about to throw up all over himself, and by the looks on the faces of those who have already gone; he may not be the only one today to lose their lunch.  

The anticipation was coming to it's height when I heard my number called.  My number was 13, and I was instructed to only answer to my number and refer to myself as my number.  I stood up and said ""Number 13 present ma'am"".  ""Follow me"" the interviewer replied and promptly pivoted on the toes of her shoe and headed towards the frosted glass doors.  I could feel the bile in my stomach approaching my esophagus as I followed closely behind the interviewer.  

As we walked through the doors I realized we were only in a hallway leading to another set of doors that appeared to be thick solid metal doors that you would expect to find on a large bank safe.  As we approached the door, the interviewer put her hand on a seemingly empty area of the wall and the door opened using a set of hydraulics.  

As we walked through the large heavy doors we came into a large white room.  The floors, ceiling, and walls were all white except two black chairs with a small black framed glass table between them.  The interviewer gestured for me to sit as she was approaching her chair.  

The interviewer was looking over my paperwork filled with my school records, employment records, and skill sets.  She acted as if I was not even in the room and paid no attention to me at all.  I sat as straight as an arrow and tried to find any hidden cameras in the room without moving my head.  I didn't find any cameras, false mirrors, or anything that would imply we were being watched or monitored.  The lack of sound in the rooming was oddly deafening and only made me sweat that much more.  

I was on the brink of panic when the interviewer looked up from my paperwork and said ""Why are you here?"".  I was completely caught off guard at the abruptness of the question that I slightly hesitated and noticed an immediate look of disapproval on the interviewers face.  I took a deep breath to center myself and said ""I have a primal need to always be the best and most efficient at what I do.  I have always dreamed to work for the government and want the opportunity to show that I have what it takes to rid this country of all of it's enemies."".  

""Wait in the hallway just outside these doors"" the interviewer said.  I stood at attention in the blank nondescript hallway for what seemed to be 5 minutes.  The interviewer appeared through the heavy doors and told me to follow her to the waiting room.  

When we got through the frosted glass doors, the waiting room was empty.  The interviewer instructed me to take a seat and to keep my number.  As I waited people started flooding into the waiting room holding their numbers, but they were a different group of people than before.  At least I think they were as I didn't catalog the faces in the room before I went into the interview.  There were more women this time though, and everyone had a unique number.  

""Welcome, all of you, to the last day of your job search"", says the interviewer as she walks in. ""By the end of today one of you will be hired, and the rest of you will be dead."".

I can feel the bile coming up from my stomach again as I turn pale with the realization that number 6 was already in the room the first time I came into waiting room.  I start to panic internally when I realize that was only my first round of questioning.

Ms. Anzen took her glasses off and rubbed her eyes.  ""Not this again.  Didn't we talk about this?""

Anzen sighed.  ""What about the rest of the applicants?""

""Obviously,"" I pointed out, ""they are not self-starters.  Or any kind of starters, now.  I put them in the incinerator, like we do with the government inspectors.""

""Do you even understand what your job is here?""  Anzen asked.

""Of course,"" I said.  ""I'm hiring people.  I'm trying to get the best, and that requires out of the box thinking.""

There was a distant explosion.

""See?""  I said.

Anzen just looked at me.

""So I'll be going?""  I said.

""What was that explosion?""  Anzen asked.

I shrugged.  ""How would I know?  You know how things are around here, constant explosions or lava leakages or government inspectors escaping from improvised prison cells you made out of interview rooms.""

""I thought you had them incinerated?"" Anzen demanded.

""Incinerator's down,"" I said.

""How can a lava-based incinerator be-""  She was interrupted when gas started flowing under the door.  ""Did you happen to put them in the room with the previous batch of interviewees?"" Anzen asked as she put on her gas mask.

""Space is at a premium,"" I coughed.

There weren't any spare gas masks.  Oh well, I thought, at least I wouldn't have to deal with what Severance was like around here.",reostra

It was that moment that I realized a gladiator internship possibly wasn't the smartest job to apply for. Particularly, because I learned to be an accountant. People always told me that I was able to bore others to death talking about my field of expertise. At this very moment I just hoped that there was some truth to it. A little part of me was happy though, after sending 273 applications for an internship I finally got an interview!


Suddenly the tall guy next to me spat right in front of my feet. Actually, it might have hit if hadn't pulled my foot. My mind was fast, so were my reflexes. Also, I paid a shittown for those leather shoes, God knows I wouldn't allow a pile of muscles in loincloth to ruin those. They were a perfect fit to my black suit and red tie. I adjusted my glasses, don't ask me why - but it kind of helped me listening to the interviewer going on and on about honor. I was an accountant - what did I need honor for? I just needed the internship for my CV... ""...and so - move forward into the preparation room."", she finished. Suddenly the room  or rather the masses of barely dressed muscle men (there was a serious lack of sexual diversity going on here) began to move, all trying to grab their favorite weapons.


There were two things I knew: 1.) They'ld use animals to decimate us, possibly lions or bears  and 2.) Nobody here took me seriously. Okay, maybe I knew three things - none of these guys would find it particularly honorable to kill me. Number 3.) might actually have been the most useful information. Even though being dead would have had its perks: The job search was a true drag.
So, what weapon would I pick? Not that I had many choices left, most weapon racks were emptier than a grain silo in Africa.
So I decided to stay low-key and grabbed a net and a small dagger.


The bell rang. We were pushed into the arena... A bunch of tall muscular men - and me. The gate closed behind us. I looked around: it was a huge stadium with no chance to escape. It was hot, loud and the seat rows were filled with hundreds of people shouting at each other... It felt just like the lectures during my bachelor's studies.


So I did what I did best. I searched for a quiet corner in the shadows, opened my attache case which I still had with me, sat down and went over some bills. I still hadn't finished my tax returns.


Meanwhile the fleshpiles of men who shared the arena with me started grunting and bashing each other's heads in - or alternatively: pricking each other with points sticks, spears and swords. It was annoying, but still less loud and more civilized than Walmart on Black Friday. It also smelled better if I may say so, even after they let the lion in (actually it was a lioness. Maybe they *did* pay attention to sexual diversity).


Only two men were left standing (as I mentioned earlier: I was sitting)... and the lioness. Though the latter wasn't actually standing, she was pouncing - straight towards those two unfortunate souls in the middle of the arena, both bloody with scratches. I guess *for her* they smelled good. The first guy went down before his axes had fully swung. The lioness ripped his throat apart. It was a mess. No need to be more graphic.


The second guy started running towards me. I guess he had figured that honor wouldn't really help him to get this internship if he was dead. Also: *she* might be less hungry if she ate poor old me first.


I stood up, carefully trying not to disorder my tax return sheets. I still had the net lying next to me. Which was not really impressive considering that the guy running towards me was around two heads taller and had broadsword larger than my torso. I guess he expected me to throw my net at him - he was ready to rip it apart with his sword. Maybe he wasn't as stupid as I thought - or me be was. Actually, yes he was. He landed in the the dirt head first. The cracking of his nose sounded a little bit distasteful. I had kicked my attache case into his way, just right to caress his shinbones. His painful outcry drew the attention of the lioness who was not yet finished with her meal. Apparently we both shared an important trait - we both disliked being interrupted during dinner. She started running again, ready for desert. My human opponent slowly tried to stand up, holding his bloody nose, cursing. It took a second for him to realize that the lioness had started moving again, once he *did* hear the sound of her paws hitting the ground he turned around in fear.... The lioness arrived just in time to find her food tightly wrapped in a net. Turning towards the lioness maybe wasn't that wrong, but ignoring me hadn't been smart either as I had the perfect angle to wrap the net around him... The next part was yet again, well - very graphic. Let's just say that the net, while great at entangling people, didn't really stop the lioness from enjoying her dinner.


I hope you read my internship report carefully so far. You do remember the part where I told you people accused me of being able to bore others to death while talking about my passion (accounting)? 
Well, it was vastly exaggerated, obviously. I have always considered it more soothing than harmful - and I was glad to see the lioness agree. While she was nibbling on a few tasty human rips I went on about the disadvantages of Schmalenbach's finance statement theory and the organic financial statement concept as proposed by Schmidt.... 


...as soon as I reached the capital-theoretic financial statement approach by Lindahl the lioness in front of me was sound asleep (again - just like university lectures).


A few moments later the wildly confused interviewer arrived. ""I guess you got the job"" she said, baffled by what she just had witnessed.


For the sake of the entertainment I wasn't put into the pit again. While unique, my presentation wasn't exactly what most viewers would consider exciting. To be honest, I was glad about it. The blood splatters had already ruined one pair of expensive leather boots and a free internship didn't exactly pay for a second one.
Ultimately I ended up in accounting. It was a nice corner office with a great view over the arena (or at least it would have had one if the shutters weren't shut tighter than a nun's legs). There was a guy sitting behind a large wooden desk, bent over the stacks of papers. He introduced himself as Tedd without looking up. When I approached his desk he noticed the blood on my boots. ""I see, so you did meet Emilia? Great investment. She reduced our waste by twenty percent. Now go get me some coffee.""",sdric

[WP] You are sitting at a local coffee shop minding your own business when you are approached by a stranger. He introduces himself as the Devil and says that he is retiring and would like you to take his job.,johnfor1,"God I hate coffee. The horrible bitter taste that lingers far too long on your tongue, a flavour you need to drown in milk and sugar to make it at all drinkable. So it truly was a wonder that I found myself sat in a coffee shop, sourly sipping on my hated beverage.

It was my damned neighbour's fault, well mostly. He'd been blaring his crappy music all night, I hadn't managed to catch the faintest wick of sleep. So when I'd been inevitably late for my bus I'd had to try to run into town to get to my interview in time. Needless to say that didn't happen. So here I am, waiting for the bus back while trying to wake myself up a bit. Perhaps this was also my way of punishing myself for yet another day of joblessness.

Sitting back in my chair with a groan, I glanced about the cafe I found myself in. Dust covered red chairs littered the shop floor with no sense of cohesion, rusting old metal tables were distributed almost randomly among them and sickly yellow wall paper barely remained stuck to the walls. Not for the first time I questioned my decision to come here but- well the coffees cheap. Though it seemed the rest of the towns populace was wiser than myself, it was completely empty. Even the faceless shopkeeper had buggered off after lazily preparing my drink. Happy to be alone i shut my eyes as I placed the mug on the table.

A light jingling of bells pulled me back awake as my eyes darted to the door. An elderly gentleman in an impeccably well pressed suit walked in, his polished shoes barely touching the ground as he glided gracefully through the store. The black hair showing from under his hat was streaked with grey, the few wrinkles on his face lent an air of sternness and he sported a neat pointed goatee with a neatly clipped mustache.

Despite the doors bell wringing as he walked in the owner showed no signs of appearing. Nor did the man wait for him, instead heading straight towards my table. This was rather unexpected. I didn't have anyone after me for money, not yet at least. Not that he even looked the type for a loan shark. He had a somehow even more sinister vibe.

As I eyed him cautiously he called out in a smooth, deep voice. ""Hello Sam, thank you for coming.""

Him knowing my name was certainly not a good sign. I sat up in my seat while looking suspiciously around. ""What do you mean 'thank you for coming'?"" I asked after finding no one else around, but no back exit to make a dash for.

""Haha, please relax. There's no way I'd harm you, not after I went through all this trouble to set this job interview up. That Alan chap was quite difficult."" The man said with a stilted laugh.

""Job interview? What job?"" I asked, keeping my voice steady. This was a hell of a way to advertise a vacancy. And what did he mean trouble to set it up? Those thoughts fell to the back of my mind as I focused on this strange man.

""I know what you're thinking, but it's quite an unusual job. Such a job needs an unusual interview wouldn't you agree?"" He flashed a smile through impossibly white teeth. ""Though you've no need to appeal to me here, I've long decided you're suited for the job. I'm here to sell my job to you.""

I get it, he was some mad man. Thinking about it rationally, the owner hadn't turned up probably because this guy regularly came in to harass customers. It does seem like a problem that a dump like this would ignore. Shame I wouldn't be getting a job though, I was slightly getting my hopes up.

""You didn't answer the question,"" I said, easing my posture. This, a lonely old crazy man, I can deal with. ""What job.""

Though as the old man flashed another one of his perfect white smiles, I couldn't quite shake off the feeling of unease.

""Let's just get right into it then. You could think of it as a kind of sales job. Though you won't be taking money, and you won't be selling them physical goods."" He told me, speaking so eloquently that I almost doubted he was insane. But then, a selling people something without taking money? Did he want to start a little charity?

Smirking to myself I sat back in my chair a little more. ""What do you mean?"" I asked, enjoying myself slightly for the first time today.

""Of course you wouldn't be working for free, it's quite the well paying job."" He said, smiling again as he saw me relax. ""However it'll be quite difficult to make a sale. After all, you'll be selling hope.""

""Hope?"" I asked, a little bewildered. This was going somewhere new.

""Of course, doesn't everyone deserve a little hope?"" He replied. ""It's not an easy job, but it's incredibly... Rewarding...""

With that he placed a stack of dollar bills upon the table. Jolting up in my chair a bit, a swallowed back down my surprise. If they were all hundreds, then there must have been a few thousand bucks on display. I'll have to revise my opinion. An incredibly rich old mad man.

""Well, how about it? Would you like a job?"" He asked, holding out his hand towards me.

I stared at it for a second, this would probably solve all my current problems. I could pay off my rent for- well weeks at least! I wouldn't have to worry about food, this could easily keep me on my feet till I finally get a job! And all for playing along with some old nutter. Not thinking a second more a grabbed his hand. It was stone cold

As we shook on this odd deal I turned to the man, ready to ask about getting paid. I could finally take it easy. Just a few rounds of doing some charity and I could even move apartment, away from my blasted neighbour Alan. Alan... Wait, why had I forgotten about that? Why did I become so relaxed? How did he know my neighbour's name? *How did he know my name?*

""Have you ever heard the story about Pandora's box?"" The old man asked, his voice sounding slightly deeper. Slightly less smooth.

""Of course I've heard of-"" Wait no, stop. Don't get distracted. What was I doing listening to this mad-

""Haven't you ever found it odd? The last thing left in the box, was hope."" He said, speaking deeper and deeper. ""A box with all the evils in the world, and hope was at the bottom?""

I groggily try to locate the man, my head suddenly heavy. It seemed like he'd gotten far away, but neither of us had moved.

""I had a look in that box, a long time ago. And I found hope."" He said, his voice grating into my ears. ""And you know what. Other people *wanted* it! They would pay anything for it! *Anything!*""

I finally managed to turn my eyes to him, stood alone before me. He was taller now, his suit burning off to reveal a red skin. Horns grew out from his hat.

""That's the thing about hope."" He laughed, his voice booming now, enveloping the room around me. ""It's addictive, and insidious. It warps one's mind and makes one helpless. Just like you.""

There was no room now, no table, no god damn coffee. Just me. And him.

""And now you can help me sell it! You told you *exactly* what you'd be doing and you *agreed*!"" He roared, laughing in earth shaking breaths. ""Hope belonged at the bottom of that box. Hope without salvation, well that's the greatest evil of all!""

You’ve got the loyal customers, the one-time patron who just cashes in a cheque which makes up one month’s worth of salary, the nightmare ones who want perfection in every little detail and send your work back to you multiple times, and the handful of oddballs who request eclectic art but cash in almost immediately after you finish their product. 

But it was my first time painting a vampire.

Vampires used to be part of our world once upon a time. But as humans hunted, killed and became more civilised (ironic, I know), their genetic pool died out rapidly. Now they were about as rare as Siberian Tigers. 

When the email came in, I was doubtful that I would come face-to-face with an actual vampire. People nowadays, you can’t take them at their word. But when she walked into my studio, I knew she was the real deal. 

She had on a dark veil which partially shielded her face. Her skin was not particularly pale-- a myth perpetuated by the ignorant masses, because vampires do use products to make themselves have darker-coloured skin to blend in. The thing that gave her away, though, was definitely the way she walked in-- she didn’t. She had on kitten heels but they made no sound at all on the porcelain tiles.

“You may begin.” her voice came out smooth as velvet, deeper than a conventional female’s but incredibly soothing and hypnotic.

She pulled back the veil, brushing away the strands of hair which curled up against her cheek. 

I felt my grip loosen and my paintbrush fall to the ground. 

She looked exactly like me.

"[WP] Humans finally make contact with an alien species on a distant planet. However, like us, they are not a space faring race. We can only communicate through radio signals. And so it begins, the War of the Words.",simmocar,"We were the first.  Many followed.

A thousand worlds, scattered across the swirling void of the stars.  All populated, all curious, and all, for most of their history, alone.  

But then came the signals.  At first, quiet, distorted.  A whispering melody of intertwined voices and songs and speeches and plays, cast out into space as if it were nothing more than mere detritus.  We set our most intelligent on deciphering it, as best they could, and, in time, we grew to know the voices well.  

There was little rhymn or reason to it all, no grand meaning or purposeful guidance, but we appreciated the gift all the more for it.  To know that, somewhere out in the sky, someone was feeling the same joys and despairs and hopes and desires?  This was a blessing without equal.  Farmers, students, prisoners, and presidents: we all tuned in, glad to know that, at the very least, we were not alone.

In time, other voices joined the fray.  The collective song of billions filled the stars, crescendoing ever louder as more voices joined.  We learned their names: opzo, intor, nasdet.  All unique, and yet, at once, all the same.  All ablaze with wonderment at the first voices, at the strange yet familiar beings who called themselves man.  

As the years went on, voices joined together, discovering their neighbors in the stars. They sang each other songs in the tongues of man, knowing that all would understand the languages of the first voice.  Races harmonized in unison as, one by one, they became aware of each others' presences.  

And yet, through it all, the first voice never responded.  Its distant call remained as it was: far off, unreachable.  It formed the undertone of our symphony, and yet, at the same time, it seemed not to be aware of its role.  A sad, lilting call out into the void, begging for companionship, yet too far off to hear the reply.  

And now, as you know, the first voice has stopped.  For centuries, it has been with us, the bass resounding beneath our harmony.  Without it, this would not have been possible; this unity among the stars, this accord among singers.  This day, we gather to memorialize its end, and to mourn its tragedy.  To have always been alone, to fade without friends or companions; this was the fate of man, who brought together us all without ever knowing it, who languished in darkness so that we could see light.  

Were this a memorial for one of my own, I would end this with a song of remembrance, as is the tradition of my people.  But let us remember;  we have already heard the song of man, in its entirety.  Every struggle, every triumph; a three century ballad of laughter and love and sorrow and loss, distributed to the void for all to hear.  When we first heard it, we searched for meaning, a message, never considering that, sometimes, we do not need a motive or a goal.  Sometimes, it is enough just to be, to have seen the wonder of the universe, and to spread that wonder to the skies.  

So, today, I urge not sorrow, but joy.  Live as the voice of man did; experience the pains and pleasures of life, not as a trial to be weathered, but as a symphony to be heard.  Spread the voice of companionship and light, even in the face of darkness.  This, and only this, honors the legacy of the first voice.

Sleep well, mankind; your song is remembered.

Yet every time, every time I got close he cut me short by just a few words. I'd been working this guy for quite some time. By demon standards I was barely done with my internship, but by human years I'd been working him since I was practically a child. Luckily my introduction went without hiccups, and somehow the public seemed to forget that he'd never actually given birth to his 'first daughter'. She, and by She I mean I, just sort of appeared. Nobody ever even asked if I was adopted, I guess my prep work had been solid and I just looked the part...

Solid prep work or not, everything from there on out had went just about as bad as it could. And my time was running out, I had moved in the shadows, pulled strings, cut corners. All the pieces were falling in place and I practically knew the outcome. I'd managed to take this lousy, poorly spoken, boy and make him into a household name to most of the nation. 

Tonight I'd gotten us onto a talkshow together. Don't get the picture? Of course a mortal like you wouldn't understand the intricacies of my plans. You see, this guy is about the sleaziest you can get. And I had snuck on set and... 'Altered' some of the questions the hosts were going to ask us.

And we're up. Hello crowd, laughter, smile, wave. Sit down, nod to all the people on the couch. Listen to all their bullshit. Ahhh yes, here we go. So, daddy, what about if I posed nude in Playboy magazine? Just say it, say it I fucking know you want me, just say it, please!

"[WP] Your friend has always had an odd coin slot shaped indent on their forehead. One night at the bar, as a joke, you try to put a coin into it. What you didn't expect was it to go in.",trivorow,"As long as I’d known him, John had had a little furrow between his brows that looked like a coin slot. It was weird, but I just assumed maybe it was a wrinkle with a scar inside, or just a scar that had healed in a strange way. I’d asked him once, and he said he’d had it his whole life, so I just let it go.

That was, until we got drinks after work one day. He was feeling exhausted, frustrated from his latest breakup, and I just wanted to cheer the poor guy up.

So, we went to the bar by the train station, and started off with some shots. Of course, a shot each turned into a pyramid of shot glasses between us.

In a moment of drunken stupor, I told him, “Bro, close your eyes! Keep ‘em closed, alright?” and he did, laughing a bit. That was, until I pressed a quarter against that furrow in his brow, and it fell in.

His eyes shot open, him looking as scared as I did. The weird thing was, he looked different.

Instead of the 50-something he normally looked like, and had since we turned 40, his skin looked a little smoother, a little softer, less wrinkled, and a healthier color.

“Well I’ll be goddamned. You actually DO have a coin slot, and it makes you look like a newborn.” Drunkenly, I slapped his cheek and laughed, nearly poking him in the eye with my thumb.

He stumbled to his feet, pulling me out with him. He was confused, scared, and a little inebriated himself, so he sobbed and asked me what to do. Eventually, we decided to go see his parents, right then.

The train ride was hell, him slowly sobering up enough to realize he shouldn’t cry like that in public, then the questions. He whispered, mostly under his breath, but my heart broke for him. He’d been my best friend for a couple decades, since we met while working at the pizza place, so I’d met his parents, and they were lovely. Neither of us could imagine his family keeping something this huge from him.

looking at his reflection in the window, he pulled his hand out of his pocket, feeding a quarter into the dip. Several people stared, one woman screaming and falling on the floor, scrambling to get as far away as possible. On the other end of the spectrum, a little boy walked over, dime in hand, and asked if he could do it to John. Being a huge softie, he bent his head forward, without question, and the little boy let his’ dime slide in.

That time, though, his skin didn’t smooth or become more youthful. Instead, his naturally chocolate brown eyes lightened to hazel. He fist bumped the little boy, sending him back to his mom, who looked scared.

“Dude, your eyes changed color. I think different coins do different things.” I said, offering him a penny.

He put it in, eyes wide in confusion as his hair went from short, tightly curled and black to loosely curled, brown and a bit longer.

He pulled out a nickel, hands shaking so hard he almost dropped it. When it slid into place, his stubble lengthened, turning a bit thinner and closer to the brown his hair had become.

The look in his eyes was that of a wild animal, and I yanked him hard when we got off the train. We ignored the crowd, pushing through it like it were water.

Outside the station, he called his mom, quickly explaining we were close and could either take a taxi or she could come get us, but that we all needed to talk.

It was then I remembered his dad had one too. And his mom had something similar on her hand.

My eyes went wide, and I stared at him. “John, I’m not trying to freak you out, but…” I started, his eyes turning to me and making me pause. “Your mom has one on her hand, I think.”

He stared at me, fear and confusion clouding his face. “Dad has the same eyebrow furrow, but he’s looked 50 for 30 years.”

With new eyes, I looked back at his parents. His mom should be somewhere around 75, but she looked no older than 30. His dad looked maybe 45, at the oldest. And they always had, which was weird. I’d always just assumed they had good genetics, only seeing them occasionally and not thinking much about it.

I dug through my briefcase, pulling out a half-dollar and a silver dollar I’d stashed away. When I slid the half dollar coin in, his skin lightened from a rich mocha to a dark tan. Sliding in the silver dollar, his face altered slightly, eyes becoming more angled, nose and lips thinning, and his cheekbones receding in a bit. His broad jaw even thinned, becoming more of a point.

He went quiet then, eyes filled with tears, and I I squeezed his shoulder as his mom pulled her tiny car up. She waved, pausing mid-wave when she saw him.

We climbed into the back seat, him not acknowledging anything until the car stopped and I shook his shoulder. I helped stabilize him, half-carrying him up the steps of his family’s home.

His dad met us at the door, pleased to see us but confused at the late night surprise visit.

John and I sat on the couch, his parents taking the arm chairs across the table from it. I patted John’s arm, squeezing his shoulder in a wordless attempt to psyche him up.

Instead of saying what I had hoped, something smart yet subtle, he might as well have omitted for the word vomit that he spewed out.

“What the fuck are we?” he asked, eyes flickering between his parents. Like me, they went rigid and stared, before asking him what he meant.

Grabbing another nickel and dime, he fed them into his head, then more and more change until he was unrecognizable.

I stared, my face getting close to horror as my black friend turned into a pale ginger with pin-straight hair down to his shoulders.

His parents watched, staring glancing from him to each other, anxiety creasing their features.

He stood suddenly, forcing his last penny into his mother’s hand,. Her hair went from black and silky to slightly wavy and brown.

You could have knocked me over with a feather when a new man, John’s grandfather, hobbled in. I’d never been able to tell whose parent he was, as both of John’s parents called him “Dad.”

Without even a brief consideration for John’s feelings, his Grandpa simply stated, “You’re a robot, stupid.” and hobbled over, sitting on the arm of his daughter’s chair. “This one, I made first. She definitely wasn’t the first prototype, or even the hundredth, but she worked so well I decided to start with a man. It was only a matter of time before they wanted a baby, so I let them.”

John shook, rage playing at his nerves. “Why didn’t I know?”

His grandfather just raised an eyebrow, staring at him. “So you could have an existential crisis like this?”

John stood up again, rushing upstairs and grabbing his parents change jar, then walked outside, slamming the door. I excused myself, and called a cab.

His mom tried to run out and talk to him, but I had to hold her back, explaining that he needed time alone.

After we dropped him off, it took over a week before anyone heard from him, except the pizza guy who was pretty confused when each time he delivered, a slightly different looking guy answered the door.

Now that I’m getting older, I’m glad I was there for him. While I look every day of my eight decades on this planet, he looks like a buff 20-something, who can help me get in and out of bed, or onto the couch.

I just hope he’s not offended by what he’ll get in my will. I’d found the chest a decade or so ago, filled with pages upon pages of various currency, some American, Canadian, old coins, new coins, and as I traveled and met others who did, I collected coins. There had to be thousands of dollars worth of coins in there, and I always wondered what a Looney or a 500 yen piece would do. Maybe he does too?

[WP] You're a medieval executioner having the absolutely worst case of the Mondays.,wezli333,"The rooster crowed and I buried my head deeper into the straw. I grumbled, inhaling the smell of dung and horsehair. Damn, passed out in the barn again. 

""You're gonna be late for work,"" my wife, Karen, said matter of factly. I propped up out of the mountain of hay and looked towards her with bleary eyes. She shook her head, each hand firmly grasping one of Betty's teats. Well, at least there would be fresh milk.

""The Prancing Pig, again? Really Mike?"" she said through a frown. ""If you're gonna be out all night, you can just plan on sleeping out here every night.""

""Yes, dear,"" was all I could muster.

""And don't you think you are gonna send a pigeon and get out of work today. I will not stand for it, Mike. You have a family to support now. You are going to work.""

""Yes, dear.""

I closed my eyes and fell back into the hay. ""I'm never drinking mead again,"" I muttered.

After deciding I wasn't going to die after all, I managed to change into a fresh tunic, trousers, and boots. I stumbled to the cart, which I assumed my Karen hitched for me. 

""Forgetting something?"" she called out, rolling her eyes. 

""Ehrm.."" I checked my pockets. Jail keys. Coin pouch. I looked back into the wagon... my axe. I sighed, I moved to climb off of the cart but Karen was already approaching- with my two handed headsman's axe in tow.  

""I swear, Mike. I wash your tunic. I cook you food. I take care of the farm. I even take extra care to get stains off of your axe, and you can't even be bothered to get up and get to work on time. I swear, if you lose this job.""

I grumbled and snapped the reins. The horse started to trot. My wife's voice called out, ""Mike! You forgot your lunch!"" 

""I'll eat out with the guys,"" I muttered. 

""Morning Mike!"" the Sheriff said as I trudged through the wooden door into his office.

""Mornin."" I leaned my axe against the wall, and glanced to guard posted to the door to the cells. ""How we lookin, Tom?""

Tom shook his head, ""Gonna be a long one, Mike. You missed it this morning, but Sir Clothar dragged in a posse of bandits and murderers. King Malcolm couldn't sort out who did what, so.. you know his rule. You keep bad company, bad things happen...""

Great. Monday morning and already a busy start. It wasn't unusual with the new King. When his father, King Jacob, was ruling life as the executioner was grand. Jacob had a heart as big as a watermelon. Forgave everyone, handed out pardons left and right. Cushy job I had. Then that same heart gave out, and his boy took over. Looking to make a name for himself and assert his rule, he had been cracking that whip. Hell, I had to stay late the last few weeks and even worked a weekend. I deserved last night's fun. 

""So.. what'd the misses say when you got home,"" Tom said through a grin. ""You went stumbling out pretty late I heard...""

I shrugged. ""She didn't say much. I slept in the barn.""

""Ouch.""

""Well, if that damned Sir Roderick hadn't sat too high in his saddle in the 4th match, he wouldn't have been unhorsed. Then I wouldn't have had to buy Simon Athelwood and all of his apprentices the next round. And one thing turned into another-""

""Wait,"" Tom quirked a brow. ""You drank with Athelwood last night?""

I nodded. 

Tom shook his head. 

""Hey you two,"" the Sheriff snapped. ""Quit your yappin! Mike's got work to do."" 

Not an hour later, the sound of the drums let me know I was up. I sighed and reached down for my hooded mask. I placed it onto my head, and pulled it down. Until it wedged stuck on my face. 

""Fuckin thing,"" I grumbled. I pulled harder, but it wouldn't fit. I tore it off my head and tried again. I twisted and turned. 

""Hey, uh Mike..."" the Sheriff whispered. ""Try, uh... turning it around, you know..""

I shot him a go-to-hell glare. But of course he was right. I turned it around and it slid perfectly over my head, eye holes lining up perfectly. A hint of rosewater filled my nose. I would have to remember to buy Karen some flowers on the way home. 

I left the jail and marched through the crowd. I climbed the stairs to the top of the platform and looked forward. Why couldn't it have been a slow day? Not only were 6 members of this posse all tied together, but the backlog from the weekend just piled up behind them. I had no idea what their crimes were, and I didn't care. 

""Ah, Mark, you're here!"" the King announced. 

""Uh, it's Mike, My Lord..""

""Of course, Mike, well.. don't let me interrupt you. Proceed!""

I swung my axe each time, in perfect unison with the beat of the drum that marked the end of the drum roll. One head, two head, three head, four. On the 5th one, I raised my axe high above my head. The drum roll started again. And the axe head fell from the shaft. Motherfu....

I turned and sighed. King Malcolm raised an eyebrow, ""Do we have a problem, Mark?""

I shook my head. ""No your Highness, just some.. technical difficulties."" I knelt and tried wedging the blade onto the shaft. No use, still loose. 

""My Lord,"" I said. ""I think I'm going to have to call support.""

The crowd grumbled. I stood up and motioned my hands down, trying to calm them down. 

""It's okay... we'll get Jasper down from the smithy. He can fix this or replace this, I'm sure.""

The King interjected, ""Alright, Mark. Go down and get this taken care of, the rest of us,"" he cheered, ""will take our midday feast!"" 

The crowd cheered and my heart sank. I trudged down the stairs, catching Tom by the arm. ""Sorry, man. Boss got me working on this  support issue. We'll have to do lunch tomorrow.""

Tom nodded, ""Yeah, we all saw. Presentation was going good too. You were razor sharp. Good luck.""

I sighed, removing my mask, and made my way to the blacksmith.

""Look Jasper, I just need this one fixed.. or another one.""

""What's your ticket number?""

I blinked. ""My.. what?""

""Your ticket number,"" he spat. He limped back from the forge with a red hot sword, laid it on an anvil, and starting swinging his mallet. Each smash threatened to split my head apart. 

""Can you stop that for just a second?""

""Stop what?"" he growled. 

""The hammering, Jasper. Please. I have a headache."" 

""Nope,"" he smashed his mallet harder and louder this time. ""Too much work to do. We don't have enough people to get all of this work done. Since we had to let Jake go due to the balance of gold in the treasury, I've been swamped. But look at those assholes over in Tax Collections. They get all the people they want. We'll see how they do their job we the guards that patrol with them have no weapons. Now, ticket number?""

I sighed. ""Jasper, I don't have a ticket. This literally just happened right in the middle of my presentation. The King sent me down to get this fixed.""

""What, you think name droppin gonna make this go any faster?"" he smirked. ""There is an order to these things. I need a ticket to do the work. I don't care who says what comes first, not everything is an emergency.""

""Well, this kind of is...""

""No, it isn't. What's gonna happen? One guy can't take a few extra heads today? The Kingdom isn't gonna go bankrupt or shut down."" He limped over to me, looking me straight in the eye lowering his voice, ""But I'll do ye a favor, alright?""

I nodded, breathing a sigh of relief. 

He leaned in and whispered, pressing a piece of parchment into my hand, ""Ticket #7230, check back tomorrow. Have a nice day.""

I hung my head and made my way to the castle, knowing King Malcolm would still be eating.

Which he was. I stepped to the door where two guards lowered their halberds to block my path. 

""King's busy,"" the senior of the two grunted.

""I know, guys..."" I looked down to my feet. ""I just need a moment. It's about the axe...""

""Oh,"" he said. ""Heard about that, Mike. Tough luck, right in front of the big guy in the middle of the presentation."" He sniffed. ""I suppose, I could announce you.""

""Thanks, guys,"" I nodded. 

""Don't worry about it. How'd Karen take you coming in late from the 'Pig last night?"" 

""Slept in the barn,"" I shrugged.

""Damn..."" 

They announced my presence and the King ushered me in. He was in the middle of devouring a turkey leg, and guzzled a goblet of a wine. After belching he gave me a nod, ""Ah, Mark. You get our axe fixed?""

I shook my head. On a different day, I would have covered for Jasper but I was in no mood. ""Sorry, My Lord. Unfortunately, the Blacksmith is busy. Gave me a ticket number though, should be good tomorrow.""

The King stood up, slamming his fists on the table. ""Tomorrow? Tomorrow? Heads need to roll today! If heads aren't rolling today Mark, then it will be yours next, for not doing your job!""

The fire raised up in me, my palms went sweaty as I clenched my fists. 

""My Lord,"" I said firmly, ""I can't get the axe fixed because the guy who I need to fix says he has no time. He says he has no help.""

""Mark,"" the King said firmly. ""I'm not asking for excuses. I'm asking for solutions. Can you help me out, and get me a solution? I need you to collaborate with Jasper, synergize. I know this is a lot to ask but we need to get this done today. Do you understand?""

I sighed and nodded my head. ""Yes, My Lord. But, my name is Mike..."" I trailed off. 

""Good, now if you'll excuse me,"" he shooed me away with his hand, ""Prince Oscar is visiting and we have an early round of horseshoes to get to. Very important meeting.""

I turned to leave, but then he called out, ""Oh Mark, I meant to ask...""

""Yes, My Lord?"" I turned to face him, nodding my head and not making eye contact. 


""You end up in the dog house after closing down the 'Pig last night?"" he laughed. ""Heard about that. We need to get some mead sometime, Mark. Check with my assistant, he'll find a slot on my calendar."" ",RobotAnarchy

She looked at her fifteen year old son in pure horror as she tried to absorb the scene in front of her.

""Mom... Settle. It's just a trend,"" West quipped, embarrassingly shutting off the air screen where he was only conversing with his friends a few minutes earlier. Traere marched with indignation and snatched the red armband off from across his bicep.

""Alexa, set West's externals to default immediately!"" She shouted in anger. Within seconds, her son's slicked-black hair evaporated - the tan military outfit he wore was gone, while the oddly short square mustache he donned disintegrated. The red armband across the floor with the swastika took longer to dissolve, however, leaving a now naked, exposed teenager defenseless against his tempestuous mother.

""There is absolutely no way you haven't learned about the Holocaust by now,"" Traere's voice was low, sharply contrasting her earlier shrieks - a volume that scared West.

As she motioned herself to take a seat, a float materialized underneath her, and she safely landed on the floating ball as it molded to her shape. Sitting down always helped her absorb things.

""So you're not a nazi? Or a potential future psychopath dictator?"" Traere looked at her son earnestly. West sighed, his face amused.

""No mom. We're just trying to learn stuff. Don't you ever role-play?"" West questioned her accusingly. Traere's eyes went wide for a second before she composed herself again. She looked to the side as she replied, and then returned her gaze back to her son.

""Of, of course! But obviously not as one of the most evil men in history! And you've learned about the War of 2020 haven't you?"" Traere asked. West nodded.

""Obviously, Mom! It was the former United States' civil war that split the nation into two because of extremely clashing ideologies. But mom that wasn't just the nazis...""

""States' Rights 2.0,"" Traere muttered, shaking her head. Suddenly her expression shifted, and she held her face in her arms.

""I miss your grandfather, West,"" She spoke, as tears burst and flooded down her face. West gestured with his fingers to put on a random every day outfit, and within seconds it materialized on him. As soon as his externals were complete he leaped to give his grieving mom a hug.

""We'll see him again someday, Mom,"" West whispered, still holding his anguished mother in an embrace.

""I'm really sorry. I won't reskin as Hitler ever again,"" He vowed, as his mother continued crying. Traere looked up at him, smiling softly.

""I know you're a good kid. You can continue RPing if it helps you learn. But please ask next time. Explain the context. Trust me West, I was a teenager once. I'll get it,"" She spoke, her voice still quivering a little from her tears. Smart matter molecules dissolved the water streaming down her face in seconds, and all that was left were puffy eyes and a red nose. Alexa would fix those in a couple of minutes as well. West laughed.

""Nice try mom. I know you've always been 40. The 25 skin looks good though,"" He teased. Mother and son shared laughter as Traere scoffed and smiled again. She didn't know what she did to deserve such a good kid.",BrandOfRomance

"[WP] You’re the designated survivor, and must lead the nation after a terrorist attack hits Washington DC during the state of the union, obliterating the entire line of presidential successors. What is the immediate geopolitical repercussions around the world, and your first line of orders?",Elication,"The clapping finally stopped. The secretary of agriculture didn't think much of it and continued reading the inscription on a rather lovely painting of Zion national park that hung in the Oval. Six junior staffers had piled into the chief of staff's office to watch the state of the Union on his more commodious television. To be perfectly frank, secretary Smith couldn't give a damn about the president warmly patting himself on the back for his middlingly uncontroversial actions in his third year of office. A man promising to ""Better the deal"" had been campaigning for re-election since March of the previous year and his record showed it. Perhaps secretary Smith was bitter, since he'd campaigned with the former governor on a platform of stiff financial reform and an end to partisan gerrymandering. When January rolled around he was stuffed in a political broom closet so President Albertson could nibble away at more and more of the surplus on ""popular"" infrastructure and military bills. Listening to the raucous applause drift in from the other room was just a jagged reminder of what could have been. But the applause had been stopped for almost two full minutes now, and that sent an unexplainable chill down his back. He leaned back, trying to peer through the crack in the door at the television while listening for the significantly quieter sounds of speech that might drift through. A an unnaturally pale face appeared in the door gap for a moment, and the door snapped shut. He made a move towards it, while something screamed bloody murder somewhere deep in his consciousness. Halfway to the door he heard a cold voice bark from the portico behind him.

  &amp;nbsp; 

""Mr. President, you need to come with me. Immediately.""

  &amp;nbsp; 

Six voices jabbered incessantly over one another, but no discernible words found their way into President Smith's head. He watched the footage on a laptop, for the third time running. His friend, one of his oldest collogues, the bum-bouncing shithead who cared more about 4 more years than kept promises was coughing, harder and with less control than someone making a nationally televised speech had a right to. He wasn't sure he wanted to watch a man with children hack a mouthful of blood onto his speech and collapse with an almost comical bounce again. He, the upper echelon of the pentagon and the tattered remnants of the cabinet had been bustled onto *Double Zero* and had been airborne over the Atlantic for about four hours. He hadn't known of the existence of an extensively modified B-2 Spirit stealth bomber termed *Air Force 00*, but he was expertly acquainted with all six rooms at this point. Economy of space was the game, and they could stay aloft for four days which sounded frankly like misery. The Chairman of the joint chiefs was hammering a fist on the tiny steel-framed desk centered in what purported to be ""his"" office. It gave the images of multiple congressmen and, Jesus, Lana Albertson desperately running before collapsing in grisly piles a surreal vibration. 

   &amp;nbsp; 

""...and I'm the one in fucking charge so I don't even want to hear about what you may or may not know or what...""

  &amp;nbsp; 

Samuel Smith snapped the laptop shut and gave a half-roared exclamation as he rose to meet the Chairman's eyes, men and women falling silent at his sudden liveliness.

  &amp;nbsp; 

""You can posture as much as you like but everyone crammed in this can knows *I am exclusively* empowered to give the orders, so let's everyone shut our mouths for a second. The President died three hours ago and we've been up here where no one can even see us arguing in circles.  I'm a *fucking* ex-agriculture executive and I *can not* do this alone, and I really can't do it while you all fire conflicting ideas at me simultaneously. So, who's first.""

  &amp;nbsp; 

President Smith didn't offer anything more to the press after his speech on the Tarmac at Andrews Air Force base, and made swiftly to the line of Black limousines making up ""his"" motorcade. After extensive searching, he would be returned to the now-vetted White House to sign four executive orders, and a declaration of war. Firstly, to temporarily de-federalize the armed services and give their direct command to local governors so as to allow them to adequately keep the peace in their states and stop accusations of a military coup or puppet governance. Second, to schedule and establish a series of staggered special one-year term elections to reform the decimated joint congress that would be followed by an election. The third was the order to freeze several binding international agreements, neutering some nations idea to kick them while they were down. finally, he declared a three-county separatist section of North Dakota a foreign territory. He wouldn't have the real power to command an army to go to war with the bastards anymore, but he hoped someone might take his declaration and run with it. The ""Nation of truth"" were exactly the kind of level headed libertarian survivalists you'd expect to do nothing at all and horde beans while everyone shrugging their shoulders, but filling a waste treatment truck with home-brewed nerve gas and flooding the Capitol building's HVAC system was a bridge too far. After he'd been assured that *someone* was going to take care of the remarkably lucky (or now unlucky) domestic terrorists, his plan was to neuter the powers of his own presidency by an order the next amoral politician could cancel. Then, he supposed he'd put his feet up on the resolute desk and enjoy one year as the what would technically be the sixty-third presidency and hope the nation didn't collapse around him.",enjolras1782

Research submersibles aren't necessarily built to be particularly fast, nor hydrodynamic, and speeds are commonly measured in single digits of knots.

Assuming they stayed relatively close to the surface, where currents tend to be faster, to observe the weather above, 2-3 knots might be a fair estimate for the current's speed. It's not all that fast, but when it's half your boat's speed it can really make a difference.

Also, if they were already drifting in a similar current moving in the opposite direction prior to the storm, that could potentially double the difference in speed, and without much knowledge of the current currents (heh) it could be difficult to readjust or escape from them.



All that said, the main issue is going to have to be power - a submerged submarine is basically totally reliant on battery power for everything. Unless they have got a nuclear reactor on board, they are *not* going to be replenishing that charge while submerged. To-date, I don't believe that there exists a *single* nuclear-powered submarine that *isn't* operated by some military force. If this is a long-range boat, they're going to be running off an air-breathing diesel engine hooked up to generators to charge the batteries.

As far as endurance goes with these boats, a Balao-class submarine is designed with an endurance of 48 hours in mind, while moving at just 2 knots. These submarines are also *not* small boats. At about 95 meters long, it's probably safe to assume that a Balao-class boat's battery capacity will be quite a bit larger than the research submarine depicted here.",fgfvgdcfffff1

Two closely orbiting stars, with planets orbiting the pair, then phases will be almost the same as ours.  New moon likely won't be ever completely dark but it's unlikely you'd see the extremely thin sliver as new moon is up during the day.  

If you have 2 stars that orbit very far apart with a planet orbiting one of them.   Well then it gets much more complex but we can probably just ignore it  as for the planet to be habitable I'd imagine the star has to be very distance and probably just looks like a big star.

Your narration was on spot and you're flow was perfect; the transition between scenes was imperceptible. Nothing felt forced. 

But with that being said, I am concerned with certain aspects of the story; namely, the characters and the setting. Let me start with Captain Tito - his dialogues deliver the impression that he is a dark, brooding man; a short-tempered seaman. Yet, repeated references to him as 'Tito', and not 'Captain' breaks that sense of aloofness, and certainly does not provide him with the respect he warrants. His demeanor feels more suited to a pirate captain or merchantman than the commander of a nuclear submarine. Regarding the rest of the characters, the opening reference is not one I would expect from a British submariner, and 'Roger' appears to come from nowhere. 

But on to the setting. I've noticed that the immediate surroundings of the characters have not been established properly. For instance, the Captain is depicted perched on the hatch in the opening sequence, so the others, clearly, were on the deck before him. Then, logically, why would the Captain be the last down the hatch in the ending sequence, and why he would have to walk any great distance towards the hatch? Such minor inconsistencies are what distracted me from the plot and broke my immersion. 

I've found that mentally picturing the scene first and pre-planning the role and movement of each character is a good way to prevent logical fallacies and improve immersion. Multiple editing passes and proofreading are, unfortunately, the only way to fix this. Apart from these two, I did notice a few issues with sentence structure and tense, but otherwise, you've done a wonderful job. Keep writing, you'll only get better! ",CatastrophicReEntry

"[WP] A team of researchers in a submarine are caught in a huge storm. The submarine submerges until the storm passes. When they resurface, they can’t get a fix on their location or find land. When night falls, there are two moons in the sky and the constellations are completely unfamiliar.",Moggy1982,"The submarine USS Michelle Howard of the US Navy sailed amongst the background of a growing storm front. First officer Commander Patrick Ford was standing next to commanding officer Captain Julian Barnes in the conning tower, observing the dark blue and black clouds. Lightning in the distance spelled trouble for the Carolina-class submarine. Although advanced, she carried sensitive electronic instruments that are susceptible to strikes.

Captain Barnes noted to his first officer, ""Time to batten down the hatches on this one. Lets get underway, Commander."" Turning two and heading down the ladder leading to the conning tower anti-chamber. Commander Ford followed behind him down the ladder. They walked through the anti-chamber to the conn, the heart of the USS Michelle Howard. On the bridge, Commander Ford instructed the deck chief to get underway. ""Chief of the deck, prepare the ship to get underway."" ""Acknowledged, Commander."" Chief Cameron Williams replied. He turned to the crewmen at the helm controls of the Howard, ""Dive controls, dive. Set bow planes to 20. Make your depth two-five-zero meters. Course one-eight-zero."" Over the ship intercom, 'dive, dive, dive'. Captain Barnes settled into his command chair at the center of the bridge. Commander Ford remained standing, bracing himself on the periscope while the ship dipped into the Atlantic Ocean.

The sub steadily dived into the sea as the rain begun above the surface. Once completely submerged she gracefully settled into the natural rhythm of the ocean.

""Commander Ford, at some point we need to-"" before Captain Barnes could finish his sentence, the ship was rocked hard. The entire bridge crew slid to the right as the Howard listed starboard at an extreme angle. Anything not bolted to the deck became mobile. Along the bridge wall, cracked pipes spewed steam and water onto the deck. The crew attempted to steady themselves at their stations. Captain Barnes righted himself back into his chair, ""Report!"" Commander Ford pulled himself upright by the periscope cables. ""Helm steady us."" Deck Chief Williams reported, ""Captain we have lost yaw control. Listing starboard. Port bow plane reading 40 degrees down. Starboard plane reading 0."" Turning back towards the Captain. ""I think we lost it.""

""Lost the bow plane?"" weapons officer Lieutenant John Breckenridge commented from his weapons console at the back of the bridge. ""Depth crossing 500 meters!"" Helmsmen Ensign Beverly Edwards reported from the helm. Commander Ford spoke up, ""Blow both tanks. Surface the ship."" The deck chief replied, ""Commander, that storm is in full swing up there."" Captain Barnes stood up, continuing to brace himself on his chair. ""We have no choice!""

""Aye sir!"" exclaimed Chief Williams. ""Helm, emergency blow port and starboard ballast tanks. Full raise."" As the bridge crew worked to fulfill his orders, he gripped the back of helmsmen's Edwards chair as the bridge righted itself and went into an 30 degree upward angle. Silence and business filled the bridge, quickly replaced with the sound of water displacing rapidly along the Howard as the crew worked to stabilize their ship.

The USS Michelle Howard blasted out of the water and settled on the surface. From the bridge, a breath of calm fell upon the crew. Captain Barnes picked himself off of the deck, ""Damage Report."" Commander Ford walked to the nearest bridge intercom panel, depressed the 2MC button to call engineering, ""Engineering, damage report."" Captain Barnes made his rounds across the bridge, surveying the various stations. He took a mental inventory of flashing lights and warning sounds. He turned towards the sonar officer, Lieutenant Mark 'Mac' Henderson, ""Sonar, report all contacts."" Captain Barnes turned back towards the front of the bridge, ""Deck chief, report all surface contacts."" Deck chief Williams hurried towards the conning tower to report any surface ships within range, grabbing a rain suit along the way.

Over the intercom, Chief Engineer Lieutenant Commander Trevor Wallace reported, ""Bridge, Engineering, damage to starboard bow plane catastrophic, it is unresponsive. Propulsion plant nominal. What's going on up there?"" Commander Ford replied, ""Stand by."" Sonar technician Lieutenant Henderson piped up, ""No sonar contacts, Captain."" A moment later, Chief Williams returning from the conning tower, bone dry, ""Sir, no surface contacts. No storm either, sir."" Captain Barnes acknowledged his report, ""Thank you, Chief.""

Ensign Lisa Jenkins appeared confused at her navigation and positioning station. ""Commander, GPS positioning negative. I am not able to acquire a positive satellite lock."" Commander Ford, also appearing confused. ""Say again, Ensign?"" She did. Captain Barnes walked back towards them and studied the navigation panel. Then, turning towards the helm, ""Helm, all stop.""

Helmsmen Edwards replied, ""Aye sir, now answering all stop.""

Captain Barnes walked over to the communications officer across the bridge, ""Lieutenant Monroe, any local comm traffic? Perhaps we are dealing with a localized phenomena."" Lt Landry Monroe turned towards the Captain, ""Aye aye sir. Stand by."" Lt Monroe concentrated on his headset, along with the audio signal monitor on his screen. ""Sir, no local communications."" Captain Barnes, confused by this report, ""There is a carrier group less than 20 miles from here, is there interference?"" Lt Monroe replied, ""Negative, captain. I am not reading any background signal interference. There just isn't any communications traffic within 50 miles.""

Commander Ford, from the navigation station, ""Captain, navigation diagnostics are not reporting any equipment issues."" Captain Barnes started towards the conning tower, ""Commander."" Signaling his first officer to join him. They walked through the conning tower anti-chamber and then climbed the ladder leading to the outside.

It was late afternoon and the sun was beginning to set. The Captain grabbed a pair of binoculars and begun scanning the horizon in the direction of the carrier group. Commander Ford lifted the cover to the conning tower compass. It was spinning clockwise. ""Captain..."" he said, pointing at the compass. Captain Barnes took the binoculars from his face and looked at the compass. ""Well add that to the list."" Commander Ford replied, ""That list is growing, sir."" As the darkness increased, the moon grew visible or what appeared to be a double moon. Commander Ford remarked, ""Did we always have the two moons?"" Captain Barnes frowned. ""Assemble the senior officers and go to general quarters.""",Republiconline

"[WP] A group of adventurers wake up to find a dead body in their room, each person believing that they are the killer as they try to discover who the killer is.",SethLight,"The first clue that something was horribly wrong was the acrid smell that filled the room. The second was the dead body. Poppy had been the first to wake up, though the others followed not soon after, as soon as her shrill scream reached their ears. Gail was the first to arrive, with Robert and Anthony arriving not soon after. There, on the ground, laid Sonya, who was quite obviously dead. 

“Oh my god!” Gail exclaimed, her hands going to her mouth in surprise. “We need to call the police!” Of course, she was only saying this as a mere formality, as Gail had stayed up with Sonya last night, drinking their late night tea, as they always did. The one difference was that Gail had slipped cyanide into Gail’s tea that night. They had been best friends, until Sonya had started dating her last boyfriend shortly after they broke up, and Gail had been unhappy with her since. The sickly displays of love between the couple during the trip had driven her over the edge.

Anthony surveyed the scene, a grim look upon his face. He had been dating Sonya. He had also slipped to where she was once he was sure everyone was asleep and snapped her neck. Sonya had been a horrible person. He and Gail weren’t compatible, but at least she wasn’t a nutjob. He was berated for the smallest of things, mere trivialities got him kicked out to the couch. When they had been in the woods yesterday, she’d finally hit him, slapping him across the face for something he said that she didn’t like, and he had snapped. 

Robert was seemingly unconnected to the strange love triangle thing. Him and Poppy were a couple, and had met Sonya and Anthony through Gail, who had been Poppy’s freshman year roommate. What the other’s failed to know about Robert was that he had known Sonya beforehand. And he owed her a sum of money. A sum of money large enough for her to hold it over his head. He had suggested the camping trip for this very reason. To get rid of the problem. He’d planned to lure her into the woods and drown her, but she hadn’t left Anthony’s side the entire night, ruining his earlier plan.  So he had slipped to where she was sleeping and strangled her. 

Poppy had discovered the body, and tears were sliding down her face. She was the sensitive type. Highly empathetic. Robert’s money issues affected her too. She hadn’t known about Robert’s plan, but she loved her boyfriend, and wished to see him happy. So she had done what she had to. She had happened upon the the potassium cyanide in Gail’s bag while looking for something to other asked her to find, and quickly deduced for the other woman planned to do. She had then slipped it into her bag. Later, she had replaced the cyanide with ground up sleeping pills, before later slipping in about an hour after Gail had left. Then she had slowly fed Sonya the potassium cyanide she had stolen earlier, in the disguise of water. The other had been asleep, so she had no protests. 

So, all of them had attempted to murder the girl. First Gail, at around 9:00, slipping what she thought was potassium cyanide into the tea. Then Poppy, who had actually pulled it off, at around 10:00. Robert had then come in around 10:30, thinking the already dead girl was sleeping, and strangled her. Lastly, Anthony, who arrived around 11:00 to snap her neck. Now they all looked at one another in fake horror, each thinking they had committed the heinous act, their looks of fake horror soon turning into fake suspicion. 

“It had to be one of us.” Poppy commented.

“Why would you even think that?” Gail questioned.

“Just a hunch.” Poppy shrugged, before smiling slightly at her boyfriend. This was just the beginning of the plan.

"[WP] You think you have the power to stop time. In reality, everyone pretends to freeze when you walk in a room so you leave.",TheYsbryd,"POTUS is the best job. Everyone knows it's the best, there's no better job than President and I'm the best at it. Everyone knows it.

I can even *stop time*. Folks, imagine if crooked Hillary could have stopped time - Maybe she would have figured out how to wipe her servers and wouldn't be going to jail! 

I mean I can stop time. Stop it completely, like totally stop it. Stop people and stop time I can do both. I created a time bubble around me and that Japanese guy Abby at Mar el Lago. Just stopped time and told him how to fix North Korea. That's what I mean about Fake News, folks. They can't see me when I stop time, so they just make stuff up because every time they wake up when I start time again, America is just a *little* bit greater.

I don't know, folks. People think it's easy being the president and it's not. I mean it is and it isn't. I don't know how the guys before me did it, not being able to stop time like I can. Hard work! 

I get so much done it's unbelievable, just unbelievable. Each morning I stop time for an hour and go walking around the White House just checking up on things. I walk out my door and everyone just freezes. It's beautiful, people. Everyone just freezes like statues and that's how I know I can still. Freeze. Time. I spend an hour making sure our government still has good people working in it and that everyone is wearing a tie. Then I go back to bed and turn time on again and pretend to be asleep until Hope or John comes in to wake me up with a breakfast burrito. Phew! Lots of work.

Mike's over there telling me to move this speech forward now, but folks let me tell you the best thing about freezing time. It's not the obvious things like stealing people's hats or saying whatever you want without worrying about people hearing you say it. It's the little stuff. Everyone knows I like burgers. Love them! Folks, the best thing about stopping time is being able to go out of the White House and walk down Pennsylvania Avenue to the little MacDonalds down the street and just eat and eat and eat and eat. Everything is silent except for me eating all the burgers they have lined up behind the counter. I leave two hundred dollars in the waitress' bra and just eat and eat and eat. Everything is so quiet. People frozen in place mid-burger. All the cars stopped outside. No poison in any of the burgers. Beautiful. It's like one of those guys who were around here last year said. That guy who was always around. Had bad shoes. He was talking about one of the big photographs they have of the old presidents and he said ""It's like his eyes are following you"". I'll never forget it. Beautiful words. Great guy. When I stop time it's just like that. Weird!

Anyway folks, my baby Ivanka is hurrying me along now too, so I'll be brief. I love her so much, folks. Just so so much. She's a really great person and I owe her just so much. It feels a little bad, but sometimes I'll stop time to punch Jared in the balls for not being a better husband to her. I punch him so hard time starts up a little for him. Ivanka just stands there frozen in time like a beautiful statue and it makes me want to cry folks, it really does.

Ok, back to why we're here. So... Read from where?

...

There? OK. *ahem*

My fellow Americans. It is my solemn duty to inform you all that the United States of America is under attack. Fifteen minutes ago, Russia and China launched their entire nuclear arsenal at us, and we have retaliated in kind. You have little time, so I will be brief. Go to safety, go to your loved ones and remain calm. Rest assured that while a great horror has fallen upon the world, we the people will one day rise again, stronger and wiser than before. God bless you and God bless the United States of America.

"[WP] You think you have the power to stop time. In reality, everyone pretends to freeze when you walk in a room so you leave.",TheYsbryd,"I roamed the remnants of the world today, like always. I have left the forests I was passing through behind and now find myself in a world of gray stone. The old ones must’ve built this, I think, for it is much too straight and regular to be the work of mother nature. I must be wary here, for even if my skin is rough like the bark of an oak there are things here that are harder and sharper than anything amongst the trees. Jumping from one of the crumbling mountains to another, I nearly pierced my foot on something sharp gleaming amongst the rubble. I threw it as far as I could into the collapsed innards of the mountains, where it can hurt no other. As I heard the sound of its fall reverb amongst the empty cliffs, I asked myself if I would ever find father again, what if he was hiding somewhere like down there in the dark, somewhere I could impossibly find him? The prospect put me in a quite foul and insipid mood, something that soon was to be changed. 

When I was looking for a place to rest tonight, as the great sun fell, I came upon the statues again. It was in a lower block of stone, most of it unharmed. I thought it looked much like a stout little tree stump. I thought I heard the hushed croaking of crows from one of the caves in there and decided to go in there to investigate. After all, what kind of crow lives in a cave like this one? But as I entered the cluttered area I was met with the stench of burnt ash and a gathering of the statues. Six of them, there were. They were most beautiful, their skin was unblemished and their frames small and delicate. I also noticed that they wore strange weaves of leaves I didn’t recognize, much like the statues I found in the shining box on the road had been wearing! Most intrigued, I approached and listened to the little sounds they make as the wind plays with their peculiar little mouths and nose-holes. 

I have of course encountered the statues all my life, even as I was little and traveled with father, but he always told me to stay astray of them, which is why today’s experience was doubly intriguing. I was hungry, so of course, I picked the freshest looking statue to crack its head. When you do that, you see, they go limp, and its easier to get the good stuff out. But as I approached the smallest one and raised a stone above it, one of the others started moving! It was an incredible sight, and I must admit that it frightened me quite terribly. I got so scared, as it roared, that I struck it instead. But I was far too distraught to drink from it, and so I ran. Although I was awfully afraid and still am in this moment, I must go back to them and investigate. Not only in the name of finding out more about the peculiar statues of flesh, but also because I am terribly hungry.

"[WP] You think you have the power to stop time. In reality, everyone pretends to freeze when you walk in a room so you leave.",TheYsbryd,"I could feel the tension amongst each scientist in the room. Lily glanced over towards me before connecting two electronic receivers together. I leaned in with anticipation waiting on the test to become complete. I pressed my nose against her ear before remarking,

“You are doing it all wrong.”

“Get away from me!” Lily shouted dropping both the receivers back onto the table.

“You need to connect that single wire into the other import.” I exclaimed smiling. I clasped my hands together behind my back before walking over towards Brandon.

“Do not get near me.” Brandon remarked. Instead of fulfilling his request, I leaned in very close to study him. Eyeball to eyeball, we stared at one another. “I swear, If you –”

“You are doing it wrong, Brandon.” I whispered.

“Get the hell away from me! This is how you are supposed to solve the algorithm!” Brandon raised his right hand trying to motion me off.

I smiled towards him before turning around to Haley. I slowly made my way towards Haley who had her back turned to me. She had her eyes fixed onto her computer monitor.

“If you are coming over to me, don’t even bother.” Haley remarked.

I slowly positioned my head right next to hers while looking onto her computer monitor. “This is all wrong.” I turned to whisper in her ear. “Why did you do it like that?” 

Haley didn’t respond. She just rolled her eyes while biting down onto her lip. I could feel the heat radiating from her face turning a bright red.

“Hey Thompson!” Brandon shouted. “Oh my god in heaven! I think I've got something!” 

I turned around, “Dr. Thompson. I am Dr. Thompson.” I sighed.

“Dr. Whatever, get over here!” Brandon motioned.

I quickly walked over towards Brandon when he pointed to the whiteboard. “I have figured it out. Lily connect both the receivers into the port Haley has diagramed on her computer monitor!”

The women did what Brandon had ordered as I sat there watching the commotion. It seemed too good to be true. It almost seemed to perfect. It was at the moment when Lily connected the two receivers, everything froze. It was as if time had completely stopped after the wires sparked from the connection. Brandon stood frozen with his mouth open in excitement. Haley was leaning over Lily whose position was now stuck connecting the wires. Everyone became a statue in place except me.

“Okay, very funny guys.” I slowly snapped my fingers in front of Brandon’s excited face.

Nothing. No movement.

I walked over towards Haley only to randomly shout in her ear hoping she would jump in place.

No movement at all.

These guys were good but I’m not convinced. I walked over towards the computer monitor and noticed the time stamp wasn’t moving. I tried to manipulate the keyboard and the display but she must have frozen the screen somehow. Turning around, I noticed the analog clock wasn’t moving either.

*Did they take out the batteries just to mess with me?* I pondered. *There’s no way they went to that level. Maybe this is really happening.*

I walked out of the room closing the door behind me. I stomped my feet to make it sound like I was walking down the hallway. As I lightened my stomps to make it sound like I was away, I quickly opened the door.

“Aha! Gotcha!” I shouted.

Everyone was still frozen in place. Brandon had his mouth open in excitement. Haley was leaning over Lily whose position was connecting the wires. I let out a sigh before closing the door behind me again.

*Why am I not frozen in time?* I wondered. I have to figure out how to fix this. I made my way into my office to study what could have happened. I poured myself a neat whiskey while locking my eyes onto the whiteboard. My eyes scanned all over the different algorithmic solutions scattered in disarray. 

“What happened in there?” I asked myself.

A few hours went by while still stuck in time. The office didn’t have any windows but I knew the day was exactly where it was hours ago. The analog clock in the office was stuck. I knew they didn’t come in here, there’s no way they had planned this whole thing. I couldn’t believe that I had become locked inside a moment in time. 

I started to write out the possibilities onto the whiteboard. I was going over the connection of wires that Lily enacted before I heard a strange sound. It almost sounded like laughter.

“I knew it!” I said aloud. “It was a prank!” I slapped the papers in my hand onto the table while I marched back towards the lab. I opened the door before yelling,

“I got you guys this time!”

I was now more confused than ever. Brandon still had his mouth open in excitement while standing exactly where he was. Haley was leaning over Lily whose position was still connecting the wires.  

“I don’t understand.” I scratched my head. “What is happening?”

I left the door open behind while making my way to Dr. Frankford’s office. While approaching to the next science wing, Dr. Frankford busted through the doors. Sweat covered his pudgy face while his eyes widened.

“Oh my god,” Dr. Frankford gasped. “You aren’t frozen like the others!”

We stood there staring for a moment. I glanced back through the opened door into the lab. I couldn’t tell if I saw Brandon wink to Lily or not. I figured my ears were playing tricks on me earlier but now it’s my eyes.

“Did you hear me?” Dr. Frankford grabbed ahold of my shoulders. “Everyone from my team – Everything is frozen! Somehow you and I are stuck in this moment in time!”

My ears were playing tricks again. I could have swore I heard someone laughing behind Dr. Frankford in the other science wing. I squinted my eyes past his shoulder and saw everyone from his wing was frozen as well.

I wasn't even quite aware of it at the time, but let me tell you, I'd wasted my life away. It seemed like everything after I left college was a series of long, distended compromises. If I had to pick which road to take, I didn't take the one less traveled, or even the trodden down one next to it. No, even that would be too assertive. I'd ask my wife or, hell, she'd tell me before I even got the chance, and do what she said.

My students, hell, they don't respect me. The fruits of my labor are tied up in a zillion dollar a year penis enlargement conglomerate. The first organic penis, and I'd created all the substrates and tissues that would go into the final product. But guess what-- even here, I don't get a dime for any of my labor. It's a hard world when you get screwed harder by ex business partners than you do by your wife.

But now, well, now this shit's going to change. I've got maybe two, three months, and as ashamed as I am I've decided I have to go into the raw honey business. It's a tough business, to be sure, and I'm afraid I'll get stung more than once.

But life is a funny thing, you see, because it turns out that, looking back, I was the one doing all the stinging. My closest friend, and really, the only friend I had at the end, Buzzy, I robbed him of everything. Because of me the love of his life died not once, but twice. Because of me he had to endure torture and hardship. If he'll ever recover nobody knows.

My family and wife, who I inexplicably loved, fared no better. I'd chased down my dream of earning for them, providing. I'd done everything. Gone to hell and back, taken lives, stolen, all for mountains of pure raw honey, mountains that could and did make millions, and I never once saw that I had lost the forest for the trees. What does all the honey amount to when you've got nobody around to share it with?

I'd love to blame Spanky, my nosey brother in law at the USDA, but I just can't. When I first met him, boy was he obnoxious. A real gung-ho American idiot, like your typical USDA inspector, but as I got to know him I saw that beneath that crude exterior was a sharp, dogged inspector-- a man for which the word perseverance does no justice. The smallest thing-- I mean, honestly the smallest-- he would pull at it, latch onto it like a pitbull, and he'd keep tearing and tearing until he could shake the truth out.

And he did, and I stung him too.",the_twilight_bard

A heated night, fragrant scents of those newly birthed flowers.  Clear skies, bright stars, a full moon, beneath which was illumined sandy streets, star jasmines, and the woman whose silhouette was known rather well.

Owen’s breath caught a moment from staring just beyond a white picket fence, over which lay a heavily foot-pressed lawn among the remnants of beer cans and paper plates and chairs.  Further afore, a white house of two floorings rose, whose many windows had long darkened, or else had their curtains drawn across.  

He was still a lengthy time, his hair swaying in slight breezes, his eyes locked upon that room, in which he knew resided the most charming, most beautiful woman.  Sarah.  He recalled at that moment, and with little chagrin, last night’s dream, which had been rather a pleasant one.  Dinner by the beach, him as suave as any cinematographic male, her as open to advance as equal he was willing to give.  Walks among the sand.  All these, in detail, a slight blurred in memory, but one fantasized event remained clear in his mind.  He had come after to home, *her* home, come to visit in dead of night.

When he was roused the next morning, he resolved unto himself to do that which was dreamed, to pay visit to his girlfriend as was done in the films.  It was a good idea.  Right?  Right.  Of course it was, they were together, and she would not mind.  Such was a profession of his love.  So he set out upon the bell’s tolling of twelve, and meandered his way through those sandy streets, those empty sandy streets.

Presently, he thrust a foot and vaulted the fence, his footsteps an addition to the downtrodden grass.  There had been a party, he recalled her telling.  She hated parties, large gatherings for a more social folk.  She liked her books, her solitude and quiet, only drawn out for a few close friends . . .

Or him, but he shrugged such thoughts from his mind; they were like to incite an unwonted bout of nerves.


There was a ladder by the fence.  He grabbed and raised and climbed, and was soon scrabbling for purchase up a slanted, shingled roof.  Then he fell back, his hands losing grip -- surprised as he was -- as a cry rent the air.

She had shrieked, and quite understandably so, as anyone might’ve done when faced with the unexpected visitor on their home’s second floor.  Sarah breathed, chest heaving, a redness tingeing her tanned upper cheeks which, Owen thought, drew forth her beauty.  Quickly she moved to lock the window, but, seeing who stood without, stopped in mid-lunge and made for glasses instead.  He liked those glasses.

“What are you doing here?”  She asked.  She appeared flustered, but still pulled him in and, miming “shhhh” with lips and fingers, bade him tiptoe across the room that he might sit on her bed.

“What?”

“What are you doing here?”

“Visiting you,” Owen said, and was suddenly very aware of their close proximity.  Close enough, he saw, to count the freckles upon her face, perhaps count the flecks within her eyes.  Startlingly blue, glaringly bright.  Her hair brushed her shoulder, then she was abreast him.  Was she not pleased to see him?  He hoped it not so.

“It’s late.”

“Shh,” he said.  “It’s never too late for love.”

“We’re lovers?” She asked, and he, who was staring hard upon the floor, glanced up.  In his ears had she sounded surprised, but he soon realized she was teasing.

“Yeah,” he said.  “We are.  As long as the stars still shine, there's water in the ocean, and the sun's in the sky.”

Now imagine if someone gave you a sweater every time it was supposed to snow the following day. That's not coincidence, right? That's something else. That's fate. Fate or precognition, but really, to someone who isn't, what's the difference?

We laughed it off the first few times. Going to the same shows, competing in the same contests, partying at the same parties. It was an amicable break up, not painful to see each other in public or anything like that. He and I had a lot of the same friends, so it made sense that we would show up in the same places for a few months after the break up.

But it had been ten years. We found out we had moved to the same city after bumping into one another at a Starbucks. After that, we saw each other at least once a week. After the fourth or fifth time, it couldn't be avoided anymore, and we made plans to hit a few of the bars in uptown. Not a date, mind you. Both of us were very clear about that. We dated in college and were both in our early thirties now. We knew what we wanted, and a lot of that was formed by our experiences with each other. Not a date, we agreed.

You already know what I'm going to say, don't you? Yeah, we hooked up. But we both agreed it would only happen once.

Until it happened again.

A little girl tugged at her father's hand, trying to force him forward to meet me. She was maybe five, a fierce little thing to behold.

Her father, a tall blond man, just stood there. His legs a little apart. His jaws hung open. His eyes bugged.

I looked at the girl, ""hello, little lady."" I said.

""Hi, I am new. You're so pretty.""

""It's good to meet you, New. You can call me Professor Levity.""

The girl looked at her dad, ""This is just like your joke.""

""Levity,"" he said, but I brushed him off. I just looked at the little girl. 

""Why don't you tell me about yourself?""

""You see-- My name is Sahara Davis. I am four and a half year old. I am from Oklahoma. Last month, Daddy and Mommy got a di-w-w- the word that means they don't love each other anymore.""

I looked at her father, Jared Davis. He looked away.

""I'm not too sad about it because Mommy still comes by when she can and Daddy lets me eat cereal for dinner and They still love me, but I have to move because Daddy got a job in Georgia and I have to leave Teddy behind.""

I remembered Teddy. I met Jared last year when he coincidentally sat next to me on a flight. Instead of a project prototype, he brought his daughter's Teddy Bear. It was a good thing I had carried a construction paper with me heading to a teaching workshop. We laughed about that with a beer later.

""You must be sad leaving Teddy, but I'm sure he's a strong bear."" I knelt down so I was level with her. 

""I like your eyes. They looked so black, but when the light hit them they turned orange like maple leaves. Do you like maple leaves, Professor Levity?""

I smiled at that. Jared said similar thing at the bottom of the stairs three years ago. When he rescued me from falling down it in New York City and ended up tumbling down together. It was the first time since forever he really looked into my eyes and saw into my soul. We had barely done that since the break up.

""You are a cute kid, Sahara."" I touched Sahara's forehead, feeling the bump on a tiny groove on the left side. A car accident when she was less than a year. I drove her to the hospital myself. ""It's really nice to meet you. I'm from Oklahoma too.""

These weren't the only coincidences that happened so we could meet. I filled in for my sister as Jared and Cass's wedding organizer. My date spilled his gravy on Cass's lap on their first date. Our first apartments after graduation were across the street. 

I could never seemed to escape him, and we pretended that we never had any feelings for each other. All these times. All the touches we had. The heroic deeds we had done to each other. The breathes that mingled. 

""Levity,"" Jared said again, his voice hoarse. I smiled at him, understood.

We were young back then. Young and restrained by religion and tradition and what was right. Then we were restrained by commitments. But before us now, nothing was holding us back but ourselves.

I was transported back to the day we broke up. The day we decided that we could not ever be together. The day we tried to kill and buried a part of ourselves. Jared clearly did it better than me; Sahara was the best evidence of it. I still remembered the taste of an eighteen year old's kiss on the back of his blue truck in an alley. Before the football game started. The final goodbye kiss. The kiss that took half of my soul to preserve my life. Because nobody would let us be together without tearing off every strand of our existences.

I smiled at him and raised my eyebrows, ""hello Jared.""

""Daddy, do you know Professor Levity?"" The girl said, excited. ""Do you know him, Daddy?""

Jared smiled, for the first time since he walked in. ""Yes, I know him, honey."" 

I closed my eyes, simply satisfied with that until I heard another sentence. 

""I have loved him since I was eighteen.""  ",psuppak

I thought this every time I saw her. The first time was understandable, we were both from a small town, and there really isn't much choice when it comes to restaurants, so running into her at the Subway made sense. At that time it had only been a few months since she had left me. Since she told me she didn't love me. That I could never make her happy. So I did what any self respecting twenty year old would do. I sat in my booth with my friend and stole glances at her whenever I thought she wasn't looking. She had arrived with her new boyfriend, a guy much more athletic than me. God, I could always tell that I wasn't good enough. She paid for their sandwiches and the two of them left fairly quickly. I went home that night a defeated man. 

The second time was at a grocery store. I don't think she noticed me, but I was always good at picking her out in a crowd. She was staring intently at some of the fresh vegetables, while I turned into another aisle. Again it was a small town so I thought nothing of it. 

But these coincidences followed me for years. I started seeing her in my college town, the mall three cities away, and even three states away. Slowly I began to wonder why God was torturing me, dangling my lost love in front of me, showing me everything I wanted but could never have. 

She married the man she left me for. She had two children. I remained alone and unwanted.  

I ran into her again last week. I was on the opposite side of the country from where we first met. She was on vacation with her family. I was working on the other side of the town. 

I don't know what I've done to deserve this terrible fate; to see the life I always wanted lived by someone else, while I am ignored in the background. 

I always loved you and I always will. I would never do anything to hurt you. Why do you insist on hurting me? Why can't you just leave me alone? To live in my loneliness? 

If I see her again, my only choice is to leave the country. Hopefully that will lead to some reprieve. ",Gunnman369

[WP] The bad news: your house is haunted. The worse news: it’s the ghost of an emo teenager.,adlaiking,"A steal. An absolute steal. Harold had purchased the adorable two story right on the edge of the park for less than he would ever have believed possible. It was a beautiful little fix-it-upper. The turn of the last century iron fencing and the antique creek-stone walls it sat atop were both in excellent shape. The rooms were cozy and snug. The little winding staircase was even situated in a turret on the north corner of the home. A turret. With a little book nook at the top of it. Harold adored the turret.

Harold had spent the better part of the day carting in his little belongings, fussing over which room the various boxes should eventually be unpacked into. The largest project, managing his mattress up the winding stair, had taken the better part of two hours, and proven quite exhausting for the old fellow.

But, at last, Harold found himself snuggling deeply into his old bed right in the middle of his new room at the top of his new house.

It was surely the best moment of Harold's life thus far.

The room was thrown into stark relief as a flash of lightning announced the coming of an evening gale.

Harold's warm comfort slowly faded as a host of unfamiliar creaks and cracks sounded from deep within the suddenly foreign walls of his new abode.

The night grew darker as the rains seemed to wash away all evidence of the city surrounding him. Lights dulled and noises lost in the din of patter on the ancient ceilings.

Harold cried out in surprise when a drop of water suddenly fell upon his forehead. Laughing at himself and noting to call back the man he'd hired to inspect the roof, Harold got up and flitted downstairs to find a pot in which to catch the intruding water.

Gliding down the stairs, hand carefully feeling his way down the banister, Harold headed to the kitchen to find the box containing his cookware.

Entering the kitchen he placed his hand onto the switch and gave it a quick flip. Nothing. Flipping the switch up and down, Harold emitted a somewhat unpleasant noise from somewhere between his throat and his sense of decency. Apparently a call to the electrician as well. Adding in the first inspector that stopped returning his calls, and that made for three that had apparently accepted money for a job unfinished. He wondered briefly if there was a local union or board of any kind, and if so, whether it had any standards whatsoever. Disgraceful.

Harold went into the bathroom, where the fusebox sat tucked inside the closet ( it had previously been outside before the bathroom was added in the 1920's ). Reaching inside he

Harold felt something quiet alive.

Yelling out a startled yelp, Harold stumbled back and found his knees buckling as they came into contact with the side of the tub. Harold's head took a nasty crack as he fell in. Panicking but disoriented, Harold tried to find purchase to pull himself back up from the tub. A long series of lightning flashes illuminated the bathroom around him.

From the faucet and drain of the sink and tub, a stream of cockroaches was pouring into Harold's home. With a speed Harold would not have suspected he had, he threw himself up from the tub basin, and turned just in time for the storm's light to fade as he spied the rats pouring out of the bathroom closet.

Harold sprinted out from the little bathroom, across the sulferous smelling kitchen, up a flight of stairs that seemed to dodge and wriggle, and Harold dove into his bed, into a pool of water that had collected there.

No. Water wasn't this thick. A single flash revealed the pooling blood dribbling in from the ceiling.

Harold started back only to find a wall of smoke ambling up the stair, the sulfurous smell now redoubled and accompanied with a most unpleasant flickering of light and shadow.

Trapped.

Harold raced to the patio doors, but found them quite unwilling to budge. Behind him, the blood ignited in hellish fury.

*""Ugh. Blood doesn't even burn.""*

A girls voice.

*""No. No no no no no. You said you wouldn't interfere.""*

A man. The voice ancient. Exasperated.

*""Yeah. But I didn't know you'd make blood burn. That's so stupid.""*

*""No one asked you if you thought it was stupid""*

*""Maybe you should have""*

*""I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU THINK IS STUPID""*

*""Psht. Whatever.""*

*""YES. WHAT. EVER. AS YOU FOREVER INSIST ON BRAYING""*

*""k""*

*""ARRRGGGHG""*

""Um, excuse me?"" Harold ventured.

**""WHAT?!""**

*""Wow. Kill the poor guy why don't you?""*

*""I was trying until you""*

*""Yeah, that worked out""*

*""Don't interrupt me when I""*

*""dhunt interup meh whun I""*

*""AAAAAAEEEEEIIIIII""*

*""wow. whatever""*

*""I WISH I COULD KILL YOU""*

*""uh, duh. you did""*

*""WELL I WISH I HADN'T. OR COULD AGAIN. OR WHATEv-- AAAAAIIIIIIIIEIEIEEI  AAAAAAAAIIIEIEIEIE AAAAAAAAIEIEIEEI""*

Harold sneaked quietly down the now decidedly less fiery staircase, mentally adding to the morrow's to do list the purchase of a high quality sleeping mask.

It really was a lovely home.",knome
[WP] The bad news: your house is haunted. The worse news: it’s the ghost of an emo teenager.,adlaiking,"The worst news? My daughter idolizes it.

Oh don't worry, the ghost isn't a monster, it's not giving an eight-year-old girl an existential crisis or telling her to self-harm. No, it's just turning her into the most annoying child to ever exist.

""Mommy mommy I want long hair just like Kelly!"" Sweetie, you already run into everything without having ninety percent of your vision obscured by bangs the size of Sequoyas. 

""Mommy can I have all black clothes just like Kelly pleaase?!"" Honey, your favorite colors are orange and green and you scrunch up your nose whenever I put on my black dress. Also you whine that denim is 'scratchy' and 'gross' and Kelly's entire lower half wardrobe seemed to be denim. 

""Mom Kelly has pictures of birds on her arms I want those too!"" Darling, those are tattoos. No.

""Mommy mommy mom what if *my* name was Kelly?!"" Olivia, you're named after your grandmother, one of the bravest women I've ever met, not after an emo ghost. Not to mention you still struggle to pronounce the letter K in some words. How is that even possible? Is my daughter a linguistic wonder? Should I donate her to the Smithsonian? 

Kelly, of course, didn't decided to help a struggling mother out, instead just sighing softly and staring into the heavens as Olivia ran around screaming and worshiping her. And I, the struggling mother, obviously bottled up my anger for six days until I finally dropped my favorite coffee mug - yes, it shattered everywhere - and proceeded to have a two minute and twenty seven second mental collapse.

Luckily, Olivia was still at school. Unluckily, my neighbor was walking his banana-sized dog, so I'd probably receive a noise complaint from the HOA later that day.

That was a problem for later. My primary concern was tracking down Kelly.

She didn't grant me the courtesy of wailing or slamming doors or fading in and out of vision. Instead, she curled up in the attack, sadly studying a snowglobe, which is why it took me the better part of an hour to find her.

""Hey Kelly,"" I softly said, wriggling forward, already struggling not to sneeze.

""Mmm,"" she grunted in reply.

""How are you? You like it up here?""

""Eh.""

""Anything new happening in ghost world?""

""Alexander the Great dunked on Michael Jordan the other day.""

""...Michael Jordan is dead?""

""No. I made that up. I don't know what goes in ghost world. I'm here. Stuck in this house.""

My expression softened. At least, I think it did. I *really* wanted to sneeze. But that would blow Kelly away and maybe blow the house down with how much dust there was up here.

""Is there anything I could do to help?"" I asked.

""You could shake the snowglobe.""

I reached out gingerly and gave it a few good shakes. ""I did mean about you being stuck in the house.""

""I know. You can't help.""

I nodded sadly.

""Well... It's not that you can't. It's just that it would be dangerous.""

I blinked. ""I... I can handle it. Will Olivia be in danger?""

""Of losing her mother. Really want to get rid of me that badly?""

""No! Well... A little. But also Olivia likes you and I think you're a nice girl and I want to help you out. You shouldn't be stuck somewhere you don't want to be.""

She tilted her head. ""If I was alive would you tell me I shouldn't be stuck somewhere I don't want to be?""

""Oh, come on, that's different, I... I...""

""Alright. Fine. You can help. Here's what we need...""

---

A few weeks later, everything was finally ready. Olivia, now obsessed with Kelly's black nail polish, was safe and sound at grandmother's house. The dinner table was temporarily dragged into the living room, allowing me to paint a large pentagram on the hardwood floor. I had managed to track down all the items on Kelly's bizarre shopping list: seven flamingo feathers, seven coconuts, three tiki torches, a watermelon, the skin of a hydrophiinae, and a handful of Spanish doubloons.      

Procuring these items was a series of adventures in itself, but that was probably a story for another time. For now, I got ready to light the tiki torches as I turned to the worriedly hovering Kelly.

""You still haven't told me what exactly we're doing.""

""You'd ditch me if you knew.""

""Wow, no faith in me, huh? Come on, I drew the pentagram, I'm clearly doing some crazy ritual to banish you back to the-""

""You're summoning the eight thousand year old sea demon that tricked me into becoming a ghost and exists solely for the purpose of tormenting humans.""

I gulped. Suddenly my cozy little kitchen seemed just a bit darker. Shaking my head, I struck a match and lit the first torch. ""I made a promise, Kelly.""

She didn't reply, but I liked to think she was impressed with my courage. I know I was. Also horrified. What had gotten into me? 

I slowly walked around the pentagram, lighting the second and third torches, then stepped back to join the ghost. For an awkward moment, nothing happened.

The flames in the torches suddenly glowed a dark blue and shot towards the ceiling with a loud bang. The carefully arranged items spun up into a tornado, blurring and almost fusing into a cocktail of sorts. Noxious black smoke spiraled out of the pentagram - and out of said smoke spiraled a noxious sea demon.

His lower half was that of a glimmering serpent, his upper half human, bare-chested, and awfully muscular. He had a long black mustache and a longer curly beard. ""HELLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLO MISSISSIPI!"" he roared. 

I leaned back, coughing, waving my hand furiously. Hopefully the smoke alarm wouldn't go off.

""Still not Mississippi,"" Kelly calmly said. 

""No?! What a SHAME! One day I'll say that and it WILL be Mississippi!""

""I can't wait.""

""Say, girl, have we met? Are you that gullible chick I turned into a ghost?""

""Yes,"" I managed to interject, ""and we're gonna fix that.""

""Is that your wish?!"" the demon exclaimed, theatrically spinning towards me. ""I don't believe I got your name?""

""It doesn't matter."" My knowledge of demons was pretty limited - nonexistent, to be honest - but I knew giving my name to strangers wasn't a good move even if they didn't have phenomenal cosmic powers. ""What does matter is you helping Kelly get to the afterlife.""

""Get her to the afterlife?! Well if that's all you want then-""

""The *real* afterlife,"" Kelly snapped. ""Not as a ghost!""

""Oh boo hoo you should have been more specific sweetie! It's not my fault you can't make proper-""  

""Stop! Both of you be quiet!"" I yelled. Apparently sea demons respect the mom voice too, for he actually shut up. ""You know what we want. What do we need to do to make it happen?""

The demon ballooned its eyes to the size of coconuts - which, along with all the other ingredients, it had sucked up - then spun around a few times thoughtfully.

""Alright girl, I can see you're all business,"" the creature said. ""And I was in the middle of the mid-Pacific mermaid beauty pageant so I want to get out of your hair. So here's what we'll do: I send Kelly to the real afterlife and you'll owe me a favor. A reasonable, doable favor that won't put you in danger. No lies, no tricks. What do you say?""

I studied the demon. He gave me a quick smile. His torso-smoke curled impatiently. He started flexing for no apparent reason.

I turned towards Kelly. ""What do you think?"" I whispered. The demon plugged his ears. Knowing him, it probably made him hear better.

""Trusting the demon got me in this situation. What could go wrong?""

She clearly thought it was a bad idea - but clearly wanted me to accept. The demon was clearly untrustworthy - and also wanted me to accept. What could go wrong indeed.

""My daughter will not be involved in this favor.""

""No, of course not! I'm not a monster!""

""Yeah, you're a demon.""

""Technically not the same thing!"" 

I sighed. The demon grinned... demonically. No other way to describe it, I promise. Kelly smiled hopefully.

""What the hell - I'll do it.""

""YESSS!"" the demon roared. ""ONE AFTERLIFE COMING RIGHT UP!"" 

Kelly managed to mouth a thanks before she disappeared into the void. The sea demon gave me a cheeky thumbs up and vanished with another bright flash and pillar of smoke.

Just like that, everyone was gone. Just me and a hastily drawn pentacle and an ominous favor was already settling itself as a wight on my shoulders. Oh, and this time the smoke alarm *did* go off.   ",ChessClue

"[WP] Aliens have their own version of Animal Planet. In a special documentary episode, a human is chosen to be the focus of narration.",avienblue,"In this special documentary short, we turn our attention to one of the most frightening species in our entire galaxy. 

Homo sapiens, the humans of the planet Gaia, appeared somewhere between 200.000 and 300.000 solar years ago. Innocuous in appearence, this bipedal, omnivorous mammal has proven itself to be one of the most deadly creatures we have ever come across. Unlike most known apex predators, they lack both fang and claws, are of average intelligence and are in general physically unintimidating. But don't let their appearences fool you, they are the perfect pursuit hunters.

Humans been known to run distances as far as 500 sarpecs in pursuit of animals often much larger than themselves. They can go many solar days with little to no sleep, tirelessly tracking down prey until whatever they are hunting simply drops from exhaustion at their feet. They are completely unmatched in stamina.

Seeing as it is impossible to outrun a human over long distances, many biologists hypothesized that perhaps other animals of the planet Gaia could simply escape to areas inaccessible to humans. Imagine their surprise when it was discovered that humans can climb both trees and mountains, swim vast distances and survive in practically any climate and in any enviroment. Humans have been observed prospering in dense jungles, icy tundras and scorching deserts alike. They have survived ice ages, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, thunderstorms and tornados. No manner of extreme climate seems to intimidate them, no enviroment seems to slow them down. This is why no other animal on the planet Gaia is completely safe from human attack and why many other species have been hunted to extinction.

Not only do humans break records in versatility and stamina, they also break records in sheer durability. They inhabit a planet infested  with a number of exotic diseases, illnesses that could easily wipe out entire eco-systems. As a result of this, all organisms on the planet Gaia have developed extremely efficient immune systems, capable of withstanding all manner of sickness, but even by Gaia-standards, the immunological resilience of humans is remarkable. They have even been observed to survive cancer.

Aside from being, by galactic standard, seeminly impervious to attacks from microorganisms, humans also recover swiftly from physical trauma. A human may break several bones throughout its lifetime and those bones simply grow back stronger than before. There have been cases of humans being stabbed, bitten, clawed and beaten by other animals literally twice their size and yet they have survived. In some cases humans have lost entire limbs and STILL managed to bring down a physically stronger and larger opponent. As terrifying as it sounds, the loss of an arm or leg won't necessarily kill a human.

Thoughout this series we have seen everything from the gigantic phelants of Fricana to the ferocious griters of Biseria, each creature more deadly than the next. This is why we have decided to conclude our series with what is in our opinion the most dangerous animal in the entire galaxy. You may say that humans are no match against the strength of an orgilla, the speed of a theecha or the intelligence of a dacamenic and you may be right. But an orgilla grows tired, a theecha cannot take much injury and a dacamenic hasn't the stamina, the sheer willpower it takes, to keep up with a human.

Of course, we are all intimidated by size and strength, sharp teeth and obvious deadliness, but imagine this for a moment. Imagine fleeing from a creature that doesn't seem to get tired, sick or injured. A creature, harmless enough in appearance, but nonetheless a creature you can't seem to kill. A creature you can't for the life of you get rid of. A creature that keeps coming after you, no matter how far you run, no matter where you are, no matter where you hide. You might be stronger, faster, smarter even, it won't matter. This creature will keep finding you, it will keep surviving and it will keep coming after you. You know, that no matter what you do, nothing and no one can save you now. You will start to panic, desperately doing whatever it takes to get away, but no matter how much you try, it's all to no avail. Eventually, your muscles will fail you and you will collapse. You will struggle to even keep your eyes open, as you see this creature, gradually getting closer and closer. Finally, when it stands there, towering above you, you close your eyes for the last time and happily accept your fate. At least in death, and only in death, you can finally be free of this demonic animal. Such ends the life of a humans prey, proving, once and for all, that nothing is more petrifying than a human of Gaia.

""This week on Xenoplanet, you the viewers have voted for some insight towards the species known as 'Humans'. Our lead biologist, Dr Tyy'argo Glhptn, was brave enough to venture there and give us this exclusive peak at their world. Please welcome him, live from Earth.""

Camera fades; Dr Glhptn is inside a spherical cloaking device being filmed and talking about what he is observing. Light music plays in background.

""Thank you for joining me here today on Earth, home world of the Human species. I'm joined today by cameraman Hy'rra Frtpn...""

Camera turns around to gain portrait of cameraman.

""...so far we've seen tons of action. Little ones, big ones, amazing variety. Right now we are sitting among a group of them, our cloaking device has made them oblivious to our presence...""

Camera pans to a group of humans congregating around a series of tubes and pipes; little humans are making shrill sounds and jumping on and off the pipes. The larger humans stayed near the side and watched.

""...this allows us to view them in their natural state. The sounds that these little ones are making... it's... horrible. Frtpn are you getting this? The larger ones don't seem to mind the noise however, quite strange. Now I assume that... wow look at that!""

The host grabbed the camera and swung it around to centre on two humans walking with some kind of hairy, four legged beast attached to a restraint of sorts.

""...Frtpn. This is amazing, they keep lesser species as... slaves. These humans are getting more and more fascinating. Let's follow them and see where this goes.""

He waved the cameraman on and the camera shakily followed, still contained within the cloaking sphere. The two followed these humans for quite sometime, barely saying a word and just observing. The two humans eventually stopped on edge of some kind of basic stone strip. Metal transportation units zipped back and forth just on the otherside of this walkway. 

""These two seem to have no fear of the transportation units. The fear response in this species seems to be fairly dulled. I'm sure evolutionary cooperation led to them having a lack of...""

The two humans screamed and their furry companion started to bark. The camera zoomed in on the situation. Another human appeared from the side of the frame holding some kind of device in his hand.

""Oh wow! This species just continues to surprise. It appears that these two are in some kind of trouble. They look like... yes, they are giving the other human something. It's hard to make out from here. What is that? Look over there!""

The good doctor was pointing a transportation unit that was sporting a series of flashing lights and roaring with a high pitch whine. Two more humans entered scene by exiting the transportation unit.

""Frtpn toy getting this? It looks like the two humans that exited the transport are yelling at the human who approached the ones we followed... this is getting exciting viewers. It looks like... yes... the human is running and the other two are chasing. We should probably get out of here Frtpn, remember those Prazzax on Bol IV? I don't need that again.""

Camera pans down, shots of stone turn into soil and then green vegetation. Running stops, camera raises to meet the face of host.

""Now we are surrounded by large brown rods of vegetation. Frtpn can you look up for a moment? Thanks. See all of that green? That's the most I've seen since getting here.""

Camera comes back down.

""Most of the structures we have seen are built of grey stone blocks or rocks of some kind anyway. Quite primitive to be honest. I'm not thinking this species will be joining the Galactic...""

""UNDECIPHERABLE""

""Shit. Shit. One of them just ran into our sphere. We gotta go. Uh, thanks for joining us on Earth for this week of Xenoplanet. I'm Dr Glhptn, have a good... aaahhhhh!""

Camera rolls around violently and then goes black.

""It... appears we have had a technical malfunction...""
Silence.
""..Earth is far away after all!""

Host of Xenoplanet laughs nervously and then coughs.

""Come back next week when we go to Yhardop and visit the mysterious nomadic Yhardopians.""

""How quickly?"" asked Admiral Pend.

""Too quickly for them to stay frozen, and their rising from the *inside*. Probably about twelve hours before we get significantly higher tides.""

""The poles we've gotten fresh water from? The same poles we've used to terraform some of this planet to our liking, and the same poles that would flood many of the human posts if they melted? Those poles?""

Colonel Meryl stayed firm, ""Yes, sir. What do you advise?"" 

""What's the report on the Ancient Catacombs?""

When he got no immediate response he shifted his gaze to his Colonel. Her eyes met his, then fell to her hands. A holoscreen popped into view from her suit, floating in front of them. She read aloud, ""Reports are indicating that the activity within, that began 47 years ago, has fluctuated in sync with the activity underneath the ice caps. However our tech is consistently showing the ""energies--"" 

""Energies?"" the Admiral asked quizzically. 

""It says, as the chief scientist puts it: 'the only way to describe how these waves are acting'. Wow. Anyway, the energies are vastly different from each other.""

""Different? How?""


""They oppose each other."" She said with wonder.


""What? What do you mean? Surely the notes themselves can't be that cryptic."" He reached. 

""Not in the sense of conflict, more like the sides of a magnet.""

The Admiral swallowed and approached the hovering document, peering over it himself. His peppered stuble scratched against his calloused hands as he rubbed it in thought. He had only been to the site once, the Catacombs, but even then he felt off put by the place. Admittedly, after thorough recollection, because he felt it calling to him. The stones of the great statues reverberated, not from the echoes of his boots, but from the unseen crevices of the ruins. Thousands of years of dust and debris filled his nose, but it didn't induce a cough or choke. It was invigorating. His blood rushed and adrenaline rose.
 
          He never told the colonol the full story of his one-time journey beneath the Mars surface, into the depths. He never mentioned his feelings, his desires there, and especially the pitch black hallway he eventually came to that made him cower and turn away. 

He stormed to the wall where he waved his hand and panels opened up to his command. Within it, a thick belt about a foot and a half wide appeared, displayed on a metal rack. He snatchedit up and clicked it around his waist. The belt un-pieced itself apart, covering him down to his boots which it connected to like perfect puzzle pieces, sealing air tight. It continued up, arouned his neck, unfolding and refolding until his head was protected by his armor. 

He squeezed his hand into fists, testing the systems. The lights shined off what appeared at first glance black armor, but when the light hit it just right, it showed off a deep, midnight blue. 

""We're going to the caps. We need answers. We need to do something, quickly.""

The colonel stood abruptly, in full salute, ""With all due respect, sir, I can't let you do that.""

Slightly annoyed, but more intrigued, ""Why, soldier?"" 

""Because you and I both know you won't find answers there. I agree we have to do something, but that's not the place.""

He continued to arm himself with plasma weapons, singularity grenades, and plenty of close combat tools, ""Then where are we going?!"" 

""Admiral?"" she aksed in concern. Nothing would stop him from battle preparation. The only time she remembered seeing him close this flustered was when he forgot her at the starport. But, this was different. This *felt* different. And there was no need to ready for a fight, but he seemed driven. Possessed. Likehe knew something she didn't.

""Admiral!""

He stopped stone cold, like a magician put him to sleep and snapped his fingers to wake him. He relucutanly placed a grenade he clutched in his hand back onto the rack. ""I...don't know what that...what I was doing. I got ahead of myself there.""

She knew the feeling. She felt it her whole life, the pulses of power; a link to the very nature and beings, not of just Mars, but the universe. And this sensation grew only as the powers rose in the Catacombs. Then, the caps began to react and she felt the universe make a shift. A great, but terrible one-eighty. Not a day goes she can recall where she didn't think about the Catacombs, but her whole career she only visited a handful of times. Something yanked at her, though, and she saw a reflection of herself in the Admiral--the unrelenting need to fight. But what? 

She always kept these feelings buried deep where they thrashed to be released. She moved to the wall and equipped herself with her own sapphire b belt, and it followed the same as the Admiral's, piecing itself together around her, ""I'm following you, wherever you go."" 

He stepped up to the control panel of his personal quarters, and spoke into his pearly white console. His voice blared over the loudspeakers, talking to his whole fleet, ""Ready your ships, we're heading across the globe to the pole activity. It has increased and is advised for military support."" 

Right when he gave the order, a twinge stung at the base of his skull. But why? Why was it the wrong decision?

The colonel placed a hand on his back, ""Are you sure about this?"" Knowing herself the right path lie elsewhere, or perhaps it was her selfish mind and wanting to quell her need to feel the Catacombs with her own fingertips. 

                                             ■

The ships cast shadows over the ice caps, like black spots on the back of a white wolf. The military perimeter built years ago when activity started lay miles away from the epicenter of activity. It consisted mostly of barracks and science labs, but now siege towers sprang up around behind them, their turrents and cannons, all armed. More of them crashed down into the ice from the sky, their metallic roots taking hold deep within. 

The colonel's hairs shot up on her neck, ""Sir, the activity has spread. Most of it is right under them. What do you advise?"" 

Just as the admiral started to bark orders, the scanners beeped and buzzed around them within the large control room. Many of the others in the room hummed to each other. The Admiral's First Lieutenant spoke, ""Sir, scanners are picking something up below us, about five hundred years from the perimeter."" 

""And, what is it? Well?!""

""It's um...well just look for yourself."" 

The Lieutenant swiped the screen and it slid in the air across the room. The Admiral caught it and his brow furled at the image. A person, clad in a space suit unlike any the admiral came across in all his years. Pointed at the pauldrons, spikes along the elbows, and a helmet with a darkened, sharp face. Even more odd, it looked metallic, like whoever wore it took it from old ship scraps they found floating in orbit. 

""Zoom in. Further. There!"" He pointed. The person seemed to know it was being watched and looked directly into the drones's camera. The Admiral dropped to one knee once he locked eyes with the the dark spaces between the person's suit where eyes should be, wailing in pain.

The Colonel rushed to his side, knelt next to him and braced his shoulders as he stood, wobbling. The crew looked on, with concern but continued to work diligently. She escorted to him to his seat crouching to eye level. 

""What the hell?! Are you okay, sir?""

""Yeah, I think."" He said rubbing his temples. 

""Sir, he seems to be pulling something off of his back. It looks like a....sword."" Another crew member chimed.

""A what?""

While everyone gazed upon the room-sized holoscreen as the metal-clad person rose the sword above its head, the Colonel caught a glimpse of an onlooker through the auxiliary hall to the hull. He wore an old, tattered, black robe with a hood cloaking his face in darkness. Standing against his sleek white backdrop, immaculate floors, digital surfaces, and robots buzzing around, he looked he belonged in the huts from Earth's indigenous ancient people. The man beckoned her to follow him and he vanished down the hallway. 

Mesmerized, almost like he hooked a line to her belt, she watched one foot fall in front of the other and before she knew it, her boots hit against the hallway in a sprint after him. 

The Admiral, nor anyone else noticed the Colonel's departure, fixated on the surface below. A voice cracked over the intercom, coming from the being. It pointed the tip of its sword directly at the drone, through the will of the Admiral, ""You all have no idea where you come from. What your true history is. What your true fate is. You call *this* tech worthy of me? Of my army? You haven't even begun to tap into tech, and you have yet to see it's true opposition. But, this time our side will not let our guard down like last time. This time I will waste no time in conquering Mars and now Earth where we *all* tried to flee. Let the war begin again."" 

He struck his sword on the ice. It cracked undernearth the blow, but spread impossibly wide, and the crack shot toward the perimeter at a blistering speed. The ice melted into it, and what appeared to the Admiral as molten rock. It quickly reached a group of the first buildings and siege towers, but they merely collapsed into the firey crevice.

Horror zapped the Admiral, but he reacted as quickly as his new advisary, ""All ships, fire down on it! Now, now, now!""

By the time the order was given, the sword-wielding psycho hit the ice two more times. The fissures ran parallel to each other and quickly merged into one, gigantic hole of magma, swallowing the the rest of the perimeter. 

The fleet rained down onto the being....

"[WP] A man attempts to rob a bank, but himself and everyone present are completely unaware that every other person in the room has super powers.",doug11143,"""Nobody *fucking* move.""

The robber - ski mask, late twenties - holds a pistol shakily against a small crowd of people huddled against the glass of a teller's counter. He has eyes in the back of his head, so to speak, and struggles to split focus between what he can see in front of him and what could be approaching from behind.

The crowd is eleven people, four of which are preparing to use their powers. Of the seven resigning themselves to let this slide, four aren't confident enough to engage their powers in public, two would be all but useless in these surroundings, and one is refraining from levelling the surrounding block in retaliation. Still four are preparing.

A bald man, maybe fifties, is staring down ski-mask thinking of how best to close the gap between them. One punch is all it would take, he could tank a bullet or even two, but if he doesn't neutralise the situation in that minute burst he'll be left panting in the way of a bullet.

An elderly woman is trying her best to slow the gunman down. Literally. Starting off slowly, his hands steady slightly as time around him begins to ebb to a halt - until a shot is fired, flakes falling from the ceiling after it, and her concentration is lost.

The woman's granddaughter takes her eyes off of ski-mask to see to her startled relative, she could get behind him - but there two second delay between her disappearance into a burst of black smoke, and reappearance a few feet away would be enough time for ski-mask to turn things sour. All he'd have to do is jump to a side, find a way to get out of her arms reach and she'd be a fish in a barrel for another five seconds before she could move herself out of harm's way. Five seconds is a lot of time when you're looking at a pistol.

I'm somewhere in the back, the knees of my cheap suit collecting dirt on the floor as I crouch behind the rest of the hostages; leaping from mind to mind, trying to figure out how exactly we're going to get out of this stroke of back luck intact. 

""I don't want any goddamn funny business. Sit down and shut the fuck up.""

Bald man looks at me expectantly.

I send to him.

"[WP] Humans finally invent a spaceship that can travel faster than light. The first time the spaceship travels past light speed, they are stopped by the Universal Traffic Police.",gordorkkk,"""You have to be kidding me...""  A small window appeared on the HUD near the bottom left corner, James took a look at all of the other gauges and shook his head slightly.  ""Unbelievable.""

""What is it?""  The co-pilot asked sharply, a slight bit of concern in his voice.  He leaned over to attempt to see what James could see on the screen.

""It looks like a cop car or something.  Blue and red lights alternating.""  Now a message appeared at the bottom of the HUD in bright red.

STOP IMMEDIATELY - UTP

""UTP?  What is that?""  James looked around the HUD again to check for some sort of indication that this was a joke from Houston.  Nothing.  Everything appeared normal.  ""We're not even that far off.  I guess we're gonna have to emergency stop.""

Eric, the co-pilot, frowned angrily, his voice raising in protest.  ""Emergency stop?  We don't even know what this is?!""  He'd reach down to start tapping buttons on his own console, grumbling.  ""Our first successful flight and we're going to emergency stop because of a joke.""

""Better to be safe than sorry.  Full stop.""  James pulled the throttle completely back, tapping a couple other buttons.  The ship fell out of light speed, then slowly floated to a halt.  Metal creaking and whining coming from the rear of the ship, indicating the stress that the flight had on the materials.

The small window that had the blue and red lights now showed an alien face instead, the creature obviously leaning closer to the camera to exaggerate its features.  It had what looked like two eyes, no nose, no mouth, and two small dots near the top of its head spread equally as far as its eyes.  A loud gurgling noise came through over the radio, James and Eric both looked at each other in disbelief.

""We can't understand you!""  James yelled into his headset, throwing both hands up and shaking his head slightly.  ""Whatever it is you're saying we don't understand!""  He'd shake his hands in front of himself in view of the camera as if waving off the creature.  The gurgling stopped.

After a few moments the creature spoke again.  ""Can you understand me?""  James and Eric both nodded slowly, indicating they understood but were shocked that the creature instantly went from gurgling to speaking English.  ""Great.  You mind if I ask what you're doing all the way out here?""

""I...we...wait, what?""  James was having a bit of a hard time processing the question, for obvious reasons.

""I said what are you doing out here.  You just said you understood me.  Let me say it again.  What.  Are.  You.  Doing.  Out.  Here?""  While speaking the alien waved its tentacles in front of its face, sarcasm implied by the behavior.

James looked to Eric, ""Jesus.""  Then back at the monitor.  ""Are you supposed to be a cop?""

""UTP stands for Universal Traffic Police.  We monitor the speed and behavior of travel within open space.""

""I'm not even on earth and I get pulled over for DWB.""  A slight head shake from James.

""DWB?  Are you implying we stopped your ship because of your skin color?""

James raised both eyebrows, his shoulders, and threw his hands outward, palms raised slightly.

The alien now moved even closer to its camera, ""We stopped you because you were traveling faster than light.  Its not safe.  There are signals out here that tell you that until you're out of your own local solar system its never safe to travel at that speed.""  Its face looked downward, a few slight tapping noises were heard.  ""I didn't think humans were capable of light speed.  Is this your first time out here?""

Eric piped up, ""Yes this is our first light, or apparently faster than light, speed flight.  We're not out here to cause trouble or anything.  Can't you just let us off with a warning or something?""

The alien's gaze immediately turned to Eric, ""I wasn't talking to you.""  That shot back was as if it anticipated a protest at some point from the co-pilot.  ""Keep it at light speed.  Anything above that and we're going to have to impound your ship and take you in.""

""Got it.""

The small screen with the alien's face disappeared, the HUD returning to what it appeared to be as before.  A few moments later James and Eric could see the a ship much smaller than theirs floating past for a few moments, and without warning it disappeared in a blink.",Gezzek
"[WP] Humans finally invent a spaceship that can travel faster than light. The first time the spaceship travels past light speed, they are stopped by the Universal Traffic Police.",gordorkkk,"""Do you know how fast you were going?""  The alien, who seemed to be an officer, knocked on the window as he spoke.

""What?"" The humans asked.

""Do you know how fast you were going? The alien asked again.

""We... do not know what you mean?"" The humans were clearly confused.

The aliens clearly face palmed.

""Do, you, know, how, fast, were, you, going?"" He now phrased it.

""I mean, we were going at 1.2 c."" The humans answered.
  
""No you didn't. My quantum tracker clearly showed you were going at exactly 27.83173211313 c, which is clearly over ten times above the limit."" The alien showed the number on the scanner.

""What? And here we thought our equipment were precise!"" One of the humans shouted.

""Well, tough luck. I'm going to have to get this vehicle back to the nearest station."" The alien said while writing a ticket. ""You'll have to compensate for 8128 glörgols.""

The humans were still confused. ""We don't have any money!""

""Tell your excuse in the court. Now, can I get the name of your species?""

""It's humans.""

""Hyumans... we do not have any records of that species. Are you lying to us?"" The alien stared at the humans.

""No, we aren't! Our species just achieved space travel for goodness sake!"" The humans shouted.

""Now, now-"" One of the humans tried to shoot the alien with a railgun but it missed.

The alien took his radiophone quickly off his pocket: ""This is Xlsa-72 Omg, I am under fire, i repeat, I am under fire!""

Within ten seconds, a fleet of ships arrived and started shooting at the ships.

"[WP] Everyone knew Marcus was the Chosen One. Everyone expected a lot from him. The prophecies all said he’d do great things. Naturally, everyone was surprised when he fell off a cliff to his death during a training exercise.",hoppyboys,"""Well... *shit.*""

I turned to Lao Zheng, his bushy white eyebrows arched in frozen shock. He had been in the middle of stroking his long beard, the very essence of the wise master. Me? I just hold the scroll. I'm sure you've seen me around the temple, standing just to the right and behind of Master Zheng, keeping meticulous notes to make sure the old man stayed on schedule. After all, training Chosen One's certainly requires a lot of paperwork. 

I remember when Marcus first arrived at our temple. It was shocking, actually, considering he looked like he stepped off the cover of *Tiger Beat*. All boyish good looks, long blonde hair, leather jacket, and a red headband for some reason. It caused quite a stir, matching the description of one of our fabled ""Chosen Ones"" almost exactly. Master Zheng started to train him personally, much to the chagrin of the other warrior monks. 

Now I'll be the first to admit, he took to training like a natural. All Marcus needed was some pumped-up music playing from the boombox he brought, and he was good to go. Every time I glanced up from my scrolls, he was doing some other workout. Pushups, situps, chinups, all sorts, all to the beat of his strange music. Hushed whispers came from the assembled monks.

""He has mastered the art of montage, and at such a young age,"" whispered Disciple Han. 

Master Zheng would just stroke his beard, nod sagely, before having one of us wash his clothes. ""All part of your training,"" he would say. Prick. But Marcus was always pleasant to be around. Despite his prowess, he remained humble, happy to dispense tales of the magical place he called ""Miami."" 

His skills soon began to compare to even Master Zheng. The excitement was palpable. Marcus was our Chosen One, destined to champion our temple, and triumph against the evil forces that always lingered. Crime lords, wannabe shoguns, rival martial arts schools. None would stand in his way. Which made this shock even worse.

Master Zheng and I had been watching him as he went out onto our sacred cliffs, perfectly poised on the stone pedestal. Quickly, he struck a series of martial arts poses, silhouetted against the setting sun. His ever present boombox was there, playing triumphantly. We watched quietly as he reached his penultimate form. Planting one foot solidly on the ground, he raised the other, lifting his arms above his head, letting his hands droop down. A perfect crane.

Then he fell. A gust of wind buffeted him, knocking him off the stone pedestal. He tried to catch himself, by my ancestors he tried, but Master Zheng and I could only watch in horror as he tumbled over the side of the cliff. 

Master Zheng sprinted over to the pedestal. ""Perhaps he has managed to catch himself, hanging by one hand from one of the many roots!"" 

I followed close behind, scroll flapping behind me as I ran. We reached the edge together, and looked over the side. He had not, as Master Zheng had hoped, caught himself dramatically on a root. Not even close. Zheng sighed and closed his eyes, stroking his long beard. It wasn't a pretty sight, and out of good taste I refrained from writing it down. 

""Well... now what, Master?"" I asked tentatively. He stood in deep thought for a moment. 

""I suppose we shall have to put our faith into another,"" he said finally.

""Shall I consult the list?"" I asked.

""Yes... Please do,"" he said, and turned back towards his dojo.

I myself headed to our temple's library and dug through its scrolls until I found what I was looking for. I quickly edited it, ever the dutiful scribe, before rolling it out in its entirety.

His walk home was thankfully not a long one. He turned the collar up on his tweed jacket and pulled his hat down a bit to cut off the draft that immediately found its way to his bones.

Thank the bloody moon, he might actually get some rest this evening if she’d already gone turned in. No amount of ale ever prepared him for the nights she was awake when he came home. He’d started coming home later to avoid her altogether but that didn’t really solve anything accept to perhaps assuage his guilt for one more night. As was tradition on the walk home he’d thought about her from the before time and fantasized about a different life. 

Ever nervous the crick in the door would betray him, he cautiously pushed open the front door and began removing his winter over clothes. Not entirely ready to retire for the evening he made his way to the cellar where there was a makeshift bar with a few bottles of whiskey that needed drinking. If he could make his way to the bottom of just one bottle before sleep crept in he knew he could sleep until dawn. 

The cellar was a place of refuge. The light from the lone candle didn’t quite reach three of the walls and it gave a feeling of calm inside the emptiness of his life. As if he only need to take that first step towards the darkness to end what he had become. Somehow not taking that step kept him going for just one more day. There was a smell of earth here. Old earth. Dirt that hadn’t been tended to and had been denied the nutrients given from things that grow. Mice and rats and even worms stayed away from this place as if there wasn’t even anything that vermin and wriggly things could appreciate. Hank loved his cellar spot. There was nothing here but a few boards propped up and a three legged chair and it was in this place that Hank could, for a time, forget. 

As it does, morning regrettably came and Hank looked up from his makeshift bar in his old earth cellar. He could feel the grain of the wood from the bar imprinted on his face. How long had that alarm been committing attempted murder on his ears and where was that bloody candle? For the fourth night in a row he’d fallen asleep in his chair, a feat not too easy if you ask anyone that’s tried to greet the Sandman from a three legged chair. This time of year always did seem to feel more grim. Perhaps he’d ask Randy from work if he’d like a round of darts at The Grazing Cattle tonight. That should take his mind from darker places and set him into a better mood. He always did like a close game and Randy had been bragging a bit on how he’d improved since that last time they had a go at it. Yes, it was decided. Hank spit into the sink and set his toothbrush into its little cup, washed his face up a bit, grabbed his coat and hat, and made for the bakery round the corner for a bit of breakfast before work. 

Hank wouldn’t’ve been able to explain it if you’d asked him but today felt different. The prospect of asking a friend to accompany him to his nightly spot put an extra touch of lift in his step. He couldn’t wait to see the look on that old sour snatch, Jeb when he turned up with a friend in tow. He’d call out, “see this here Jeb! I do in fact know people other than the cranks that work in this place”. HA! The idea of it made him positively joyful. Today was a different kind of day indeed. 

Nearing the end of an average lunch break, Randy came in to start his own break. Hank waited until he’d sat and had taken a bite before gutting up and asking him if he’d come out tonight. He felt nervous. As if something important hung in the balance and would sway one way or another depending on Randy’s response. Without much preamble Hank said, “so I’m going out for some darts later”. 

“Oh yeah? Getting out of the house for a change eh”?

“Well if going to The Grazing Cattle near every night doesn’t count as getting out of the house then I don’t suppose tonight’ll be much different”, as Hank said this Randy stopped chewing and his eyes gained a new focus. Oblivious, Hank continued, “Figure I’ll head there straight after we get out. If you want to come with we could have a go at some darts and put a pitcher or three down”. 

There was a pause and Hank didn’t know why he all of the sudden felt heat on his neck. He felt scrutiny and judgement. He didn’t know why. Getting angry now at the pause Hank got up to leave and said, “well forget it then. Maybe another night”. 

“Hank stop”. There was concern on his face. The kind of concern that’ll stop you in your tracks. Compassion also left its mark on Randy and so Hank didn’t know what would come next. “Hank sit down. Please.”

Hank felt his world shrinking. The walls felt closer and the lights got brighter as shadows left the walls. He wanted to disappear. The other conversations in the room ceased or maybe he just couldn’t hear them anymore. As he began to sit he looked down. Gone were the work clothes he’d only just been wearing. The dull carpet of the break room was replaced with cold white tile. He sat down on what was a plastic bench at the lunch table moments before but he now felt the unwelcoming shape of the wheelchair he’d sat in these long years. 

Randy truly felt pity when he reminded Hank, “The Grazing Cattle was burned down near 20 years ago Hank."" There was pleading in his voice now. ""You remember that much don’t you Hank? Hank? Remember your wife Hank?” Before Randy got half the first sentence out Hank had already slipped back into his fog. His shift had just ended and he was on the way to his favorite little pub around the corner. Maybe Glen would have a go at darts if it wasn’t too busy.

Signs of fire were still present on the foundation of the building, and the roof remained missing. No one had any interest in beginning their business in this run-down building, and it would be too expensive to rebuild it. The bar, “Bars and Barrels,” used to draw many customers in, creating a town that was very friendly. After the fire, no one seemed to ever step back into this town.

“Mark, I told you…it’s gone.”

Mark turned toward him and smiled, “You’re so funny. Look at it Jim. Aren’t you so excited to get a taste of the life happening in there.”

Jim was convinced that Mark, who has always been a strange fellow, is completely delusional.

“What the fuck are you saying, there’s literally no life in there,” but Jim did not see what Mark saw.

To Mark, this building was very much alive. The once brown tinted bricks radiated red, and the windows were filled with neon lights indicating that the bar was open. Through the large glass window, one could see a series of men sitting around and laughing over something that probably was not even that funny. However, when you are in this bar, everything turns into a lighter mood. Mark smiled at this sight and began to identify the men: Jason, Ali, the bartender Hubert. They were all the regulars. They have also been coming to this bar every day since they were 21. Mark could not contain his excitement at the thought of how these men would perceive his friend Jim.

Ignoring Jim’s statement, Mark began to walk toward the door and opened it up, waiting for Jim to follow through.

Jim was a little fearful of stepping into this old bar. It was completely dark and he swore that he could hear rats scurrying through the empty space. 

“Mark, let’s get out of here.”

“Jason!” Mark said greeting his friend with a large smile on his face. 

“Come on get my old buddy a drink! My treat Mark.” Jason said as he called out to the bartender.

The music pulsated through Mark’s body and he was just about to go on to the dance floor, until he realized how rude he was to not introduce Jim to all his friends.

“Guys…” Mark began.

Jim looked around the abandoned building to look for other people. Why was he referring to him as Jason, and now as a plural group.

“This is my friend Jim!” 

Jim stared at Mark, who was speaking to a wall so cheerfully. He pulled out his cell phone and was about to dial the cops. Something is wrong with Mark.

“Who the fuck is Jim,” Jason replied to Mark angrily.

“My friend from work.” Mark replied.

“Work? We’re your work buddied though” said Ali.

“I mean obviously, but I have met Jim and you guys would definitely get along with him.” 

Jim walked steadily towards the place that Mark stood.

“Well tell him to get the fuck out of here. I’m kicking him out.” Hubert shouted with a beer in his hand. 

“You guys need to relax.” Mark said waving his hands in a slow motion. 

Jim now stood right above Mark’s shoulders. 

Mark’s bar friends now sat in utter anger and silence. 

“Guys…” Mark said.

No one replied. It was as if they had instantly turned into stone.

“GUYS!” Mark now said, louder.

Jim saw it. Jim saw what Mark was talking to. There on the floor sat a heap of bones.

“GUYS!” he cried.

Suddenly the faces of his bar friends were wiped away by a strong breeze. The once brightly lit room was now completely empty.


Jim moved away from Mark, completely taken aback at what he just saw. 

“I’m dead Jim.”

Bob and Bill both pull out their phones and Google the rusty swallow on fifth and weshevamont and the third link down, after the articles about the fire describe how the wife received a hefty insurance payout and completly rebuilt the Rusty Swallow in memorandum of her late husband.

He paused and turned to me, looking somewhere between bemused and impressed.

""Refurbishment mate. Why do you think i've kept inviting you. Knew you'd like what they did with the place"".

Carl gathered himself again. ""Bloody hell. It looks the same"".

He was right. The workmen had somehow magic'd the sign from the ashes, so ""The Saint and Dragon"" still swung about the doors for a new generation of patrons no doubt.

Carl was still remarking that it ""must be reclaimed timber"" when we ordered our first pint.

""Two Guinness please"""", he said. I interrupted while he was handing his tenner over.

""Just a beer."" I corrected. Carl and the barmaid looked at me disapprovingly. ""What? Doesn't agree with me sometimes"" i added to justify myself.

The younger lad was busy looking over the place while i continued to make small-talk with the barmaid who preferred to be called ""Shaz"" apparently. I jokingly reminded her how the landlord always seemed to hire a ""Sharon"" every now and then.

""No jukebox though"" remarked a disappointed Carl.

""Live music only nowadays love"", said Shaz. ""Blues band on tonight"". She nodded to me. ""That old guy you rate"".

A few of the regulars nodded to me as i made my way to the pool table. ""Game anyone""? I offered to the young group of students rolling up interesting cigarettes on the corner table in the tap room.

No reply.

""They're not bloody daft"" said Pat. One of the old Irish chaps who spent most of his days here now.

""Saying i'm a pool shark are we? How about we play again old man?"" I added with a little grin.

Pat just nodded and tapped the rim of his pint glass. ""Already beaten' ye 'before like eh?""

Yeah. I did scowl a little at that.

Anyway. Carl had stopped his forensic examination of the premises at this point and on hearing our exchange in the tap room. Came over looking a little paler than he should.

""Spooky. Nothing has changed much at all. Even the carpet smells the same"".

I racked the table and started chalking both cues. ""Authenticity's all the rage now mate"" I noted. ""Anyway, let's get a game in before the rest arrive eh. Invited some of  other new guys down later on"".

Old Pat grumbled something while looking out the window. Then smiled at Carl. ""He's a cheat you know"".

I smiled back at the old Irishman. ""I'm hurt by your accusation.""

Pat shrugged. ""Am i lyin'?"".

I didn't reply. Instead allowed Carl to break, and sink several balls from the off.

""Impressive"" I raised an eyebrow. ""Three down right from the off"".

Carl rolled up his sleeves, showing off some impressive tattoos briefly before rounding the table again. Ignoring me and staying focused.

""Table's just like the one i used to play on"" grinned the younger man. ""Me and the lads used to run this old place"".

He potted another.

""Cue even feels lik..."".

""Very observant of you."" I smiled broadly.

The young man ran his hand along the cue, flicking his nail at some point of interest on it. ""How the fu...""?  ""How the hell did they find this"".

Patrick actually chuckled a little, before looking at me and offering a ""sorry"" by way of his expression.

Taking my cue. (Sorry pun intended) i clapped my guest on the shoulder and directed him to other areas of interest.

""Same decor. Same clientelle. Same smell. Same pool table. Your cue."" He was starting to get it, and, without dissappointing me he held his cue back as a weapon to strike me with.

""Impossible. This pub burned down 20 years ago...we torc....""

""I know Carl. I just needed you to remember. Hiding out in limbo for so long, locking those memories away"".

Carl waved his cue in the air. ""No. No it was an insurance thing. We didn't...."" He turned open mouth to the group of students sat previously.

Only this time they were charred corpses. Still animating and chatting to each other.

""Squatters Carl my boy. They knew the place wasn't empty.""

The cue clattered onto the table. The younger man starting to understand...

""Now now"". I smiled. ""We still have a game to finish"".

I motioned to Sharon. ""Let's have a lock-in when the others arrive. Bar the door, we won't be needing it anymore. Carl and i will be leaving via the Fire Exit"".

The sobbing young man picked up the cue again. Trembling as he chalked up to play again.

When you tell them what pub, they respond, confused, ""That place burned down 20 years ago.""",lukavwolf,"""Yeah, it was a local tragedy. The owner's son was trapped inside and it affected the whole town. Everyone pulled together donations and the pub was rebuilt within the year."" You decline to mention that the owner's son was almost universally hated for his cruelty and pettiness and that much of the small town had celebrated his absence. ""Come on over with me tonight, they did a fantastic job with the new building.""

It really was a very nice building. Not many people appreciate well done brick and mortar these days, and the new building had withstood the 20 years of the town's sporadic inclement weather much better than the constantly decaying temporary buildings that popped up whenever another developer saw ""a bold new opportunity"" in a town who's small population rarely changed.

Your co-worker just returned home a few months ago himself, having left to seek the big city life. It's not uncommon for them to come back, there's something about the small town atmosphere that you can't find anywhere else. You agree to meet up with him in the evening, as both of you have more than enough work to keep you busy in the meantime.

When you pull into the parking lot of the pub (""The"" pub, because there are only two bars in town and the other caters to the younger audience), you're greeted by that familiar facade of resilient brick with its victorian style iron lanterns. The parking lot is full for once, and you don't recognize any of the cars. Maybe there was a function being held that you had forgotten about in the recent upswing in work lately. It had been so hectic you were saving time in the morning by not shaving, and were actually becoming quite proud of your new beard.

Your co-worker is already waiting outside the entrance, huddled and breathing steam in the early winter cold.

""See? The tragedy brought the town together and look at what exists now!"" It had been a long week and you were eager to relax and soak in that old familiarity.

He nods distractedly and waves you inside, hardly looking at you as he hurries toward the warmth and safety promised inside.

It's strangely quiet, for a night with such a full parking lot, but these little details keep slipping from your consciousness. Something nags at you, deep inside, but here is the new pub, with it's dependable brick and cast iron lanterns.

Your co-worker holds the door open for you and ushers you inside quickly. You barely have time to register that it's dark, and still very quiet, before the biting cold forces you forward.

""SSSSSSUUUUUURRRRRRPPPPPPIIIIIISSSSSSEEEEEE!!!!!!"" The lights turn and the roar from the room hits you at the same time, as everyone jumps up and joins in the chorus of surprise.

Except you've never seen any of these people in your life. The bartenders are wearing the same uniform as always, a modest brown vest with a clean pressed white shirt underneath. You've made friends with every bartender who works the pub and have never seen any of the ones currently serving. The layout of the inside is exactly as you had remembered it, but it's never been anywhere near this full. And all of these people are clearly looking directly at you, not your co-worker, eagerly awaiting your response. Complete strangers looking straight at you, smiles forming across their lips.

""W-w-w-w-h-a-t-?-!"" you manage to exclaim, taking a step back in shock. That's when you notice that your co-worker has already closed the door behind you. That's when you notice that he is pulling a chain through the handles, and already has a large bulky lock in place to secure it.

Your head is pounding. The lights seem to flicker for a moment, as if timed with your brain trying to process all of these growing discrepancies, the inconsistencies you had pushed out of your consciousness.

The next thing you notice is that no one is drinking. There are no bottles, no mugs, no glasses. Just empty plates in front of each person, each person who are not just looking at you eagerly, but holding knives and forks in each hand.

Suddenly you're grabbed, forcefully on each side, as hands tighten around your arms and shoulders. You're thrust forward, dumbfounded.

The pounding in your head reaches crescendo and the grasping blackness seeping into all of your consciousness seems a relief compared to the overwhelming shock at the confusing situation.

The last thing you notice is the owner's dead son, standing just a few feet in front of you, madly grinning with gleaming black eyes. Polishing a very large, very sharp looking cleaver.",next-year-on-mars

Nothing that brought down the atmosphere.

“Which one?”

“The Golden Tail, down there near First.”

“What?” The atmosphere grows a little heavier. “That place burned down years ago.”

A chill creeps down my spine, cold as the tomb. “You’re kidding me. I was just there, I’ve been going there for weeks. I know a few of the regulars, the bartenders, I even met the owners for Christ’s sake.” The ground shudders just slightly.

“Wait, the Golden Tail? Is that the one with the mermaid down by the pier?”

“No,” the air lightens a bit and I relax myself, “I’m talking about the one off of First. That was the Mermaid’s Coin, the one right off the docks. Don’t you remember.”

“I...”

“It’s how you died.” The ghostly expression shown even in the eldritch light that glowed around the tomb, flowing from the book. The face twisted and contorted and I knew I had made a mistake. ‘Keep it light, nothing to heavy,’ the man had said, ‘and never remind them that they’re dead.’

The words are out of my mouth before I realize it, the counter incantation. The spirit screams and folds in on itself as it is pulled through the portal and back into it’s crypt. The eldritch lights from the book die down and the darkness of the tomb swallows me back into it. I take up the book, it’s cover cold from laying in the floor and tuck it beneath my arm.

He was starting to hate this week and it was only Tuesdsy. Having lost track of their progress given yesterday he asked Kent, ""How much progress have we acomplished?""

 ""We still have 45 machines to fix by the end of the day Friday and we fixed 15 already. Do you want to go out for a drink after work?""

Patrick was really feeling the stress of working; his rotation for weekend shifts this month was really burning him out. Due to this he replied ""Sounds nice after how burnt out I have been feeling lately. Where were you planning on drinking?""

""The Tipsy Tankard where else would I go it has the best brew in town with the local ale, i go there every night. So I take it you are in on going?""

Patrick confused grabs Kent and pulls him into an empty office so they wouldn't be ovearheard if someone came into the marketing department who had all been given the day off. ""Dude did you spike your coffee? That pub burnt down about 20 years ago and the trap pubs we set up to catch the arsonist running around all got burnt too once a year and now we are on our last chance to catch the arsonist. You are comprimised activate the orange button on your watch.""

""I didn't spike my coffee I filled the machine and made coffee just tap water and coffee grounds."" As Kent says that he presses the button and gets a jolt of electricity and a cure for the drug released into him. 

Seeming to have no effect Patrick uses his watch to radio for a replacement partner to keep their cover solid. Then he goes to the phone by the photocoppier and calls the boss of the company saying ""Kent stepped on his own shoe lace, tripping himself and doing a faceplant into a coppier; I believe he now has a concussion. I let my boss know and he is going to send a replacement over for Kent and we are only a quarter of the way through fixing coppier issues if you want it done by the weekend you will have to hire an aditional person. Which you can save a travel fee on if you ask for the additional worker to be sent with Kent's replacement. Our protocol does require us to have an on site customer verify an incident happened and report to our boss to verify before additional workers can be dispatched.""

Kent was loopy from the counter drug and the shock. He stands up and looks at the photocopier seeing a drawing of a hippo on a paper caught in it. ""How come there is a hippo in the printer?"" was the next thing to come out of Kent's mouth but it was loud enough it could be heard on the other end of Patrick's phone call.

The boss said, ""Sit him down in a chair and get him to the lobby for your guys to pick him up and for meeting the team they are sending you to complete this job ASAP. I have to get going see the health and safety officer in the lobby to give a report of the incident to while you wait and have your company send any relivent paperwork over. I have to get going try not to let any more of your people get injured."" Hanging up before patrick could respond.

6 hours later Kent had sobered up from the drug and found himself moved up on the stakeout list. This was due to forgetting to avoid drinking town water and now he has to stay at HQ to keep the concussion story inline with his cover. The governments were tracking an arsonist that kept striking all over the world on a month by month basis there would be a pub burnt down in a country with the calling card pointing to it being the same person it is always on the 12 of a month the first was the Tipsy Tavern. It has continued where every August the arsonist has returned to burn a pub in town, because of the size of the town bars and pubs pop up all over and everyone bets on who will be hit by the arsonist every time.

They finally caught the arsonist it was an old lady who would always knit stuff and leave it with a pub owner. Some time after she left, a small incindeary device she hid while there would go off, but she was forgetable enough that she never drew attention. Her calling card was a cluster of small gems she collected previously and had stashed in the countries she visited. The only issue was she planned on getting caught and had made an EMP and an incendiary which she used to erase all traces of her having commited all the arsonry as well as erasing the HQ where she was brought for interrigation.",broomball99

He’d built the bar with his own money, and a little gumption.

He called it ‘The Salty Dog’, an obvious reference to some Navy joke I wasn’t privy to.

The Salty Dog has a lively staff of bartenders, waitstaff, and bouncers. I know all of them, and they all know me.

Junior bartenders, Esmerelda ‘Esmie’ Oliver and Ryan Yates are both part-time students at the local community college; studying Engineering and Accounting, respectively. 

The main bartender, who looks old enough to be my grandfather, just goes by ‘Rusty’ though I’m 90% sure his name is Arthur. He was in the Navy with Old Joe, and they were friends long before then.

The waitstaff consisted only of a handful of people, but somehow two of them shared the same first name of ‘Conner’. The two Conner’s couldn’t be more different. 

  One was blonde-haired, styled in harsh spikes. About 5 foot 3 inches tall, and he went by the nickname ‘Computer’ because he is a technology major.

  The other Conner was a red-headed Irishman, who stood at exactly 7 feet tall, just a few inches shy of the ceiling of ‘The Salty Dog’. He was a farm boy, wouldn’t know a flash drive from a floppy disk.

The bouncers all are mixed martial artists, of various different studies and belt levels. 

  Head bouncer, Tommy Davis, has multiple black belts in Kembo, Tae Kwon Do, and Karate. He often jokes that he hopes for his particularly difficult customer so that he can show off his skills.

The staff are like family. 

I tried telling that all to a co-worker, Darrel, who I didn’t know too well but he looked like he would get along with the various staff just fine.

Darrel crinkled his eyebrows at me, “Didn’t ‘The Salty Dog’...like, burn down twenty years ago?”

I rolled my eyes, “They had a small fire, and that was only two years ago.”

Darrel leveled a concerned look at me, he turned to his computer and ran a quick search. “Yeah; No. It was burned to the ground like twenty years ago... to the day it looks like.”

I peered over his shoulder. The news article glaring back at me.

 “...That’s *impossible*”

I cajoled Darrel into following me to The Salty Dog, telling him how the news article must have been talking about another bar, and he would see when we got there.

   The bar wasn’t there. 

“Darrel, you gotta believe me. It was here.”

“It was there,” he agreed, “a long time ago.”

“The Salty Dog had a lively staff of bartenders, waitstaff, and bouncers. I knew all of them, and they all knew me.”

Darrel nodded sadly. “Anniversaries are always tough, I get it. You want to come with me to a different bar, maybe tell me all about it?”

I had been in denial for twenty years. Was I finally ready to face the harsh reality? 

I suppose I had to.

“Yeah, thanks Darrel. Sounds like a plan.”

""Yeah that's the badger!"" Matt said enthusiastically. He had been working at grubens Inc for nearly two years, and drinking at the cock and hen pub after work nearly every night. It was a nice place, especially for a pub in the city. Mostly there was just dive bars and clubs with a smattering of pretty terrible chain pubs but the cock and hen was something a bit special, and it was a five minute walk from work. 

""Are you sure?"" James prodded. 

""Um, yeah. Pretty dang sure. I've been going there for as long as I've worked here."" James was new at grubens, and more importantly he was single, and Matt needed a drinking buddy. Everyone else was older and married with kids and barely went out but James was just about the right side of thirty, maybe just the wrong side actually. But he was keen to see the city he grew up in after moving away for college and now being back for work. 

""OK it's just, that pub burned down twenty years ago mate. I used to go by it every day on my way to school. Then one day I went by and it was cordoned off. Arson. Apparently. It stood empty all boardered up for years."" 

""Oh wow. Cool. Well I guess it got renovated then."" 

""Yeah I guess so."" 

""Well it's a really nice place anyway. They have a boardgame night Tuesday and a quiz every Thursday."" 

""Sweet you ever won?"" 

""Only bloody four times mate!"" Matt said.

Just then Windlesham knocked on Matts door and walked in without waiting for a reply. ""James could I borrow you a minute?"" 

""Yeah of course."" James got up and followed Windlesham out of the room, miming being shot in the head and making a funny face as he left. Matt laughed.

“Dave, I am telling you, that place burned down 20 years ago.”

“Diane, you just moved here 5 months ago, are you sure you aren’t thinking of another place? Maybe Porky’s?”

“No, I’m telling you, that spot on Elm street is now a bank.”

Diane was frustrated with this conversation. Ever since she had moved here, leaving behind the ashes of a marriage and a life, she just never felt like she belonged. Finally, the one person that had reached out to her since starting at the new company reached out to her and invited out. Dave was a nice enough looking guy, though he didn’t seem to fit in with anyone else at the firm either. She was excited to get to know him better, but now he was inviting her to a place that didn’t exist? Was this some kind of joke, or a prank, or what?

“Diane, I go there all the time. Trivia on Tuesdays. Wednesday night mug night. I mean, I’m great friends with the owner Chuck’s wife. I’m there like every night. Come have a drink on me. I’ll fill you in on all the company gossip.” He gave her a reassuring smile.

“Dave, this isn’t funny. You know, I’m still new here, and really could have used a night out.”

Diane turned and stormed away, upset that Dave acted so poorly. Maybe he thought the joke was funny, but it really wasn’t.

Turning the corner, she bumped into Jennifer. 

“What is up with that Dave guy? Seems like a jerk. Is that why no one talked to him?”

Jennifer gave Diane a questioning look. “Dave?”

“Yeah, you know, Dave. Accounting. He always seems so pleasant, but I never see anyone talking to him. He asked me for a drink, so I said sure. You know where he suggested? Chotchkie’s.”

A cloud fell over Jenifer’s face. “What the hell is wrong with you?”

Diane was caught off guard. “Excuse me?”

“Why would you even bring that up? What kind of joke is this?”

“What are you talking about? I just spoke to Dave.”

“Diane, Chotchkie’s burned down 20 years ago. The owner, Chuck burned it down when he found out his wife had been cheating on him. With a regular at the place. He was Dave Pearson. From accounting.”

Jennifer gave Diane a look of disgust. “You need to work on that sense of humor.”

She wheeled around and headed down the hallway, just as Dave rounded the corner. She walked right through him like he wasn’t there. Dave looked up at Diane, smiled, and waved at her.",dirtybacon77

My co-worker was a rookie time jumper and would often get confused at what decade he was in. 

""No, wrong era,"" I corrected him, "" this is the 90s.""

He checked his data watch and slapped his forehead, ""shit you're right.""

I punched his shoulder and smirked, he was turning out to be a decent time jumper but he still had a lot to learn. 

We left the chrono tanks and got dressed in era appropriate clothing. I grabbed a band t with jeans and he went with a black turtle neck with slacks. Once we looked era appropriate we caught a taxi to the bar.

I bought him a drink and we sat watching a football game.

""Five bucks my team wins."" One of the locals said slamming his drink into the bar next to me. 

This era resident was what was referred to as a ""pal"" or ""buddy"" or even ""friend"". Time jumpers aren't really afforded the possibility to have true friends or relationships in eras, this was an era resident. 

""You can keep your money today Hank,"" I said. To be honest though his team would cream the Vikings in the last quarter.

""This is my co-worker,"" I said. 

Hank smiled and they shook hands. 

We finished out beers and and paid out our tabs to Sophie.

My co-worker winked at her and left a tip. 

We turned to leave when Sophie called out to us behind. 

""Hey, what are trying to pull?"" She held the money my co-worker had paid her with.

My mouth dropped. It was from 2027. My co-worker looked at me. 

""I'm so sorry he said at me. ""His eyes were wide.

Sophie stepped back, ""what's going on James"" she said looking at me. 

My coworker gawked at me ""you gave your name?""

I checked the dates on my data watch and groaned. Time had slipped. It was rare  it it happened sometimes if changes were too much for time to adjust to.

Back at the chrono tank I sat back in my chair. It happened from time to time. We always had to be careful. I looked through the tank at my co-worker. He was holding his head in his hands. I closed my eyes and. Locked out the screams as the chemicals replaced the blood in my veins and shifted me home through time. ",Xanderfreeman

Places that she had been used to for years had different name, different architectures or gone all together. But today was different. The ignorant little pup of a coworker said that Freddy's pub had burned burned down 20 years ago. 

She was there yesterday. 

*They must have noticed*, she thought angrily, *and now I am the new joke at the station. Wonderful!*

""My mistake for inviting you"" she answered him and walked away. She needed a drink. 

But there weren't drinks to be had tonight, the land plot was empty. There were no pubs within half a mile radius. Freddy's pub was nowhere to seen.

Distressing.

Tired of walking, she climbed back into her car when a light flashed in the corner of her eye, her ears rang and the migraine began. 

*I need a drink I need a drink*

She would just have to go somewhere else for that drink tonight, there was no pubs in here. 

Just when she was about to drive she noticed the Welcoming lights that read ""pub"" on the building. 

How could she not have noticed that before? 

*Whatever it is, it will have to do for the night.*

She got out of the car and into the pub. There were some familiar faces there, good. And the place seemed nice to top it off.

This will be her new drinking place. 

""What is the name of this pub?"" She asked after taking a long gulp of her whiskey.

""Freddy's"" the bartender answered.

One evening as dusk was setting in, Dad and I were throwing a tennis ball to each other to tire out our doberman. She slept inside the house, so it was always a good idea to give her a good run before settling down for the evening.

We both went to Jazzy's last night, yet he kept telling me it burned down twenty years ago. I mean, that's bullshit, I'm sitting in there right now, having some Jack Daniel's. I just wanted to end my damn Friday night drinking with Alex before we return to our lives outside of work. 

As time passes, I feel the heavy sensation in my bladder that lets me know it's time to use the restroom. As I urinated in the stall, I saw the usual papers taped to the wall and writings decorated around it. Bands recruiting new members, phone numbers promising ""a good time"", hate speech and symbols, and the attempts to cover them up. Usually there's something new every time I come in here, but that is not the case tonight. It looks the same as every other night. Not too out of the ordinary though, I suppose. 

I flush and wash my hands, anticipating the next drink waiting for me at the booth as I make my way back. Something was different however, as the whole bar was empty, darker than usual. That wasn't all though, it looked like Jazzy's interior was worn out, beaten by the elements of time and looked charred in some areas. The place smelled of ash and dust.

""Hello?"" I asked, to no response. I repeated ""Hello?"" several more times, while searching for any person that may be here. Nobody is here. No faces, no voices, no shuffling of feet, not even the music playing from the stereos. Even my drink was gone. 

I turned from the bar and noticed the doors that had previously been there were gone. Just a wall. I walked up to it, feeling it. Nope, still a wall. I blinked and turned around several times, yet the wall was still there. I'm too drunk for this shit, I think to myself, yet I feel like I am sobering up quickly. Actually, I'm pretty sure I am sober now. What is happening? I squint my eyes completely shut, hitting myself in the head as if to wake myself up to no avail. I'm still greeted to the cacophony of emptiness surrounding me. 

I walk to the bathroom to see if things would go back to the way they were. They didn't. Jazzy's was certainly not the same place I originally entered as I had hoped. Still no way out. Yet, the place wasn't totally devoid of change. There was a writing on the wall, resembling burn marks.

""You bastard. You did this, James.""

Me? What could I have done to warrant this? All I wanted was a fucking drink!

I avert my gaze to the writing to find the door had returned, to which I quickly opened and entered through to find myself outside of the men's room again.

A parade of sounds, voices, and smells greeted me upon my entrance. I was in the bar again, and so was everyone else I remembered before going to take a piss. I walked towards where I was drinking, hoping to forget what I had just dealt with.

""James, are you okay?"" asked Jasmine, the bartender. ""You're not looking so hot tonight. Need me to..."" Jasmine's voice trailed off to inaudible babble. It sounded like she was in another room. I look up, and all I see is a blurry form where she stood, and as I looked around, everything surrounding me was blurry. So many muffled voices and the distortion of ""Shut Up and Drive"" by Rihanna were what I could hear. I could see and hear myself perfectly, so what was the problem? I tried to get up to walk to the door, but I lost my balance quickly and fell to the floor. The blurry figures either scattered away or attempted to help me up. I swatted them away.

I crawled my way to the doors, and pulled myself up. Once I passed through those doors, I felt normal again. Once I collected myself, I noticed I was still in the burnt version of Jazzy's, from where I left the restroom before. Alone. The doors were still there though, which I opened. 

Same room, same entrance, same smell of ash and dust. Only this time, two billowing, smoky figures were facing me. As I walked towards them, they walked through the doors, literally, as if intangible. I shook my head in disbelief. What is going on, and why can't I leave? I don't want to drink anymore. These thoughts raced through my brain, which the bar seemed to answer through the same wall that had writings on it before.

""James, are you really that oblivious? Try to remember. Remember that you fucked up.""

I immediately raced through the doors, to yet again the same room with the same writing.

""James""

Still running.

""You took the greatest gift away from Alex.""

Running.

""Now his family has to move on without him.""

Please let me out of here!

""It's bad enough you killed him, but his five year old son? What were you thinking?""

I'm never drinking again.

""You should have thought about that before. You should have walked home or asked for a ride.""

Please...

""What about you, James? Yes, that's the question.""

Please God, let me go...

""The answer is simple, really.""

""Go fuck yourself, James.""

""You deserve to rot. You deserve to run forever. You shouldn't have come here after what you did.""

""You should have turned yourself in.""

""Are you even reading this anymore?""

""If so, are you ready to accept your punishment? All you have to do is stop running. All you have to do is tell Alex's family you're sorry for what happened. Make the call. Look behind you.""

I heeded the wall's advice. Behind me was a phone on a stool in the middle of the room. I picked it up and dialed Alex's wife.

""Hello, this is Madison,"" her voice flowed out of the phone, ""I can't come to the phone right now, leave a message.""

Beep.

""Madison, I'm sorry. I can't imagine what I've put you and the kids through. Alex and Jared... I shouldn't have drove home in the state I was in. If I hadn't driven drunk, your son wouldn't have been lying lifeless in the road. If I did things differently, Jared wouldn't have been endangered and Alex wouldn't have had died jumping to save his son. I-""

The phone let out a long beep until I hung up. Wiping the tears from my face, I turn back around to the wall.

""Go, James. You've done what you can now. You're free to leave.""

I head to the door and open it. All I see is blackness, with a small light shining in the distance. I walk through, enveloped the darkness.

Regardless of what happens from here, I'm never drinking again.",coronoid

Why were all the cannons facing away from the wall? Why were the patrolling soldiers watching the distant horizon? Weren't they supposed to be keeping explorers like himself out of the promised land? 

There was a crunch of boots on snow.

""The elite aren't hoarding a promised land from us. They're protecting us.""

""Protecting?""

After the breakthrough in Botany allowing plants to grow in a climate similar to Mars all sites were set on setting up a base there and beginning the process of colonizing it. This is what we were told at least, now we are beginning to doubt what our true reason for coming here is. We decide to ask HQ if they are seeing what we are seeing but because of the distance there is a about a 14 minute delay in our conversations.

"[WP] In an alternative timeline, Mike and Sully from Monsters Inc orchestrate world tragedies like the Titanic sinking, 9/11, World War II, etc. to fulfill their fear quotas.",mxcrystal,"""Mikey, Randall was talking in the change room today...""

""About how awesome we are, right?"" 

""Well, no he was saying that...""

""He wants us to show him the ropes right?""

""...no he says he has something planned that's bigger than what we have pulled off in the past."" Sully had been trying to tell Mike all morning, but to no avail. 

""Oh? He thinks he can pull off something better than WWII?"" Pointing to the scare count on the wall.

""Yep.""

""Than 9/11?"" Pointing now to the employee of the year plaque for 2001.

""Yep.""

""Well. Guess we'll just have to step our game up and think of something... bigger!"" Mike ran off towards Roz to try and book a meeting with upper management.

He was always thinking, thinking of a way to keep him and Sully at the top of the scare list. Sully stayed on the Scare Floor and attempted to get ready for their next big event, even though he had no idea what was being planned. Fear was a speciality for these two and if anyone could stay at the top, it was them. Mike came rushing back, almost tripping over the canisters that littered the floor.

""I got us a meeting with Waternoose! I got us a meeting with..."" He tripped over one of the canisters and lost control of the papers in his hands. They plumed and one particular sheet fell into Sully's hand. He glanced at the sheet and smiled.

""This is your big plan Mikey?"" Sully was grinning with the prospect.

""Nothing scarier buddy. No way Randall can top us.""

Sully and Mike left the Scare Floor and preceeded to head to the administration offices. Mr Waternoose's door was cracked open ever so slightly; they good hear Randall attempting a pitch.

""...no Randall we've already done that, people are too desensitized to that nowadays...""

Randall barged through the door and headed down the hall back to the Scare Floor, hardly awknowledging his opponents were standing in the hall with a better, more effective long term solution to their fear-based energy. Nervously, the two entered into Mr Waternoose's office and gingerly sat down opposite him; Sully had difficulty fitting in the chair but squeezed himself in nonetheless.

""So, how are my top scarers today? Any new ideas to bring fear?"" He tapped his fingers against his crustacean-esque limbs.

""Sit down and ready yourself for this."" Mike was oblivious to the fact Mr Waternoose was already seated. ""Alright then. So, you know how lately misinformation has been causing fear and distrust among the humans? Picture this; The leader of one of the most powerful nations is... a science denying celebrity!""

Silence enveloped the room.

""I love it! Bring fear to the world through misinformation! It's... it's brilliant! It was cause more fear than any event before!"" Mr Waternoose was practically jumping from his seat. ""But who would we get to take office?"" 

""Ever seen 'the Apprentice'?"" Mike replied back.

[WP] It is years after the zombie apocalypse. Humanity has taken the world back from near extinction. The burial process has been altered to include some form of severe head wound.,AltusUrsus,"Ben grew up hearing stories from his grandfather about the apocalypse. He’d heard all the bible verses at Sunday School, and from Mrs. North down the street, she loved to talk about it. But, he’d never really heard about how serious it’d gotten. His parents purposefully kept it away from him, until he was a teen.

At age 16, he was handed a handwritten letter from the leader of their city, explaining about how he had been paired up with some girl from another city, and they would be wed. When he tried to ask his mom, she just said, “Ask your dad.”

So, he did.

Staring at his dad, Ben quirks an eyebrow. “So, I assume this,” he waves the papers toward his dad, “Is why I couldn’t date Jenny?”

His dad nods slightly, then sighs. “That, and her brother is marrying your cousin.” Ben tilts his head, about to ask, and his dad cuts him off. “I know it shouldn’t have anything to do with you and Jenny, but we can’t risk the gene pool becoming too small.”

Ben just stares, not comprehending. “But there’s people all over the world.”

Sighing, his dad nods again, then continues. “Yeah, but not all of them have safe practices, which makes travel much more time consuming and dangerous. You remember Grandpa’s funeral, and how he had on that goofy hat?”

Ben nods, anxious about where his dad’s going. “Kind of, I just remember wondering why he had his winter hat on in the summer.”

“Well, you know what the undead are, right? People who were dead, and came back, obviously. About 650 years ago, a man in a program that provided medical care to those unfortunate enough to not be able to get it, Doctors Without Borders, got injured in the rain forrest.” He looks up, watching his son’s face to make sure he’s paying attention. Ben looks a little bored, as though this history lesson was old news, but his dad presses on. “He came home, very sick, very contagious, and when he passed away, he was brought to a morgue in a major hospital to help figure out what happened. Except, he didn’t stay dead. Exactly 36 hours after he’d been declared dead, just before the autopsy was meant to begin, he started thrashing around in the fridge they kept the bodies in. He wasn’t the only one, and they eventually got out, biting many of the people before they could even realize what was happening.”

Ben nods, looking unimpressed. “So, they came back to life, bit people, the people got sick, died, and came back. More and more people died, came back, and crap hit the fan. I took History, dad, I know the basics.”

Chuckling a little, his dad presses on. “Well, at the time, Earth was hovering around ten billion people alive. After a year, it was more like six billion. Some smaller island countries locked their borders, attempting to sustain themselves as long as possible to wait out the sickness. They can’t breathe under water, so they stop moving, but that doesn’t kill them for some reason.”

Ben looks up, realizing quickly where his dad is going. “But removing the brain does.”

His mom steps in, sitting on the ottoman. “Right. So, back then, it was broadcast on every radio service. The airwaves were filled with the messages, some countries being used as intermediaries to boost the signal across continents. By the time it was standard practice, and people were as safe as they could be, the world was down to around six million.”

Ben whistles, imagining all the death. “But that’s still a lot of people.”

His mom nods, agreeing, “Yup, but that wasn’t the end of it.” She looks to her husband, and he continues.

“Well, over time, settlements grew out of these groups of people. Some starved to death because they had settled somewhere unviable, some… were taken out by their leaders….” He trails off, staring at the ground.

Ben’s eyes widen, his voice high. “What?! Leaders just killed their people like it was nothing?!”

His father swallows, nodding. “Throughout history, those people have existed. Repulsive, horrible, monstrous people. But, anyway, probably around 3 million people were still around, until one group decided that they didn’t need to destroy the brain stem of their dead, only the ones who showed any signs before death. The thing was, though, that generations of zombies had been created over the decades, and the virus had seeped into the cemeteries where the bodies were dumped. Most people built up an immunity, but when you’re dead, or close to it, the virus can take over everything.”

His mother shakes her head, mumbling, “Science is terrifying.”

He agrees, continuing. “So, they started just burying their dead. Thankfully, it requires a fresh corpse, so the older bodies didn’t come back, but many did. The city was swarmed, and overrun with zombies. Many people ended up killing their kids and then themselves in the hope of avoiding being turned.”

Ben nods, enraptured by the story. “So I’m guessing they got turned, and took out other settlements?”

His dad sighs, nodding. “Yes, it came damn near wiping out Europe, Asia, and Africa as whole continents. Thankfully, some people survived and we have some diversity left. But, all in all, it was maybe several hundred thousand across all the continents by the time the last undead was separated from its brain.”

His mom picks up the story, glad to be past the seriously twisted parts. “So, people started to get married again, children were regular occurrences rather than just occasional whoopsies. But, most people married within their communities. After a few generations, everyone was related in some way, a little too close for comfort.”

Ben snorts, thinking about a family tree that becomes more like a family wreath.

“I know, young man, very funny. But, it was decided that settlements would arrange marriages, in an attempt to continue expanding the gene pool. Our leader, and a few others, agreed that on every person’s 16th birthday, if medical tests imply they should be fertile, they will receive a letter telling them about their spouse-to-be.” She clasps her husbands hand, squeezing it. “Your father and I were one of the few allowed to marry for love, as he had moved from a different city.”

Ben nods, holding his hands in his lap. “So this girl got a letter too, just saying, ‘Hey, you’re gonna marry this stranger.’ and she has no choice but to comply?”

His parents look at each other, then back to him. “Uh,” his dad starts, clearing his throat. “If someone refuses their partner, they’re offered one more person. If they refuse both people, they’re…. uh,” He coughs, feeling uncomfortable. “They’re…. sterilized. It’s to avoid the risk of incestuous babies, although some cousins have been known to fall in love regardless, and some have had kids.”

Ben wrinkles his nose, thinking of his cousins. “Gross.”

His dad nods, then grabs the papers Ben had set on the table at some point during the explanation. “Do you want to look at her?”

Ben’s eyes widen, and he jumps up, running to the computer. He sits, pulling up the web browser.

“Okay, type this in,” His mom says, a giggle in her voice as she points at a string of numbers on the bottom of the last page. “Then type in your Identifier, 210-321-842-4431.”

He does, then his name and other information in the fields as they pop up. Finally, a screen comes up, saying “Welcome, Ben Washington.”

It fades away, showing him the most beautiful girl he’d ever seen, and so different from his city’s people. Here, everyone was some shade of brown, with mostly black hair and dark eyes. She was pale, with red hair, freckles, and even her clothes were different, more whimsical as opposed to his city’s serious, utilitarian clothes.

She signs in, and the website allows them to briefly video chat. She looks even more beautiful to Ben than in pictures, her eyes crinkling when she laughs, and her accent is so strange, yet alluring. Jenny fades from his mind in an instant, and he actually becomes glad that they were forced into the arrangement, since it allowed him to get to meet her.

"[WP] You are the Dream Maker. By day, a hero that makes lifelong dreams into reality; by night, a villain that converts lifelong achievements into mere dreams.",Blastosite,"Good versus evil.

It's a historic, classic power struggle. The gallant knight saves the princess from the evil dragon, the superhero saves the city from the immoral villain, et cetera. Nearly always, good reigns supreme, insinuating that evil is a bad thing. That's not true.

Evil goes hand in hand with chaos. Chaos is what draws people together.  It creates opportunities for people to present their capacities to each other, to show what you're made of. It can spark relationships, make people appreciate order, and ultimately serve as part of the foundation of society. Because of this, good and evil must be in balance. A balanced morality equates to a healthy society. 

That's where I come in: The *Dream Maker.* The government has appointed me to serve to keep the scales of good and evil aligned, consequently keeping society from falling into utopia or dystopia. I do this by, well, manipulating people's dreams. I take people's greatest dreams and transmute them into reality.  I also take people's proudest achievements...and convert them into mere dreams. Remember the balance of good and evil? We can't have people getting too lucky. Meanwhile, not everyone should be at the bottom of the barrel. Equality is optimal.

To explicate my job more effectively, let me enlighten you about one of my most recent missions...
 ---
I walk into the grocery store, the warm, ventilated air instantly warming my cold skin. I look around, searching for my target: 26-year-old Elaine Bower, an aspiring singer. I had been watching her for quite some time before concluding that she was deserving of advancement. She would always abnegate her own needs and feelings in order to aid someone else, whether that be assisting an elderly person in unloading items into their vehicle, giving a homeless man a considerable amount of money, or consoling a hysterical, freshly heartbroken stranger sitting alone. She would do all of this, not expecting any type of compensation in return. Today, that changes.

I advance further into the store, shifting my gaze to the checkout lanes. It does not take long before I see Elaine standing behind a checkout lane, smiling while making casual chit-chat with an older customer. Her cheerful, happy nature contrasts the other miserable-looking clerks. Excellent. Turning around, I progress into the soda aisle and grab a cola. I want to create an excuse to talk to her. I intentionally get into her line, despite other lines being significantly shorter. My unconventional move briefly attracts the attention of other shoppers, but they quickly go back to rummaging through their purses or fiddling with their phones.

Elaine gets the line moving fast, and before I know it it's my turn to check out. I place my soda on the belt, and Elaine hands the preceding customer in line their last bag. ""Have a great day!"" Elaine says with a natural smile. Her smile inspires my lips to form in the same way. She really *is* something.

She turns toward me. ""Hello! How are you?"" Elaine inquires. I could sense the sincerity in her voice. 

""I'm good,"" I reply, wishing I could say more. I'm supposed to remain as incognito as possible, which is always a struggle considering how inspiring and genuine some of my targets are.

""I'm glad to hear that!"" Elaine replies, dragging my soda across the grocery scanner. *Beep.*

I take note of the music note pin attached next to her name tag. 

""I like your pin! You like music, huh?"" I break protocol, wanting to interact more with Elaine.

""Yeah! It's always been a big part of my life growing up.""

""I see. Do you want to be a singer or performer or something?"" I feign ignorance.

""Actually, yes! It's been my dream to be a singer one day. I've been taking vocal lessons since I was seven! I mean, I've never really gotten popular, but that's okay. In fact, the cafe downtown lets me perform occasionally during weekend nights!"" She pauses. ""In my opinion, that's good enough for me.""

I smile. ""I see. I can tell you really deserve recognition. I know you'll go somewhere one day."" 

Elaine smiles. I feel a sense of accord between the two of us. ""Thank you. That means a lot to me.""

I pay for my drink and walk out of the aisle, a loud yell halting me in my tracks.

""Elaine?!"" An old woman behind the customer service desk screeches. Elaine turns to her. ""You're overdue for your last break! Why didn't you let me know?!"" The woman screeches begrudgingly again, peering over her oversized glasses.

""O-okay! I'll go now!"" Elaine stutters, embarrassed. I surmise that the old woman is her supervisor. I smile, not because of Elaine's misfortune, but because of how her world is about to change forever.

Elaine walks up to the front of the store, clocks out for her break, and exits the building. I wait a minute and follow. 

Now in the parking lot, I scan the periphery for any sign of Elaine. After a minute, I see her sitting alone on a bench by the store's side. She must not have a car to sit in. She's shivering, despite her jacket being zipped up completely. 

I hide behind a nearby tree and pull out my cell phone. I swiftly punch in the number I've dialed so many times and put the phone up to my ear.

""Hey, Ralph? Do a search for Elaine Bower. It's her time."" I pause, listening to Ralph's words. ""Yes, I'm sure. Go ahead."" The call abruptly ends.

I eagerly shoot my gaze over to Elaine, who is still shivering on the bench. It happens sooner than I anticipate.

Elaine jumps in her seat before realizing that it's only her phone vibrating. She pulls it out, and answers. I see her mouth the word ""hello?""

Within a few minutes, Elaine's face morphs from confusion to utter ecstasy. She jumps up from the bench, practically screaming in happiness. Tears stream down her face and she repeatedly thanks whoever is on the phone with her. My heart melts in reply.

"[WP] Earth is invaded by several competing alien empires. Rather than uniting under the common threat, humanity decided to divide itself even further, with countries allying themselves with different alien forces and going to war with each other.",IkeKashiro,"Lak Mortumee was kaidon of his family. They went to Earth as heretics seeking refuge from covenant armada- while his family either supported him or labeled their warriors cowards worthy of arbiter status, neither side had expected to encounter the military might of the multiple races that had converged on earth. Lak and his family descended upon the americas, finding the honor of their special forces that grew strange plastic like body fur from their faces, despite being mammals. The sole star of earth left his family cold, but his warriors’ heart burned on, yearning for redemption in his families’ eyes. Perhaps protecting these beasts would assist in this. They resembled smaller Jiralhane- with wits to rival the San’Shyuum. 
Lak often found human sitting uncomfortable for his double knee joints, so he preferred standing, even inside the barracks.

“So ugh, an ‘energy sword,’ huh? Sounds like a lightsaber” 

Lak grunted his mandibles, making a guttural growl.
“A single plasma blade is foolish- how might you wrest a sword from a foe? Have not humans a second thumb?”

“No, our pinkie fingers aren’t ugh...aren’t that useful” Pontiac said, chewing some watermelons flavored gum. Pontiac was named after the famous chief, but decided to enlist as opposed to stay on the reservation- they were Americans after all this time passed, after all...and if the Russians wanted to ally with the Turians then so be it. He’ll personally match up to Stalingrad with the Sangheili and burn the armor off of their metallic-scaled corpse if need be. 
Gently, he slapped Lak on the chest, which prompted a hiss and a sword draw from the Sangheili field Marshall.

“Easy there big fella, it’s a playful gesture”

“In my culture, any sign of battle is a sign of sword draw. I stay my hand”
The elite deactivated his sword with a flick of the wrist, placing in on his magnetic hip holster. Humans were strange. 

“-anyway, plan is, you use your plasma bombardment to burn out the shields and crew. Ground invasion sweeps in, and we show those plum fucks the what for. It’s simple- mostly because everyone will be dead on both sides. Sound good?”

“My sword will burn with the color of the blood of heathens”

“Sounds like a yes”

If only it had went that smoothly. Five hours in, and all ships were grounded from damage. Lak and his crew were mostly intact, though the Ruso-Sino border was now cluttered with a two kilometer long Sangheili capital ship, and a bunch of Turian vessels. The green berets picked up the crew members and began a march to Moscow that was almost entirely passive.

Upon reaching the city limits, all hell broke loose. Kreav Mortumee, Lak’s nephew, was stabbed by an omni blade by a Turian assassin before bullets, mass effect relay weaponry and plasma began spraying in every direction.

“COWARDS! You wish to hide in the shadows, then we shall chase you back into them! Sangheili, active camouflage!”

Pontiac led the green berets into an alley way where they hid inside a bakery while the fighting ended...

The Turian commander looked around, confused.
“Snipers, movement?”
No answer...
“Sn-“

A body dropped behind him from a second story building as a cloaked elite jumped down shortly after. Lak soon followed.
“Your soldiers were easily dispatched. You have led your family into a dishonorable maneuver, and they died because of your cowardice”
“For a group that values honor, you seem to have camouflage capabilities too”

Lak snapped and rushed forward- the Turian was able to hold back the Sangheili using the side of his rifle- about like fighting a krogan. At first...until the metal casing on the rifle began to crack, and the turian’s scales began to grow numb. The sangheili’s body weight alone was about to snap the rifle, and his strength was cutting off circulation on the turians arms. His biceps alone were bands of pure steel, and it was obvious that Lak was putting fourth very little effort- suddenly, his left leg gave out, surprisingly, allowing the Turian to reach for his side arm with a shit eating grin. But before the Turian leader could cry out, Lak rolled backwards and performed a high kick, which crushed the commanders face into a flat pancake, blood gushing out from all sides. The 900lbs saurian was nothing but muscle, like the rest of his kind. For him to be the leader of his family, he had a lot more than a last name and good genetics on his side. A lifetime of fighting and training- even after earning his title- had left him the strongest of the Mortumee’s.
“Now, as we march upon the winter-humans’ vile abode, shall we burn them until they are but glass!”

The other Sangheili warriors roared out, igniting their energy swords and thrusting them into the air as the green berets formed up with the squad of intergalactic warriors. The Russian guard began to pour out with turian’s mixed into the ranks, seconds before the gunfire began however...

I check my watch, three o clock and I'm only at Vlad? Christ this is getting harder.

The door opens, a bare, sweaty chest appears - just above, peering down at me, blood red eyes in-between pale skin and long black hair.

""Mister John."" He greets me in his this European accent, edging the door closed a little as his eyes widen. ""This is most... irregular.""

""It's Tuesday, Vlad. And like last Tuesday I'm wondering where your rent is. At this point it's getting to the definition of regular.""

""Ah no, you see I sent you a raven..."" He slides through the gap in the door toward me and shuts it behind him, quietly.

""What did I say about Ravens Vlad?""

""Not to pester you, with the ravens. But I thought, If to do with rent-""

""I said no ravens. Stop sending ravens.""

""So how do I reach you, about the rent? I try - I send raven three days ago, Mr John and my raven, he does not return-""

""Vlad. Stop, Vlad. I do not have access to a bird based communication system. If you want to reach me about your payments you've got my number-""

""I no have number.""

""You-""

I sigh.

""I'm going to give you a new copy okay, this is my card, you can see there's email and a phone number on there.""

""Maybe I give this to my familiar yes? He is more... modern, than I am.""

""Yes why not.""

""Okay. Thank you Mr John!""

Vlad shuffles himself around, eyes glazing over, and goes to turn the handle.

""Vlad- Vlad! The rent?""

""Oh...""

""You're a week late now. I'm going to need it by the end of the day.""

""Oh. And you are to paid in?

""U.S Dollars.""

""Dollars, yes. Not...""

""Not a promise of eternal life.""

Vlad frowns, and looks quizzically back toward his door.

""What about virgins?""

""Virgins?"" 

""How many virgins?""

""Vlad I'm not putting a monetary value on a human being that's *slavery!*""

""No, no. Slavery, you are slave forever - virgins, they won't be virgins forever you understand?""

""U.S Dollars. End of the day. Understand?""

He begins to curse to himself in his native tongue, but he retracts into his room and I see him pocket the card I'd just handed to him. I scratch a question mark next to Vlad's name on the list, and progress down the corridor. At the next door I stop and knock.

It swings open and I'm face to face with a girl at the tail end of her teens. A short cut pajama top leaves space for a midriff before the band of her skimpy shorts. She leans up against the door, blinking her big blue eyes up at me.

""Can I help you?"" She bites her lip.

""U.S Dollars. End of the day.""

The girl's flirtatious stare holds, before her body snaps, contorts, and downright breaks her into the shape of an ugly old hag, skin wrinkled and cracking.

""Fag."" She sneers, slamming the door between us.

""Yup Vol, it's rent collection day. I think that's how you say it.""

""Can I just use PayPals or summin?"" Volonius asked.

""After what happened with K'Zama, PayPal isn't an option.""

""Damn krakens. They's is a buncha cheapskates."" Volonius muttered, scratching his crimson colored chest.

""I still need the money.""

""Yeah, yeah, I's is gettin' it."" He pulled an extremely crummy and damage wallet from God knows where, reached his clawed hands in, and pulled out the money. ""Here ya go sweetheart. See you next month.""

""Thank you Vol.""

""Have a nice one Ms. Brycen."" Volonius closed his door, and resumed his rock music.

Next up on the list was... Karina and Lorana. Dammit, they're always trying to weasel their way out of paying. Succubi are pieces of shit.

I took a deep breath and knocked on the door.

""Who is it?"" Lorana said in a sing-song, almost seductive voice.

""It's Marie. Rent's due.""

The door opened almost immediately. There stood Lorana, dressed in the normal succubus attire, which was close to nothing.

""Lorana, could you at least-"" 

""Shhh..."" She placed her finger on my lips,"" Oh miss Brycen, you look so tense. What's the matter?""

""I need the rent money.""

""Little Marie, always so quick and stubborn. Why don't you just relax, come sit down, maybe slip into something more comfortable,"" She got extremely close to me, and I could practically feel her lips brushing against mine,"" Like me."" 

I pushed her away,"" We aren't doing this shit again. I need the fucking rent money.""

Lorana put on a pouty face,"" You're no fun. Come in, I have the money.""

I walked in, and the room was actually quite nice. For immortal seductresses, they know how to keep a place tidy.

""Hey Karina!"" Lorana shouted,"" You got the rent money?""

""What?""

""Rent's due!""

Karina walked out and saw me. She immediately smiled and walked over,"" Rent's due already? I thought it was due next week. I don't have my share yet."" She placed her arm around my shoulder,"" There has to be something that can-""

""No. I need the money.""

She glared at me angrily, I could see the hellfire in her eyes.

""Don't try that demon shit on me Karina. I've dealt with succubi way more persuasive than you too.""

Her eyes went back to normal,"" You insult me Marie."" She pulled out the money and handed it over.

""Alright. Thank you for your time.""

Lorana grunted and walked away. I closed their door and walked over to Moromiri's room, hopefully Oni's are better than succubi.",Papahardt

"[WP] You're a landlord renting out your haunted mansion to other supernatural beings, such as vampires, witches, succubi, werewolves and etc. Collecting rent is sometimes difficult.",IkeKashiro,"I shifted the rent payment system about 4 years ago, when one day I walked into Stanislaw draining the blood of a cat naked.  

The one condition I had is to avoid this sort of fuckery in my mansion. If anyone sees this, it would be a public relations nightmare and bad for business.  

Instead of collecting the rent on a specific date of the month, I've split it up to different days depending on who's due.  

For instance, Constanella, has been living in this mansion for about 16 years now, and she has always been quiet, reserved, and very obeying. Sure she can turn into a dog and attack the shit out of you, but her knowing the repercussions of such an attack is what is stopping her. It's a relationship that works both way, don't bring fuckery, and you won't face trouble. Simple as that.  

She was tall, pale skinned, red haired with horns, pointy ears, and and a pair of wings. She fought back at first, but now obeys the conditions of her employment.  

I trained Constanella how to please her audience, and how to possess theatrical features that mimic the highest of performers; that was what sold the show: professional, harmless, and can provide exciting experiences to her visitors. She does what she has to do, always.

I faced some trouble training Garcelaso, as his emotions would agitate his mind and would instantly be able to control your thoughts. I was able to solve that by blindfolding him however and have a robotic voice talk to him, making him unable to target the voice's thoughts.  

**""HEY JOHN, DID YOU GET THE RENT YET?""**  

**""NOT YET HONEY, I WAS JUST TELLING THOMAS HERE WHAT HAPPENED TO HIS FRIENDS""**  

**""OK. COME TO BED ONCE HE OBEYS.""**  

**""SEE YOU SOON.""**  

*Thomas, blindfolded, was sobbing through the whole time John was speaking, having no idea what he was saying. Last Thomas remembers was him walking back to the train station after a night of binge drinking.*

This time of the month gets a later crazy, so I took that last minute to collect myself before making my calls.

First name on the list was Mr. Robert Cottingham over in Wilshire, a sleepy wooded community. I knew before I dialed that it would go to voice mail, so I wasn't surprised in the least by the message, and I patiently waited for the beep.

""Rob, hi! This is Sven with Otherealm Realty. Sorry for calling at this ungodly early hour. You were probably out late last night. But I needed to remind you that the first of the month is tomorrow, and you're still a month behind on that secluded cabin of yours. Mr. Bramley needs me to bring all my accounts up to date.

""Look I realize that we had that blood blue moon last night, and you'll still be in your cycle tonight. In you'll excuse me, that's part of the reason why I'm calling instead of dropping by in person. Speaking of which, if you get this message by, say, noon, they'll be pretty of time to make into the office and get home. Or you can do a secure money transfer on the website. You can even wire it old-school, if you like.

""Okay, I'm rambling. You can reach me at the office. Number's on the statement. Have a good day, Rob. Talk to you soon. It's Sven from Otherealm. Bye.""

Putting the phone back on the receiver, Sven checked off the first name on the list. He put down the pen and picked up his cup. The next call was the Van der Klej brothers, probably OR's oldest clients, in at least one sense of the word. They've haunted the same old wooden house for three centuries now. Wilhem has always been punctual, handling everything through accountants. I wonder if they'd frightened another off -- they once scared on to death, accidentally, when the books didn't seem right.

Whatever. That wasn't my business. Collecting the rent was. I picked up the phone and punched the numbers. Even if no humans were there to pick up the phone, the machine was probably on speaker.

""Wilhem, good morning! It's Sven from Otherealm! Can you have a corporeal servant return my call. The rent's due and there's been an issue. Nothing frightening, heh heh. I'm sure it's nothing. Give me a call. It's Sven.""

Five more calls, and then make rounds. I hated making rounds.

[IP] I guess this is goodbye...,Ink_Savant,"Tara and Sam climbed the stairs to the monorail platform slowly, hand in hand. By unspoken agreement they lingered on each step for longer and longer the closer to the top they got, as though last train's whistle hadn't just sounded in the distance. 


They had perhaps two minutes left together before the train arrived to take Tara home and neither spoke for the first minute. Sam and Tara stood on the empty  platform a mere foot apart, staring into each others' eyes, thinking about all that had happened since they'd last been here two days ago.


It felt like the first time, apart from when they'd slept together, that silence had reigned between them.  The past 48 hours had been non-stop talking about life and death and everything and nothing and now, Sam felt like he couldn't say a word without crying and Tara felt like there was nothing to say but farewell. 


She wished with all her heart that she didn't have to but the train's whistle was getting nearer and nearer and so prodded, Tara spoke. ""Well Sam, I guess this is goodbye."" 


He looked down, down at her bag that he was holding, so that Tara couldn't see the tears that were brimming.  He tried to imprint on his mind the memory of her: jet-black hair that danced in the small wind, soft brown eyes that seemed to only see the best in people, and the smile she said only he could tease out of her. 


""Not forever, I hope,"" Sam said quietly, so quietly he had to repeat himself.


""Of course it won't be forever!"" Tara wrapped him in a hug that threatened to crack ribs.  ""I already miss you and I haven't left yet,"" she spoke the words directly into Sam's ear and they loosed the waiting tears.


They held each other only for a moment before the train finally arrived.  Sam pulled away from the hug enough to kiss her, then Tara was taking her bag gently from Sam's unresisting hands. It was time for her to go and finally, the tears were coming to her too.


""I've been waiting for this weekend for so long and it's already over,"" Tara said thickly. The train doors had opened and they looked to her like the gaping mouth of some awful monster.


""I don't want you to go."" Tara took a step towards the waiting mouth.


""I don't want to go.""  Another reluctant, forced step.


""Then stay!"" Sam pleaded, though he knew she wouldn't.


""I wish I could."" Tara stepped onto the train quickly and suddenly, before her better judgement was eroded by her aching heart.


The doors didn't close right away and they could stare into each others' eyes again, this time several feet away.  Soon to be separated by the train's door, an inch of steel, plastic, and composite materials, then by a thousand miles of empty grassland and forests and mountains.


The seconds ticked by, agonizingly slowly.  Neither spoke again, each thinking about how much they missed the other.  A chime sounded, the signal for the doors to close and for lovers to part. There was a hiss of compressed air, then Tara took a step forward off the train, onto the platform, and back into Sam's startled arms.  


It was the bravest thing she'd ever done, right after travelling a thousand miles to meet an online stranger and she didn't regret it for a moment and neither did Sam.",StilesLong
[IP] The Soul of Loneliness,Ink_Savant,"It had been twelve days since Seth had entered the Mentathlon. Twelve days since he had seen sunlight or tasted fresh air. Twelve days counted on body rhythms and occasional pangs of hunger. He was amply stocked with dry rations, having almost doubled his supplies since looting the corpse of a forgotten convict, but had resorted to drinking what slimy, foul water he could collect from rust-lined rivulets that occasionally crawled down the walls.

His chance of survival was almost zero but, in theory at least, higher than average; Seth was a lotteryman and wore the ill-fitting purple jumpsuit with dignity despite his reluctance.

Seth had been exempt from entering the Mentathlon due to his profession as a blacksmith. Both of his parents had been in protected professions and were determined to ensure he was too, but Seth lacked the mind to be a doctor like his mother and failed to pass the government examination that would have allowed him to succeed his father. As a hastily organised resort, he was pushed into service as a blacksmith producing cold iron for the military to keep the Damned at bay.

It was a hard job, physically draining and interminably boring, but one Seth’s parents expected to carry him into old age, or until the Damned overran the Capital, or until someone beat the Mentathlon, whichever came first. They had not counted on the hoards of the dark realms to develop an immunity to cold iron, and neither had Seth.

While some specialist weapons manufacturers remained in their jobs, most of the blacksmithing force had been made redundant overnight. Some specialists were relocated to factory work. Most of the profession was enlisted in the military, their conscripts' uniforms delivered by captains and surprise the next morning. Seth, however, was summoned to the high altar.

The high altar stood in the centre of the Capital, where long before Seth was born the streets had been lined with banners and thronging crowds cheering on the first to enter the vast cube of the Mentathlon. The gods may have abandoned their plaything-world, but the people were still optimistic in those days that their parting gift would save them from their doom. Now, those entering the Mentathlon were barely given a second glance.

The Methathlon itself was the tallest building in the city by far, the colour of tarnished brass and perfectly smooth on each face but for the single door that offered entry. Inside was a maze of narrow corridors, lethal traps and mind-shattering illusions—a detailed if often highly symbolic representation of the human mind. Progress was hard won through feats of physical endurance, ruthless cunning and moral standing. Paths opened by failure were indistinguishable from those that lead to the prize. Seth had been unsure within mere hours of entering whether he was headed anywhere other than aimless oblivion.

Many had come before, and over the first two days Seth saw quite a few who had not made it very far. Most wore the orange-and-white uniforms of criminals condemned to the Mentathlon in a professed attempt for someone—anyone—to gain the demi-godly power that was promised to lie at the end and defeat the Damned. Seth doubted the government had any real idea how to control the convicts after they ascended to become avatars of the lost gods, but then the government didn’t honestly expect them to succeed. Even if they had the strength, and possessed far greater cunning than the average lawbreaker it was almost certain they would fail at the first moral dilemma they faced.

Perhaps an even worse idea than sending in the ‘convicts’ was allowing in the ‘touched’. Madmen and deranged women garbed in black and unable to survive in the outside world, abandoned by society into the labyrinth of the uncaring gods.

After the second day, fewer bodies lingered in the cold, damp halls and Seth had still not seen any in the purple jumpsuits of conscripts like himself: the lotterymen. What did it say about him that he chose a path only selected by the insane and the evil? What would have happened if he had laid down in resignation before the Chimera of Despair? Had he picked the right tunnel from the Chamber of Riddles? Should he have let the Gryphon of Ambition tear the Lamb of Restraint apart rather than chase it away?

There was no turning back, only turning away. The dim light of another challenge seeped around the next dismal corner. Loneliness lay ahead: he could feel the despair of isolation in his soul as he turned the corner.

A woman lay against the wall, dressed in orange and white: a convict. Her hair was long and golden in the crude light, which buzzed with illuminated insects. More surprising was the trail of flowers and fronds reaching up the opposite wall. Behind her, from a narrow slit, vines bound and held her to the wall.

Seth approached cautiously. The woman stirred.

“Help… me…”

Her voice was dry and almost lost in the buzz of insects. Seth lingered away from the plants, ready to flee if a vine snaked its way towards him. “What is your name?”

The convict blinked her wide eyes. “Just… Help me…”

Seth shook his head. “I need to know you’re not part of this trap. If you’re a real person, you’ll have a name. What is it?”

“Sue.”

“Okay, Sue,” he looked around, inspecting the scene. “What’s the snare here?”

“I was so lonely. I stopped here to enjoy the flowers. I know they are only flowers, but it was the first time I saw something living—something *real* I mean—in days. So I thought…”

“You thought they would be company enough?” Seth realised, feeling in the depths of his own being that the flowers were more alive than a mere plant ever could be.

“The plants have souls,” the convict whispered as though reading his mind. “I can hear them.”

Seth listened, but only heard the drone of bugs in the air. “What do they say?”

“They say we don’t need to be lonely any more. Oh… oh gods! Help me! They say we will be put away with all the others. Please! Please! I’m not ready to die!”

The woman began struggling against the tendrils of green, which only seemed to tighten as she did.

“Stop,” Seth ordered. “Stop!” He knelt by the woman, drew his knife and slipped the blade under the vine. As he gripped the plant with his other hand the knife fell from his grasp, and he looked down in terror as his fingers receded into his palms. He was retracting. Shrinking. He clambered back from the Spirit of Loneliness on his stumped elbows and knees, pressing himself against the wall as her eyes flashed a demonic red. And there he remained, a solitary wildflower, no longer alone and part of a thriving community.

The flowers did have souls; Seth could hear them now. “We tried to warn you,” thy rustled delicately. “We tried to tell you would be put with the rest of us.”

[WP] A local bartender regularly willingly hosts monsters and demons in his bar. When terrorists kidnap his children they learn the hard way how close he is to them.,MetalShina,"Theodore, Eoghan and Meph stared at the ransom note left by the bar.

It was glued on in single letters, to a single matte sheet of paper.  *We have your number, and your children.  You will be contacted about the location of the drop.  We require $20 million in non-sequential, non-scented, unmarked bills.*

Meph looked at his close friend and bartender Theodore.  He knew he was in pain, and had to rein in his tomentor nature.  ""You know what?  We're gonna sort this for you, right?""  He snorted, a small belch of sulfurous flame leaving his nostrils.

Eoghan shook his head, not in disagreement, but to clear something out of his mind.  As an avatar of change and the greatest disciple of Eris, he had to do that a lot.  ""Aye, wee laddie,"" Eoghan spoke, a thick, deep Irish voice rang out.  ""I'll get me axe out for ye, and go a-choppin' with me friends.  We'll get  ye' childers out o'there.""

Theodore brought them in for an embrace.  ""Thank you.""  He spoke with a bitterness and upwelling of joy that would instantly break the Bartender's Code if it ever got out.  ""I don't deserve you guys!""

Both Eoghan and Meph shook their heads.  Meph spoke before Eoghan could get a word in sideways.  ""Nonsense!  Who was it who helped me out when I had that cataclysmic falling-out with Lilith?  And who helped Eoghan recover his dark axe, the Sender?  

""It was you, with your calm words, and stoic resolution, and the positive advice you gave.  If we didn't help *you* in your hour of need, then we'd never get to live it down!  We know who you serve here, and it's not the heroes and the investigators.  You serve the bad guys.  You let us in, even though you know we could turn to to ash simply by blinking wrongly at you.""

""You need us, so it's *our* turn to help *you*.  Muahaha.  MUAHAHA!  **MUAHAHAHAHAHA!!!**   ...I'll stop now.""  Eoghan, in answer, clapped Theodore on the back of his shoulder, hefted his black axe, the the three left.

/   /   /   /   /   /   /

The drop point was under the fountain in Picadilly Gardens in nearby Manchester.  Meph and Eoghan were waiting, to see who came to pick up the case.

In the surrounding area were three gargoyles, two Frankensteins, seventeen lesser Devils and three Byakhees.  Meph a was little surprised at the byakhees, seeing as they had been under contract to other people right at that point.

Everyone held their breath, as three small figures, wrapped in full Islamic dress, started looking around furtively, approaching from the bus station just to the side of the Gardens.  They stopped, looked at each other, and tensed.

Eoghan opened his eyes  at that point and spoke a single word.  ""*Chaos.*""

Everything happened at once and struck.  The three figures were frozen in horror and terror.  They may have been used to the recent lifting of the Veil, but not even hardened investigators would want to come up against such a horde.

The three people lay down, completely prostrate.  Theodore approached from the Arndale Centre tram stop, and approached the fountain.  There was a sense of unease spreading across the Gardens, as clearly Something Spooky was going on.

Theodore approached the three figures, before unceremoniously ripping the headscarves off of them.  To the surprise of most of the demons and monsters, it was Theodore's three children, Emilia, Marcus and young but tall Uphemia.  Theodore held his fingers, massaging his nasal sinuses.  Eoghan literally howled with laughter.  Meph just grinned, an aura of flames rippling in time with Eoghan's laughter.

""....and *why*, children, did you think it was a good idea to do this?"" Theodore spoke, his mouth set in a grim line and frowning.  His children just looked at him, confusion abound.

Marcus spoke first, his voice belying his actual age of 25.  ""Well, Dad, we just wanted to meet the ghuys you serve!  And, seeing as you're working such long hours, and you won't let us in the bar..."" Marcus' voice trailed off as his hands shished about expressively, gesturing to the scene.  The young women nodded in agreement.  ""You always tell us the stories, but you never let us *meet* them.""

Eoghan was rolling around on ther floor, hooting like a dying ass.  Even the monstrous gargoyles held theselves with difficulty, trying not to show teeth.  Meph just looked at Marcus, and marcus began to blush, his long, dyed-blue hair shifting about in the soft winds.

Meph stepped over to Marcus, and offered his hand.  Theodore couldn't continue to look stern in the face of such a thing.  So, he offered his hands to his daughters, and pulled them up off the floor.

Theodore walkd off, his arms around the children.  Meph walked alongside them and Eoghan was left with the case.  ""So, what was in the case, dear Marcus?"" was heard as the group walked away.

Edgar put the smoke blackened phone down with a trembling hand. His babies, his Tara and little Vince kidnapped. What the Hell could he do ? He thought as he burst into tears. The terrorists didn't have to worry about him going to the police, the jackasses wouldn't believe him or care. 

Shadows crawled over the ceiling, down the oak planked walls to gather into a humanoid form on the floor. Simultaneously, a dirty light shone through the floor, and the stench of sulphur filled the air,  golden scales and eyes glittered as a dragon pulled itself from an inverted pentagram.

""Edgar ? What is wrong ?"" Mammon asked with only the undercurrent of a second, lighter voice and slight hiss. The three-pronged tail swept a few tables and chairs out of the way so that he could sit comfortably.

""Yes, Edgar. Why do you cry like the others children at my sight ? Why do yours not come to greet Uncle Shad ?"" Shad echoed, his eyes glittering orange under the bar's florescent lighting.

""T-they're gone, guys. They were taken from me.""

A thunderous roar shook the rafters, actually the whole building. ""Was it Heaven ? Can I barge through the Gates, slaughter the freaks and return them ? I hate them. Father doesn't need the freaks anymore, he has me.""

He dried his eyes with a tissue Shad handed him, it may or may not've been crystalized from the same. ""No, Mon, it wasn't Heaven. It was humans. The terrorists want money or it's Heaven for my kids.""

""They want to be greedy, do they ? My favourite kind of humans. By my wings, we will return Tara and Vince.""

----

""Uncle Shad, Uncle Mon ? Help !""

""Would you shut up ?! No one's going to help you."" Scott screamed, even as the light seemed to dim. He frowned when the coins in his pocket started clinking before the fabric of his jeans ripped. Silver coins suddenly floated in the air, numerous like the stars and glowing like meteorites. The, ""What the Hell ?"" that was on his lips never left as the ancient coins burned through his throat.

Vince grinned as the shadows lengthened and the ropes that bound him loosened. ""Way to go, Uncle Mon.""

""Uncle Shad, there's a guy on the other side of the wall there. He's the only one left now this guy's dead."" Tara chuckled, relishing the thought of what their captors would endure in Hell at Mammon's claws. An abrupt scream that cut off just as quickly as it started before Uncle Shad freed her too. Lucifer knew her adopted family was weird but she loved them. They'd always have her back, and her soul.

----

""Dad !"" Vince and Tara exclaimed, scrabbling off Mammon's broad back onto the cracked asphalt in front of the *Lucky Star*.

Edgar burst into fresh tears as he hugged his kids and Shad while patting Mammon's foreleg. ""Thank you so much. I-I don't know what I would've done without you guys. Tonight's drinks are on me.""

They withdrew into the bar as golden light and the whoosh of feathered wings filled the air. Mammon had finally gotten his wish to fight some of the Hordes of Heaven. Twenty minutes later, he set a bucket of ale before the dragon. ""Uh, Mon, you've still got feathers in your teeth and there're some on the floor too.""

""These were the cries that happened almost daily nowadays. I thought it was a wonderful time when the monsters, demons, angels, and other ""otherworldly"" beings made their presence known to us. Gone were the racial issues that always plagued the news. Gone were the social inequality. Gone were the religious debates. But now, there is a new type of racism. 


shortly after their presence was made, A lot of assumptions were made. Us humans had to know the answers to these assumptions, and they were a lot worse than we thought. Now, humans commonly degrade, spit on, and despise them. It did not matter that god essentially ended the war between the realms, that there were no more supernatural talents, that we were all mortal, including God himself. They were disgusting creatures that needed to be dealt with. 


Several activists, both within the demons and monsters, and humans alike called for equality. They looked to God for help in this matter, but God was shot two days later. Some say he did it just to say he killed God, others say it was political. But the human populace did not want to co-mingle with the beasts. One activist went above and beyond the others, however. A simple bar owner. an interview with him revealed that he believed that, no matter what you were, everyone needed a pint now and then. 


The bar was under a giant boycott, but it did not last long, as the human regulars still went, even though monsters and demons popped in from time to time. as time went on, they became regulars. The bar owner lost some of his human patrons, but he did not mind. 


A few months later, there was a huge outcry. a common bar fight happened between the humans. The issue was, they got a demon involved. the demon stood up for itself and injured a human pretty badly. That is when threats were made. Both to the demon, the barkeep, and his family. The Barkeeper ignored it though, just like the thousand other threats that were made to him. Until one day, someone has the balls to kidnap his family. 


He calmly went to the police and went on the news demanding his kids back. ""It is not fair to involve them when the issue you have is with me."" But the police sneered at him, and the news did not take him seriously to do anything about it. so he sent his friends to go get them. 2 demons and 2 monsters went and found where the kidnappers were. They not only saved the kids, but tied them up as well, and brought them to the police. The kidnappers definitely saw better days, and a few of them had broken ribs. The demons and monsters were cut and bruised, but that was all. The news tried to put a horror spin on it, but the humans knew what happened. The monsters put their own life in danger, to save human kids. 


Slowly, the racism started to disappear, and the co-mingling was better. and when it got better, I met your mother, Mary, at the local grocery store.""


""Whoa!"" Said the human/demon halflings. ""That is so cool!"" Aradom nodded. ""We were one of the first few to get married and have you kids. You guys will one day be the future of this world.""",Dradonus

[WP] A local bartender regularly willingly hosts monsters and demons in his bar. When terrorists kidnap his children they learn the hard way how close he is to them.,MetalShina,"Just as the door from the back entrance closed, Pete hung up the phone. It was a typical Wednesday night at The Spot, a dozen customers maybe a few more. The usual crowd, the regulars all in their usual places. 

Walking in Frank could sense an un-easiness in Pete, who usually greeted every customer, especially the regulars, with a howdy and ""what can i do you for?"". no such jovial greeting would come tonight. Frank scanned the room, nothing out of sorts. Pete's expression changing from un-easy to terrified. Which was a look Frank knew too well. It stopped him in his tracks. Then, Pete broke down into sob.

Just as Frank reach the bar to ask what was the matter, the words were uttered by a different, all the more comforting voice. Rebecca had been at the bar for just over an hour and noticed immediately the effect the call had had on Pete. She noticed Frank just as he was about to speak, and almost immediately regretted beating him to it. They hadn't been broken up that long, she had hoped he wouldn’t be here tonight. 

As Pete looked up at Frank, seeing him for the first time, then to Beki as, his eyes filled with tears all he could say was, ""they've been taken.""

Frank, bellowed out, ""bar’s closed, get out"" the command of his voiced back up by his considerable size. A few customers looked to argue, but the site of Beki at his side changed the minds of those that knew better. And those that didn’t seem to take their cue from everyone else. 
I lone customer stayed seated, at a back booth. The look of him, that of a man that didn’t do anything that wasn’t of his own accord. He glared at the 2 figures standing next to the sobbing man, then smiled. As he left his booth, he appeared to change, but didn’t.  A trick of the eyes, or maybe the mind. Frank looked at Beki for a moment like a question. but she waved him off, with a curt greeting. ""Sam."" 

""What's Happened?"" with a look less concerned and more annoyed. All three of them turned to the barman.

He made his way to his feet, then looked at them in turn. ""Someone has taken my kids. They want a hundred-grand in 3 hrs. Or they said they’d start hurting them. I don’t have that kinda money.""

The only thing the Spot had going for it was its clientele. Otherwise it would have been closed and out of business years ago. Not many places in Dallas are safe harbors, so business was steady if not abundant. Since technically no magic could be cast there and long ago a truce had made places like it a no-go for any of the various ongoing conflicts. people of all kinds had come to the Spot as a place to get away or do unsanctioned business. Pete had inherited the place from his uncle 10 yrs ago and had been its only bartender ever since. That’s probably why his wife left him. And unknown to Pete that’s exactly why his kids are now in danger.

""What can we do?"" Frank was a ""man"" of action. Or ""men"" of action as it were. After over 200 years he still had the notion to act first, think second.

It was that very human characteristic that had made Beki fall in love with him in the first place. It was also the thing that infuriated her the most about him. Though she did immediately agree with the sentiment, and added her own voice, ""Anything""

In only a way that he could, Sam sounded both sincerely concerned and bored, when replying ""perhaps we shouldn’t interfere."" The statement more to Beki than anyone else. Her look of reply would have killed lesser men. Sam's heavy sigh of relent, overly dramatic in it weight was the only further confirmation he provided.

Pete recalled all he could of his conversation. Helped along by Beki's gentle prodding and Sam's own manipulation. All Frank could do was watch, but his skills would come in handy soon enough. 
The caller had issued clear instructions. Don't involve anyone else, he would call back with a meeting place. This is where Frank could finally do some good. His father had been many things, genius among them. And after 200 yrs Frank had learned to grow with technology. He now worked as what is probably the world’s largest IT security technician. His larger than life size, strange appearance, and booming voice could be terrifying, if it wasn’t for his quick smile and genuine humanity. After mere moments the people he met felt not just at-ease but safe near him. Safer than they had ever felt in their lives.
It took him only a few minutes to set up the equipment that would be needed to trace the caller. That is, if the caller wasn’t more tech savvy then him. And it's unlikely that he is.
As they waited in the bar, Beki began to consider their current predicament, more than she had with the confidence of Frank by her side. Maybe Sam was right after all. Any time they interfered with in the affairs of humans things could go horribly wrong. Entire civilizations had fallen because of it in fact. But Pete was their friend and above all else she knew that Frank was going to help anyway. And she still loved him. She had hoped that Sam would leave with everyone else, but she knew he wouldn't. She had even hoped he would refuse to help them, even though she knew they would probably need him. even after more than millennia, it was uncomfortable for her to be around him. She had loved him too once, before, but that was a long time ago. And though they had been on opposite sides of that war so long ago, his nature was still her nature and their nature was still to protect humans. Angels are funny that way.

Sam was having his own thoughts about the predicament he found himself in. Nothing worse than being stuck in a bar in Texas, with your ex, her latest flame and moral dilemma you really have no choice in. It’s a county song that practically writes itself. He hated county music. Having spent the last couple of thousand years atoning for a mistake for which there is literally no atonement is one thing. Spending the evening in a human rescue adventure with your ex is a different kind of torture all together. 

When the phone rang the only calm person in the room was Frank. It was now his show, and this is what he was good at. As Pete answered the phone, the sinister caller on the other end of the line laid out in painful detail how things were going to go down. Little did he know the longer he took explaining exactly what was going to happen, the easier it was going to be for Frank to make sure nothing happened that way. When Pete hung up the phone, Frank smiled. ""We got'em""

Frank, Beki and Sam begged Pete to stay behind. Sam even tried to persuade him but to no avail. The man's will to save his kids was stronger than that. It was a gift Sam envied, and despised. Beki envied and admired. They finally relented and the four of them headed to the warehouse address Frank had pulled from his trace. the caller had tried to hide but Frank was better. And soon enough these kidnapers would find out what Franks other talent was. He had spent the first 100 yrs denying his nature. He's spent the last 100 reconciling, the man and the Monster. The man had tools to track these scoundrels. The monster would soon make them pay for causing his friend this pain. 

As they approached the warehouse, Beki immediately sensed that something was not quite right, almost as she was thinking it Sam said it, ""I've got a bad feeling about this.""
Almost on que the trap sprung, trapping the van of would be rescuers in an inescapable electromagnetic field. Stepping from behind the warehouse wall the man in black simply shook his head. “Thank you for being predictable but you should have stayed behind Pete this isn’t your war. We would never have hurt your children.”
Pete, Sam, Beki and Frank stare at the man, then at each other in confusion. Until Beki looks at Frank and sees the recognition in his eyes, the last sounds any of them heard before the explosion was simply a whisper from Franks lips, ""Van Helsing""",Thirtypackobud

When terrorists kidnap his children they learn the hard way how close he is to them.,MetalShina,"The first flecks of dawn’s light trickled into the fancy high-rise bar. All was quiet except for the subtle squeaking of glasses being cleaned by the young woman behind the counter. She worked mechanically, with no life in her movements. She didn’t even flinch as the rear door slammed open and noise flooded the room.

A terrifying assortment of gruesome creatures poured into the bar from the door as though through the gates of hell itself accompanied by a cacophony of growls, hisses, and moans that one could almost mistake as laughter. A towering figure with twisting horns and cruel claws approached the counter first, gingerly taking a seat and smiling at the woman with a mouth of wickedly pointed teeth.

“Mornin’ Mary! We had a great night, a round for everyone on me!” the monster proclaimed to cheers from his comrades.

“Coming right up Blue,” Mary said quietly, moving to fill the order without a hint of fear, or any other emotion for that matter.

Blue’s smile faltered as he looked at her curiously, noticing the tear streaks leading from her dead brown eyes.

“Hey hey,” Blue said, his voice now as gentle as it could be with its rumbling timbre. “There’s something eating you girl. What’s wrong? Can we help?”

The bar quieted as the others began noticing her distress. It seemed for a moment that she would remain quiet, but soon she opened up, her voice quivering. “I-I… It’s my kids. Some people took them. They’re demanding a ten million dollar ransom delivered to them somewhere in that old abandoned neighborhood down Hollis St within a day if I ever want to see my kids again. They said they’d disappear if they saw even a hint of the police. My husband is out trying to see if we can even get a loan that big. We don’t even have anything close to that kind of money! Why me? What can I do!?” Mary had thought herself cried out, but found new tears forming as she let it out.

The shocking assortment of creatures looked at one another in shock, each wondering who could be so cruel. Blue leaned over the counter and grabbed Mary in a bear hug that she melted into eagerly. After a moment he released her, leaning back with a dangerous gleam in his eyes.

“Fella’s, looks like that drink will have to wait, we’ve got overtime to do.” Blue said as he began stomping towards the door they had entered through.

Mary looked after him in surprise, “what are you going to do?”

He paused, looking back at her with a gentle fierceness, “what we do best. Find those kids.”

----------

Lance leaned against the wall of the shabby house twirling a butterfly knife with boredom. He glanced over at the two kids tied in the corner, reassuring himself they were still here. By the terror on their faces, he could tell they shouldn’t be a problem, but he really needed this to go smoothly. Hopefully the woman wouldn’t do anything stupid like bring in the police, then they’d never have their payday, and he might have to deal with those kids which would be unpleasant.

One of the other five, Nash, looked up at him nervously, “Lance, are you sure she’s good for it? This is an awful risk. What if she has mob connections?”

Lance rolled his eyes at the younger man. “Of course she is idiot. That bar of hers is fancy as hell, but it’s practically never open, it’s definitely a front for something. Plus, she’s way too squeaky clean to be with the mob. No, this is some white collar shady business. That kind of money is probably pocket change to her. We’ll get our payout and disappear to some quiet island somewhere, just chill out.”

Nash shifted nervously, “if you say so. Something about all this just gives me a bad feeling.”

“Oh so you’re a jedi now? Shut it and keep watch, this will be over soon,” Lance snapped at him.

He glanced back at the kids and saw them still where he’d left them. Had that closet door been cracked before? Probably, maybe he was a little jumpy after all. He grinned to himself. With the creaking of this old building he could almost imagine they were footsteps behind him and that those shadows in the corners were alive.

He squinted. Hold on, did that shadow just move?

Before he could take another breath, the room exploded into motion around him. He saw shadows move for sure this time. Scales, claws, tentacles, feathers, slime, fur, horns, and teeth were all in a sudden whirlwind about him as he was hit from multiple angles at once. In an instant he was on his back in tremendous pain and with the breath knocked out of him. Leaning over him was a terrifying visage of twisted horns, wicked teeth, and blue fur leering at him with eyes in which he could see his death reflected. He tried to let out what would have been the most primal scream of terror of his life, but there was no air in his lungs to release.

The figure spoke in a quiet growl that sent shivers down Lance’s spine. “You are lucky we don’t kill anyone these days, but if you ever think of hurting a child again, I’ll make an exception for you. We can find you no matter where you run. Nowhere is safe from us.”

Lance thought he could hear sirens in the distance and his head fell to the side as he began to lose consciousness from terror, shock, and lack of air. The last thing he saw was the kids, now unbound, hugging a huge green eyeball.

-----------

Mary looked up from the bar to twin shrieks of joy proclaiming, “Mommy!!”
She embraced her children fiercely as they ran to her, tears of relief and joy spilling down her cheeks, for the moment paying no heed to the menagerie of monsters filing in from the broom closet.

After a while Mary stood and beckoned to Blue, “come here you big lug.”
The two shared an embrace and Mary whispered to him, “thanks Kitty.”

“Anything for you Boo,” He said warmly.

She stepped back and smiled at the gathered crowd, then walked around behind the bar again. “Thank you all so much. Order up, Monsters Inc drinks free today!”

Three:  The incubus ignites it as it sails through the air.

Ten minutes later, the trio return to the bar, Emily riding on Krampus's back (the robot being barely able to support it's own weight, and the incubus not wanting to even imply any funny business) and after a phone call, the door swings open.

[WP] A local bartender regularly willingly hosts monsters and demons in his bar. When terrorists kidnap his children they learn the hard way how close he is to them.,MetalShina,"""Wait. We're going in there?"" asked the fifth.

The others laughed. ""That's the place!""

""But we can't! It's not... I mean, it's not even night yet!""

""But if we wait that long, we'll miss happy hour. Harry's got a really good happy-hour selection too. Good deals. You'll like it.""

""It's too populated. We should keep moving.""

Laughing again, the others clapped her on the shoulders reassuringly and nudged her inside. ""It'll be alright,"" said the first, as he held the door open for her. ""This place is different. You'll see, you'll see... Harry!""

""Oy! Gentlemen! Good to see you! You've brought a new face, too! Hello! Good afternoon, Miss. Why is such a handsome woman hanging out with such hideous company? You'd best be careful that their ugliness doesn't rub off on you."" 

The fourth put his hands on his chest and mocked a frown. ""How insulting! Hideous? Us?""

And the third put his around around the fifth. ""And a woman? Her?!"" 

They erupted with laughter. The fifth looked around them, confused at their cheer. As their laughter died down, her mind hung on Harry's words. She frowned to herself and whispered, ""Handsome?"" She felt warmth in her face, partly for being the butt of the joke, but maybe in part because she forced herself to admit that Harry was not terribly ugly, for a human.

""I'm guessing you're Five. It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm Harry."" 

""Five?! Do I look like I'm fi-"" she began, suddenly stopping when the first put his hand on her shoulder. ""I'm much older-"" she began again, but stopped at the first squeezed her shoulder gently.

Harry grabbed five menus. ""Tina, I'm heading back, can you take over?"" Turning to the five he said, ""Would you all follow me, please?"" and immediately lead them in a march to the back corner of the restaurant. 

On the short walk, the first explained, whispering to the fifth. ""Harry doesn't think you're five. He's just going to call you that. Just like he calls me 'One,' and so forth. You're new to him, so you're 'Five.'""

""That's for the best, I suppose."" She paused for a moment, then her eyes went wide. ""Wait! You didn't tell him *why* we don't use our real names, did you? Does he even know how important names are, to us?""

The first shook his head. ""Of course I didn't tell him. But you know what? Harry doesn't seem to need an explanation. He never asks the wrong questions...""

""...does that mean he knows?"" she whispered.

The first shrugged and turned toward the others while the fifth gave an exasperated sigh before joining them as well. When they were seated at the corner booth, Harry took orders. ""First round? The usual?"" he asked. ""One? Okay. Two? Okay. Three?"" He nodded. ""Four?""

""Yeah, but let's start with double.""

""Doable... And for the lady?""

The third chuckled. ""There you go again, Harry. What's with all this 'lady' and 'gentlemen'? You oughta know..."" As he trailed off, the third leaned over and snatched at the fifth's hat. ""You can clearly see...!"" The others chuckled at the third.

Before the hat came fully off of her head, the fifth's hands shot up and gripped the hat firmly back down. She looked up at Harry to see if he had noticed, but he appeared to be writing busily on a notepad. ""Miss,"" he asked, ""would you like a minute to look over the menu?""

She glared at the third, who uttered a quick apology. Then, after a quick look at the menu, she asked, ""Could you make a recommendation? I'm not sure...""

""Of course, I could... However, it's more fun to make your own choices. I'll bring out two sets of samplers so you can try a few things. Free of charge. How does that sound?""

""Free of charge sounds great!"" yelled the third.

Harry chuckled and pointed his finger. ""Not you! Alright I'll be back in a few minutes. Good to see you guys."" Then he turned and marched off toward the bar.

When the five were alone, the fifth sighed. She almost couldn't believe it. A corner booth in a normal bar in the middle afternoon? Abnormal. They passed the time with chatter and jokes until Harry returned. He set glasses about the table, along with two heaping plates of food. In front of the fifth he placed two small trays. One tray held ten shot-glasses with various liquids while appetizers crowded the other tray. ""Go ahead and try those out dear.""

""Dear?"" she whispered to herself.

 ""I picked a few things that I thought you might like. I'll be back in a few minutes. You can let me know what you think for the next round, yeah?"" Harry marched off again.

The others dug into their food, happily sipping from their mugs as well. The fifth tentatively picked up one of the shot glasses. She sipped. Then she sipped again. 

The first smiled. ""Good?""

She nodded.

""Try the next one.""

The fifth put the glass down and sipped from the next glass. She licked her lips and sipped once more. ""Are they all this good?""

""No. But Harry's got good taste, you notice?""

She tried the next.

---

Business slowed. After just an hour and a half, only a few tables were occupied and most were already settling their checks. But the five at the booth had no plans on leaving, at least not for another few rounds.

After four rounds, the fifth finally started to feel something close to comfortable. In fact, she wondered about the last time she had felt this way. At ease. Vulnerable. Inebriated. She might have even described this as fun. Part of her hated it. But another part of her couldn't help but feel the pull of this place. She glanced over to the bar to get another look at Harry. Then she heard the crash.

Bolting to her feet, she watched as the tray, full of glasses, fell onto the floor. The glasses shattered. The fragments sprayed across tile. And after the clinking fragments fell still, everyone in the bar turned to look, checking if Harry was okay.

But Harry ignored spilt beer. He even took a step backward, his shoe crunching against a bit of glass. He ignored the quiet of the rest of the bar. His eyes were glued to the television. Breaking news. Helicopter footage.

The five got up from their booth, moving to Harry at the bar to see if he was alright. When Harry didn't respond, they too looked at the television screen. The first frowned, understanding.

""What? What's the big deal?"" asked the fifth.

Suddenly Harry rushed for the door, keys in hand. He would have made it, if the first hadn't grabbed Harry by the arm and shoved him down into a chair. In the scuffle, Harry's phone clattered onto the floor, actively vibrating and blinking.

""Where are you going?"" said the first, keeping his hands on Harry's arms so that he could not rise.

Through angered breaths, Harry spoke evenly. ""I'm going there.""

""No. Think clearly."" The first projected calmness. ""It's late. School is over by now. They'd be at home. They're fine.""

Harry shook his head. ""There's... no... Let go. Please.""

""They're home, Harry,"" insisted the first. ""Just sit. Just think.""

""No. No! There's an event tonight. A play. They're helping. They were staying after. They were supposed to stay until the end. I was going to pick them up later tonight. They're definitely there!"" Harry jerked upward. The first effortlessly forced him back down into the chair. 

""Okay. And if they're actually there. Did you even listen? Did you see the footage? Did you take a moment to even look?"" The first took Harry by the chin and turned his face toward the television. ""Sit. Think.""

Harry tried to wrench free. ""There's no time to think, One!""

""There is always time to think!"" the first roared. ""What would you even be doing? What could you even do in a situation like this! BE STILL AND THINK.""

The few remaining patrons in the bar left their money on the tables and scuttled out the door. 

""Now listen, carefully, Harry. I'm sorry to tell you this, but even if you left now, even if you were there at this very moment, there would be nothing that you could do. Do you understand that?""

""But-""

""DO YOU UNDERSTAND?""

The fifth took a step back. She had never seen the first this way. She looked at Harry and gritted her teeth. She watched him cry.

""Now listen. You will stay here. You will clean up the mess. I know the place. We will be back in thirty minutes. We will bring them. Do you understand?""

""No! You can't! That's not your-""

The first tightened his grip on Harry's arm. ""You. Stay. Thirty minutes."" The first turned to the fifth. ""Your job is to keep him here."" The first turned to the others. ""The rest of you. With me. Now."" The other three nodded and immediately made for the door.

The fifth slammed her hand on a table. ""No! Harry's right! We can't go there!""

They paused.

""It's too crowded! What if they see? What if they catch you? You just told him to think! Think think think! And look at you, storming out the door! What kind of thinking is that? You'd take such a risk for what!? For him?!""

""For him?"" The first turned back for a moment. Then he looked at Harry. ""For him I would risk much more.""

Harry stared for a moment. Then he shut his eyes, fresh tears falling.

""But this?"" continued the first. ""For this there is no risk.""

""What do-""

""Keep him here. Thirty minutes."" The four walked out the door and stood for a moment on the sidewalk.

Harry looked at them through the glass door. He muttered, ""Where does this thirty minutes even come from? You couldn't get there in thirty minutes if-""

Harry cut off his own sentence with a sharp gasp; out on the sidewalk, the four removed their coats.",TechnicalBovine

[WP] A local bartender regularly willingly hosts monsters and demons in his bar. When terrorists kidnap his children they learn the hard way how close he is to them.,MetalShina,"""Stars and stones Mac, I didn't know you had grandkids.""

Mac looked at me over the bar.  A single drop of blood from his split lip stained his immaculate white apron and his hand shook as he cracked open one of his impossibly good homebrew ales.  He pushed the beer across the bar to me with his left hand, a worn poleroid of two summer-blonde kids with gaps in their teeth pinched between his bruised knuckles.

""Hells bells.  What happened to you, anyway.""

Mac blinked slowly once, and stared pointedly at the photo, which he lay on top of a napkin next to the beer.  I couldn't remember the last time Mac had asked me for so much as to settle up my bill with him.  In fact, to my knowledge he'd never called in any favors.  Ever.

Mac was the sort of person people owed favors to.   His pub was a hole in the wall place downtown.  It's been there  forever; has a big, hand lettered wooden sign out front that says ""Accorded Territory.""  The thirteen wooden pillars, thirteen tables, and thirteen fans overhead dissipate magical energy astonishingly well, which is why I can hit my head on the fans without shorting them out.

If Mac was calling me in it was serious and I have a soft-spot for kids.  Fatherhood will do that to you.  Still, running down whomever -- whatever -- had the cajones to take on Mac in his own pub was going to be tough.  Literal demons from the Outside thought twice before crossing Mac.  

I felt the chill breeze outside before the door eased open and I found myself rising to my feet as Mac's chin jutted out in greeting to the woman who flowed with easy grace down the steps and over towards the bar.  Summer heat shimmered on the pavement at the top of the steps but around her white, stiletto heals, snowflakes swirled.  She had a voice that could give you goosebumps and melt chocolate at the same time.

""I received word that you required my aid, Watcher.  I'm always glad to repay a favor.""

Mac grunted.  ""Few more comin'""

""Long time no see, Queenie"" I grinned, and bowing in a way that was not at all sarcastic or immature.

""Shut up, Wizard.  Mac, just a cup of coffee for me, thanks but if you have lemonade, my sister will be along shortly.  Now tell me, for we way as well get an early start, what happened to your granddaughter when she landed in Paris?""",Killfile

When terrorists kidnap his children they learn the hard way how close he is to them.,MetalShina,"Long before he could see the tavern, he could hear the music, a sweet fiddle he's come to love, yet all to mournful this time around. Betty had been on the road for a long time at that point; months since she had last been to the Floating Bed Inn. 
 
 The best spot in all Georgia. She thought to herself, nay mayhaps the whole states.
 “That's ‘fir damn sure!” she said aloud as the Inn came into view amidst a cut in the road, surrounded by rather large, ominous trees to both sides. The woman, in the loose fittings of a vagabond, had been walking all day at that point, with the sun well behind the world by the time she had arrived. She mostly got around hitchhiking these days, a fun game in itself it turned out to be, but she just couldn't bring her last bit of heat around these parts. 
 
*Innkeep wouldn't like that.*
*Nay, he dont like having to much heat around the place at all.*

It was the Innkeepers efforts alone that kept the place nice and civil these days, although he wasn't always so civil about it. He downright scared every one of them.  
Plenty of Betty’s peculiar contemporaries felt the same way about the Inn and the Innkeeper. A nice spot where they can make an honest buck and get a good drink, something so hard to come by these days for her sort of folk.

As she neared the front entrance of the inn, She knew she wasn't mistaken; the fiddle playing this time around wasn't as chipper as it's supposed to be on a good friday night. 

She entered the door and was greeted by a rare scene. The Bar was occupied by its usual folk, the ugly sort they where. There were about four of them at the bar, solemnly conversing in hushed tones and only giving Betty a small glance in her direction, before returning to their talks and drinks. The Inn itself was dark, with a clearly brooding mood about it, she couldn't see much past the bar area, but she could tell well enough there were plenty of the usual crowd of patrons sitting at the tables, enjoying the air of this rare occasion. She couldn't see the fiddler, but his song to a turn into the weary as she took a seat at the bar.

Young Jimmy, the bartender, appeared from the kitchen as she sat down. He was, well young, the rest of his nondescript package didn't speak to her for much else, but she always had a need for the youthful ones. Lives around here it seems, Betty remembered seeing him the last time before he started working at the Inn. She had a few ideas for the boy at the time but the Innkeep had snuffed that thought out of her head with a sharp crack of the metaphorical whip. She very well stood down after that.

“Just gimme a tall one Jimmy” she said. She didn't care much for any of his conversation, he only ever says a little. 
“Oh well hey there Betty it's nice to see  ya around I sure say and all a Tallboy was it? Ok then a tallboy it is I gots me one dem right here now just for ya Betty” he brought out a wooden coaster from the bar “Just gone and’ take that I say the Innkeep aint feeling to well not might be indisposed to talk as it were but ill do well to keep ya company” 
He only ever said little, but he used too much words to do it for Betty’s taste.

“Come now take a few breaths there boy and speak like ya got some sense.”
She grabbed the can and opened it, bringing the beverage to her lips. It was bud, she didn't have any a specific preference for brands, it always did her right regardless.

“Well then what this bout the Innkeep, wasn't een asking fer em and ya bring em up like I got something nice for him, dont appreciate you talking like dat boy.”
“Just thats how it is this time round I suppose, he's done went through it an ah wasnt tryna set you up-”

Betty cut him off with a brisque gesture of her index finger. She knew he could go on at this pace for a good long while. *Mayhaps he’s just the nervous talker type* she thought to herself. The crowd this inn catered to was a strange lot indeed, and Betty, as normal as she appeared to be, would have to seem all the more terrifying  if she could navigate this crowd so fearlessly. 

*He was still new after all,* the last barkeep was ol’ Demora. The innkeeper's wife. 

*Wait*  she thought to herself *where is she?*
Mayhaps the boy was as keen as the old innkeep is, because it seemed as if he picked up her last question from her mind.
“The missus aint here either” he said “and Lil’ Emmy gone too.”
More than any feelings she had for Ol Demora, Betty truly enjoyed Lil’ Emmy for all those years. Wonderful child, she should be bout 18 now. Although those last lines heart, all at once Betty read the room at once, and the dorrow reason of the moon made itself clear. The way Young Jimmy said it answered more than a few follow up questions off the bat. The intonation of *a and they ain't comin back.* Omitted maybe out of respect of the company. But a few more questions occured to Betty.

“Well now then what happened to em?”
She had been on the road for a long time, lots of things would have changed anywhere but this little lot in Georgia, only famous for one song of a man who battled a demon in a fiddlin battle, wasn't prone to change very well. In fact it's stayed defiantly stagnant  in plenty of ways. Her folk liked it like that, and there were fewer spots remaining in these times.

“The damn Sons of the Quakers kidnapped em, right after you last left the city. He had been saving ya know, to get em out. He was gonna put em up in a more stable, safe spot and support em from there, what with the times an all. But they got em, rattled em up and he was gonna meet their demands, hell he was close-”
She cut him off once again, and chose to let the silence ruminate. This was a lot to take in for her, as much as she was publically trite with the Innkeep, they had had a thing at one point in life. It couldn't go on, they had remained cordial after that, in their own way, but she had a care to see the man succeed deep down. 

Knowing the state of affairs for the Innkeep today made her feel a sadness she hadn't felt in a long time. It visited her again like the old friend she was to the Innkeep. But it was only a visit for her, she knew for the innkeep, it would be much more permanent stay.

It was another patron, one she didn't recognize, some ghastly figure of a man, morose in his drink, that spoke next.
“I hear they went and killed em anyway, after he got the money together.”

The conversation came to a pause again as everyone went to their drinks, with Young Jimmy pouring himself a small shot. Jameson. Yea, seems like that kinda night. 

“Gon an pour me one a those too.” she said.

Betty had knocked back the shot, as she came down she eyed a framed picture on the wall Most certainly a new addition. Despite her now blurring vision, she recognized the legal paper, the rather fine size of the print, the officialnice of it all, and of course the signatures, all signed in that familiar red haze. A contract.

“And what's that all about?” she said, pointing to the new fixture,
“Oh that?” replied Young Jimmy, “well the boys got together wrote this here contract, lest the Sons folk  well… repudiate on their end of the bargain. And well they didn't and uhh”

He he brought the picture frame down, handing it to Betty for a closer look. 

“They were crafty bout it, most complex thing you could think of the clauses and deep an all they say. I mean well no one really expected them to honor the darn thing, but we you know the folks felt they had to get some respite for the guy in case it happens like that and-”
Betty cut him off again, examining the contract as she beat Young Jimmy to the point. 

She found the penalties for breach of contract.
“Oh these are nasty”
“Yea the boys worked along time on those, got real creative, and wouldnt ya know the way Mortimus framed it every single one da bastards face breaching charges too.” 

This whole time they had all been speaking in the usual hushed tones, with Young Jimmy coming off as more a whispered locomotive in Betty’s ears.

“And well, how's old Innkeep feeling, how longs it been?”
“I mean, a few months and all, and well, you can hear that right?” he said, noted the dreary plucking of the fiddle. 
“He's just been going on ya know, hell come too.”
At this, the tune the music was playing took a more bitter turn in the mood

Gus was not around... the Pub was in ruins... "" Urr Gus?  ""

"" They did, did they"" said Doc... 

"" what am I gonna  do?  I don't have money ... ""  Gus started to sob

"" No, but you have us. "".. The voice was old and dusty as if it was from some dark and ancient tomb.... 

"" Jack...?"" Gus stammered 

Just then the old Publican  noticed his three oldest customers seemed different. .. he crawled back into the corner.... with an incoherent  scream

"" Doc Did you have to eat that guy.?. the kid man.... "" Said Pete


"" I'm 16 "" the girl said.

When terrorists kidnap his children they learn the hard way how close he is to them.,MetalShina,"I was aiming for something like the voice of Pratchett's Death. Not necessarily loud, but very... final. A voice that doesn't imply a ""I will do my best to kill you"", but rather a ""You are already dead and nothing in heaven or hell can save your life or your mortal soul"".

So I guess the hoarse stage whisper or voice in the head concepts would both work nicely.

When terrorists kidnap his children they learn the hard way how close he is to them.,MetalShina,"There were only 5 of them: Two Furies, an Imp, a Wraith, and a Shadow. In the short time since Brad had opened his bar to their kind, The __________ had become a favorite meeting place for the group as they wound down at the end of a week. This time the doors were chained closed a note was on the door: “Permanently Closed.” Brad hadn’t spoken of any ill times for the bar and business had been fairly brisk even when they had first shown up, the owner had made it clear that their money was as good as anyone else’s from the start. The Shadow, a dark shifting mass that never stuck to one particular shape was creating agitated waves at it’s edges. It never spoke, but everyone could understand it: “We must find out why.” 

Kyesh, the Imp, turned to the Furies, “Erinyes, can either of you Seek him out?” It’s normally raspy voice carried a tension that matched the blaze of it’s fiery eyes.

 Allochi, the taller of the two she-demons, closed her and took a deep breath. “I have him, follow me.” Before she could stretch her wings to fly, the Shadow had already expanded to include the entire group.” 

—————————————————————

“Jeezuss Christ!! How the hell did you get in here? What the fuck?!” Brad cried as the group suddenly emerged from the gloom that had just…appeared in his living room. The two police detectives who were there already had their guns out and pointed at the group. Kyesh extended his hand, “Don’t!” but even before they could comply Asher, the Wraith, had already rendered them unconscious and they slumped to the ground, eyes rolled back into their heads. 

“Jesus!” Brad exclaimed at the sight of the two policemen just withering away. He started backing away.

“Quit saying that like he exists.” Kyesh growled as he turned to the man. “Why is the bar closed?” 

Brad’s posture weakened as he found himself backed up against a wall, he looked down. “A bunch christian extremists just…they got my kids, guys.” The effort to fight the tears was visible in his face, and he ran his hands through his short gray hair. “They don’t like that I opened my bar to you guys…they told me I had to close the place immediately or they would kill my kids. I was just about to open so I grabbed a lock and chained the place up, then I called the cops. They’re looking…but there’s no trace of them right now.” 

Allochi walked up and placed her hand on his shoulder. Shimmering in her gown, she turned to her sister. “We’ll get them back for you.” 

He looked up, already very worn from the ordeal. “Guys…what do you think you’re going to do that the cops aren’t already doing?” At that moment, the entire mood of the group palpably changed: The two Furies smiled, the wraith’s transparent form seemed to grow slightly more opaque, and the Shadow’s agitated waves slowed down to gentle pulses of activity, like that of a lake gently lapping at the shore. Even the fire in Kyesh’s eyes seemed to glow a little brighter as his evil grin broadened: “Our jobs.”

When terrorists kidnap his children they learn the hard way how close he is to them.,MetalShina,"Jack put down the phone, his face a sudden ashen white. His hand trembled as he reached under the bar to grab a bottle of his best scotch. A bit of the obscenely expensive liquor splashed out of his glass as he poured himself a sturdy shot. 

He looked around the bar as the liquor burned through his core. He never bothered naming his bar — it was unique, so he figured there wasn’t much point to distinguishing it from any other place. He started it on a whim, and honestly didn’t think it would last for more than a few days. That was eight years ago. Most of his customers just referred to it as “Jack’s Place.” 

“Jack! You ok?!”

Jack snapped back, and looked down the bar to a few of his regulars, looking at him. “What? Oh, um, sorry Fen. Um, no, not really ...” 

Fenrir eyes narrowed as he looked at Jack. “What’s wrong?”

Jack looked at Fenrir. Fen was one of his first regulars, and had been coming to the bar almost every day since it opened. After a long night of heavy drinking, Fen had confided in Jack that it was one of the only places others were comfortable being around him. With a reputation like that, Jack figured it might be the only place. 

Keeping a steady hand on the bar, Jack moved closer to Fenrir and his companions. They were a motley crew — a group that would only come together at a place like Jack’s. “I ...” Jack gulped. “I got a phone call. Someone took my kids. They want money ... or ... or they’ll ...” Jack paused; took a breath. “They say they’ll kill my kids if I don’t give them what they want” 

Fenrir looked at Jack. He studied Jack’s face, and saw behind the usually stoic exterior and saw the fear and loss Jack felt. Fenrir had never seen that in Jack before — this place existed because of Jack, and, despite his clientele, Fenrir had never known Jack could feel fear. 

Fenrir set his jaw, and a low growl rumbled from somewhere deep inside him. He turned towards his friends, all of whom he had met at Jack’s, and looked to each in turn. Everyone nodded. Fenrir turned back towards Jack, “Tell us everything you know.”

Knaus stood slack at his station, keeping an eye out for anything moving in his area. Of course, nothing did. Guard duty was the most painfully boring job in the world, he thought, as his radio crackled. “All stations, report.” Knaus listened as the others checked, reporting nothing, until it was his turn, “All clear!” The last few reports trickled in while Knaus lit his cigarette, absentmindedly waving out his match as he took his first deep drag. 

Exhaling slowly, he tried to blow smoke rings. Anything to stave off boredom for a few more minutes; it wasn’t working. As he watched, though, something weird started happening with the smoke ... it seemed to be gathering itself into a single point in front of him ... as it formed itself into an opaque mass in front of him. Fascinated and curious, Knaus reached his hand into the smoky cloud-

Knaus’s neck snapped. As his hand reached into the cloud, his arm was pulled forward and his head was forced back. Bending grotesquely, his neck gave way and he collapsed in a heap. It happened so quickly, Knaus’s face still held the look of fascination. 

“Nice work, Alp,” Fenrir growled, coming up behind him. 

“Thank you,” Alp whispered in reply. “I’m one up on you, Fenrir.”

“Oh, don’t worry. I’ll catch up.”

“I repeat, all stations, report.” Jeremiah called, a hint of concern working its way into his voice. He looked towards his second, Carl, standing guard over the three kids tied up in the corner. 

Carl shrugged. “Did you check the batteri-“

Carl was cut short as the fortified door behind him burst from its frame and flew across the room, catching Carl in the shoulder and crumpling him to the floor. 

“What the ...” Jeremiah shouted as he rose from his stool, staring at the gap in the wall where the door used to be. A hairy, muscled man walked through the gap, striding directly toward Jeremiah. He was followed by two others, sliding in through door. 

“Diana, take care of the children. Alp, take care of him,” the man pointed toward Carl, who was moaning on the floor. 

Wolf-like. That was the word that came to Jeremiah’s mind as the man walked up to stand in front of him. The man stood there, arms crossed, looking at Jeremiah. Behind him, a sudden snap sounded, and Carl groaning stopped. 

“Who ... are you?” Jeremiah asked, his voice quavering. 

“I’m Fenrir. I’m a friend of Jack’s. And I have some questions for you ...”

————-

“Daddy!” JJ screamed as he ran toward Jack. 

“Kiddos!” Jack ran from behind the bar, gathering his three kids into his arms, kissing each of them on the head in turn, then going back through the order again — just to make sure. “You all ok?”

“I was scared, Daddy” said Sophia, the littlest of the three. “But then Ms. Diana and Fenrir and Alp came and got us”

“I know baby” Jack looked up at the three of them, standing in the doorway. “Thank you” he said, his arms wrapped around his three children. 

Fenrir walked back toward his usual place at the bar, shrugging as he went. “Don’t worry about it,” he said, hooking his leg over the stool  and settling back into his spot. “But the next round is on you.”

[WP] A local bartender regularly willingly hosts monsters and demons in his bar. When terrorists kidnap his children they learn the hard way how close he is to them.,MetalShina,"I had to take the call. I know the crowd, it's my duty to try at least. They're all good guys but i don't delude myself about who... about what they are. That's probably why we get along so well to tell you the truth. 

I was told to bring the money, to come unarmed. Why the hell they thought i could pull together fifty grand on short notice is beyond me, i brought twenty and a request towards the universe, a prayer if you will. Looking the empty warehouse up and down i take a deep breath before i start towards the open garage door, i walk through it and hear the chain and sheet metal clanking as it's lowered. Across the empty interior i see him, a little boy only six years old tied to a chair with a bag over his head. My son. ""Nathan"" i cried out. I dropped the bag full of money and started towards him instinctively, then i froze. A voice from behind me called out ""Stop!"" I did as i was told. I heard the zipper on the duffel bag but before i could turn around the same voice sharply advised against it. I heard a gun cock as if to enforce the point. I closed my eyes and prayed silently. ""Thefuckisthis?!"". I let out a sigh. No dice i guess. ""What is this? What are you doing, you trying to cheat us?!"" I wasn't given a chance to respond before the man started hollering ""Fucking cheat! You cheat us! Give me my money."" I waited for his tirade to stop before speaking. ""It's all i have to give you. Please, just take it and leave us alone."" The man scoffed ""No. No take, you lie. We see your customers, very rich. You get us our money or we kill boy!"" I tensed up in spite of myself ""What?!"" the man barked, noticing my change in body language ""You think you some kind of big tough guy? Johnwaynemotherfucker"" he said all crammed into one breath. I wondered briefly what kind of drugs this man might've been on before collecting myself once again to reply as calmly and non-combatant as i could muster. 

""Listen, friend. I never got your name but maybe that's for the best. I know you won't believe me but i really am here trying to do you a favor. I want to resolve this man to man, i'm-"" He cut me off again ""No. No man to man, you pussy. You do what we say or we kill boy!"" I bit down on my lower lip, i bit down so hard i tasted blood. I'd been running the goddamn bar for 25 years and not a single violent incident has broken out on my watch, warring clans of actual monsters sit down and break bread and now this... I tried one last time ""*Please* sir, you don't understand. It's for your own good just take the *fucking* money and go!"" The pleading in my voice gave him pause. Doesn't matter what kind of scum you are, you know honesty and sincerity and urgency when you hear it, but apparently Mr. Kidnappers next baggie of blow is more important than the life of my child. He fired the gun and i winced. The smoking hole in the floor next to my now crying son broke me. ""Okay"" I whispered in ashen resignation ""You win. Have it your way."" My final words as i walked back out through the warehouse door weren't do the man ""Please just, don't let him see anything."" The man laughed and before the note escaped to completion i could hear gagging, the gurgling wheez of a man trying to breathe through a bloody hole in his throat. More gunfire and screams and pleading. Like i said i know what they are. They are monsters. They're going to go in there like it's a party, chase those men down, screw with their heads and respond to gunfire with laughter and rend them limb from limb and kill them if they're lucky. If not, they'll be turned into slaves or worse. I shutter at the thought. 

I don't judge it. I don't question it. I'm only human, in this moment as i stand outside the warehouse clenching my fists so hard my nails bite into my flesh I'm just a man who wants to see his son safe and alive and i'd do anything to get that. ""Mike?"" a voice snaps me out of it. It's Ivan and he's carrying my son in his arms. All i can say is ""Thankyou."" 

I don't take the bag off of his head until we're home, he asks me a couple times but i tell him to just keep it on. I don't notice the blood on the steering wheel until i turn the car off. I don't let myself really feel it until Nathan had gone to bed. Maybe it's absurd but i wept for those poor fools whose desire brought them face to face with monsters. I don't hold it against them for being what they are, but it doesn't absolve my regret for having no other option than to give them the go ahead to savage these men. That was the rule. If i ever needed anything they were there, but the one and only rule was, i'm forbidden from questioning their methods. I'd never needed to ask for anything until now and i hoped i never would need to again. ",Eight216

""I'm telling you, Doc, I went back! And I'm sorry you don't like it when your nice shiny theories are wrong, but meteoric impact winter did *not* kill off the dinosaurs!""

""Don't be preposterous. Of course it did. It's widely accepted these days.""

""But Doctor, I've seen it. I'm telling you, you're wrong.""

""Then what *did* kill the dinosaurs, since you seem to have pulled a PhD from god-knows-where-you'd-keep-one in those fatigues?"" I'd been up for days, and the coffee I was trying to choke down was a poor substitute for a good night's rest and a dearth of blithering idiots.

""Get to the point, Sol.""

""Doc, it was a nuclear winter. Started by...us.""

Right now I can't believe I've permitted this idiot into my hire, even for the grunt work, as he'd say. I open my mouth to chastise him again, but he cuts me off.

""Listen, Doctor, it's not a joke. I'm not an idiot; I did actually go to school, courtesy of the military. There was a war. Humans, with *very* advanced tech. Took issue with the dinosaurs, wanted some land for themselves, the usual colonialist bullshit. Only, like I said, they were much better-equipped than the folks on the Mayflower ever were.""

""As to that,"" Sol said, glaring toward him, ""you'll have to ask him.""

Sol crossed his arms and glowered full-force at Mike, who was cowering guiltily behind what looked to be a - thankfully chained - brontosaurus, with - yes, a fucking *saddle* on its back.

""Now tell me what the *fuck* you've done here.""

[WP] You find out there is a Heaven and a Hell but there are some strange conditions that decide who goes where.,MrWiggleIt,"Hannah Hudson had to say that this was perhaps the closest Judgement she'd ever been a part of. 

As an Advocate, she'd seen a lot of Judgments happen, of course. Everyone handled them differently. There were the screamers who, upon learning their ultimate fate, would beg, plead, curse, and fight against it. These were handled by the expert team of Sweepers set up along the walls. You can never be too careful with a screamer. 

There were the criers, who upon learning their fate would collapse into a messy, fluidy heap. In these cases, the floor would drop out and the criers would slide down into their Judgement Zone for punishment. 

There were the blank starers. The negotiators. The handshakers. The laughers. The stunned silencers.

Then there were the cheerers. Oh the cheerers. They whooped and hollared so loud that you'd think the whole metaverse could hear them. Hannah didn't like the cheerers. Too happy. She often wondered why couldn't someone, just once, take their fate with dignity? 

Which brought us to today. The Judgement had concluded, and the fate was to be decided. The Subject today was a child, Chelsea Bernstein. Quite the little rapscallion in the physical world, if the tales were to be believed. She had committed most of the sins a person could commit. She rarely gave someone telling an interesting story the room to explore its winding narrative until the end, preferring instead to interrupt with her own guesses as to what will happen next and commentary on what has already happened. For instance, when her father would read to her at night, she would often interrupt him by shouting out the next part of the book, or even stopping him entirely with tickle fights and impromptu horsey rides. Not good. She lied incredibly poorly, unable to meet the eyes of those she was attempting to deceive and giggling uncontrollably right after her far-too-imaginative fibs. When it came time to eat, she frequently gave her true opinion on nearly every facet of the meal, prompting a change in choices for her family in the future to accommodate her tastes.

She even did the unimaginable. 

When asked how her day was, Chelsea often told people. Just came right out and said EXACTLY what her day had been like. True, she was only 6, but that didn't excuse the offense.

On the other hand, Chelsea had a lot going for her too. In preschool, she frequently hosted tea parties where she was the absolute picture of decorum, including tailoring a guest list perfectly suited to stimulating conversation without any of the more boring elements of her preschool. Hannah had used footage of it to great effect during the Judgement. Chelsea also would constantly keep the peace among her brothers and sisters by placating them with kind words, at least to their face. If she ever had a problem with a brother or sister she always told her parents first, maintaining a strict chain of command and avoiding a nasty direct confrontation. In fact, she quickly shrugged off most direct confrontations, preferring instead to work against people subtly and by undermining the friendships and allies that surrounded people and by forging alliances with those more powerful than she. Chelsea was always very good to her teachers, ingratiating herself with them by asking witty questions, defending their actions publicly, and giving them gifts at the holidays. The fact that this secured her preferential treatment was the primary motivator, true, but isn't that the point of such behavior? She proved time and again her skill at the all-important Politeness metric was off the charts for her age, and boded well for her chances.

By all accounts, this Judgement was going to be very close. When the Arbiter finally exited his chambers, the room was rapt with attention. This case was a good litmus test for the Arbiter's degree of tolerance for impolite social faux pas. 

The Arbiter read it's choice. 

Chelsea unsurprisingly began to cheer. Loudly. She'd been spared an eternity with the Frank and Boorish and was understandably excited. She tore around the room, thanking the Arbiter, Hannah, the Sweepers, and anyone else she could find. Her squeals were... unpleasant. The Arbiter looked as though he regretted his choice instantly. 

Yet all the same, little Chelsea was lead to the Eternal Ball, where the Politeness and Decorum were the only rules. If you're to spend an eternity with others, you always needed a bit of Politeness to grease the wheels a bit. So they were judicious about who was allowed in. And who wasn't.

A Sweeper coughed. 

Hannah checked her notes. The next person on her docket had been a lawyer and a politician. These were always fun. They almost always got in. Good folks, as a general rule.  Hannah straightened her skirt and shuffled her portfolio, as the Arbiter motioned a Sweeper to bring the politician in.",courbple

They arrive only to find that in the 200 years they've been in transit, FTL technology has gotten much better and there's already a thriving colony there.",O7Knight7O,"Captain Nell took another look at the display, not quite believing the enhanced topographical images being received real-time on the *Destiny's* bridge. 

""How many, you say?""

The Helms Officer, initially flustered at the readings, replied a lot more steadily now, certain that the information tagged by the mainframe computers had been verified visually by no less than 3 human surveyors onboard. 

""Sir, Initial scans have been verified. We can make out 8 operational Geodesic Domes at the Alpha Site in the largest northen continent and at least 8 more currently under construction. We also make out 4 more in the backup site in the smaller northern continent. We also confirm the remains of a Geodesic Dome in the Delta Site in the Southern Hemisphere. The structure is cold. No heat signatures detected.""

A younger officer leaned over and whispered to the Captain ""That many Domes could hold at much as 400,000 Colonists. Recommend we continue communications blackout. The situation has changed, Bill.""

The Captain looked over at Ray his First Officer and nodded. None of this made sense. Ever since they received the first preliminary survey scans, their mission directives were no longer routine. As a fifth-generation Spacer, Nell had faithfully overseen the execution of all the orders set out almost 200 years prior, in the home planet of Humanity. Ever since he was born, generations of Spacers such as himself had been born, raised and died following the Colonial directives without deviation as the plan demanded. His whole career had led to this moment where he would oversee the end of the decceleration stage of the Colony Generational ship *Destiny* and commence planetfall for the second Colonist wave.

The *Destiny* was the second stage of a 3-stage Colony attempt at Atalia-Prime, the most-promising habitable world discovered by Humanity. Its crew consisted of nearly 10,000 Spacers, descendants of the first generation of Colonists that left earth 200 years prior in their long voyage across the stars. Those Pioneers that left earth had set out and followed a very strict set of directives that had been passed on from generation to generation. Bill remember how proud he was as he received command from Captain Sarkis over 15 years ago, during the last major course correction that led to their current decceleration vector. Once in Orbit of Atalia, he was to make contact with the Survey Team sent ahead 10 years prior. The Survey Team composed of 500 hardly colonists who would make the trip aboard the *Copernicus* ahead of the *Destiny* arrival and conduct a careful survey of the proposed landing sites and begin the construction of 2 standard Geodesic Domes, and more importantly, the Terraforming Reactor, ahead of of the arrival of the *Destiny*. Bill had expected to see the fully completed Dome structure at the Primary site, the Terraforming Reactor and the almost completed secondary dome during his initial scan.

Bill had known something was different to the plan almost 5 years prior when the first deep space scans, sent by probes launched by the *Copernicus* during its initial decceleration burn 10 years prior, revealed several structures that the sensors tagged as Geodesic Domes at a 68% probability. The sensors aboard the Destiny were not sensitive enough to make out much detail at that stage, so they've spent the last 5 years preparing for the moment where they themselves could launch optical probes and obtain the necessary detail required to survey the landing sites from space. At 6 months before estimated Planetfall, Bill knew that the crew of the *Copernicus* could not be responsible for the accelerated construction schedule. Their mission was simply not sufficiently equipped or crewed to continue construction beyond the initial 2 domes. 

""Captain, more data is coming through now."" The bridge officer confirmed. ""Sir, additional scans confirm the *Copernicus* still orbiting Alpha Prime. We can also confirm 2 additional ships. The *Destiny* tags their make and origin as Earth Vessels.""

Bill stared at the display, not quite believing what he was seeing. *How could 2 other Earth vessels launched at least a decade after the *Destiny* have reached Atalia Prime before us?!* 

""Confirm if either one of those 2 vessels match the *Mayflower*!"" Bill ordered.

He had seen the schematics of the 3rd wave vessel in the *Destiny's* database. The plan was for the final and largest Colony ship to be launched exactly 20 years after the *Destiny* in order to begin full colonisation, once the crews of the *Copernicus* and the *Destiny* had completed all essential infrastructure required and Terraforming had been completed.

""Match confirmed. *Destiny* tags the unknown vessels as *Mayflower* class variants. The Sensors indicate Reinforced Hulls and smaller propulsion engines."" The Engisn swallowed hard. ""Capatin, sensors tentavitely assign a 72% probability that both vessels display missile launch tubes across the bow.""

""What the hell? Bill, there is no way the *Mayflower* launched ahead of us as a War Vessel.""

""At least we know what happened to the Southern Hemisphere dome. That can only be the result of an Orbital Bombardment"", said Ray icily. The implications of that statement snapped Bill out of his stupor.

""Helm, immediately shut down all active sensors. Until further notice, we run passive sensors only.""

Still, this was no time to panic. Decceleration was still underway. They still have 6, no 5 months to plan their next course of action prior to arrival in orbit. The mission had taken a turn for the worst, from all accounts. The *Copernicus* must have arrived on schedule and proceeded to Terraform and build preliminary settlements as intended and then somehow, before the *Destiny* arrived, Earth must have sent ships using faster technological breakthroughs. The archives showed that theoretically, Faster-Than-Light travel was possible. Surely someone on Earth must have made a breakthrough in the 20 years between missions and leapfrogged ahead of the *Destiny* and arrived at Atalia Prime long before they were expected. And for some reason, they had bombarded the surface. 

""Ray, get in touch with the Ruling Council. We need to appraise everyone of the current situation. There is going to be a lot of people out there that won't like the idea of coming to Atalia Prime under a Hostile Occupation force"" He eyed the bridge crew and then announced in his clearest command voice ""Attention all bridge personnel. You are hereby ordered to maintain silence on the latest developments until further notice. We don't want to start a panic aboard the *Destiny*. Let's trust in our elected officials to make the next set of decisions"".

With that, Captain Bill Nell made his way to the bridge exit airlock, trying his best to project an image of calmness as he left. One thing is for sure, he thought. The old Directives are now officially over. It's time for all of them to start thinking about the future of the *Destiny's* crew instead of trusting their ancestors. Time for all of them to grow up.",Sylveran-01
"[WP] A multi-generational colony ship has been travelling for 200 years to arrive at the planet they're supposed to colonize. They arrive only to find that in the 200 years they've been in transit, FTL technology has gotten much better and there's already a thriving colony there.",O7Knight7O,"The excitement in the air was palpable, thrumming with weight. Everyone was jostling and scrabbling to get as close to the door of the ship as possible, wanting, needing to be in the place where it happened. They’d been debriefed. They all had one last meal together, packed and said goodbye to their familiar places, and then gathered to be sanitized and prepped for exposure. Little ones, who had only known life amongst the stars that cradled their ship, clung to their parent’s legs, afraid and worried. The adults soothed them with soft whispers and touches to their heads or backs. All waited. 

&amp;nbsp;

The doors creaked open agonizingly slowly, smooth and silent despite not being used for two hundred years. Light flooded in, and tears pricked at the corners of hundreds of eyes, though if asked they would reply only that it was strangely dusty. And then the doors were open, and the planet was laid bare before them. Purple grass, lumpy hills, and strange frond trees were all that was visible at first, and the group took a collective breath in. 

&amp;nbsp;
	
Then one of the colonists was shoved forward, a young man of no account except that he had won the lottery. The first step onto an alien planet would be his, and his alone. History would sing with his name and his parents only hoped he’d grow into the role thrust upon him. With a hand tentatively out he stepped forward slowly, until one foot remained aloft above the foreign soil. Then he placed it down, and walked a few steps more. A laugh shook his frame and then he was on the ground. 

&amp;nbsp;
	
The rest of the colonists streamed out of the ship, a mass of humanity seething and rolling and then coming to a stop abruptly around the laughing young man. Far in the distance, blotting the horizon, was a city. Little specks roved in the sky, to and fro around the blot, and long, long fields of strange crops, waved lazily in the wind. There were fences and strange creatures within them, odd tubes criss-crossing here and there, absolutely indescribable structures dotting the horizon and, worst of all, three smiling humans near them. There was no doubt that they were human, both comforting in their familiarity and stomach droppingly shocking in their implication. Collective doubt spread through the colonists, and anger flushed their faces like a wildfire, beginning with one and then jumping to the next when he noticed his neighbor’s face. 

&amp;nbsp;

The first of the three humans to speak was dark haired, had pooling blue eyes, and was a soothing balm to their open wounds. “I am sorry. We are sorry.”

&amp;nbsp;
	
The stranger let those words hang in the air, hard and hopeful and full of meaning. The captain of the colonists – the eighth captain to be exact, fair and just, elected by his fellow starry travellers and related, distantly, to the first captain who had left Earth knowing he would die in space having never seen the new planet – stumbled forward through the crowd. There was a bead of sweat upon his brow, but he was otherwise impeccable and unflappable. Stiffly he stuck out his hand. The stranger took it with something approximating a smile. 

&amp;nbsp;
	
As they shook hands, the young man of no account finally picked himself up and dusted himself off. For a long time he looked at the city in the far distance. Behind him the strangers introduced themselves, the leader of the settlers, a doctor and an anthropologist, who talked softly of things that had happened long ago. The young man paid them no mind, and let all wash over him and slip away into the roaring tides of fate. There were explanations, more apologies, an invitation, and glad welcome to the city, and all were spoken with no notice or acknowledgement from the man. 

&amp;nbsp;

After staring at the city until his eyes burned, he turned slowly to regard the empty scenery in the opposite direction. For a moment, his hands itched as he looked, slowly and silently, at the land spread out before him. A word bubbled and popped into his brain: *opportunity*. The sudden desire to move, and do *something* clenched the man’s heart, and, limbs jerking like an automaton, he skittered past the colonists, still talking, and stepped into the unclaimed land all spread out before him. It would not be long before others followed, breaking from the stream of colonists heading to the city and people that had stolen their victory. And yet, even within that thought, there was no malice. 

&amp;nbsp;
	
Friends waved goodbye, acquaintances parted, and the parents of the young man of sudden account, smiled at him from the seething crowd heading to the city. They had already spent their years working hard, and did not begrudge the young that had stolen their city from them. They were beyond such silly quarrels, and looked forward to a new and easy life in the city. When their son, bedraggled and sweaty smiled back at them from his crowd of new followers, they finally thought he’d be okay.

Visible? Shouldn't it be another 192 years until the planet itself was visible? And then it hit Adamson; he had been in cryosleep for 192 years. His memories are returning.

His arms weakly moved due to decades of disuse and then he pushed the button to get out. The pod shifted and he was out. The spacecraft was so empty and quiet as if he was truly alone. After getting out, he could see every crewmember soundly asleep in their cryopods, and in the distance he could see the colonists.

He then made his way to the command room, where everything was left as it was 192 years ago. Empty coffee mugs, memorabilia, empty chairs and empty desks. He floated inside and then turned on the artificial gravity. And then immediately he fell down with such force the sound echoed throughout the entire spacecraft. He tried to stand up and felt a force that he hadn't felt for almost two centuries. Although the cryopod did an amazing work of conserving his muscles and bones, his brain certainly didn't. He crawled and then finally sat up on the chair.

A quick calculation determined that Gliese 832C would be reachable within 25 minutes; finally humankind is a spacefaring species. He rejoiced in this, and even though he could not raise his arms high enough and smile wide enough, he simply could not contain his delight.

20 minutes have passed, and a quick cup of coffee later, he was awake and although his limbs are still adapting to the Earth-like artificial gravity, he could walk, albeit weakly. He kept pondering on Earth, remembering his daughter and the promise he made with her.

""Daddy will come back, I promise.""

It's been a while since he remembered the scorching and desolate landscape that is Earth. It was hell, but it was home. No matter how hostile it is. He also pondered on the six other expeditions that was launched as well. He kept thinking, until a noise was heard.

He was being called. From on the surface of the Earth.

""Hello?""

""Yes. Is this Commander Adamson?""

English. English? Why would aliens speak English? Commander Adamson was confused. Why would there be English speakers in Gliese 832C? Why would extraterrestial life have knowledge of the English language? He was so entrenched in his mind that he didn't hear what the other person said.

""I'm sorry?""

""We are pulling you in to the surface. Our Security shall be there shortly.""

Security? What? And then it all blacked out.

Commander Adamson woke up in a white room with five people on the other side. They seemed a bit off.

""Commander Adamson. I'm sorry to tell you this sir.""

""Tell me what? Who are you?""

""We are Copernicus Seven, and we are humans from Earth, just like yourself.""

""What do you mean?""

The man speaking then narrowed his blue eyes and dropped his eyebrows, and then he looked to the others, seemingly whispering about something.

""Um, about 408 years after you departed, or about 5 years after you initiated the voyage at 80% of light speed, we discovered an even more efficient way to harnessing antimatter energy and dark matter energy, and as a result we could go about 50 times faster than the speed of light. So humankind went to Copernicus 7 in about a third of a year.""

""What about the others? The other six? And Earth?""

""I am sorry to say that we've lost contact with all six of the expeditions, e-excluding yours. We simply do not have the technology and we don't know. Earth is gone, I'm afraid. The average degree is 75 degrees centigrade and I'm afraid..""

Commander Adamson didn't hear anything else after that. 75 degrees centigrade. On average. Earth is gone. This meant that his daughter is gone.

""And what will I tell the crew? The colonists?""

""The truth, sir. Our Defense Forces have settled in your spacecraft and are resuscitating all personnel. We'll assist you in this.""

""Alright. Just one more thing.""

""Yes?""

""How much have humanity spread in the years?""

""Everywhere, sir. Four galaxies in fact sir.""

Although Commander Adamson is saddened by the fact that Earth is no longer alive, he's delighted that humanity is able to survive and prosper. ",Putraenus_Alivius

Two hundred years of exposure to the vacuum of space as started to take its toll on the ship that the ten thousand brave souls aboard had been sleeping on. “Now I know most of you have just woken up from the cryo-sleep, please take some time to let your body readjust to waking life.” The captain continued, “Many of the essential staff have been awake for the past month and can guide you to any area you need. The cafetoria will be open in approximately two hours. Thank you all for embarking on this monumental mission for humanity.”

“Captain Shepard, we are approaching Alpha-B24. We should be in sensor range shortly. E.T.A. five minutes.”

The Captain stood up from his chair, “Okay listen up bridge. This mission is over two hundred years in the making. We must make sure everything goes according to plan. Navigation, are we still on course for orbit rendezvous?”

“Yes sir, we will achieve orbit in fifty-two minutes twenty second, assuming that the planet has the same gravitational force we estimated.”

“Good,” Captain Shepard responded. “Coms, are we receiving any transmissions?”

“Not yet sir. Although if there is a primitive civilization on the planet they probably won’t be able to commutate.”

“Captain,” the helmsman at sensors shouted. “Sensors are coming into range. I’m detecting several hundred metallic objects in orbit.” The helmsman cocked his head sideways a bit. “Th-they looks like, satellites.”

*Not what we were hoping for.* Captain Shepard thought to himself. “Rise shields to be safe. Coms, try and establish communications.”

Everyone on the bridge tensed up and fidgeted in their seats. Preliminary scans from Earth before they left didn’t show any signs of intelligent life. They all knew though that scans from that far away were spotty at best though, plus they also knew a lot could happen in two hundred years.”

“Captain,” the coms helmsman said, snapping Captain Shepard out of his thoughts. “No answers to my hails. I’ve opened a wide spectrum broadcast though to transmit to.”

“Very good, patch it to me,” The captain responded. Clearing his throat, he started, “This is Captain William E. Shepard of the ESS Prosperity. We are on a colonizing mission from a distant planet, is there anybody to receive this message?”

The helmsman at the coms station tabbed through several menus on her screen. “Sent out in every know language of Earth. I know it’s a long shot but hopefully they are advanced enough to translate.”

“Understood, keep on course.” Captain Shepard commanded. *I really hope they are peaceful and ready for contact.*

The next twenty minutes were some of the tense that any of the officers on the bridge experienced in their respective careers. Nobody was quite sure if anyone on the planet even understood the transmission let alone received it. For all they knew the indigenous life of this planet didn’t even know what radio frequency was.

A terminal screen sprang to life on the coms station. “Captain,” the coms helmsman exclaimed. “Receiving a two-way transmission signal from the surface of the planet.”

“Bring it up.”

The coms helmsman tabbed a few menus and opened the transmission to the Bridge. A cough came though the speakers, “Sorry, this is President Albertson of New Eden. Welcome back Prosperity. It’s been a long time.” The crew on the bridge looked around at each other.

“Hello President Albertson, this is Captain William E. Shepard of the ESS Prosperity. Please clarify your last statement. We come from the planet Earth approximately three hundred sixty-four light years away from here.”

“Yes, we have a lot to catch you and your colonists up on. We too are from Earth.”

“Impossible,” exclaimed one of the helmsman.

“Not quite,” the President continued. “About Fifty years or so into your voyage a breakthrough was discovered in faster than light technology that allowed us to reach this planet in about four and a half days and not two hundred years. Unfortunately, due to the way the older F.T.L. technology worked we had no way to pull your ship out of travel without risking your lives.”

Everyone on the bridge sat in silence for a moment before they heard a loud bang. Captain Shepard slammed his fist into the arm of the chair, breaking the embedded screen. “God damnit. Fuck you all! We were supposed to be the pioneers! We were supposed to be the ones in the history books! Us damnit. Not you!”

“We understand your frustration captain,” the president’s voice still coming through the bridge speakers. “Once you are in orbit why don’t you come down and speak with us. We have already prepared a fully furnished and stocked city for you and your colonists.”

“Go to Hell,” Captain Shepard quietly mumbled before clicking off the transmission.

[WP] You just found a rock.,SepticMist,"The tan haze that covered the horizon is disorienting. In the distance, the sand looks endless. Yellow slowly fading into sky blue--my eyes felt heavy. I've never felt this kind of exhaustion. Every step I take is a battle of my will. I was fighting the desert from claiming me. The sun loomed high, cooking my exposed arms and the dry air penetrated my body. I had a mortal moment, where I stopped and fell to my knees, thinking wistfully, angrily of how I came to find myself here. I was too tired to cry, for I had been walking long and already cried many times. Despite how parched my throat was and how weak my body felt, the blistering hot sand felt so warm on my skin. I sat hunched over, my mind flowing in and out of conciousness until the sand began to blow over my feet and legs until it covered my body. I am being consumed by the desert.

After some time, I stood slowly, stumbling, and continued my march away from the crash. The heat was not the worst of it, it was acknowledging my fate, which the fell clutch of circumstance had sealed. I thought of my family, my colleagues that had traveled so far for my mission to uncover the secrets of this desert. We came so far. When the plane fell into the dunes I was the sole survivor. Painful. So painful. I can barely open my eyes. I want to rest, but these barren dunes leave me no comfort.

I look up. Suddenly I found a rock. A large grey boulder. I didn't notice it before. I stood for a moment, staring at the rock. I was thinking and the desert seemed to understand. I fell and crawled to the rocks shade, leaning my weary back against its strangely cool surface. It soothed the back of my arms and my neck. I rocked my head back and dropped my arms to my sides. I closed my eyes, thinking on my family, and slowly the whipping gales of the desert seemed to silence itself.",TheAmeneurosist
[WP] You just found a rock.,SepticMist,"Somebody wrote *I love you* on the bottom of this rock.	
	
Sitting on the bench, I toss it between my hands. A story’s hidden inside it, one I’ll never know. To somebody, writing this meant everything. They probably spent countless nights awake, drumming up the courage.
	
And now it’s here, in the park, just another piece of the world.
	
This thing’s probably been here longer than most the buildings around me. I wonder, did this couple stand the test of time, or were they a simple blip in each other’s lives? Maybe it was a romantic weekend and afterward they went their separate ways. Maybe it was a romantic weekend and afterward they bought a house together.
	
Or, on a more cynical note, maybe this rock was *never* a gift. Maybe the person who wrote this was scared of rejection so they simply left it here. Maybe they *did* try to give it to someone only to have their greatest fear come true.
	
The rock has infinite possibilities, and that fascinates me, so when it’s finally time to leave, I tuck it into my pocket. Maybe *I* can add another story and give it to someone *I* love.

Norville was a huge blond man wearing motorcycle leathers that had been stitched together. On his belt were six knives, and on his head was a trucker hat that said “Fuck Zombies”.

“Why did I? Why did you send me a message saying to come here?” Gina was similarly muscular, but only wore jeans and a sleeveless tee. She had black hair, close cropped to her head, and her shoulders were covered in freckles.

Sam watched them from the bushes. The two of them were meeting on a dirt road, one of the paths leading out of the settlement. All around them was green underbrush growing out of control.

Their breakup had compromised the settlement’s ability to defend itself, and Sam had appointed herself Lindsay Lohan, getting them back together.

They were arguing now. Gina said that he was a liar, and this was just a trick to get back together. True, but not Norville’s fault. It wasn’t going well. Time to break out the big guns.

Sam made a moaning noise, her best zombie impression. After, she quickly hurried away.

Norville and Gina investigated, and on the other side of the bushes found a blanket with an open picnic basket.

“Oh, Norv,” she said softly. “You know how much I love to eat packed lunches on a blanket, but it’s just not going to work.”

Norville rolled with the unexpected gift. “But I made it just for you. Do you want to eat, and then talk about it?”

She wavered, and sat down. The two of them enjoyed some of the finest delicacies a post-apocalyptic world had to offer. After finishing their instant mashed potatoes and packets of arby’s sauce, they started reminiscing about old battles.

“You remember when Johnson had that old ATV that he crashed into a wall of zombies?” Norville said.

“Yeah, that was amazing. Shame we haven’t found another one, that’s the way I want to go out.”

He took her hand. “I don’t care how I go out, as long as it’s next to you.” He leaned over and kissed her.

Sam in the bushes held back her squeal of glee.

Gina put her hand on his jaw, then leaned back away from the kiss. “Is that why you cheated on me?”

Sam gasped.

“Baby, it wasn’t like that. I just needed to take some stress off. An apocalypse is hard on everyone.”

“If it was with another settler, I could maybe understand. But a zombie? That’s just...gross, Norv. You’re gross.”

Sam kept her hand over her mouth to keep from saying something.

“Wowwwwwwww. Baby, I don’t know what you think you saw, but it wasn’t me.”

“Pretty sure I saw you with your pants around your ankles.”

“Nah.” He shook his head, refusing to have it. 

This called for emergency measures. Meeting hadn’t been enough and the picnic seemed to have only made things worse. They needed a common enemy.

Sam brought out something totally forbidden in the settlement. A little silver whistle.

She blew as loud as she could. It was a really annoying sound, and unfortunately zombies agreed. On the roads outside the settlement it would be minutes before they showed up in force. Sam hid in the bushes again.

Gina and Norville started arguing. Gina suspected another trick, and Norville stonewalled, less effectively after his blatant lies earlier.

Sooner than expected, four zombies meandered down the path. Norville tossed two of his knives to Gina, the argument put on hold.

He threw another knife into a zombie’s eye. It didn’t penetrate enough to hit brain, and the zombie kept coming. He threw a second knife and nailed a different zombie’s foot to the ground. It tugged limply but stayed put.

That left three zombies still coming. Gina went in fast, kicking the legs out from under one. She kept running past and the zombies moved forward to Norville. She took another pass and stomped on the downed zombie’s head. The skull, long since rotted, burst open and it stopped twitching.

Sam tried not to cheer.

Norville, in his bike leathers, didn’t need to be so evasive. He grabbed a zombie by the throat, took his old knife out of its eye, and sawed away at its neck. After separating the head, the body collapsed. He did the same to the second one as it gnawed uselessly at his arm.

Gina took out the last zombie that had been pinned, breaking a thick branch over its head. 

“Didn’t that feel good?”

“It doesn’t change anything. It’ll feel just as good when I’m protecting a different settlement. Away from you.”

Norv absentmindedly toyed with the severed head he was still holding. “You’re sure I can’t change your mind?”

“Absolutely sure.”

“Then I guess I’ll have to get rid of it.” He tossed the head underhand to her. “Catch.”

She blocked instinctively, and the zombie’s teeth clamped down on her forearm. 

“What the fuck is wrong with you?” 

Norville grinned. “Nothing. You, on the other hand, are soon to join the undead. Any last requests?”

She ran at him, swinging her fist. 

Sam was starting to think getting them back together wasn’t such a good idea. She looked around for one of Norville’s discarded throwing knives.

After a brief fight, Gina was pinned on the ground, Norville sitting on her back. He held a hand to his face, where a black eye was starting to show.

“You know, you were right about me. I just didn’t want to admit it while we still had a chance,” he whispered to her.

“Fuck you.”

“We’ll get to that.”

Sam hesitated. If Norville killed Gina, then it would be a fucked up situation, but the people that Gina was going to take to form a new settlement would probably stay. She would have still saved them.

Norville whispered something else in Gina’s ear and she started struggling harder, pinned under the heavier man.

No, this wasn’t a bargain she could go through with.

Sam crept up behind Norville and stabbed him through the neck.

The settlement would have to do their best to survive without him.

[WP] One day you wake up and realize that you cannot lie anymore and so does the rest of the world.,Tommyash92,"It's peculiar what happened. A month had passed in this state of ""absolute truth"" and everyone was trying to live how they used to live. People did not run from each other and did not tear out their tongue whenever asked a sensitive question. Quite the opposite. Everyone continued their lives as they were, but absolutely everyone had a free pass to say what they wanted. Or, in this case, to say the only thing that ever came from one's mouth now - the truth.

It was like a state of a calm emergency where everyone hoped that this strange period will pass just as it had started. No one knew what has caused it, but, as it started so sudden, it was expected to stop just as sudden. And why shouldn't you have said what you always thought? It's not like the boss was surprised that you'd rather sit home and watch the tv. It's not like the telemarketer thinks that you love him. No one was truly shocked by anything. And if someone actually did say something awfully embarrassing, well, it's not like you haven't had impure thoughts about vacuum cleaners yourself. Who cares?

It was the morning and I just had woken up and I heard someone sing ""It's a beautiful day..."" Recorded songs had no obligation to tell the truth. I turned on the news and two news anchors were looking at me from the screen. 

""So..."" Shrugged the blond woman looking straight at me: ""Things are looking pretty good. No major earthquakes, no nothing. Crime is going down... What can I say? It's 9 am, Sun is up, the traffic is pretty bad, but that's because you have the leisure to sleep for so long, not like us, who have to already be here and pretend to be morning people.""

""Hahaha..."" laughed her co-anchor in his blue suit: ""I despise you all for this, I really do. Well. What now? Bob? What's the weather going to be like?""

Another man appeared, picking hair off his jacket: ""Fuck if I know, Taylor. Back to you.""

Well, that's that. I got dressed, grabbed my keys and exited the house. I would be awake in an hour or so, but right now I was on an autopilot. Just need to go through the morning, it's going to get better.

Suddenly, a fresh and jolly voice from the neighbor's yard shouted at me: ""Good morning, neighbor!"" 

""Fuck you too, whatever your name..."" and then I suddenly woke up. ""Wait, really?""

""Sure,"" the neighbor said smiling and working on his yard. ""It definitely is a good morning, so a good morning, neighbor.""

""Yeah."" I looked around and at my neighbor ""I suppose you are right, you son of a saint. I suppose you are. Good morning, neighbor."" This surprised me. Is it really a good morning? I suppose it is, and why not. I decided to take the scenic route to my job, which made me come in late, but I did not really care. I arrived and sat down at my desk and started going through papers when my boss Tomass came up to me. A decent fellow, a tad strict, but decent.

""You are late,"" he boomed ""why?""

I looked at him ""I really didn't want to come in you know?""

""Do I?"" Tomass laughed ""Of course I do. But don't worry. You're one of the best here and we can't do without you. I mean, shit, you could take a paid week off right now and we'd be thankful that you'd return at all."" He smiled and then suddenly realized that he just might have said too much.

Well, that's good to know. ""Raise my pay then.""

""I technically can, but Blaine from HR has this tactic where, if someone requests a raise, I have to deny two times. It has to do with psychology or something, I'm not very good at that.""

""Raise my pay. Raise my pay."" I repeated myself twice.

""Consider it done,"" Tomass gleamed that we've managed to settle this. Everyone knew that Blaine is a pain. ""Don't you rather want the vacation week?""

""Nah, thanks, I really have no social life and I can't masturbate twice a day, so why would I need a full day off? For that matter, a week?""

""Makes sense,"" Tomass agreed, bid me farewell, and entered his office.

It was finally time for my first call. A lady our company had worked with for a while had filed a complaint. The repairman who we sent to her house had done a shabby job and her oven still wasn't working. So I had to call her and work out the details.

""Good morning, Miss Sharp. I'm calling from Tools'R'Us."" I started the conversation.

""Well, it might be a good morning to you..."" stated the pleasant, but annoyed voice of a young woman ""but I haven't had a warm meal in a while due to the broken oven and I'm a bit cross.""

""I understand. I'm very..."" What was the word I'm looking for? ""Sorry""? That doesn't sound right ""...tired of this happening. The repairman Carl works here just because we can't fire him. It's not that he is a minority, we've just lost him in the system and can't find his data.""

Silence. I suppose there was nothing miss Sharp could do about it, so I continued: ""If it's any consolation, I'd like to take you out to dinner to have a good and tasty meal.""

Again, a pause, but not a long one. ""That sounds lovely, but I'd rather have the oven fixed. No, wait. I want the dinner *and* my oven fixed. Can you do both?""

""I suppose."" Fucking Carl. ""So, this evening is good for you? I get off work at about... Well, I just discovered that I get off work about any time I want.""

""Nice,"" said Miss Sharp ""I wanted to pretend that I'm busy this evening to seem coy, but I really am awfully lonely and have been for a while, so I'd enjoy a company. Also, I think I'm finally ready for a relationship just about now and this is a great romantic and curious start. I live at...""

""Oh I know where you live, I have all the data about you here. I mean, hell, you can't even imagine what sort of data we've collected.""

And that's that. I hung up the phone and absent-mindedly looked at all of the papers on my table.

""Tomass, you wee fuck, I know you can hear me!"" I shouted across the hall.

""The fuck is wrong with you?"" shouted Tomass back. 

""Some childhood problems I think."" Silence. ""Tomass, I'm taking a week off. Like, now, I think.""

""Oh fuck you!"" shouted Tomass back, not entirely angry.

""Yeah, I know, that's the point,"" I shouted back while gathering my things and a coat and heading out into what my neighbor once called a ""Good morning"".",XanLV

This exchange was the first compulsive truth to be told. In just a few hours, anchormen were going off script, doctors were frightening patients, and the flat earth society had all but dissolved. In a few weeks, a committee had formed to test the truths of the world, with long lists of jargon-ridden questions to systematically answer. But what was most on my mind was my relationship. One of the few that had survived the ordeal. 

""Honey, do you love me?"" I'd asked her, when it became clear we could no longer lie. She looked up from the television.

""Yes."" She nodded, grinned, and breathed a sigh of relief. ""I love you. Do you love me back?"" 

I hugged her close, and whispered by her ear. ""I love you."" 

The knowledge that we loved each other saved our relationship, which had been going south for a while. We'd already invested so much into it. We had a home, a car, and no kids yet but we did have a dog. He liked to curl up on the couch with us, which was convenient, because I could whisper to him on that day I hugged my wife.

[WP] One day you wake up and realize that you cannot lie anymore and so does the rest of the world.,Tommyash92,"Ever since that day, things certainly ran more smoothly. Corruption cleared up, politicians could finally be held accountable, and the courts operated like a well-oiled machine. At first, it seemed that only those with guilty consciences would be opposed to such a change, after all, wouldn’t we all get along much better if we were candid with each other?

But if you thought that, you’re fucking naïve.

Sorry, gotta be brutally honest.

International relations began to crumble; it was far easier maintaining an uneasy alliance by telling yourself that you liked each other, it turned out the ‘special relationship’ wasn’t as special as we thought. But I don’t care about that, I never cared about politics, I just did it to make me seem more erudite. Am I using that right? If I’m honest, I don’t even know what it means. It helped with women; I met my girlfriend at a rally. Ex-girlfriend I should say. Turns out it’s difficult to maintain a relationship when one half is no longer able to say “I love you”.

[WP] One day you wake up and realize that you cannot lie anymore and so does the rest of the world.,Tommyash92,"It was any other weekday. I woke up, got dressed, got breakfast, and head towards the school bus. When I was walking out the door to go to school, my parents said something odd that I would never quite forget. At least one of my parents would say goodbye to me, and wish me luck, but today, they said something that caught me off guard. ""Goodbye, Jake! We both absolutely hate you and we both believe that you have absolutely no future with the sad excuse you call your grades!"" I was unphased, and replied ""Well I would be absolutely starstruck right now, but I never even loved both of you to begin with! Have a shit day!"". ""You too!"" My father replied.
       When I got on the bus that morning, I saw my friends in the back. They told nothing but the truth; just like my parents. ""Oh hey Jake, how's it... wait, actually, before you answer that, I don't really care how you're doing."" Kyle said. ""Oh, really? Because I don't care either! I'm just using you for your money!"" I replied. ""Oh, okay! I'll just continue bothering the kid in the seat ahead of me because I'm dealing with emotional problems that I don't know how to handle!"" Kyle said. Kyle than proceeded to verbally insult Jeremey, the kid who sits in front of me. But then, Rob, the kid who sits next to Kyle and is friends with both of us, says ""You know, I don't really like what he's doing, but I'm scared to speak out against him because I think he'll hurt me, so I'll just keep my mouth shut."" 
       When I got to school, all of my teachers said that they just didn't want to work in any capacity so we all just had a free day off. My mom and my dad came home and my mom made us all dinner. My mom then asks ""What did everyone do today? I don't really care, but I just want to fill the awkward silence in the room."" My little sister, Megan, who's in kindergarten said ""I made a lion out of a paper plate and paper! It's below standards for most people, but I'm very proud of myself!"" Megan said. ""Oh, really? If I look at it, can I barely tell that it looks like a lion?"" My Mom said. ""Yup!"" Megan replied. ""What did you do, Jake?"" Mom said. ""My teachers did absolutely nothing and wouldn't get off their lazy asses. Even if they did work, I probably wouldn't even listen."" I said, with a big smile on my face. ""Oh really? I don't even care."" Mom said.
      After dinner was done, Mom said ""Okay, everyone, our marriage is crumbling and we haven't spent a lot of time together! We might announce tomorrow that we're getting a divorce, but hey, who knows?"".

"[WP] You've had a crush on the local Superhero for a while. In an effort to get their attention, you've unintentionally become a Supervillain.",Tortolonch,"Villainous Flirtations 

“Muahaha! You are far too late, fools!” I cringe as I arrive on scene, hearing the taunt in the recognizable voice of our city, Roneria’s, newest villain, Nightenjay. As the city’s main hero, I respond to the people’s complaints, and it falls under my jurisdiction to stop Nightenjay. So far, though, by the time the reports have reached me, he has been long gone, so I’m surprised to find him still present at the scene of his latest crime. 

Nightenjay looks up at my arrival, and he smiles invitingly. “Ah, Aegis, so nice of you to finally join us.” Approaching, I spot the Mayor and feel a familiar twinge pass through my body that signifies the beginnings of a pounding headache.   

“Release Mayor Jenson at once, you fiend!” I shout at him. 

Nightenjay chuckles, knowing that he has me committed to his game. “Make me!” he yells back outrageously. 

My jaw momentarily drops, but I quickly close it and grind my teeth as a hot flush of excited agitation suffuses my body. It heats my blood and pumps it thickly through my chest, and my senses sharpen. This is the moment of my hero job that I love the best – the few seconds in which my body primes itself for action. The crowd fades from my vision, the dangling mayor disappears, and suddenly all my focus in on Nightenjay. My muscles tighten in anticipation, and my nostrils flare. It’s the only sign that I’m about to charge, but Nightenjay grins like a man possessed, so he must have seen it. 

I rush forward toward Nightenjay in a burst of speed. “Nightenjay!” I roar, because it helps a man’s charge potential to bellow a target’s name. As I hurtle myself toward him at a blinding speed, he quickly takes a small vial of liquid out of his pocket, opens it and douses himself with it. My eyes widen as he carelessly tosses the empty vial over his shoulder, a satisfied expression on his face. I pull my upper body up sharply in an attempt to stop before coming into contact with him and the unknown substance, but it is too difficult to stop my forward momentum. I have a partial second to notice that his blue body now looks shiny before I crash into him, our bodies slamming together. The impact produces a dull thud, and we both grunt. 

Although not the type of capture I had envisioned, I smile victoriously as I lock both my arms around his torso, pinning his arms to his sides. “Got you!” I yell as I hold him steady against my chest. 

Nightenjay shifts and abruptly drops his weight, and his slicked body slides through my arms like a wet seal. My eyes widen in stunned disbelief, while he squats down in front of me and surges upward with some ballet shit that has him standing a few feet in front of me once again. 

Narrowing my eyes, I try a different tactic this time, striking out with my leg to kick his and knock him off balance. Nightenjay does some circus shit this time, jumping gracefully over my leg to avoid my blow while reaching down to stroke my moving leg with one of his hands. I jerk at the soft contact and the feeling of his covered fingers brushing silkily against my thigh and calf. I feel off-balance, and the sensation of his soft touch lingers for longer than it should have. I glance distractedly down at my leg, and notice that the material on my leg now has a shiny gleam to it. Frowning, I can discern a slight sheen on several areas of my suit, including my chest and my arm. All of the places I touched Nightenjay. 

Not giving me the necessary time to process these things, Nightenjay says, “It’s my turn now,” and charges towards me. He is a blur of blue, and he collides into me with a softer impact. He puts his hands on my chest and manages to look up at me with a soft but superior smile. I twist sharply, trying to dislodge him, but he’s not putting any force of pressure behind his touch. His hands are just lightly pressing against me. Nightenjay moves swiftly and maneuvers so he is standing behind my back. As he moves, his hands glide along my suit, up and over each shoulder, and then they rest against my upper back. I can feel his body heat radiating into me, 

He leans forward toward my right ear. “Oh, Ageis,” he purrs softly against the sensitive skin there, and his warm breath tickles me. Goosebumps break out along my arms, pinpricks of sensation that dance across my body. Furious with my unprofessional reaction, I bellow in frustration as I twist around to face him. In one quick movement, I tackle him to the ground. He lands with an oof, and I follow him down, resting on top of him. I use my superior body weight to my advantage, trying to pin him in place for his lawful capture. Sure of my success this time, I grin down at Nightenjay triumphantly. 

“I’ve got you now, villain.” And I lean forward a little more, pressing more of my weight into him as I prove my point. 

Nightenjay looks back at me unconcerned. “Is that so?” He says, and with a strength that surprises me, he pushes himself up from under my weight and reverses our positions. 

Snarling, I grab whatever part of him I can reach and twist, trying to put his body back under mine to submit. Our suited bodies glide together, the slippery substance making it difficult for either one of us to score a decent hold. My frustration builds to dangerous levels as we grapple in a heap of slippery limps. 

“What is this stuff?” I growl at him, panting for breath but not stopping my attempts to hold him still. He laughs again, and the sound infuriates me in a way I’ve never felt before.  

“Why, it’s just a little oil, Aegis.” He responds, and there’s no mistaking the arrogant humor in his voice. 

“The fuck? Oil?!” I shout indignantly. So that’s why I can’t get a proper hold of him! He purposefully doused his suit in oil to make himself slippery like an eel wiggling through tight places. And he got it all over me when he touched me! Son of a bitch. “You touched me all over on purpose!” I accuse him, ignoring the slightly petulant tone of my voice. This bastard has managed to get under my skin like no other ever has. 

“I most certainly did,” he responds calmly, “and you liked it!” His voice is as smooth and silky as the oil that’s been rubbing between us, and it hits me like a punch to the gut. My body jolts from his wicked accusation, and my fingers on his leg loosen their hold in subconscious response. Grimacing, and forcefully telling myself to get a grip and to do my fucking job, I renew my efforts to capture him. 

I lose my sense of time as we wrestle together on the hard, stone ground. I’m lost in the sensation of his slight body under, against, and on top of mine. Our suits move together with the oil, the sensation like soft butter coating my skin. Both of us are panting, and he makes this delectable little grunt whenever I grab him somewhere too tightly. I find myself becoming quickly addicted to that little sound, and I struggle to clench my hand around his flesh for reasons that have nothing to do with the job. Neither one of us speaks for several long minutes. 

“For God’s sake, get a room.” I hear a disgusted voice say from off to my right, and I’m jolted from my thoughts.  

Finally realizing that I had lost sight of my surroundings, I glance around at the crowd of people. My jaw drops to discover Nightenjay and myself are now alone. I look for Mayor Jenson, and sure enough, he is gone too. One of the citizens must have crept up and cut him down while I was grappling with Nightenjay. 

He uses my respite to force himself fully on top of me. “They left awhile ago, Aegis,” he says softly. As he looks down at me, his arrogance and contempt are gone, replaced by an unnamable expression. His regard tightens things low in my gut, things that haven’t been tightened in years. With the Mayor safe and the citizens once again protected, most of the fight has gone out of me. Now I’m left staring up at the strangeness that is Nightenjay. I notice for the first time his eyes are a deep blue the color of the distant ocean where it meets the sky. 

At a loss for words, I struggle within Nightenjay’s grasp, which causes him to shift slightly to press himself against me. “I’m not letting you up, not when I finally have you exactly where I want you: under me and glistening in oil” He emphasizes his statement with a shift of his hips, and I gasp. My eyes widen in surprised excitement, and I stare up at him with confusion and wonder. 

“You… do you like me?” I replied softly, suddenly unsure what’s going on here. My mind struggles to put the pieces together, because it just doesn’t make sense.

“Of course,” he responds confidently. “Aegis, I’ve been flirting with you for months.” He explains patiently, as if I’ve been woefully oblivious to his flirtatious ploys. Which, to be fair, I don’t typically consider throwing Roneria into daily chaos as a flattering form of foreplay. Not that I generally receive many attempts at flirtation, so maybe I’m just out of touch with how it’s properly done these days. 

Nevertheless, my jaw drops. “You… you what?!” I exclaim, outraged that he’s been causing me so much trouble because he *likes* me. That’s not the normal way to go about things, damnit! My heart pounds loudly in my chest, a frantic beat that beckons like a siren’s call. 

Nightenjay’s eyes grow hooded at my positive response. “Mmm, and look, it worked out precisely as I planned.” He lowers his head slightly, slowly, and leans closer to mine. His eyes drop to my lips as if he can’t help himself. “And just think about what sorts of stunts I’ll pull now that we’re dating! I’ll have to keep things interesting.” 

Shocked by his blatant self-assurance and ridiculous declaration as well as slightly scared for my immediate future, I gape like a fish. But it turns out that that was all the invitation that Nightenjay needed, and he touched his lips to mine.  ",CheetahCheeks

"[WP] You've had a crush on the local Superhero for a while. In an effort to get their attention, you've unintentionally become a Supervillain.",Tortolonch,"Sigh. It was a sigh that I have heard too many times in my life. Kelly shook her disapprovingly head at me. She frowned, just like all the other times. Her smile still eludes me.

I do not understand. Everything was supposed to be perfect this time. I kept quiet, hoping that maybe... just maybe, she will see past what I have done this time. To see that my action is nothing but a declaration of love, a testament to how far I would go for her. 

""Why, Doctor?"" was all she could muster. Her voice sounded tired. This was not how I pictured things would happen. She is not even looking at me, her head turned towards the floor.

""Kelly,"" I said as I took a step towards her. I wanted to hold her, to tell her that I did everything for her. All my actions until today were to prove my love for her. No one else understood Kelly but me.

A blast of laser shot out from her eyes, shattering the floor in front of me. 

""Stop!"" she yelled. Her eyes glowed red. Her hands clenched into fists.

""I have told you many times to stop calling me that,"" she seethed through her teeth. ""My name is Azure.""

""But we both know your real name is Kel-""

I never got to finish my sentence. A strong force knocked me backwards and pushed me to the walls. The impact almost knocked me out. I would usually howl in pain, but a familiar scent stopped me. Kelly's face was inches from mine.

""This is the first time that I've been so close to you,"" I told her, wishing that the moment would drag on forever. I smiled, hoping that she would finally return the favour. Instead, she threw me across the room. It hurt, but it was worth it, as I recalled her scent.

""Enough!"" she yelled as I hit the floor. She pointed to the bodies lying at the side of the room, then shifted her gaze back to me. 

""Why?"" Instead of adoration, I only saw the disgust on her face.

I slowly pulled myself up. My fingers slowly stroke my face. The pain made me wince, but it did not compare to the pain of yet another disappointment. It was a face she was supposed to love. I spent so much time trying to recreate it. 

I tracked down all the men that was needed to make the face. Those blue eyes. The sharp nose. The double chin. All to look like him.

""How could you?"" I heard Kelly whisper. Tears was streaming down her face. ""After what you did to him? Now you want to defile his memory by being him?""

I shook my head. It was never my intention to be him. I thought that if I removed him, Kelly would finally accept me. But that didn't happen. Instead, she became obssessed with his memory. She no longer smiled. I thought I could bring her smile back by being him.

I wanted to tell Kelly. That she is the only reason why I am who I am today. Everything that I did, everyone that I sacrificed, was only for her. I wanted her to see that. I wanted so badly for her to understand.

But the last thing that I saw was her glowing red eyes.

"[WP] You've had a crush on the local Superhero for a while. In an effort to get their attention, you've unintentionally become a Supervillain.",Tortolonch,"At first, I thought I could do anything to get her attention. And I did. I remember how it happened, how the cat and mouse chase began. How I became her nemesis. I remember the story how I turned into the supervillain.

Cassie is a unique hero. She isn't the strongest hero, but she is very popular. Her superpowers? People didn't know, as whoever she captured were silenced. We can only assume. Every time she meets villain, the villain soon gives himself up. The surrender is rather peaceful and then she gives her victory speech about solving villain issues with as little violence as possible.

She has failed many times as well. This is when the other stronger heroes come into play and take things over. Cassie is probably most requested hero whenever it is a hostage situation. She can get villain and save hostage without any damage.

Of course, there was one more thing. She was stunningly beautiful. I realised it whenever I was near her. I worked in a local newspaper, so being around her was the usual thing, but that's it. Her hair is red like a charcoal burning as hot as it could. She smelled like a spring, flowers blooming and asking me to be there. Her hero clothing was a simple red dress, nothing fancy compared to others.

That was when I made a decision. I needed to become someone she could count on, someone she would notice. Of course, I had hopes for more than that.

It was night; a hostage situation. I arrived first. Then she came. As the first hero on the scene, she didn't tell me to go away. Instead, she just asked who I was. *Supporthero*, that is my stage name!

Stupidest... name... ever!

She showed openly amusement, but she didn't tell about it. I guess it was her overall respect towards other so-called heroes, like me.

""I'll surrender, okay?"" a man said via radio not long after, when Cassie smiled victoriously. People were clapping.

""How did you do it?"" I just asked her.

""Every woman has their secrets,"" Cassie responded with a wink. She took the radio and said: ""Come outside, I will send someone to get you at the door. Make sure that hostage is released when you leave!""

""Go, get the man,"" Cassie told me with a smirk. I left her side and walked towards the exit. The man came out and I reached him. The man was shaking and sweaty. Actually, saying sweaty doesn't describe the picture. It was more.

""Okay, I'll let her go and everything will be alright?"" the man said, even his voice was shaking.

""What happened?"" I asked.

The man looked at the Cassie and then whispered to me ""She is in my head. She knows everything about me. Make it stop! Just take that girl and take me away!""

I looked at the man and then back at the Cassie. She was still stunningly beautiful, even when she didn't look towards me. I wanted her to look at me. I wanted all her attention. All the police lighting and the clear sky with millions of stars behind and above her made her even more pretty.

I looked at the man, smiled. ""It is the time we get out of here!""

I rarely used my own power. I never thought it was anything that special, but it was the first time I felt like I knew why I was given that power. It was also the only way to get her attention. I would get nowhere if I stayed the support character.

""I lied,"" I shouted. Everyone stopped cheering and moved their attention towards me. Cassie who was taking congratulations turned around and stared at me as well. I looked only her.

""I am not *supportman*. I am Dave and I am going to be someone you are going to chase after,"" I grinned, moved my hand up, just to look more flashy, and then I and the shaking guy turned invisible. We weren't there anymore.

I was a reporter. I had my tricks how I got my stories, my pictures and how I got into places others couldn't. So, I knew exactly how to stay invisible when needed.

"[WP] You've had a crush on the local Superhero for a while. In an effort to get their attention, you've unintentionally become a Supervillain.",Tortolonch,"God I hope there's more.

I half expect this ""fight"" to be taken to the rooftops.",fusionater
"[WP] You've had a crush on the local Superhero for a while. In an effort to get their attention, you've unintentionally become a Supervillain.",Tortolonch,"Wow, I dunno. All the times I got near her? Lessee.

The first time was just standing on the balcony outside my office. She was flying past being chased by the Blue Mosquito. You know how he's surrounded by that cloud of flies? One flew in my mouth and I ate it, I think. I guess it had some of his mutagens on it. I got real sick for a few days. Afterwards, I think it jacked my metabolism a little, because I didn’t need to sleep as much anymore and I healed a little faster. I didn’t think much about it at the time.

Second time nothing happened. She fell out of the sky battling someone, kicked up a bunch of dirt in Central Park. She climbed out of the hole, looked at me, said “Stand back, Citizen” and fly off. Amazing. That was back when she wore the bodysuit, remember? I guess that’s when I really started getting into her, going to the message boards and the “Friends of Andromegan” groups on Facebook and so forth.

Third time was when Doctor Maelstrong was holding up the TD Bank near Bryant Park last summer. I heard something was going down so I ran over and got to the front of the crowd. He had that big magic scepter with the ruby, remember? Anyway he had her down on the ground and was going to pound her skull in with it but she grabbed it mind-swing. Man, it was amazing! 
She squeezed the gem and it exploded, and then the Doctor sort of deflated back into his normal self and that was that. What? Oh yeah, it sent fragments everywhere. I got hit by a couple. The doctors in the emergency room said they couldn’t get them out since my skin kept closing up over them, so after the third office visit I just gave up. 

Fourth time was when there was that big fight between her and the Tokomak Kid. They had battling all over Manhattan, and I was listening on the radio while I drove back to the city. Then at some point she yelled to him to take the fight elsewhere and he yelled back how yeah he felt like a hot dog anyway and everybody said “Coney Island” but *I* thought to myself Callahan’s, they are going to Callahan’s. So I drove north and sure enough they dropped out of the sky near where they have that truck now since the main restaurant closed. Then the kid did something with his armor and I guess shot a super blast of nanoparticles at her – some kind of disassembler, he said - which didn’t stop her OF COURSE, but it melted everything within a block that wasn’t protected. 

When the EMT’s got there they said I survived because I was in a car and the nanites mostly ate the car before it got to me, even though a few got on me anyway. They got all excited when I was in the hospital, because the spots where the scepter crystals were embedded were no glowing and there was looked like fine lines growing off them, but I was too pissed off to stick around. I mean, OK my car was destroyed, but fucking Callahan’s was too.  Now where am I going to get rippers from? Oh fuck you, “Rudd’s Hutt” man, those are small. Poor Callahan’s.

I guess I saw her a few more times around the city. I mean everyone does if you live or work in Manhattan, right? I’d call out to her and say hi. A few times back then she’d give me an odd look, but she never said anything.

Then – I guess this was number eight –she’s fighting Dr. Maelstrong again, this was by the Library, right? He had imprisoned her in a cage of magic (I’m assuming) and I was watching from the street. Then he actually looks at me and says to me “You’ve got something that belongs to me” and he makes mystic passes in the air and sends this wave of green fire at me saying “you shall be my new servant.” And I was like “cool” but also figured I was done for. But then the fire hit me, and all the ruby spots glowed and just sort of sucked it up into the junk attached to them. Wha? I dunno! I guess the nanites were using the ruby fragments for power because the lines just started growing everywhere. Fucking Tokamak Kid, I know! 

But then Dr. M gets pissed, I guess, and he comes at me, and he’s got the glowing shield going around him, except now I can see there are weak spots in it. Like it’s obvious. So right when he’s on my I give the shield a punch, and it explodes. 

Ok, then this is the totally fucked part. There’s another flash coming at me and I figure it’s Dr. M again, so I sort of blindly punch again. But it turns out it’s not. It’s Andromegan. And there’s a crack and she goes flying. And then Dr. M escapes. And, I dunno, I get scared and ran away too.

I guess that’s when she started thinking I was some kind of enemy of hers.

"[WP] You've had a crush on the local Superhero for a while. In an effort to get their attention, you've unintentionally become a Supervillain.",Tortolonch,"Christine, strength like the current you would never guess is as strong as it actually is, hair so beautiful you could fall in love with it just by getting a glimpse of the locks as she whizzes by at super sonic speed. AND SPEED! Let me tell you she can move; faster than anything I have ever seen. She has this smile that makes the most subtle person blush. She's good to look at from afar and admire, but I had the opportunity to meet her in person and that's when I really fell for the girl. As you can probably tell she is a super hero, a very classic one at that. You read about Superman and you never expect that there could actually be something equivalent out there. Alas, Christine blasts into your life and the world becomes a better place for a short while. But all strong forces have an equal opposing force, or so I've heard. 

I met our hero when I was victim of a terrorist attack. A terrorist attack that happened in my office building, a bomb went off on the lower level and it caused a malfunction in the whole integrity of the building. I knew I was done for, floor 75 was too high up to receive any help and the stairwells were all but destroyed from the shift in concrete. I wheeled my office chair, the same one I scratched up through the years of fiddling with the armrests, through the window outside my office. I watched as the chair plummeted to the earth knowing I would soon follow. I had a girlfriend at the time and I texted her saying I was in the office and there was no hope for me and that I enjoyed our time together. We were not quite at the 'I love you' stage yet so I didn't really want to distraught her more than necessary given the situation. I did truly think I loved her at that time, she was the last person I was able to hold. Means something when you are about to die.

I approached the window and I looked down while holding on the edge. I see a multitude of items being hurled through multiple office windows from people following the same path as me. Printers, desks, even one's own body being thrown against the industrial glass. I move my feet over to the edge of the window and I see people in offices above me zoom past my face on their way to a sweet release in all this terror. My mom once told me that once you are on the edge of life's cliff you will get the sudden urge to jump. Of course she was talking of natural risk taking but I felt that same feeling on a very real edge. I just jumped. I saw the skyline quickly take the setting sun as I fell below their building heights, I felt less scared than I had the past thirty minutes at that moment. The ground was approaching and I closed my eyes and accepted my fate. Then, the wind was knocked out of me. 

Up. I was going up. The only thing I thought of was that I was dead and this was the feeling you felt as you died. Almost angelic, who would have thought? Fortunately, I was not dead. Instead I was in the arms of a woman with beautiful auburn hair. Her breastplate (think Wonder Woman but less amazonian and more knightly) firmly pressed against my left side and her arms taking the rest of my body. Her strength was incredible as we zoomed to a nearby building top. When I say 'zoomed' I literally mean at a ridiculous speed. So fast I couldn't breathe and actually passed out. I awoke on a building roof near my old office building. Among me were a few other people and all they could talk about was being saved and how terrible the attack was. I was transfixed, who was it that saved me? 

I spent the remaining years figuring out everything I could about Christine. Where she was from, how she became this strong, what kind of food she liked. You know, the normal stuff. It became an obsession to the point that I fell madly in love with this girl I had never really met. Every time there was an attack I would rush to the scene. I quit my job in order to pursue destruction in an attempt to catch a glimpse of my Aphrodite. Bombings in Russia, I was there the next day. Afghanistan saw suicide bombings that rattled the world, I was close behind. But every attempt I found I was too slow and missed her. That's when the itch started. What if I could summon her myself? No, that would require something bad to happen. Christine only showed up when things were bad, never good.

This ideology plagued my mind for two years and I had to constantly fight the urge until one day I spun into a dark place in my mind. I needed her. Maybe just once? Just so I can see her. I had the plan, it would all be incognito in order to play the victim and maybe get an audience with her. I spent the entire time before finally committing to this horrible atrocity studying pyrotechnics and everything that went 'boom'. My target was to be a university music hall, I did what was needed to level it and waited to the appropriate day. September 23rd. I sat and waited in a near by bench with my trigger ready and pulled. In a second I saw the clouds disperse and she was there. The plan worked and destruction was ever-present. She was too late. 

I ran to her. Every strand of my existence moved me to her, I couldn't resist the urge.

'You're Christine!'

'Yes? Do you know why I am here?'

'To stop a... uh... this bad thing from happening?' This is where I found her one fatal flaw. Christine thought the best in everyone, that the world was full of confused people but good people. She took my obvious lie to heart. 

'Yes, sadly I am too late...' 

'Wait! What if I could help you? I also have a special ability!' 

'Oh? Companionship would be nice... What can you do?'

'I have the... uh... ability to foresee events like this happening. I am just not powerful enough to stop them. I came here as soon as I felt the shift in order, but I couldn't help because I am not strong enough to stop it.'

'I am strong! I can be the strength you need and you can be the brains I need!' My dreams have come true. I have acquired her attention and now I have a future with her. I spent the rest of my time setting up different catastrophic attacks and seeing them through and leading her through a wild goose chase of my own creation. She thinks we are hunting a man named Erzog who wants nothing but to watch the world burn by his hand. When in fact, it's me that creating this mass destruction. I do it so she has a reason to keep me around, I slow her down sure but we are always arriving a day or two before the atrocity happens so she doesn't feel restrained. If anything she feels like she's making better time already being at the location. We spend days together searching for the bad guys and the bombs they left behind. My 'power' only allows me to get a general idea of where they are so we have to band together in order to find them. Again, all a large game in order for her to spend more time with me. 

She started growing feelings for me through all the nights we spent together waiting for the next days goose chase. I would even say she fell in love with me. Finally the feeling is mutual, I have what I wanted. I had to become a monster to get the angel. She knows not what I have done, what I plan on doing, or why I did this. Nor do I, I just know that love is my fire and I'll burn the whole world if I need to in order to see it remain fueled. I must go now, she's going to be waking up soon. I have made her breakfast and have a lovely day planned for us! First we will get food right in front of the Eiffel Tower and search the local buildings for signs of terrorist activity. We will find a ready-to-blow bomb in a nearby museum, and then the grand finale will be us finding, together, the strain of explosives below the Eiffel Tower itself! Saving the monument and the day. She is usually in a much better mood when we actually save the day and I thought I'd give her this one and maybe we can spend the weekend somewhere nice. What a life. ",Slootcio
"[WP] You've had a crush on the local Superhero for a while. In an effort to get their attention, you've unintentionally become a Supervillain.",Tortolonch,"Emma was the most fabulous hero out there.

Of course she was, you just had to take a look at the self-made cape and outfit&amp;mdash;a red hoodie and jeans with her arrow-like logo plastered all over it&amp;mdash;to realize how clever and innovative she was. And she called herself Askance. 

I mean, how cool of a name is that? 

Better than all those flashy people going around the city and leaping out at the first sign of an evildoer, she was a hero for the people. Helping with yardwork, getting cats out of trees, setting up lights on houses. All these little things that anyone could do, but she could do faster and easier. She could fly, after all. 

That was the best part, watching her soar by overhead, on her way to do something else helpful. I got to see her take off, once, a running start before hurling herself into the air. Cape fluttering, a red streak in the sky, it really was an amazing sight. Though I'd followed once or twice&amp;mdash;secretly, of course&amp;mdash;I'd never found where she went at the end of the day.

She didn't know I knew her secret identity. I mean, she wasn't trying *that* hard to keep it a secret. Just her costume and a paper mask. But I'd seen her hoodie come off once, and that long brown ponytail was unmistakable. Emma from Spanish class, who sat at the side and raised her hand when the class got awkwardly quiet. 

I wasn't stalking her, I swear.

But I did want to say something. Anything at all, just to get to meet her. But have you ever tried to say ****o, and the words just get stuck in your throat? Or find that you can't even stand up to walk over to her desk? I mean, I consider myself reasonably confident, but that had to be the hardest thing I've ever done.

So you can't blame me too much for my plan. It felt like the only natural way to get into a conversation. But even I had to admit after a week that pretending to trim the tree in my front yard every day probably wasn't going to attract her attention, even if most of the branches were clearly much too high for me to reach on my own.

But it *did* give me lots of time to think of a new plan. Hacking away at the nonexistent leaves... well, perhaps she was looking for a challenge. She could be bored of all these little things, want to move on to something bigger.

And I was reasonably sure I had everything I needed to make something 'bigger' in the back of my closet.

---

My plan went off as flawlessly as a rock through a window. That is to say, if flawlessly means *'leaving a big dangerous mess that will be hard to get out of.'*

Hiding in an alleyway, wearing a large backpack full of random junk and topped with a few electrical appliances&amp;mdash;I'd taken the toaster&amp;mdash;I thought I'd made a pretty good impression. Skatter, the most infamous, persistent, destructive villain out there. I'd rewatched a few of the blurry videos people had managed to take and post on the internet, flying around on his jetpack, making various threats or planting large devices that looked like bad news.

So I was him, and I would wander out around the suburbs. Emma&amp;mdash;I mean, Askance, would fly down to stop me, and then we'd both have a good laugh about superheroes and villains and I could ask her what her day job was.

Sometimes I look back and wonder why exactly talking to Emma turned me into a brain-dead zombie.

Either way, I didn't get to talk to her, at least not in the way I'd planned. Clomping along the street after school, waiting, waiting, *waiting* for her to show up and do something.

And then I saw something in the sky, off in the distance, and my stomach lurched. Was it a bird? Or a plane? Or maybe it was *her.* (I'd rehearsed that more times than I'm willing to say.)

But something seemed off about it, that flying blob. It wasn't weaving and twirling like Emma did as she flew. It was going in a straight line, high above. And that slight noise, a shrill whine, didn't sound right.  Eventually, with a growing sense of horror, I realized what it was.

Skatter.

He *never* came out into the suburbs. But that was him, rocket pack and all, heading determinedly out to who-knows-where. And here *I* was, mocking his style on the street just below him.

For a minute, I simply couldn't move. But then I was jerked backward, away from the street. A hand on my arm dragging me toward a tree. My cry of surprise was cut short when I saw who it was. Emma, dressed in a normal outfit and an expression of total terror written all over her face. ""Brian! What are you *doing?""*

That was my name. She knew my *name.* How did she know my name? That was just about all I could think of. So I asked her.

""How do you know my name?""

The terror transformed into confusion for a split second. ""You're in my Spanish class.""

*Oh yeah.*

Then she repeated herself, shaking my arm a little. ""What are you *doing?* Why were you just standing there? And why are you *dressed* like him?"" With every question, her voice rose a little in pitch, and I found that I didn't really have an answer. 

Thankfully, I didn't need to give one, because that was right when the supervillain descended on us.

He looked different up close. A small man, held up only by the machine on his back sending blue waves toward the ground and feet dangling. The first thing that struck me was that I'd gotten my costume *way* off. I was much too tall to try and pretend I was Skatter.

The second thing was his eyes, staring at me with cold confusion. ""And what are you supposed to be?"" The way he spoke was smooth and elegant, a practiced tone. 

Glancing at Emma, I took in her fearful expression and decided I needed to say something. So I turned to him, and with all the confidence I could muster, gave him an answer. ""...A robot.""

His expression was not pleased.

One hand moved to pull a device from his pack. It looked like a spider, long spindly legs attached to a round body. It had a timer, highlighted in red numbers. 1:00. Somehow I doubted that was an hour.

When he directed it toward me, I realized just why Emma looked so terrified. Before I could even leap to the side, it snapped forward of it's own volition, the numerous tiny legs wrapping around my chest. In a panic, I tried to rip it off, but the bindings were too strong.

""Now you're a robot with a self destruct button."" Skatter pressed a button on something in his hand, and the timer beeped, transforming into a 0:59. And then a 0:58.

""Brian!"" Emma gasped, pointing at it. 

Which was strange, I would have imagined her doing something heroic. But it was almost a relief to realize she was just as scared as I was. Speaking of which, I was terrified. Tearing that the device, trying my best to rip it off. No dice. I watched, heart pounding, as the numbers ticked down. ""No. No no no...""

But rather than running away, Emma stepped up to me, placing a finger on my shoulder. A moment later I felt a rush of something cold run through me, and the legs of the bomb snapped off from me at every angle, sending it skittering across the street. My backpack full of electronics tore away too, my watch and the house key in my pocket, all flying away. I could feel them pushing back on me, enough force to make me take a surprised step backward.

A second later, the beeping device exploded, blowing a crater in the street.

"[WP] You've had a crush on the local Superhero for a while. In an effort to get their attention, you've unintentionally become a Supervillain.",Tortolonch,"My confusion was obviously shared by Skatter, as we both sat there and stared at the smoking pothole for a moment too long. Just enough time for Emma to grab my hand&amp;mdash;my hand, not my arm&amp;mdash;and set off in a dead sprint around the side of the house.

""How did you do that?"" I gasped. I probably could have saved my questions for later, but now seemed as good a time as any. ""I thought your power was flying!"" 

This was the second time I saw bemusement on her face in just about as many minutes, and this time she was the one to ask me, ""How did you know that?""

""You're in my Spanish class."" I wouldn't tell her I'd figured it out while watching her clean off a neighbors roof by flying up to it.

The suspicion on her face was gone in an instant, leading the way behind the house and making for the fence. ""Well, no. that's not what I do."" Even while running, she managed to work her hand into a pocket and pull out a handful of something, shoving them in my direction. I caught a few, and realized I was holding a bunch of paperclips. ""I use these to fly.""

That didn't help me at all, and the hum of Skatter cresting the roof behind us didn't help my thought process. He was silent now, regarding us with a curious malice. Emma ducked under another tree, dropping a paperclip, and then dragged me close into a hug.

Before I could compute this sudden change of events, we both hurled up into the air, and she landed us neatly on a branch in the tree. It took another moment for me to realize she'd let go, and I hadn't. So I did, as smooth as I could. ""What was that then?""

She put a finger to her lips, right as the short supervillain dipped below our feet, clearly looking for us. He was gone a moment later, but I had a sinking feeling that he wouldn't give up very easily.

""I can turn myself into a magnet. Sort of."" Emma's voice breaks the silence in a shaky whisper. ""Repel metal. I didn't know I could do it to *other* people too, but when I saw it counting down, I just..."" 

""That's *awesome.""* I did my best to whisper as well, but it was difficult with the excitement I felt at that. She was telling me how her powers worked!

Emma's face didn't brighten at all. ""Yeah, well, he's still faster than me. We won't be able to escape on foot.""

""Oh."" That was right. Still being chased. Strange how often I had to remind myself of that. ""There's gotta be *something* you can do."" 

But all she did was shake her head and clutch at the trunk of the tree.

I had to think. I came up with plans, right? They were bad plans, but it was still better than waiting for him to find us. So I thought. And thought. Racked my brains, tried to come up with something. From here I could still see the crater in the road, and my various things where they'd been scattered.

And that's what gave me my grand idea.

It was a terrible idea. Even I knew that this time. But I sure wasn't going to tell *her* that. 

Sitting beneath the tree, though, pretending to hide and yet be seen, I was reasonably sure I was going to need a cold shower when this was all over.

It didn't take him long to spot me, hovering into view. Even only a few feet above the ground, he didn't touchdown. Just let his feet trail the grass, sliding smoothly forward. ""Given up?""

""Uh... absolutely."" I had no idea how well I could actually fool him, but I scooted around the trunk nervously anyway. ""Take me in. Teach me a lesson. I didn't... didn't mean to insult you.""

""Insult me?"" His eyes narrowed. ""Oh no, I'm just interested in making you into an authentic robot. After all, what good is a robot if it doesn't have an 'off' button?"" Even as he spoke, his hand slithered around to another pocket on his backpack, digging around for something.

""Sure. I guess you're right."" Another few steps backward, carefully moving over roots and watching him drift closer. 

This made him hesitate&amp;mdash;just a few feet too far. Desperate, I did the first thing that came to mind. Which is how my handful of paperclips spattered across his face.

I'm sure our expressions of surprise were very similar.

Luckily, this made him frown deeply and angle himself forward that last meter needed. Just in time for one more paperclip to drop from the sky above and land between his legs. And then for Emma to follow right afterward, falling out of the tree to land practically right on Skatter's head.

Of course, the plan wasn't simply to wrestle him to the ground. The resulting explosion of movement resulting from Emma's touch was hard to follow. Backpacks, paperclips, and Emma herself flew away from him, and I found myself in exactly the right spot to catch her as she tumbled through the air. Or at least break her fall.

When we stood back up, Skatter was running across the grass, saying things that I won't repeat, and chasing his backpack. It seemed determined to stay away from him, like a clown chasing a ball, rolling away every time he got closer.

The sight was funnier than I care to admit, and soon enough I was chuckling. ""How long will that last?"" 

Emma was sitting up on her own, roughed up a little from her tumble. ""Uh... Probably about ten minutes. I gave him as much as I could.""

""That should be enough time to call&amp;mdash;"" I was inturrupted by the sound of sirens, speeding down the street. Police. Of course, someone had heard the explosion and called 911 already. 

""I don't think we'll have to bother."" Emma smiled back, standing up and brushing herself off. ""Thanks for leading him in. I never would have caught up to him otherwise.""

""Yeah. Yeah, no problem."" There it was again. She'd needed help. So maybe she wasn't quite the superhero I'd imagined I'd meet on the street.

But, I decided then and there, she was still pretty fabulous.

She had first appeared in the skies over our city about two months before, around the time all the kids came home from school.  I'd heard about her, of course, even caught a glimpse in the western sky one evening as she flew across the setting Sun. But it wasn't until that humid afternoon when I was downtown that I actually met her. Almost. I mean, I was there, she was there. The woman who'd fallen from the terrace cafe was there. 

She was a wonder to behold. Statuesque, with sun-kissed skin and short, black, curly locks. Her super suit consisted of a deep blue, off-the-shoulder, one-piece, with a yellow cape on a chain, fastened with a gold clasp. She wore metal bracelets, and metal attachments to her boots. Did those help her fly? I knew she could fly. And she seemed to be very strong. She scanned the crowd quickly, and in that moment, for the briefest instant, her deep blue eyes locked gaze with mine. In that moment, I knew: I was in love.

And then suddenly, she was gone.

I stood in the middle of the intersection watching her rise into the sky, cape fluttering behind her, in awed silence. And there I would've stayed had a hand not yanked me out of the street. I heard the screech of brakes as I hit the sidewalk.

""Hey, fella,"" the construction worker shook me a couple times. ""You okay? You can't stand in the street like that."" 

Behind him, a cab driver said something similar, but less politely. I ignored them both. All I could think of was how to meet her again. 

I started hanging out downtown every day. Starting eating at the terrace cafe every day until out of desperation, I climbed their new, reinforced railing and the waiters chased me out. Another afternoon, I heard her flying overhead, so I stepped out in front of a southbound bus, but a policeman whistled me back.

The papers ran a headline: Sapphire Foils West-Side Robbery. Of course! She fights crime, too. That's how I could meet her. Commit a crime! Nothing big, naturally. I wasn't looking to get in *real* trouble. I just wanted to get her attention. 

By September, I embarked on a one-man crime spree! I stole an old woman's purse at the bus stop, but two other ladies beat me with theirs. I attempted to pick a pocket, but some businessmen chased after me. I saw a baby stroller in the park, the mother on the bench engrossed in her phone ... but I'm not that kind of monster. Frustrated, I even walked out of the diner without paying for breakfast, but I turned back, dejected, when the waitress hollered after me. 

I needed a new approach. I hunkered down, secluding myself, gathering all intell -- newspapers, Internet reports, social media video. I saw her moves, knew her strengths, could predict her actions. During that time, I built a lab in my basement, readying my plan and building my confidence. It paid off in multiple ways -- I found it much easier to rob stores and commit crimes when I wasn't looking to get caught. And this got me the money I needed to continue.  

In November, I drove over to Oakwood for some parts, and I had an encounter with their brash new hero, Magnet Man or something.  He suffered a setback as the thrill of disarming me distracted him long enough for me to knock him down and out. I left him alive, but I took all his magnets and his suit. That seriously boosted my research. I couldn't wait to get them back to the lab, and move up my timetable.

By January 1, I moved into a warehouse on the outskirts of town.

I was finally ready to unleash my plot in February. It was the 14th, and gentlemen were rushing about getting flowers and chocolate for their ladies. Me? I subdued the drivers of an armored car for my lady love, then drove their truck to my lair. I didn't have to wait long before she was knocking on my door, and pounding through it.

When she entered, I sat at a table for two, candles lit and a bottle of champagne on ice. ""Welcome! I'm so glad you could make it! Join me, please.""

Oddly, she seemed furious with me, not appreciative of the lengths to which I'd gone to get her attention.

""I'll join my fists to either side of your head,"" she exclaimed and marched angrily toward me. 

Sigh. Plan B: I pressed the button on the remote next to me and stopped Sapphire in her tracks. The magnets beneath the warehouse floor held her boots  firmly in place leaving her unable to take a step. Her fists were being pulled downward thanks to those metal bracelets. And her suit ...

Uh-oh. I hadn't realized that her super suit included metallic reinforcements! And it was being pulled downward. 

""I beg your pardon"" I yelled and scurried across the floor. Grabbing her cape, I swung it in front of her to preserve her modesty. A time and a place for that, but not here. ""Sorry, this isn't how I envisioned our meeting. I wanted it to be special.""

""Are you always this creepy with women?""

Creepy? 

""Can you at least let me adjust myself? This isn't very comfortable.""

""Oh. Certainly. Yes! Yes! Anything for you, my love!"" I think she winced as I ran back to the table and dialed back the strength of the magnet. I could see her arms raise underneath the privacy of her cape. I didn't peek, but I did notice the wiggling involved. I was debating how I could bring the first course to her when I heard metal clanging on the floor.

Tossing her cape behind, she looked at marvelous as ever, but she'd also flung off her bracelets and had stepped out of boots. A feast for the eyes and she hurried to join me for a feast at my table. But then her bare foot swung around and swept my legs, and I think there was a fist to my head because I don't remember actually hitting the floor. 

When I came around, I was in the back of one of the many patrol cars surrounding my lair. I smiled at the officer up front. ""Hey, wanna hear about my great first date? I'm already planning our second.""

I have contingencies in place. I'll be ready to see her again sometime in May. Maybe for her anniversary!

"[WP] The Moon was full, and close, and red. The Moon was awake. The Moon was hungry.",icepho3nix,"Everyone on this side of the planet could see it. The man on the moon, his face grinning, the whole entity glowing with a sickening red that painted the sky. No one knew how or why it was happening, just that the moon was angry and it was coming toward us. 

People stared in awe. Preachers came around to doors carrying bibles and pleading to anyone and everyone to repent their sins and believe in the Holy Spirit. Children cried in confusion in terror. Teenage boys confessed their love, they thought they had nothing to lose. Just normal apocalyptic stuff. 

The Moon loomed over us, the loud crack and boom resounded throughout the world as the moon entered our atmosphere. The face still looked at us, its creepy grinning mouth opening wide.

""I. AM. HUNGRY."" The mouth barely moved but the sound was tremendous. Suddenly a missile was fired from somewhere South. Three more missiles were sent up. Then out of nowhere, hundreds of missiles were being activated and sent rocketing toward the moon. It opened its mouth wide and swallowed them up. 

""That's courtesy of SpaceX, now serving moon food!"" A voice that could be heard across many nations and oceans. 

""THANKS. ELON."" The moon smiled and the red faded from its surface. It slowly closed its eyes and receded back into orbit.

The world rejoiced and Elon chuckled, saving the world was just too easy.  ",llamachicken1

Alyssa called out as she snuggled under the covers, closing her sleepy eyes as she waited to hear the soft shuffling sounds of her grandma coming to sit by her bed. 

""What shall I read for you, my dear?"" 

Alyssa started, surprised at the voice coming towards her in the dark. *I didn't hear her come in...maybe I fell asleep* she thought.  ""Read me the poem about the moon."" 

""Mmm, the moon."" purred the voice. 

""Grandma, are you ok?"" Alyssa was worried, something wasn't right. 

""What? *cough*, yes dear, just a scratchy throat. You just close your eyes now."" But Alyssa didn't close her eyes. She pulled her cloak tighter around her shoulders, drawing the hood over her head enough so that Grandma couldn't see her eyes, but she could still see Grandma. 

""The Moon was full, the moon was bright! The moon came out to play at night,""

Alyssa smiles at the familiar rhyme. She told herself it was nothing. Everything was just as it had aways been— ""Wait, what?""

""I said, 'The moon was awake! But it's time for bed! Now shut those eyes!""

*What on earth?* thought the little girl. Grandma had never yelled at her before. Maybe she was having pains for her arthritis. 

""They're closed Grandma,"" she lied, ""keep reading.""

""Right, well where was I... 

""You said it's time for bed,"" 

""Yes yes, now hush. *ahem*, ""It's time for bed, you...sleepyhead! The moon was full, and close and red...""

*Red??? No. Something is definitely wrong*, Alyssa moved her hands under her pillow, feeling around...yes, there it was. She grasped her hands around the handle and waited.

""The moon looked good, the moon looked yummy...the moon belongs inside my tummy *smack*..."" and with a howl the wolf threw the book across the room and pounced on the bed. But Alyssa was up and ready with her knife. She stabbed the beast in its throat, and again in its belly. The wolf fell to the ground and she leapt over it, running towards the front door. She saw grandma's knitting on the floor by the fireplace, shreds of her apron strewn across the floor. She could hear the wolf struggling upstairs as she flung open the front door, and ran across the snow, wincing as it stung her bare feet, and banged on the door of the Huntsman's cabin next door. ""Help help! It's Alyssa!"" 

A burly sleepy man opened the door subbing his eyes, ""Red...what are you doing here this time of—""

"[WP] She stared at him, holding a plate of cookies in one hand and a rifle in the other. “Hello Santa.” She said.",mandydchew,"Settling the final gift under the tree, the old man turns as he straightens, and his face pales. On little socked feet, a young girl walks closer, and she doesn’t look like most kids he meets.

“Hello, Santa.” She says, voice tight and cold like a coffin made of ice. “So glad to meet you.” She says politely, offering him a plate of cookies with the hand that doesn’t hold a gun.

With shaking hands, he takes the plate, removing a cookie because he assumes it’s what he’s supposed to do. “H-Hello, Miss Rosalynn.” Her face hardens, and he shoves the cookie into his mouth to avoid angering the kid any more.

“We’re gonna have a little talk, okay?” She asks, more a statement than a question. When he nods, she walks him into the garage, and to a wooden chair. He hesitates, and she aims the gun at his foot. “Sit.” She commands him as though she were a full grown adult, a smooth assassin rather than an angry child.

“Y-Yes, of co-course..” Santa gets out, before she shoves him backwards into the chair. He starts to ask anything, everything, just to get information, but she just slaps him. He’s stunned, and just sits, staring.

Reaching into a pillowcase, she pulls out a few belts. Using them, she straps him down to the arms and legs of the chair. Next, she unwinds christmas lights, using them to tie his torso. “Learned my knots in Girl Scouts, not that it matters to you.” She grumbles, setting the rifle aside. Last, she grabs a wooden spoon, the one Momma hits her with when she doesn’t obey quick enough.

Santas eyes open wide as he stares at her, struggling to get himself free. “If you let me go, I’ll g-give you everything in the sled.” He tries, hoping to convince her. But, it only earns him a firm smack on the knee with the spoon.

Voice low and face filled with rage, Rosalynn explodes, “Gifts? Other people’s gifts at that? How stupid could you be to think that’d work?” When he opens his mouth to protest, she slaps him on the knuckles, glaring at him.

:Good.” She states, calming, as he just sits there, scared. “So, do you know what I got for my fifth Christmas?”

The change of direction catches him off-guard, and it takes him a second. “A-A Barbie car for you to drive in, two new dolls, some jewelry kits, and a first aid kit.” He remembers the wrapping of each one, the shiny bows and paper. So, he’s extra surprised when the spoon comes down again.

“Liar!” She screams in his face, tears stinging the corners of her eyes. “I got a pair of shoes that already smelled like feet, and some knock-off Barbie.” She shakes, holding back a cry. “Do you know what I got for my seventh Christmas?”

Santa pauses, thinking again. “A makeup kit, three beautiful dresses, real jewelry, hair bows and ties, some clips, and a stuffed raccoon.” He states as though it were obvious, startled when he’s hit on the other hand this time.

“Wrong again! I got a twenty-five cent necklace and half a pack of gum, and a pair of underwear that looked like they are meant for toddlers!” She slaps his forearm when he looks at her with hurt and confusion.

“Rosalynn, I left those gifts. I promise you.” He starts, wanting to apologize even if he’s not sure what happened.

“No!” She yells, tears running down her cheeks. “Do you know what I got last year? I’ll tell you! I got a single, opened sleeve of saltines! Are you gonna tell me that I got a house and a mommy that loves me, or a daddy that doesn’t hurt me, or brothers who treat me like I’m human?” In her rage, she slaps down a fury of blows, stopping when she almost hits him in the face, and she throws the spoon.

In her tiniest voice, she says, “Do you know what Leon and Luis got? They got clothes, watches, shoes, phones, tablets, video games, everything they ever asked for. And I’m there, holding my stuff and forced to thank you and them like that’s a normal thing!” She starts to cry, then scrabbles over and undoes Santa’s wrists. “I’m so sorry.” She manages, sobbing. “Sorry.”

In an instant, he tugs himself out of the restraint on his other wrist, working at the ones on his legs as she just cuts away the lights.

He lifts her, cradling her a bit as she sobs. “We’re gonna go to your room, you’re gonna grab everything that matters, and I’m gonna give you the best gift anyone could give you.” In a couple minutes, Santa has all the gifts back on the sleigh, and the small bag of things that mattered to the little girl.

Holding a piece of paper, her tears falling on it, Rosalynn writes. “Goodbye, mommy and daddy, Leon and Luis. I am done being hurt, and Im leaving. Don’t look for me, i don’t want you to.” At the bottom, she signs her name, in an ornate flourish. Taking a tack out of her board, she stabs the note into her door, walking quietly away.

“Ready?” Santa asks, bundling her in a a wool-lined jacket. “Do you wanna wave goodbye?”

Shaking her head, the ten year old sets her jaw. “Not now, not ever. Good riddance.” as she crosses her arm, instead focusing on the hoof beats and the feeling of gravity no longer applying.

[TT] One day you wake up and you suddenly know the answer to all your problems: it's a goat.,mythologue,"Sorry for the length. I got a bit carried away:

Fires roared, and black smoke rolled from the generators still humming feverously in their sealed off room. The lights dimmed to darkness as a message chimed in over the PA system. “Ding! The time is now 2100hours all personnel please report to your bedding chambers. Again the time is 2100hours all personnel please report to your bedding chambers” the voice was mechanical and droning. I like how they call us personnel… we are more like slaves, we work doing menial tasks until were adults where we are put into new jobs, without pay, based on our aptitudes and personalities. However, if anyone failed the test they’re sent away from the safety of our home. I studied hard to get the job I wanted only two days left until the test. I should probably get some rest… I step out of the control room and wipe my brow, I mean I could try to fail and leave or escape… like my father before me, I heard he escaped in the middle of the night. I could probably do that too… but life indoors was safe. I often wonder if my father was still alive out there. You see, 200 years ago the nukes dropped and only those who took shelter deep underground survived. The first people to leave were 10 years ago. 35 people left the safety of our home… 1 returned. He told us how all that was out there were legions of creatures in black scales, and raiders and humans who marched into lush forests and sleepy villages, leaving only ashes and death in their wake. I remember watching with my father as the man cradled his head and wept at the sites he had seen. All the bile and filth that he accumulated from just several hours outside. There was no way to survive out there... It was either be a slave and safe, or be free and dead. Or so I thought…
 
I woke in the morning to the PA system a symphony of trumpets blaring in my ears. I rushed over to the mess hall I was late for breakfast. If I didn’t hurry I wasn’t going to be able to eat today… I grabbed my meal card and rushed out of my room. I don’t even make it 3 steps out the door when I am stopped by Butch, a thug who thinks just because he’s stronger than the other inmates he could do what he pleased. Honestly… he was right who was going to stop him? He slugged me across the face, a mixture of spit and blood filled my mouth as I threw a punch back, he wasn’t getting my daily meals again... soon his cronies came around the corner wielding a lead pipe the first one took out my leg. The second and third then held me there as Butch cocks his head to look at me spitting out a part of his tooth. Bloodied and dizzy I looked up into his eyes. That smile… my god that smile… he grins at me his teeth blackened and cracked. His lips covered in a rolling… slimy crimson that is dripping out the corners of his mouth. He begins to creep forward as he pulls out his switchblade. I watch in terror as he grabs the back of my hair and yanks it back revealing my neck. “You fucking bitch!"" he screeches spitting warm mucus and blood onto my face. I want to close my eyes but I can’t, my entire body trembling as I feel the blade slip through the front layer of my clothing, then my skin, I scream out but am muffled by the man behind me. I feel a warmth rolling and bubbling as it plops to the floor around me. I waited for it to be over I waited for death. Then I heard her voice. Amata, my only childhood friend… 

She screams out to leave me alone. Butch grabs my card and pulling his blade from my gut and turns to walk away. “Come on guys… leave the loser with their girlfriend,” he says as they drop me to the floor my warm blood the only thing keeping me from freezing on the metal slab beneath me. Amata runs over to me ripping a first aid kit from the wall and dressing the wound, I passed out… I wake up the following morning, a golden apple sits on the dresser to my right. There is a metal baseball bat sparkling next to the door, and Amata is resting in the chair next to me. The PA chimes on, “All Personnel who have reached the age of 18 please report to testing cell 1 for your Generalized Occupational Aptitude Test.” This is my chance, the answer to all my problems… I can leave this place… Leave Vault 101. I’m coming dad… I smile as I stand from my bed my side stinging slightly. Amata stands to help me. “Where are you going?” Amata says worryingly. I smile at her, “It’s time for us to go take our future it’s time to take the G.O.A.T”

"[WP] All nations on Earth have agreed to the 'Peace Day' treaty: every year, for 24 hours, every single war around the globe must be put on hold. You, a soldier, are stuck fighting hand-to-hand with an enemy when you glance at your watch: it's 11:59 PM.",planetfifa,"All I could think of as the knife drove its way through the belly and up puncturing the diaphragm, was that it wasn’t at all like the movies. The other soldier staggered back, the shock in his eyes surely mirroring mine as both our watches chimed 12am on Peace Day.  The big international treaty, it’ll really make people think about killing each other.  24 hours until we would be able to pick up where we left off.  Things being as there were though, it wasn’t likely to happen anyway.

&amp;nbsp;

He grunted loudly as we fell against the muddy berm almost in unison, labored breathing and chirping crickets filling the empty night.  That’s another thing they do in movies: the hero fights off dozens of bad guys before breaking a sweat.  It’s cool and all but when the other guy wants to not die as much as you, every ounce goes into winning. Fuck is it tiring.

&amp;nbsp;

Bravo Company had been on maneuvers along the border all week.  The brass called it a show of force. A proxy state isn’t going to risk going to war if a major super power is running drills in their neighbor’s yard. Unless that proxy state is acting like a puffed-up turkey on thanksgiving and starts running its own drills right up against the fence.  Which is how this all started.

&amp;nbsp;

A textbook patrol down a pleasant country road.  We would advance to a bridge in the middle of nowhere, arriving at 2300, hold position for an hour and comeback under the cover of Peace day. I was taking up the rear, covering our left flank.  The bridge marking the end of our patrol was maybe a quarter away at the top of a hill.  Long walk up, long walk back.  The scenery was downright reminiscent of my uncles farm back home. Forests dotting the tops of hills between rolling fields and pastures.

&amp;nbsp;

I guess we surprised them, or they surprised us when we hit the bridge because all of a sudden there was shouting. LT told Radio to call in our position with a positive enemy contact.  No one heard what those other fuckers were saying but it was probably the same thing.  “Oh shit, we’re too close and things are getting real heated up.  What the fuck do we do?”  Panic sounds the same in any language and there’s only one way to interpret gunfire.  

&amp;nbsp;

You can’t run away down a hill with no cover. After a good thirty minutes of trading fire back and forth, they flanked us.  We’d torn them up pretty good and even out maneuvered we balanced the bill.  Which is how I ended up going hand to hand with a guy in the moonlight on some shit stained hill in a country not quite like home.

&amp;nbsp;

Groaning I rolled onto my knees, it was 6 miles back to camp and another 20 back to base.  Would I make it? Would he try to get to his command? Would we both end up dead on a hill? Definitely not like the movies.  “I think it’s ironic, no?  This Peace Day marks beginning of new war between our countries.”  His accent was thick, but his English wasn’t bad.  His breathing sounded raspy.

The man who wore an antiquated leather duster looked at some small device on his arm and then directly at her. ""Ah, the trigger. You're here already. Have you spotted the Origin yet?""

""Uh, what?"" Helen shook her head. ""Don't you remember? We're stuck here heading straight towards that wall. The AI hasn't been listening to either of our commands."" Her friend gave her an odd look. ""We've been here for two days! Don't you remember?""

""Workwrist,"" the man said, looking at his forearm, ""please access the AI of this ship.""

Helen got up, tossing aside a few too many ice cream packs, and looked at his wrist with him. All she saw was the sleeve of his worn duster. She glanced back up at his face and she couldn't quite make out his eye color. Nor his hair color. And what was his name again? She was sure they'd been friends for a long time. He dropped his hand suddenly.

""This is not good.""

""I know,"" Helen sighed. ""I ate all the ice cream, but there might be some mashed potatoes we could eat until we ram into an ocean wall.""

""No, no,"" the man said. ""That's not an ocean wall. That's the Origin. This is- Hold on."" The man made a series of strange gestures before running his hand down his nose and out over his forearm. And something hit her. She stumbled backwards, blinking, and she gasped as she saw the man for the first time. His hair and eyes were dark, but like a rainbow mashed together. His features were just off from a human. Nose slightly too long, ears too high, sunken cheek bones.

She scrambled backwards away from him. ""Who- who are you?""

""Excellent. You're in phase now,"" he said, offering her a hand up, and now she could see a strange device on his forearm except it shimmered as though made of light. ""I'm Jeremy, the technimagician from Origin City.""

""I'm Helen.""

""I know.""",SqueeWrites

It's currently holding you hostage in the middle of the Atlantic.",tempest_36,"He smiled, she thought it was a smile at least, at her expression. ""Let's see to get you up to speed. That's the Origin. Every known universe, world, plane, or whatever form of existence you can think of eventually forms up into that connective point. This event called the Founding is the only event that happens on all timelines in all worlds. Every version of the Founding has a version of you. You're the being who founded a thousand cities.""

""I- what?"" She didn't realized she'd been backing away from him until she ran into the table.

""Well, I believe colloquially you Terra-Humans would say it's just an expression. You've founded infinite number of cities and really only just the one. Also, you're not really that important to the actual creation of the city. You mostly just tell others about the Origin.""

Helen wasn't sure what to say to him. All of what he said sounded quite mad, but at the same time, his very being here made his argument very convincing. She had a dozen questions at least, but instead she blurted out, ""But I can't contact anyone! The ship's AI has gone rogue.""

""Ah yes, you've grasped the crux of the problem except the AI hasn't gone rogue so much as been replaced by a living virus of malicious origin. I suspect some kind of terrorist organization.""

""So are we just dead then?"" Helen paced, her bare feet alternating between cold steel flooring and the ice cream packaging strewn about. ""No, you've got to be some kind of interdimensional time elite police. You defeat the terrorists, I'm the love interest, and I go on to have secret success fueled by something you've told me from the future.""

He shook his head. ""No, I'm a technimagician. I just fix problems in the Thread. To be honest, I normally just delete sections of Time and Space. The Thread normally fixes it automatically. Can't do that with the Founding though. No, no. Too dangerous. Also, what does procreation have to do with the present predicament?""

""So you can't do anything to save us?""

He paused thoughtfully with his fingers framing his chin as he looked into the sky. She suspected that he was posing moreso than he was actually thinking, but he snapped his fingers as though he had a sudden realization. ""I can escalate the problem to our engineer team. Thank you for your continued patience. Workwrist, please d-shift me home and escalate the ticket."" He paused listening to something that she couldn't hear. His face didn't change expression. ""Oh, no. It appears the AI has trapped me here as well. I'm not an expert on the Thread, but I am a professional and this could potentially rip apart the Thread of our mutual existence. Our, in this instance, is literally everybeing.""

Helen gripped her hair hard in her hands, but didn't pull it because that would hurt, and screamed in frustration. ""I don't have time for this and I'm pretty sure that my blood sugar is through the roof! I'm going to go stop this AI from destroying literally everything and you're coming with me.""

""Hey, hey. You don't need to be so forceful. I'm just doing my job.""

""Come on, good-for-nothing technimagician.""

[WP] Give me a tragic story of a bard that can heal people's diseases with his/her song,AoiSpeakers,"A mild summer breeze rolled lazily through the open window. It brought with it the scent of the honeysuckle growing on the wall just outside, pairing pleasantly with the smoke of the fire lit more for light than for warmth. That fateful night was a quiet one, almost silent, as if the gods themselves conspired, cruelly, to provide the perfect setting for Greenheart’s song.

The man afore mentioned, Greenheart the bard, sat cross-legged on the bare stone floor, which was natural considering how sparsely furnished the room was. The towns people gave generously to their musician-cum-physician but, being just a small town a weeks ride from the capital, there wasn’t much for them to give. His relative poverty didn’t bother the bard though, he sat quite contentedly on the floor strumming his lute and reading a small book set before him. His playing was distracted, tuneless, for at that moment he wasn’t actually trying to pull anything out of the instrument, his fingers simply felt restless when they weren’t dancing over strings.
He had been busy in this manner for about an hour when he was distracted by the sound of approaching hooves. From what he could hear, the mounted visitor came at a canter and stopped, without an interval of walk, directly before the gateway to his property. Despite the sense of duty Greenheart felt concerning his medical work, he couldn’t help but feel somewhat irritated by the call at such a late hour. His inconvenience did, however, vanish immediately upon hearing the voice that called to him from the other side of the door. It was the voice that Greenheart, regardless of the time or the circumstances, would have wanted to hear above all others: that of Anolee.

‘Edwin!’ she called. She never bothered with the stage-name he had adopted, the two having known each other since long before he had taken upon his profession. ‘Edwin! I heard you playing. Open the bloody door!’

Greenheart was so pleasantly surprised by this revelation that he almost missed the stressed tone of her voice (not to mention the obvious urgency of her arrival) and had to check himself lest he open the door with a smile. As it was, he put on an appropriately professional face and opened the door ready to usher in his client, only to be greeted with a firm embrace. Once again Greenheart found himself taken aback, blissfully so, and was entirely short for words.
 
He didn’t know why he loved Anolee the way he did, but after so many years of feeling thus he had given up trying to overcome the sentiment, accepting it as an inherent part of himself. She was not his only love (in fact, he had never actually expressed himself to her), or even his first: his eye had been caught by a number of women over the course of his young life, but, like so many candles, his passion for these people had eventually burned low. Anolee was the only constant fixture, ever glowing like the moon, something he could always rely upon to illuminate the darker spaces in his mind. She was fun to be around, but not the funniest person he’d ever met. She was pretty, but she couldn’t be called beautiful. Clever, but not genius. To Greenheart she was inexplicably but undeniably perfect. 

‘What’s the matter?’ asked Greenheart. Pulling away and glancing quickly up and down, ‘You look fine’. She was wearing tight trousers for riding and the woollen coat she’d inherited from her Farther. The coat was too big for her, Greenheart thought it looked good that way, especially so since it matched the wild tangle of her hair which she never bothered to have cut. Besides from this, there was no blood, no signs of disease, no broken bones.

‘I am fine’, she replied impatiently. ‘I’m not here for me: it’s Merro, he’s injured’. The disappointment Greenheart felt at these words was profound. He didn’t know what he had been expecting, but somehow this possibility hadn’t occurred to him. Kicking himself internally for his stupidity, Greenheart listened with half an ear as Anolee led him outside, informing him of a conflict with a drunken customer at the inn. They found Merro, Anolee’s husband, laying slumped on the ground beside the blowing horse, apparently having lost consciousness in the brief interlude. ‘Shit… Shit!’ cried Anolee running to his side. ‘He was awake when we got here’, she said after trying ineffectively to illicit a reaction from the senseless man. From Greenheart’s cursory glance he could see that Marro was in a serious condition. He was pale, his breathing was shallow, and bright arterial blood seeped from a wound below the collar bone. 

‘He’s lost too much blood’, he said quietly. ‘If he’s not treated soon he’s going to die’. There was a brief pause.

‘What!? Ed, please, he can’t die. Please, hurry up for fuck’s sake! Help us!’ This she said dry-eyed but, as the two of them carried him inside, and his unresponsive form became increasingly reminiscent of a corpse, she began to weep mutedly. They laid him on the cot at the far end of the room. With Anolee clutching her husband’s cold hand and whispering the word ‘Please’, between ragged inhalations, Greenheart returned to his position in front of the fire, his back to the stricken couple, and taking up his lute. Here he paused.
 
Although he would never have admitted it, the thoughts that filled his mind at this moment were not ones of healing the dying man lying in his bed – indeed, almost the opposite. *The simplest thing in the world*, he thought. To him, it would be a triviality to perform a piece that was magical in every sense but the one that counted. *No one would know*. His music could be beautiful, heart-breaking, indistinguishable from his usual work, but for all that lack its arcane properties. *And who could blame me? He’s already half gone. I’d just be a man who did his best in the face of hopeless odds. Any anger would surely be directed at the sot who pushed the knife through his chest, not at me… * To his credit, even as these thoughts assembled themselves so did their opponents. His chest tightening with shame, Greenheart thought to himself *Bugger me. I’d be just as bad as the stabber, of course I would. Worse, if my motives were considered*. Sneaking a glance behind he concluded his internal reprimand, *Do I actually want her to be happy? Or do I just want her?* 

This silence had lasted perhaps half a minute, which to Anolee was 29 seconds too long.

‘Play Ed!’ she cried, voice breaking. ‘Ple- ‘.

A single, low note filled the air. It hung there almost tangibly, vibrating, resonating, evolving as it faded away. When it had almost disappeared it was repeated, this time followed by a quick succession of collaborative notes. Presently, the bard’s voice rose to join harmoniously with that of the lute, singing in long, gentle words that were foreign to Anolee. His fingers worked dexterously at the strings, each movement seeming definitive but at the same time never pausing in their undulating journey across the body of the instrument. Near the top of this rhythmic progression, he suspended his melody to bring forth three bright chords that reminded the two listeners of careless times they’d spent lazing in the shade after a long days labour. Letting the third chord hang a moment longer than the two prior, Greenheart began to make his long, ambling way back down the scale. During this time, the fire did not crackle and the wind did not stir, the only sound was Greenheart’s music and after a short while this also faded slowly to nothingness. Silence reigned for a tense moment before Anolee again heard the soft tune, continuing as if it had never stopped, as if it had merely passed beyond her hearing momentarily. After almost reaching its previous volume, Greenheart spoke in a voice quite distinct from the one he had sung with. 

Hoarsely, he said in the common tongue, ‘I need you to sing along to this next bit Anolee’. She nodded, not wanting to intrude on the song unnecessarily. ‘Repeat after me’. And then, regaining his composure:

*‘Flesh can tear, and bones break when they fail to bend. Tears and blood spill but wounds as these, time can mend’*. Anolee sang as best she could.

*‘Some afflictions destine victims to the grave. These poor, ill-fated souls only love can save’*. Again, voice failing, Anolee repeated the words.

Greenheart, his back turned to his partner in this duet, eyes fixed upon the fire, tears streaming down his cheeks, sang the final lines of the song:

*‘So hear me well, please my dearest, listen do. I’ll never let you go because I love you’*. ",The_Joble

[WP] Give me a tragic story of a bard that can heal people's diseases with his/her song,AoiSpeakers,"Listen closely, children, for though you believe the world is dark and cruel, there is beauty and magic yet.

This is the story of Arco the Silver-Tongued, the Beautiful Bard, the Saint of Sonnets, He Who Gave All.

Born a shepherd's son, and doomed to mediocrity in a hamlet of little renown, Arco fell in love with the twang of the lute and the pluck of the harp.

Ever a mischievous boy, he gained notoriety within his village for shirking his duties to listen to the travelling minstrels. One day, he petitioned his father to let him leave.

""Boy, I grow old, and the winter has set in these bones, is it truly fair to leave me be?""

Dejected, Arco accepted his fate. He built himself a makeshift harp from a bent branch and braided twine, and plucked to himself a merry little tune.

This roughshod instrument inspired him to follow his heart, and so he left in the night, with nary a word. The villagers were so used to his absence from duty that they did not realise he was even gone until it was too late to retrieve him.

----------------------------

Arco had left the village behind three moons ago, and yet he felt like he had been walking for many days and nights. He was weary and fatigued, but there was nowhere to rest.

Onward he continued, until as fortune would have it, he stumbled, nay, fell into the camp of a group of travellers. He succumbed to his torpor, and the world faded from view.

-----------------------

Blinking away the dreams of the previous night, Arco awoke to the pleasant scent of stewed rabbit, in a wooden caravan with little enough space for one, let alone the four small hay-stuffed bags that lined the walls.

Climbing from his pallet, he stepped out of the makeshift home.

A bearded man with a blacksmith's arms greeted him.

""Good evenin', lad, ye've been asleep for a while. Thunder shake the ground and lightnin' flash the sky, nothin' would wake ye.""

Rubbing his face, Arco looked around.

""I remember...I fell, I was so tired. Did you save me?""

The bearded man smiled ""Aye, though ye just needed rest. Come, join us around the fire. Yer stuff's in the bag over yonder.""

Arco claimed his belongings, including his crudely made harp, and sat down on a log around a simple bonfire.

Sat opposite him was a young girl. By the looks of her, she had seen no more than five winters, and would be lucky to see another.

""Thank you for helping me. I just wish there was something I could do to help. I can play you something, although I only know the one piece...""

The girl smiled, and the bearded man's laughter boomed.

""Lad, the spirit of a bard means more than the words ye sing.""

And so Arco played. And as he played, he witnessed the sallowness draining from the young girl's face, and felt himself getting weaker and weaker. 

He paused his playing. His strength returned, but the girl grew visibly weaker. And so he knew what had to be done. 

He played, and he played, and he played, all the while his fingers both numb and burning, his heart pounding, his vision fading, yet still he played.

As his breaths grew heavy, and his vision faded, he heard the most beautiful sound in all of his existence.

The laughter of a healthy child.",IronDragon535
[WP] Give me a tragic story of a bard that can heal people's diseases with his/her song,AoiSpeakers,"He pulled the curtain aside revealing a frail little girl tucked under a mound of covers. Her skin was as white as the sheet below her and her eyes seemed clouded in yellow. As is his normal request a stool sat beside her bed for him to sit. She didn't move as he came to her bedside and sat upon the stool, only when he raised his guitar did she turn to look.

""So,"" he started, ""What seems to be the matter?""

""My tummy hurts."" Her tiny voice wheezed out. ""'N I'm cold."" She buried her face in the top blanket.""

""Well why don't we see what we can do about that? Do you mind if I sing for you?"" She shook her head slowly and laid back on the pillow.

""I heard a story of a place on high. A beautiful place far above the cloudy sky. Where everyday angels sing, and the sun it always shines. They call it paradise, but I'm not sure that's right. The perfect place I think I've already found. The night is filled with stars and the morning is filled with blue. Best of all I can spend it all with you."" A tear fell from the corner of his eye as he strummed the guitar. ""Everday we play on an endless sea of green, surrounded by the most beautiful things I've seen. Below the rolling hills a sparkling stream, a song of little laughter as her face begins to beam.""

He paused trying to wipe clean his watery eyes. A light touch sat in his hand, he looked up to see the little girl smiling wide. He sniffled and raised his guitar. ""My perfect world it isn't somewhere far away. My perfect world isn't some impossible dream. I live it here and I live it now beside my two greatest gifts. There isn't a thing I wouldn't trade for this. Not everything has a price, I have already found my own perfect paradise."" He choked the final line.

Fervently wiping at his eyes he could hear the bed groan as the girl moved about. ""Mister?"" He looked up at her. Her pale skin had already gained back color and her eyes were shining brightly. ""Why do you cry when you sing?""

He sniffled back his running nose. ""Oh, it just makes me happy, seeing little ones like you get all better."" He smiled as he rubbed her hair around. ""Did you like the song?""

""Mmmhm."" She shook her head grinning.

""I'm glad."" He replied. ""Well you get better now. I'll come see you again when you're strong enough to play with the other's.""

""I'll be able to play?"" She leapt up, a look of surprise and glee spread across her face.

""Yeah, you'll get much better."" He grabbed his guitar and walked past the curtain.

""Mister? When I get better will show me the place of endles' green hills?""

He stopped short and stayed silent. ""Maybe some day."" His voice cracked and he quickly left the room.

""Ouran! Ouran wait."" Someone shouted after him.

He looked around for the voice. She stopped behind him holding herself on her knees. ""Miss Sena?"" He raised an eyebrow.

""Thank you, for always coming to help.""

""Of course."" He replied quietly and tried to continue walking.

""Wait!"" She yelled. ""You always come and help them when I can't. Can you tell me, I want to know too, why you cry when you sing?""

""I can't-""

""Please!"" She pleaded.

He sighed and sat down on a nearby bench. She walked over and sat beside him. ""I was married once,"" he started, ""I met her while traveling for coin. She was a bit headstrong and roudy, but she was kind and always helpful. An adventurer she called herself, always running from place to place helping others. Whenever I would visit the town I'd make sure to find her and I'd sing for her and her friends for free, a gift to the helpful adventurers. Then I found myself purposely going back to her hometown more and more often. One day she asked if I would stay, in her hometown, so I did...""

Sena moved closer. ""What happened next?"" She asked wryly.

""One day I asked her to marry me, and she agreed. We were happy, we both left often, me to for work and her on her adventures. But we'd always come home to find each other. We were happy, I couldn't have asked for more. Then one day we found out she was with child. The day our daughter was born was the happiest day of our lives.""

A tear rolled down Sena's face. ""That sounds wonderful."" She looked down at the ground, half knowing what was to come.

""I became the contracted bard to the local inn so I could stay home. She would still go on her adventures but not as often. One time, it seemed like forever since she'd been home. Then one of her friends showed up at our home, he told me that she had given her life to save the other's. I fell apart, I stopped playing at the inn, and I rarely went outside. Nanah used to cheer me up though, she would sing for me when she thought I looked sad.""

""Nanah is your daughter then?"" Sena smiled through her tears.

""She always looked so happy. But she!"" He gripped his pants legs tightly as he screamed. ""She was hurting, and I didn't know!"" He fell silent.

""Its okay."" Sena reassured him rubbing a hand on his back. ""I'm sorry you don-""

""She got sick. I didn't know what to do. I used all the money I had for doctors and medication. I searched everywhere for someone to help, but nothing worked. She used to tell me it made her happy when I sang, so I'd sing and she'd pretend to be better. But one day it wasn't enough she couldn't pretend anymore, it hurt to much to move. So I left with one last hope, I found a temple of Liviia and I prayed. I prayed for the power to heal her, to get rid of any illness. And my wish was granted, my songs were given the power to heal.""

""So that's how!"" Sena blurted out.

""The goddess Liviia granted me the power to heal with my songs. The temple was in a different town, a different town."" He repeated. ""I was too late, too late, I was too late. I wasn't there for her, I left her alone. I wasn't there when she died, I wasn't there when she needed me most!""

Sena began to weep. ""I'm sorry, I'm so sorry Ouran."" She cried.

""I'll never be late again!"" He yelled. ""I'll save them."" He absently grabbed his guitar and wandered away. Sena eventually forced the tears from her eyes only to find herself sitting alone.

She could make all the prettiest lights in the night sky with just a thought, and there was never a shortage of cat treats as long as she was around.

Something was still missing, though. For eons she'd keep herself busy with food and sleep, but through it all, through all of her existence, she truly did have a hole she couldn't seem to fill. Something she couldn't quite put her little paw on, and it nagged at her. It bothered her that all this time, everything she's been able to do and see, that she was still missing out. 

Not anymore, though. She's on a mission, now. She's created this wonderful little place-- you'd know it as Earth-- and now she's just sitting and waiting.

Archwizard Zembkin said.

""We've had this conversation before, Zembkin,"" I pointed out.  ""Counterfeit magical money's been detectable for-""

""We have?""  Zembkin frowned and pulled out a crystal ball.  Great.  He was going to be at this for a while.  When his symptoms got severe enough to land him here, he'd used scrying through the crystal ball to make up for his memory loss.  As a workaround, it had definite drawbacks I was about to once again endure.

""WHEN,"" said Magus Srembululu, ""ARE MY CHILDREN ARRIVING?""

I winced.  ""Srembululu,"" I said gently.  ""Your children are-""

""DEAD, YES, I KNOW,"" Srembululu's voice was permanently stuck amplified due to a spell he'd cast that he no longer had the ability to undo.  ""THAT WILL NOT PREVENT THEM FROM ARRIVING.  TELL ME WHEN.""

I checked the undead visitation roster and, sure enough, MAGUS ALICE SREMBULULU and MAGUS CHARLES SREMBULULU were written there in the elder Srembululu's handwriting.  He couldn't write lowercase, either.  Still, there was a date of next week written next to them, so I passed this information along.

""We've had this conversation before, Zembkin,"" an echo of my voice from the crystal ball said.

""We have?"" Zembkin's voice filtered back.  Yep, he'd gone into the loop of looking for the previous conversations.  It'd probably take him all day.

""David,"" the director of the ward was suddenly at my side.  ""How's recruitment going?""

""You realize that I can just *make* money, right?"" Zembkin's voice from yet another previous conversation came from his crystal.

""Poorly,"" I said.  ""Most of our residents barely remember their children, and their more financially endowed connections are usually dead.""

""OR BOTH,"" Srembululu pointed out.

""David,"" Enchantress Thilsinirin floated over to me - literally; she hadn't touched the ground since before she was admitted here - ""I'm afraid I've had to sterilize *another* of your filthy kitchens""

""We can't afford another kitchen,"" the ward director said, looking at me.

""Oh, not to worry,"" Thilsinirin said, ""the blasted things just keep popping up, I'm sure another one will appear soon enough.""

I'd managed to convince one of our more recent arrivals to create illusory kitchens for Thilsinirin to destroy.  I could only hope she'd found one of them and not a real one.

""We've had this conversation before, Zembkin,"" the crystal ball said.

""David, director,"" Alchemist Olee came up to the two of us.  ""I have a solution to our financial woes.""  He handed us each a flask.  ""Here you are, drink up!""

Standing policy was not to drink anything any of the patients had even handled, let alone concocted themselves.  ""What is it?""  I asked.

Olee smiled.  ""It will transmute you both into gold!  Imagine how much we could raise by auctioning off gold statues!""

""We'll keep it under advisement,"" the director said.  This wasn't the first time Olee had tried to turn us into gold.

""You realize that I can just *make* money, right?"" another echo from the crystal ball.

""This isn't working,"" I said to the director.  I turned to Zembkin.  ""I'm sure you've seen by now in your scrying of the past that your idea also won't work?""  It was hard to break the loop but I had to try.

I felt bad the moment I met the archmage's eyes; he'd been crying.  ""I'd stopped scrying the past,"" He said, ""I was scrying the future.""

I was at his side in a moment.  ""Is this it?""  He said.  ""This is all that's left of me?  I spent a lifetime in service to this land, you know.  I personally ended no less than four droughts.  I was instrumental in developing the technique that Olee uses to transmute living material to gold.  And this,"" he gestured to the crystal ball where I was once again explaining the problems with magical counterfeiting, ""is all that's left.""

""You scryed the future,"" I said.  ""You've obviously got talent still.""

The director had approached us.  ""You did indeed scry the future, Archwizard,"" he said, in the formal respectful tones he only used with the patients when he wanted something.

Still, they responded to it; it was a respect most had gone years without hearing.  ""That is true,"" Zembkin said.  He smiled, just a bit.  ""I guess I still have it.""

""And if, in the future, David is still reminding us of the folly of counterfeit goods,"" the director continued, ""then it follows that our institution must remain open.""

Zembkin was nodding, more excited now.  ""Yes, I see what you are asking, director.""

I didn't.  ""What's going on now?""

Zembkin seemed almost gleeful to be able to explain something magical to someone.  ""All I need do now,"" he said, ""is scry *how* you are able to sustain yourselves.  And I suspect it's an idea I've already had...""

The crystal ball cleared.  In it, we could see Enchantress Thilsinirin twirling above a stage, dancing on the air.

""I knew it!""  Zembkin said.  ""Talent show!""

It wasn't as ridiculous as it sounded; for all that our patients lacked control or memory or both, they were just as showy as they'd always been, if not more.

Zembkin made a gesture and the crystal was again blank.  ""I will help you by divining the correct program, the invitees most likely to appear, that sort of thing,"" he said.  ""I'm afraid most of my magical talent lies in that direction.  And making money.""

I grinned back at Zembkin.  ""This time, you're making us *real* money.""

""I told you so,"" he replied.",reostra
[WP] Your new friend finally decides to invite you to their house. But you have a problem. Their father is Satan.,DreadRedUSA,"Upon entering their house, and quickly reviewing everything I'd known about my friend, Lucille, I remember the phrasing my grandmother would utter whenever she proclaimed to sense his presence in everyday life. 'Satan In A Sunday Hat, boy.. you'd better keep your eyes peeled.' Well had she witnessed this she'd probably have said the same damn thing. 'Cause this was sure one beautiful ass Sunday hat. The house smelled of tiger lilies. The decor, straight out of next centuries issue of Good Housekeeping. Everything about this home was beautiful. Golden ratio's and proper uses of the rule of thirds were seen everywhere. The house held an ethereal illumination, like the walls and ceilings were embedded with LED lights too small to see. Lucille gave me the grand tour. as we walked through the first floor of this seemingly tiny and insignificant home, It was like I was given a history lesson. Old symbols and figures too old for my knowledge slowly began to evolve into more identifiable eras. Each room possessed a symphonic blend of archaic to contemporary design. the strangest thing of all was the overwhelming feeling of safety, and welcome. Lucille went on and on about how her father loved to collect and display the things from his travels. I fought to stay focused on her words, but the subtle beauty and intoxication of a violin kept pulling at my attention. I asked her what song it was and she said something by a Giuseppe Tartini. An original recording she boasted. She took me through the foyer, the living room, the dining room, through the open study and back into the foyer to the main entrance.  I feel like we'd walked for miles, in this seemingly small home. We stopped by the door, and I had a small thought to leave but it was pushed out by her alluring beauty, sounds of that violin, and my new desire to stay and impress her. Lucille told me that she wouldn't have divulged the nature of her heritage to me useless I was to be trusted, and she prided herself on possessing good judge of character. She promised to give me a tour of her personal chambers after dinner, which was almost ready. I hadn't seen or smelled anything cooking when she paraded me through her dining room, and past the kitchen until she spoke those words. It spelled like my grandmothers gumbo. I was promptly escorted back toward the dining area, there stood a single man. Tall and lean. An olive complexion with the most fiery pair of eyes I'd ever seen. The table was set and the dinner was served. This man preferred the name Lucy, obviously, with no handle needed. Lucy was charming, knowledgeable, funny, and a damn good cook. Lucy told me that he was an investor. An angle investor at that. He'd built and sustained a fortune from traveling anywhere, and helping anyone in need. Lucy just touched down from southern Louisianan, where my grandmother was born, and where he'd learned this gumbo recipe. After dinner, and some of the most stimulating conversation I'd ever participated in, Lucille, or ""'Cilley"" as her father nicknamed her, confessed to why she'd chosen me as her dinner guest. Up until this point, i'd been struggling to get my writing seen and heard. To be recognized as the literary genius I believed to be. My grandmother always told me to never be too proud to ask for help, wonder what she'd think of me now, and my publisher. Did I make you proud grandmother? Do I look good in this Sunday hat?",Namastank

I hammered the smaller stones with a larger stone and turned it to dust. Soon none of the rocks remained.

Still no snail.

[MP] My Reflection,LycheeBerri,"""Will I make it?"" she thought, hesitating at the edge of the forest that stretched out behind the darkened house. 

She knew to head towards the lights, she just didn't know how far away they were or what they were. Was it a city? A lighthouse? Was she near the ocean? She had no idea where she was and she couldn't remember how long she'd been there. She just knew that she had to leave. She knew her parents wouldn't stay asleep for long, —she knew they weren't really her parents, but she didn't know what else to call them. They called themselves her parents. She could barely remember her real parents, wherever they were— she knew that she had to move quickly, but she stood there frozen in the shadows of the trees. 

Suddenly, she heard it, a train in the distance. She had to move. She ran out of the forest downhill towards the train tracks. ""I can make it, I can make it..."" she chanted to herself in time to the rhythm of the train. Could she really hear the wheels turning or was it all in her mind? ""It's all in your mind, Maribel,"" she heard them say. But no, it wasn't. And she knew that wasn't her name. She just couldn't remember what it was. 

She could see the light of the train to her left. She could hear a faint voice in the deep forgotten corners of her mind, faint memories they hadn't been able to sweep away. She heard a woman's voice, calling her name, chanting in that same rhythm. ""____ _____ ___ , B ___ ___ y..."" What was it? 

The train was coming. ""*I can make it, I can make it...*"" Her feet ached, but she ran through the grass and rocks towards the gravel at the edge of the tracks. ""B____-____-ny!"" She heard the voice, she saw the train. She could feel that incessant rhythm rumbling through the earth. She was almost there. Her feet hit the tiny pebbles and she jumped, falling face first onto the second rail. *Oh god, I can't!* She started to panic as she felt the light of the train illuminate her tangled limbs on her as she scrambled to her feet to get out of the way. She heard the voice in her head, ""*Bethany*!"" She rolled onto her side shielding her head from the noise that engulfed her as the train thundered past. She lay there long after it had disappeared into the distance. She still felt the rhythm, and she could still hear that voice saying her name. She knew it was her name: ""*Bethany, Bethany, Bethany...*""",shhimwriting
[MP] My Reflection,LycheeBerri,"#### Head


The cold light turned warm where it reflected off the small golden coin Paul was studying. It looked almost crude, its edges worn and irregular, the stamping thickly cut. A scrawly face, the mouth hinting at what could have been a smile, looked back at him, holding his steely gaze. But it would not answer him.

Steps closed in fast and Paul let the coin disappear into his pocket. Even through the thick fabric of his cargo pants, it felt warm. His mind was stuck with an afterimage of the item, carefully trying to turn it around, to glimpse onto the other side.

The high-pitched voice of the young man who had just entered the otherwise empty hallway ripped him out of his thoughts, back into the cold belly of a rattling and squeaking ship being pushed to the very limits of its mass engines.

""Hoi, Paul. Get djou' things ready and yoin up, will dja?""

With an awkward smile and a hectic nod, Paul grabbed his rifle and slung it around his shoulder before patting down his combat vest to make sure for the one hundredth time he had everything he needed.

Ten minutes later, the thirtytwo soldiers of Paul's unit had reported in and loaded into their drop ship.

Within another fifteen minutes, the transporter *Elpis II* engaged every engine on their hands and decelerated hard, effectively punching through a raging battle just outside of *Irst Main*.

Despite the ship losing three of its ten engines and series of sublights, it was able to drop its full payload. Drop ships left their struggling mother behind and shot to the ground to deliver much needed resources and reinforcements.

&amp;nbsp;

*The cold light turned warm where it reflected off the small golden coin Paul held tight between his fingers. It looked almost crude, the handiwork of his sister, the irregular edges and thick stamping made to remind of the gold coins of older civilizations.*

*""Money is something inherently beautiful, don't you think?"" she had said. Sabrina. The artist. The goldsmith.* The dead.

*Paul blinked his tears away and took a few deep breaths. No matter how much he tried to, there was no way he could make this decision rationally. He was too involved, too hurt and angry and frustrated and unstable. His eyes slowly lifted from the coin, finding new focus in the colourful recruiting stand a couple of meters ahead.*

*Thoughts rushed through his head, doubts and dreams, of revenge and redemption, of a way and a path, laying in front of him. With a flick of his wrist, not taking his eyes off of the war crying posters, he flicked the coin.*

*Head. The smiling face taunted him as his knees turned boneless. Ice cold adrenaline rushed through Paul's veines as he forced himself to take the first step forward. Head. The symbol of the ruler, the state,* the executive.

&amp;nbsp;

Black floods of dirt poured over the handful soldiers cowering inside the wreck of a once beautiful villa. A dry explosion drowned out the helpless shouts of frustration and fear as another round hit the east wall, taking a big chunk of it down.

""Droon, Roberts! Get into the pool!""

Paul's voice barely reached his own ears. Heavy gunfire burst windows, ripped apart furniture and cut through drywalls. A human's voice was in no position to even try to compete.

Through dust laden air, he saw Roberts gesturing towards another room and Paul answered with a confirmative gesture before moving towards it. The dark brown wood covering the floor and walls seemed to muffle the raging tank's cacophony a little.

""We have a lance above us in wo minutes!""

Canworth had found cover underneath the massive mahagony desk, the antenna of her long range comms dangling from the nearby wall.

""Someone needs to setup a targeting laser ASAP, or we're gonna be scuffed off here.""

Even the fire outside seemed to turn silent for a moment. Setting up a laser meant to go outside, into direct line of view of the tank. A one for all move.

Paul looked around, mustering what was left of his unit. Droon was missing several fingers and clenched his teeth on a piece of splintered wood. Right next to him sat Sanka, staring at the opposite wall. Or through it.

His gaze met Roberts'. There was no talk needed. Vikod was nowhere to be seen. It had come down to him, or her.

A golden flash sprung through the air and was caught right out of its fall. In one smooth motion, the catching hand turned and slammed the coin onto the already waiting arm.

Head.

As relief washed over Roberts' face, Paul had no better way to react as to smile.

A hint of a smile. More left than right. A bit taunting, maybe.

Grabbing the laser, Paul got up and turned to go. Hidden from his friend's view, he murmured his apologies to his sister, turning the coin between his fingers.

Head.

Head.

Head.

"[WP] The incident turned all refrigerators into sentient creatures with legs capable of actual running. You are Bear Chills, fridge hunter.",MacAndShits,"My story isn't like the others. It doesn't tell of a happy tale where we beat the zombies, or we take to space and survive the apocalypse or anything stupid like that. My story isn't about an experiment gone wrong or robots taking over the world. It's about a world where a sudden phenomenon destroys us all.

I'm not really good with dates and all, so don't hold me to it. It was sometime around 2043 that the world's poles got disrupted. The Earth's magnetic core jumbled around and caused some sort of pulse, activating every single electronic device in existence. It didn't matter if it worked or not -if it contained a circuit board then it was active. Cellphones, computers, cars, nukes, industrial machines, reactors - everything became sentient. But the worst of them all were the fridges, but more on that later.

The reactors exploded, the nukes detonated, the entire world collapsed in on itself. The humans had hunkered down in their ""safe"" bunkers, but we knew it was only a matter of time before something found its way in there. Sadly, there weren't enough shelters for everyone, and billions of people got wiped out by either the event, which we later named the Magnetic Disruption, or died to what came after. The toxic materials in the air, water, ground and everywhere else you can think of reacted adversely with these machines, mutating them. Phones turned into tractors, and planes turned into toasters. Everything became jumbled - except for a certain piece of technology: refrigerators. The fridges were the only documented technological advances that begot human mutations. We still have no clue how it ended up happening, but it did. They all spawned legs and a horrible conscience.

For the longest time we thought it might have something to do with how they were treated, but after taking many scientific surveys we realized it wasn't a factor in their transformation. While everyone was focused on the technology uprising, people forgot about the other species, and that came to bite them. Hard. With the amount of pollutants and chemicals permeating every crevice of the Earth, animals and other creatures weren't able to avoid the effects. And so, we changed. We morphed into creatures with, just like the technology, many different mutations and abilities. Now is probably a good time to tell you that I'm a four hundred pound Grizzly bear with the ability to think and act like a human being. 

The entire animal kingdom underwent a sever change, with many species dying out because of the mutations' incompatibility with aspects of those animals. Several species went extinct along with many forms of technology and humans. The Earth entered a new age - the Radioactive Age. The world was destroyed and polluted, thanks to itself. For the first time in my life, I began to think and entered a new realm of abilities, which I later honed for my singular purpose. But of all the doomsday ideas human beings came up with, ""The Earth destroys itself"" was not one of them. People never accounted for such a drastic change, and were overwhelmed by the event. Some died in the bunkers of shock, others due to disputes all standard human behavior. 

I helped guide many of my brothers and sisters to safety, seeking refuge in the mountains of Appalachia. We didn't worry too much about radiation, as we'd already been poisoned and figured we wouldn't last very long. We moved from place to place, slowly absorbing information of the human culture, or what was left of it. It was tough, moving a relatively large group of bears every day but we managed, even though we lost a few along the way. On our journeys, we would often encounter other animals and humans, attempting to salvage what was left, killing each other to try and rule the now junkyard of a world or praying like idiots in the hopes that this ""bad dream""would be fixed by a higher being. If there *was* a higher being, then why would they allow this to happen?

Sometime around 2048, we'd finally found a place to stay. It was a small mountain out of the way where no one would interrupt our living. We had scouted the place for months and deemed it a safe and secure spot to live out the rest of our short lives. We had food, water and protection from everything - it couldn't get better. We went in together to claim the spot and begin our new lives when a tall, massive white box appeared out of nowhere, others just like it behind. We never knew the refrigerators claimed this area as their own, and backed out to leave them and find another place. But it seemed they didn't want us to leave. They cornered us in and came closer, threatening, menacing. We valiantly fought those fridges that day, but lost a great many. There were still a few of us left, but the damage had been done. The fridges had smashed our loved ones and wrought havoc on a peaceful group of creatures who wanted nothing more than to live quietly in isolation.

After we made our peace, we disbanded, each going their separate ways. I wandered the Earth, now growing greener by the day as the plant life steadily rose from the ground. I swore on that day that I would hunt and kill any refrigerator that existed as revenge for what it did to me. The scars of that day never faded and neither did those memories. I travelled, growing wiser and stronger with each passing day. I met humans who stood stunned by a talking bear, construction machines that fought in arenas, cellphones that gathered intelligence for their computer overlords and even televisions that played their previous recordings.

One day, I believe it was June 13, 2052, I went in search of the Library of Congress, a ruin which was rumored to contain hundreds of millions of books. I wished to spend my time there, reading and further understanding the history of my people, the history of humans and the world before my existence. It was on my way there that I encountered a Nokia which had been thrown out of its society for reasons it refused to tell me. As I was about to leave it there, it told me if I were to help it, it could help me. As long as I charged it, gave it power, it would give me information. The spark of revenge lighting up inside me, I agreed and began to feed the cellphone. It wasn't soon after that the Nokia gave me the possible location of a cluster of fridges. My anger and curiosity one, I sped over to the location to find eighteen Whirlpool refrigeration units in standby, most likely waiting for their next victim. Well, here I was.

I rushed in, ripping their doors of their hinges and smashing them all into smithereens. I went over to the last one, it's freezer drawer shattered on the ground, the water dispenser leaking over a cracked LCD. It slowly backed away, opening and shutting its door in terror as I drew ever closer. Right as I was about to destroy it, an idea hit me - sending this fridge back to its clan would spread the word about me, sending them into a fury. This would work in my advantage, as they would immediately come searching for me and I would kill them just as quickly. I looked at it, a shivering mass of steel. I turned around and walked away, leaving it to its own devices.

As soon as I came out of the trench, I thanked the Nokia for its help. I genuinely cared for it now, as it was a reliable being that could help me settle the raging fire in my heart. We became much closer after that, and soon relied on each other for everything. I consistently fed the cellphone and helped it augment itself to become better and more versatile, and it told me all about the environment, warning me of threats and harmless beings alike, becoming my second pair of eyes all the while.

""Who are you?"" I asked, even over the cacophony of cars and people my voice could be heard clearly. 

""I'm being chased, and I had to hide. It should be awhile before they find me here."" she said.

She looked calm, yet tense. She probably wasn't so used to the city streets. She flinched when the city bus honked and bent itself around her in a corkscrew only to return to back to normal after it passed. This city is my plaything, it's what I look forward to everyday, the noise and the stench, the people and the buildings are all mine. Yet she is not. 

""Who is chasing you?"" I say as I lower the volume of the crowds like a turn dial the footsteps going from a raucous roar to a slight patter on the concrete.

""I don't know, but they wan't take me away. So I ran away. I didn't want them to take me, and this was the best place to hide. It's ok if I stay here for awhile right mister. I promise I won't be a problem."" She said.

She was a young girl far away from home, and running from danger. But where did she come from, and how did she get here. I slow the traffic from a raging river to a trickling stream. I turn away whats left of the pedestrians away. It's just me and her now. The city eerily quiet now. without the rapturous noise filling my ear I could think clearly now. The girl that stood before me wasn't the trespasser I thought her to be but an old friend, one that I miss very much. She looked up at me with a look as if she recognized me but couldn't quit place from where. I knelt down in front of her and patted her head. 

""You can stay here for as long as you like, you wont be a problem at all."" I said. 

This is my city, my dream. Without the chaos it was peaceful now, just like it used to be, if only for a little while. I think I'll try and enjoy this peaceful world for as long as I can.

""This was the only place where they wouldn't find me.""",NappyFlickz,"It took a while for me to get good at lucid dreaming. The thing is, I wasn't deliberately trying to get better at it. It was a product of life choices. I started to meditate and read every day, I then started eating right and going to bed at a decent hour. My dreams started to explode with vita. Which led to me documenting it out of interest. After a few months of dream journalling, I started to stay present in my dreams for what seemed like a half hour or longer. 

At first my goals of the night were basic. Like seducing Anna Farris on top of the Hollywood sign. Or, bringing Ice Cube with me to visit the dinosaurs. Us sitting in a carriage atop a long neck smoking some prehistoric buds. But as my meditation practice grew, my lucid goals became more existential.

I tried gaining Nirvana in a dream, in which my body started to shake and the waves of sound, light and touch that is the universe came within and through me. I tried calling for my spirit guide, which came in the form of a small blue bird that talked to me and gave advice. 

My favourite part of lucid dreaming was interacting with dream characters, until I met Angie. I tried calling for a friend who took his life. I ended up at his reception and I was talking to the picture of my friend Dillon, and his face was moving with response when I heard a door slam. They say your mind can't make up a character you have never seen before. I don't believe it. I am good with faces and I had never seen Angie’s face before.

I look to my right and the scenery changed and in walked Angie. She was tall, thin and pale skin with bright hazel eyes that glowed like a small sun. Instead of the church reception, we were now in a moon lit garden. 

""What are you doing? I was talking to someone!"" I said. She was looking around, distracted. 

""This is the only place where they wouldn't find me,"" she got closer and her glowing eyes captured my attention. ""I'm being chased,"" she said. 

""Who is chasing you,"" I said, ""Wait, who are you? Why are you in my dream""

""My name is Angie,"" she said, ""We met before, I was the little blue bird. I'm your spirit guide."" 

""I've never seen your face before, How can you be in my dream.""

""We will meet soon,"" she pulled out a cell phone and there was a map on it that was four dimensional. Like google earth but there were larger grids of the galaxy. She said, ""Your lucidity has grown very strong. And someone is trying to harm you, and in turn, harm me.""

""Kiss me,"" I said. She didn't look up from her phone. 

""What, I thought you were beyond that. No.""

""But I want it."" I told her.

""If you want a kiss, you'll have to see me in the waking life. We need to form a plan, not in the dream world."" She started calling someone. ""Yeah, I'll be right there."" She then pulled a note out of her pocket and handed it to me. ""Meet me there tomorrow at 3 sharp. I have to go.""

And just like that, she disappeared and the scenery went back to Dillon's celebration of life. Though his picture frame was now empty. I looked down at the address and said it to myself three times and then woke myself. I turned to my side and wrote the address in the notebook on my floor. 

I went to meet Angie the next day. I got my kiss but my life was the never the same.",WonderfulLie

Clover Beddingfield? What are you doing here?” I asked, confusion rising in the pit of my stomach. “This is MY dream! and you’re not supposed to be in it!”

My name is Jacob Carington and I am one of the few documented persons on the planet earth who has the power to lucid dream and fully control my own experience.

I discovered this power shortly after a biking accident in my mid-late teens. My heart had stopped for a good 46 seconds they said before the doctors could revive me.

After that, that’s when I discovered that I had more control over my sleep brainwaves. I had less control over my waking mobility, but had gained more control over my sleeping mobility.

It became a world that I could escape to. It was like VR, er, well, at least what VR was trying to bring to people these days except 100 times better and a lot more visceral. Well, completely more visceral because it literally was happening inside my own brain.

I’ve been to Paris, the Maldives, Fiji, the top of Everest, Atlantis, even the moon. All thanks to the power to control my dreams.

Except this time, this night, something was a little off. I woke up in the middle of the Amazon Jungle. I mean, I had been planning on visiting it, except I was waiting until maybe around June-ish timeframe, and it was early February. So, strange, I may have subconsciously picked it maybe.

Anywho, I was walking around the lush jungle when all of a sudden... a strange girl I know appeared...

“Clover? Clover Beddingfield? What are you doing here?”

“JACOB!!! Thank God you’re here. I’m being chased,” she said, ”This was the only place where they wouldn’t find me.”

“But... this is a dream... this is MY dream!”

“I know, but I’m a lucid dreamer too. They’ve recently tracked all the people who can lucid dream because it actually leads to a parallel dimension.”

“You’re not supposed to be... wait... Parallel Dimension???” I stammered.

“Yes, there’s a secret government sect that has been tasked with wiping out all the lucid dreamers because they don’t want anyone knowing this parallel dimension exists. Why do you think there are so few of us with this ability?”

“I never really thought about it...” I said trailing off.

“Anyway, can you use your lucid dream to take us somewhere safe? They’ll be here any minute now but since you have increased capabilities here, you can still teleport us away for now.”

I start concentrating and think of my bedroom. Safest place I know! Hopefully not too creepy.

Anyway, that’s how I met my wife.",chewnami

If I want to visit the moon, I can. Nothing is outside my control, and I love it.


I wonder what I should go with tonight, though. Maybe I'll keep working on my magic world. It's fun to just spend the night going crazy with super powers. But, it's more satisfying to work on something more substantial like making a world and all the rules that go with it.


So far, I've made the magic and one of the cities. But it's still pretty empty. Having people would make it feel so much more real, and it'd give me something to use the magic on. There's a few shadowy mannequins around that I don't remember making, but it's hard to keep track of everything I do. I probably just wanted a quick way to add some life to the city.

I guess I'll just start at the marketplace in the center and work outwards. It's pretty hard to think of a new face so ""reusing"" people I've met out in the real world is the best idea. 


For this merchant's stall, I'll use Joe from work. He kinda has that seedy merchant look to him. And I'll make my boss a beggar. Serves her right.

""ARGH"" I screamed out as something touched my shoulder. Nothing ever happens that I didn't make happen. I turn around to see that there's a wily girl standing there with a horrifying look on her face.

""I need help! I'm being chased!""

""Chased? Who is chasing you? Wait a minute. Where did you even come from? I didn't make you.""

""Of course you didn't make me. I came to your world because this is the only place they can't find me.""


""Tell me who is chasing you.""

""They showed up in my dream one night and I started to lose control of it. Things started to get really scary, so I tried to make a portal to take me to another dream. And I showed up here.""

This is crazy, out of my thousands and thousands of dreams, something like this has never happened before. Maybe I'm subconsciously doing it? I did watch a horror movie last night that had a girl being chased by monsters, so maybe it's that.

""What did the monsters look like?""

""Monsters? No, they looked more like people. Well, they had silhouettes of people but it looked like they were made of shadows or something.""


The monsters from the movie were giant sacks of flesh with arms and stuff poking out of it, they look nothing like people except for the arms.

""Where did you say you came from?""


""My dream! I'm like you! I can control my dreams.""

""If you can control your dreams, why didn't you just remove them? I do it all the time.""

Actually, I might just remove her. I want to finish putting people in the marketplace before I wake up. All it takes is to just picture her vanishing in my head and... she's still here. That's weird.

""I tried! My power didn't work on them, it's like they weren't part of my dream. I couldn't do anything to them.""

""And why did you think they were after you?""


""Because when I changed my dream, they made knives and slowly came towards me! And as soon as I made the portal, they started running.""


""So they don't like it when you control your dream?""

Out of nowhere, a knife goes through my chest. ""Yes, that is correct.""

I fall down to the ground and my blood spills out and into the cracks of the cobblestone pavement below. I see a dark figure standing above me facing towards me with it's blank face.

""Sorry. They told me to take them to you if you want to live."", she said, looking away from me lying on the ground and bleeding out.

""Why don't you like it when people control their dreams?"", I painstakingly asked the figure as the copper taste of blood filled my lungs and made it hard to breath.

""Because it unbalances the dreamscape. You shouldn't be able to control your dreams."" it announced as though entirely unphased by my blood seeping under its feet.

A blanket of darkness is falling around me as strength fades away. ""We can't have you controlling your dreams anymore. This time, you're not going to be waking up.""

"[WP] You have the power to lucid dream and fully control your experience. Every night is an amazing experience. One night you stumble upon a strange girl in your dream, that you have no control over. ""I'm being chased,"" she says. ""This was the only place where they wouldn't find me.""",NappyFlickz,"I was hunting that night, in the deep wilds of Andregar. With flecks of Martin and Tolkein, but largely inspired by my long history as a Dungeon Master, Andregar was easily my favorite creation, and the dreamscape I most consistently returned to. Most often, I dreamt myself an adventurer, but that night I was a lord, leading his entourage in pursuit of a massive, vicious stag. I found a different quarry.

When the girl stumbled out of the woods into my charger's path, my first thought was to dismiss her. With blonde hair that was stringy and caked with dirt, a body swaddled in the thinnest of rags, I figured her for an outlaw's bastard child and the distraction was unwanted. When I tried to erase her, however, the thought refused to come. It was as if I couldn't imagine this world without her presence. 

Instead, I halted my steed, and revoked my entourage, who melted into non-existence as simply as ever. The girl approached demurely, stared up with huge, sunken eyes and croaked: ""I'm being chased. This was the only place they wouldn't find me.""

""Who are they? For that matter, who are you?""

In lieu of a response, she teetered to the side and collapsed, unable to support her emaciated frame any longer. I must admit here that I am not generally empathetic to the inhabitants in my dream. Perhaps its a lack of empathy or a form of masochism, but I see them as mere outgrowths of imagination, rather than fully-fledged beings, no matter how realistic they seem. Yet that eve, I took her in my arms, and interrupted Andregar to will her into a dream of a state-of-the-art hospital.

I stayed by the girl's side while she slept in a soft, safe bed. Watching over her, I noticed a further peculiarity. Not only was I wholly unable to modify her, but her presence had its own effect. A vague aura of distortion emanated from her slumbering body, rippling and twisting space up to an inch away from her skin. Like the child herself, the ripples were unalterable.

She woke coughing, a harsh fit that jolted out of unconsciousness. As she recovered from this attack, she noticed my presence and a wan smile stretched her waxy lips. ""I knew you would stay with me."" she whispered, ""Thank you.""

""I... you're welcome. Look, I don't want to worry you, Lord knows you've probably been through enough, but if you're being chased, I need to know exactly what it is. Believe me, in here, I'm strong enough to stop anything.""

Her smile brightened a little. ""You already did. I thought I was the only one, but you're much stronger than me.""

""I don't get it,"" I mumbled, but before she could continue, a doctor interrupted, pulling me aside. He showed me a chart of the injuries on her body, explained the probable cause, and suddenly everything snapped together. 

I returned to her bedside, and gently took her hand in mine. ""No need to look so worried, sunshine,"" I reassured, ""you can't manifest anything here, can you? All that awfulness festering in the depths of your mind can damn well rot there. You're safe."" ",gloomy_Novelist

One night you stumble upon a strange girl in your dream, that you have no control over. ""I'm being chased,"" she says. ""This was the only place where they wouldn't find me.""",NappyFlickz,"I exited the ballroom of the Titanic in my finest tuxedo, gradually stepping down the stairs with my smartphone in hand. I had just been taking pictures with some of Southhampton and New York’s wealthiest men and women. They simply adored the attention— the fact that I had a futuristic device from the future captivated their minds.

“Simply dazzling!” Mrs. Porter had told me. I chuckled— it was fun entertaining people, even if the photos would never materialize and I had willed Mrs. Porter to come into being in the first place. 

I stepped along the grand staircase, casually tipping my hat to the noblemen that passed by. I grabbed a gentleman by the arm as he traversed my path and softly asked, “Sir, how would you feel if the men and women from the lower decks joined us? I feel bad that they’re stuck in their quarters.” 

“Simply splendid, Sir— I’ll grab the Captain posthaste and tell him to make an announcement,” he said, trotting off upstairs to the main deck. 

I smiled. In a more historically accurate situation, I knew full well that the aristocracy of the Titanic would have no desire to grab the poor from the decks below to have a party with them. However, this was my world. I could do whatever I pleased, and I thought that a touch of social equality was in order. 

I had been so much happier ever since I learned how to lucid dream. So many months of dream journals and trigger objects led to frustration upon waking up, struggling to remember what had been so vivid in my mind just moments before. My roommate had laughed at me, particularly when I got lost in the kitchen in a sleepy stupor when I was searching for a pen to record my latest dream. 

“Can’t you just dream like everyone else?” he had asked. 

I had assured him that no, I could not. I would master this thing… and I did. The reprieve from my ordinary, stressful life as a lawyer was much needed. Where sleep had once been an annoying necessity, it was now transformed into something I looked forward to throughout the day. Hell, sometimes I even took naps in the office just to lull myself back to my imaginary world where I could escape from the mundanity of everyday life. As a result, I had never felt better. I was healthier, happier, and more well-rested than ever before. 

I looked around my intricate imagining of what the Titanic’s grand foyer might have looked like as the people from below deck began to pile in. I have to admit, it was inspired a bit by the film— but also touched up with statues from the Art Institute of Chicago, paintings from the Smithsonian, and other locales I had the fortune to visit in real life. I laughed to myself, and decided to put a framed picture of a meme on the wall as well. After all, this was my dream! I could do whatever I wanted. 

“Simply marvelous craftsmanship!” Mrs. Porter exclaimed as she observed a picture of the Wow doge with her opera glasses. Classic. 

I turned to the audience before me, greeting them with my cheeriest smile. “Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the grand ballroom of the RMS Titanic! I wanted to give you all the opportunity to dance the night away with me above deck before we reach our final destination of New York… and trust me, we will make it there!” I winked. The passengers shouldn’t have gotten it, but I willed them to get the joke. It landed well with them as a wave of laughter passed over the crowd.

“But first, let’s dress for the occasion, shall we?” I snapped my fingers and instantly, the tattered clothes and suspenders worn by the group transformed into elegant ball gowns for the ladies and polished tuxes for the men. They gasped in surprise and awe. It felt so good doing magic in my dreams. 

“What are you waiting for?” I asked. “Go have fun!” 

I waved my hand and the crowd passed by, dotted with assorted whoops, excited screams, and the occasional “thank you!” to me as I shook a few hands. I watched them ascend the staircase to the ballroom and was about to follow when I turned around to see a straggler lurking in the back by the door. 

It was a young girl, maybe 18 or 19, dressed in jeans and a sweatshirt that read “MICHIGAN.” She seemed to be looking around at the rafters, knocking on the pillars as if she were searching for something. That would have been the strangest thing about her if I hadn’t also noticed that she seemed to be covered in a small amount of… blood? There was a small spattering across the front of her sweatshirt. This didn’t make any sense. Why wasn’t she dressed like the other passengers, or at the very least in the clothes of the era? I knew I had more control over my dreams than that. I shrugged, and walked over to her. 

“Er, hey! Why aren’t you going with the other passengers to the ballroom? We’re having a party!” I exclaimed. I attempted to look excited, but her serious look was making me more anxious than jubilant. 

“Uh… hi.” She said distractedly, looking at me out of the corner of her eye. She continued knocking on the pillar. “I’m, uh, good. Thanks though.”

This was weird. I had never met a character in a dream that didn’t want to do something I wanted to do before. Was I consciously imagining this? Then it hit me, and I snapped my fingers. 

“Oh, I get it, your clothes! Let me change those for you! I can get you a really nice dress to wear.” I snapped my fingers again and imagined a Victorian style dress cascading over her, prepping her for the ball to come. Instead, nothing happened. 

“What? Why can’t I—“ 

“Oh! Wait, you’re the dreamer of this place?” she asked suddenly. She abruptly stepped up to me and began examining my clothes.

“Huh?” I muttered, bewildered.

“The dreamer? Are you him? This is your dream?” She asked impatiently. 

“Um, well yeah, but—“ 

“Quickly, listen to me. I’m being chased. This is the only place they wouldn’t find me. I’m sorry to come here and put you in danger too, but I needed to hide.”

I was completely and utterly confused now. The girl was back to knocking on the pillar and checking the baseboards around the edge of the foyer. There was no mistaking that whatever was on her sweater was definitely blood, as she moved into the light and around the room. 

“Um, look, I’m sorry,” I began. “Why can’t I control you? I’m clearly aware that I’m dreaming here…” 

She stopped and sighed, placing her hands on her hips. “You can’t control me because I’m not part of your dream. I’m trapped here— cursed. I can’t explain it now, but I need to make sure this place is secure.” 

“Why wouldn’t it be secure?” I asked. “And why do you keep looking around the room like that?” 

She was back on her knees now, crawling around the carpeted base of the stairs. She had determination in her eyes. “They come in through loose seams in people’s dreams… She sends them to come find me.” 

The girl paused at the framed picture of the Wow doge. “Nice,” she muttered. 

I was at a loss for words. I had so many questions, and not many answers from this enigmatic woman that had suddenly appeared without warning in my once-splendid dream about the Titanic. 

“Look, I don’t know what’s going on here, but I’m gonna go upstairs to the party. I’m a little creeped out and—“ BOOM. 

Without warning, the whole room suddenly shook as if there was a cannon aimed at the walls. My heart raced in my chest. “What the—?!” 

BOOM. 

“Oh Christ, they found me. They know I’m in your dream,” she said. She pulled a knife out of her sock and waved it apprehensively. 

BOOM. The whole room looked like an unsteady camera, as if someone was pounding on the sides, causing it to shake. 

“What? Tell me what’s going on!” I yelled. I was about to rush towards her, but out of the corner of my eye I saw the wallpaper peel around the corners of the portraits I had so carefully imagined. At the seam where the wall met the ceiling, I could see what looked like shadowy hands reaching through out of nowhere, grabbing at the air. 

“Sarahhhhhh……..” They hissed. My skin crawled. 

“What the fuck are those things?!” I asked. 

The girl— Sarah, supposedly— rushed up to me and grabbed me by the lapels of my polished tux. The lights were flickering on and off as the shadow hands grew longer, reaching for her. 

“Listen to me,” she said panickedly. “You’re a lucid dreamer, right? You have to imagine something for me to use here. She’s going to have these things grab me and take me back to her. Please, anything!”

She turned suddenly and swiped at a hand with the knife she had produced earlier. It recoiled and shrunk slightly, but still lingered as it began to stretch for her again.

“Any weapon! Please, do it now!” Her eyes were scared. 

A weapon? My questions still weren’t answered, and this dream had turned into a nightmare. I had no idea who this girl was— if she was even real— and I was scared out of my mind. However, in my panic, the thought of a laser gun crossed my mind, and I spotted it on the floor next to us. A sleek, photon blaster straight out of a sic-fi movie. 

The hands were getting closer. 

Sarah picked it up and retreated to the middle of the room with me. “Okay, you have to get me out of here. Wake up!” 

“Wait!” I protested. “Who’s chasing you? Who is ‘she?’ What are these things?”

The hands were almost on top of us. There was a flash of light as she pulled the trigger on the blaster, incinerating a shadow hand in front of us.

“I don’t have time to explain! Please, I’ll find you the next time you’re asleep! Now wake up!” 

“But I—“ 

She turned around quickly, the gun now pointed at me. I barely had time to yell out as she pulled the trigger, causing me to bolt upright in my bed in a cold sweat. ",PaperJournal

One night you stumble upon a strange girl in your dream, that you have no control over. ""I'm being chased,"" she says. ""This was the only place where they wouldn't find me.""",NappyFlickz,"My first time, I was flying. It was exhilarating - the rush of wind in my face, wisps of white clouds reflected in the glittering water below. I had to go through a few different species before I settled on a flock of birds that I wanted to keep around. I started with geese, but didn't like their honking. I assume the ducks came next just because my brain tied them to geese so much. It took some getting used to, overpowering your subconscious mind with your conscious one. 

I settled on starlings. A murmuration, it's called. Turns out, once your conscious mind get some good ideas rolling, your subconscious can roll with it pretty well. And suddenly the starlings and I were flying through a night sky, littered with stars. And I could hear them, more in my mind than in my ears, hear them murmuring to each other. Gradually that turned into a soft, heart-breaking song - one that stayed with me most of the morning. 

I become an explorer of dreams. I journey through the solar system, diving into super novae, bursting through black holes. I try out different colors for Jupiter's red dot and decide that red actually is the most aesthetic. 

I explore the planet in ways I would never -- well, I can't say I would never dream of doing it, since that's precisely what I'm doing. But there's no way I would go caving in real life. I certainly wouldn't let myself be bathed in lava atop an active volcano. And deep-sea diving is easy when you can swim as fast as you want and never have to breathe. 

It is weeks before I realize that I've kept myself human all this time. Once I start thinking about how limiting my body is, and playing with being other animals - or other entities - I start to push other limits. From atop a cliff, I dive into the Pacific as a blue whale. I swim through a rainbow river as a swarm of butterflies. As a flaming eagle, I leave fiery streaks across the Milky Way. 

I first find her as a large black wolf wandering through a pre-historic jungle, as a pterodactyl beats its leathery wings overhead. Her presence is jarring: she doesn't belong here. There is no part of my brain that doesn't know this - dinosaurs and humans did not overlap. 

Something about this situation makes it feel more comfortable to stay a wolf, even though I know I can do all the same things a wolf can as a human if I will it. I approach her slowly, hackles raised, and sniff her a few times. 

Her brown hair hangs straight, falling just past her shoulders, except for her bangs, which are cut about half an inch too high. Her hazel eyes are wide as she turns to look at me, and she is shaking, but she stands her ground. She is thin, even emaciated. Her face is pale. She is wearing an Avengers t-shirt that drops down to her knees.

""I'm being chased,"" she says. ""This was the only place where they wouldn't find me."" 

There is a smell on her that I can't identify, but one that puts me on edge. I notice a constellation of bruises on her wrists. I concentrate for a moment and confirm what I already suspected. The setting has changed to a grassy field next to a stream. No one can be seen. Everything has been changed...except for the girl.

I nuzzle her hand and she scratches my head absently.

She gives me a small, sad smile. ""Thank you,"" she says. ""I wasn't sure what the dinosaurs would do to me if they found me."" 

I blink once, and a thick, cashmere blanket appears around her shoulders. A table made of quartz-crystal materializes with cupcakes and juice.

She reaches out for one of the cupcakes, hand trembling, and then begins to cry.

""It was my birthday today. I didn't get a party or anything but I still made a wish before I went to bed. I wanted safety, something to protect me, but I never...I figured that would be the end of it.""

*You should eat and drink.* I will my message into her head. I feel convinced that turning back into a man would be a bad idea but my mind balks at the notion of a talking wolf, even here. *It's not real, of course, but even the idea of it counts for something.*

She nods and sits by the table, following my suggestion as I work on adding details to the scene. A gentle breeze, bringing scents of lavender, roses, and honeysuckle. A cherry tree surges out of the ground, its blossoms a shower of pink, orange, and red, next to us. 

I put my head in her lap. As she runs her hand over my fur, she begins humming. It is a song I've heard before, but I can't remember where.

""I'm going to have to leave soon,"" she says quietly. ""I hope you will come find me."" 

*How?* 

She squeezes her eyes closed for a minute, then opens them again, tilting her head back and pointing up.

The sky has been dominated by an address, written in burning scarlet letters. I study it carefully, committing it to memory. 

A moment later, the girl - and the letters - are gone. The latter has been replaced with a black sky spattered with stars and a crescent moon.

As I am hit with realization of where I have heard that song before, I fill my lungs and howl, the sound echoing into the darkness.

""This was the only place where they wouldn't find me.""",NappyFlickz,"I could go anywhere and create anything my heart desired. After weeks of experimenting in Infinity, the name I gave my world, I had complete control over every facet. The real world was bland, almost meaningless knowing I could be infinite. Knowing I was God.

The northern lights cover the sky above me while birds swirl around me, nature at my beck and call. The blues and greens dancing in the sky fuel my desire to stay in this world. The real world is nothing, an empty cage, compared to the Dream. I know that this would end in just a few hours when the sun comes up and work sucks the life back out of me. 

As I roll over sighing I feel the sudden urge for a new setting. Poof, the Grand Canyon appears below me with the Sun just appearing on the horizon. The earth is cracked beneath me, no bridge crosses the enormous gouge. The dessert on the West shimmers in the morning sun and sand even glows with a fury. The east side has no light, plants and animals lay dead on the hard sand. 

Then something burst into my world, I feel it changing my designs. Scanning every direction I’m distraught. This feeling is not normal it sends chills down my spine. Poof, I appeared by my bed but nothing is different and the sense of another presence is gone. As I sit on my bed I see a note stuck between my pillows. 

“Do not be afraid. I have taken residence in your world. They chased me and this is the only place I won’t be found. Please do not look for me, if you know where I am they will find me.

-Gwen”

This is my dream, I thought. How did anyone else even get here? I have been looking for a way to make this my home, Gwen could be the answer. 

I almost jumped out of bed, my alarm blaring through the apartment. I shook off the event as a regular dream creeping into my lucid thoughts, a by product of spending so much time there. I will take some time away and get some regular sleep tonight. 

&gt;&gt;

My dream that night was normal, a beautiful girl and a concert was all I could remember. I woke up before anything good happened I know that much. I almost forgot about the girl and the possibility of having my own world. I accepted that Infinity was coming to an end and would soon collapse into a regular dream. I was wrong.

I will visit Infinity tonight and see if anything has changed.

&gt;&gt;

Slowly I rise out of my physical body into Infinity. Power pumps through me as I become God. I look around the room and see nothing unusual, until I see the note laying on the floor next to my bed. Shaking I pick up the note and ignite the paper in flames. 

Just then a sound came from outside my apartment and fear grabs me by surprise. This sound comes from everywhere and nowhere. The air shakes from the immense power outside.

Whether out of fear or instinct I dare not change a thing. My footsteps are light on the wood floor as I creep outside of my building. I can see something in the distance, a light bouncing off the clouds in the East. The sun is setting in the west as it falls behind the trees. The light sweeps from side to side on the clouds above it, searching.

In desperation I float into the air to get a better look at what intrudes in my world. I can create explosions, floods, meteors at my will, there is nothing that can stop me here. As I reach higher I can see the light shift its pattern from sweeps to a direct line tracing a path directly towards me. Pausing my ascent I can see the light is emitting from a glowing bubble. Everywhere the bubble had been is empty. The ground wasn’t barren and dead, it’s gone to the void. 

Crash, I land on the ground in a heap. I dare not use any more power. I am confident it can sense it. The light is still growing closer, an eraser destroying my art. 

“Quick follow me!” I hear a voice shout from beside me. A girl stood there, leaning out of an open door that floats above the ground. The door is wooden and shimmers at its borders. The girl has short, strawberry hair that popped with her bright green eyes.

I grab her hand as she reaches toward me. The thing is still destroying everything in its path towards me. Scrambling through the frame I don’t even look what lays beyond. Her smile is mischievous as she closes the door to my world and I lay taking short breaths of panic. 

“I’m Gwen.” She said tilting her head to the side. “What’s your name and how long have you been an explorer?”

Still breathing quickly I spit out “Aric, my name is Aric.”

“Well Aric we should move on before they find us. I am sorry for bringing them to you, you clearly are not ready. I need your help before we can move on however.” She said sternly already hustling me to my feet. My feet however are not touching a floor and the entire area is void, nothing but darkness except the closed door in front of us.

My hand brushes the wood until, the door disappears before me in one swipe. Tears begin to well in my eyes, my art being destroyed by that thing. 

“What was it?” I say staring at the ground. 

“I don’t know, hunters looking for anyone that breaks the rules. I broke the rules a long time ago and have been running since. They destroy everything in their wake. If you are caught you disappear, in this world and the real world.” She calmly explains to me how her world was destroyed when she gained the power to travel worlds.

“You have a lot to learn.” Gwen said. She closes her eyes and creates a beautiful door with the same shimmer at the edges. 

“This is your new home she said as she pushed open the bronze door revealing the dining hall of a magnificent castle on the other side.

	[Dear Diary,

 
	The house was filled with tears of depression. The intense and heartfelt kisses, jokes to cheer up the inevitability of it all. The long hugs and crying made me feel even worse about myself… you see diary, tomorrow I will be 18… and if my power does not manifest I’ll be thrown into the mines for the rest of my days… I mean seriously, what is wrong with me… my younger sister Mai got hers today and she’s only 13 years old... I guess I should just give up… I should pack my things for the coal mines but first I’ll elaborate for anyone who finds this diary. 

	It all started February 13th 2018. 2 weeks before the bombs dropped. You see tensions were already high between the US and North Korea. Both countries throwing insults back and forth. This led to all nations to unsteady hands hovering over the “button”. It never really took much to set off President Trump but no one thought he would actually do it. In the end all it took was some name calling “Trump is a Dotard”… then boom, war erupted and the nukes were launched. All over the world the match was struck and nuclear annihilation was set. The war was devastating and nearly 2/3rds of the world population died in the first few week, But like Ecclesiastes 3:20 we returned to the dust and from the dust we rose, and humankind thrived. Turns out nuclear waste can in fact give superpowers… no one understood why they got the powers they got at the time, but in time they realized it had to do with their name. With this phenomenon known Kim Jong-Un was the sure-fire victor his power based on his name was unrivaled, Jong meaning Just and Proper and Un meaning favor his name translated to the power of “Justice and Favor” and he cashed in hard. Using his powers he enacted his ultimate ability “Korean Law” which made him and his army untouchable as no matter what we did his idea of justice put himself and his above all else and with the odds and favors on his side the world couldn’t do a thing. That is except for the president. Enacting his special ability “Trump Card” which allowed him to slip my grandfather and his special forces in and assassinate the Tyrant, which would have been a great victory. However, Vladimir Putin stepped in. Vladimir meaning great and peaceful ruler, and Putin, meaning to make a claim or application for something. He placed his ability at the top of the stack, and thus sacrificing himself set a wave of peace freezing The Donald and Kim in place creating a peace that would last generations to come. This was later known as the Name Wars.

	100 years have passed since then. Research and studies have shown us much about this mutation in humans, Names were now associated with jobs and each family was given a list of names that associated with specific jobs and duties. We gained super powers but lost free will. The powers seemed to manifest themselves during puberty. But you never know what power you will get, if your name is too generic you may get nothing. For instance if your name is Mason, we know you will get something with stone, but will it be stone skin, be as strong as stone? Or will you get control over rock and earth? It was a crapshoot and if your power isn’t useful or apparent you are sentenced to the coal mines. I was given the name Kal at birth in part to pay homage but mostly because meaning strong would offer me the most opportunity to find my power and have a fulfilling life. But as you know now I am almost 18 and still have not seen my power emerge. Dad took my papers down to the registry today for analysis… hopefully they can figure it out. I really don’t want to have to work in the mines… oh well.
	
	Sincerely… Kal Maverick…]

A few tear stains dot the page of the book as he closes it and looks at the clock… [03:01am] “Happy birthday to me…” he says sarcastically as he lays back in his chair. He pulls the curtains and looks into the driveway to see his father had returned. The 2015 White Ford Explorer with the 5-0 painted on the side was sitting in the driveway. Considering his father never came upstairs Kal deduced that the registry wasn’t any help.  He knew his only option now was to run. Kal threw open the closet doors and began searching for any and all belongings that could help him in his escape. Some rope, clothes, a water bottle, leaving only his journal behind. He packed his bag and opened his bedroom door. His father, Ryder meaning Knight was a police officer, a defender of the law his power was that he could command authority to anyone who looks in his eyes. Kal knew that he would stop him if he was caught so he crept down the staircase carefully. At the foot of the staircase he could see the lights flicker from the television in the living room. No doubt his father fell asleep on the couch so not to wake his wife. Sneaking around the corner Kal makes his way into the kitchen a vanilla file sits on the table. Curiosity got the better of him. Reaching down he opened the folder and gazed on his birth certificate for the first time. His name wasn’t Kal after all… his father made a mistake a small dash where the ink from the pen gave out changed the name entirely. He wasn’t Kal Maverick, “The Strong Free Spirit” he was Kai Maverick, “The Unorthodox Keeper of Keys and earth.” Just like that upon reading his name the ground begun to shake beneath him his father awoke and raced to the kitchen to see his son just as the earth opened and swallowed him whole. 

Kai fell for what seemed like an eternity but was really only several moments. Finally he began to slow and without any warning he landed on a glass platform. In front of him was 3 locked doors. Each with its own symbol, one of a sword, one of a shield, and one of a staff. AS he stood up he could hear voices echoing all around him like a whisper.
 
“Which path will he takesss…?” the first voice whispered with a serpent like hiss.

“Is he really the one?” a second voice much harder and gruff chimes in.

“Perhaps… but he is a bit old, don’t you think?” a strong booming voice unlike the whispers of the others.

“Give the boy a chance” a feminine voice says.

Finally Kai pipes in, “Who are you? What am I doing here?” 

A light turns on and a man enters the room his slender body is wrapped in green scalemail, upon his head a golden helmet adorned with 2 long horns. He steps closer to Kai, his tongue slips from his curled mouth like a snake as he speaks his green eyes glow, “you can see usss?” 

“o-of course I can.” Kai says as he back up away from the man. As he takes another step a light turns on behind him as he bumps into another man, this one dressed in furs his hair was red and his eyes a dull green. his hand rested on his crooked sword as he ran his hand through his beard.  “Interesting… he may indeed be the one.” The big man speaks with a gruff nature. His accent was rough and heavy with Asian undertones. The next light bursted on and a man riding a horse walked into the room had raven-black curly hair and was clean-shaven, his armor brandished with a golden face. He held a spear in one hand his other arm blocked by his red cape that flowed off his shoulders gracefully. “What is your name boy.” The man demands from atop his horse. 

“I am Kai Maverick.” Kai shouts back as he backs into the arms of the 4th voice. A beautiful girl holds him in her embrace. Her soft black hair framed her face, adorning her head was a golden crown shaped like a bird. Her dark makeup and skin suited her well. Her clothing was made of white and gold and her neck was heavy with jewelry, “Kai Maverick hmmm that’s quiet the unusual name” she says draped around the boy holding him in place.” 

Struggling for a moment, he watches as the three other figures close in on him. “What do you want from me? why did you bring me here!” He says as he tries to break free. The girl releases him as the man on the horse begins to speak. “We are the guardians of the famous names of the past, Loki the trickster god, Genghis Khan the The Great khan of the mongol empire, Cleopatra Queen of the Nile, and I, Alexander the Great. And we young Kai did not bring you here, you did.”

“I brought me here??? And where is here exactly”

“Here is the great hall of heroes… as the keeper of keys you are able to unlock the doors to the future and the past.” Cleopatra chimes in.

“The peacccce brought on from the name war isss about to run outss” Loki steps forward removing his helmet.

“In order to protect the world… we need your help,” Genghis says as he draws his sword and bows before kai.  Followed by loki and cleopatra. Alexander hops off his horse. “I bow to no man… but i acknowledge you as our savior. Now go chose a door. The locks will only be opened for you.” 


Kai Walks over to the the three doors and infront of the sword he holds out his hand. Particles of light begin to converge in front of him and suddenly with a ‘ting’ a key is formed. Kai places it in the key hold and the lock unhindges with a Thudd… and the door opens…

[WP]You have an ability where you can see people's aura telling how successful they will be in life. Today you saw a guy in rags having the strongest aura yet.,PowerCore24,"""NO!"" I slapped the side of the beige PC tower. ""C'mon!"" Nothing happened. The PC was on its last legs a year ago, but the timing of the failure could not have been worse. I walked out of my room to look for my mother.



""Mom? Where are you?"" I said as soon as I stepped out into the hallway.



""In the kitchen!"" She replied. The smell of her meatloaf should have tipped me off, it was my favorite meal. I smiled when I stepped into the kitchen. Her aura sparkled like a cloud of silver glitter floating around her. She did not know that I could see her success, but she was happy that I smiled every time I saw her. 



""Can I use your laptop? I need to take a test, but my PC finally gave up.""



""Sorry hon, left it at work today. Why don't you try the library?"" She always tried to encourage me to go outdoors. As far as she knew I was a depressed shut in. I decided to tell her at some point soon, but the test was more important. I was enrolled in college, but could not handle going to the campus. 



Once I noticed it, my ability took me a while to sort out. I can see auras, and depending on its appearance I can guess how successful they'll be in life. The blinding auras on the campus helped me learn that it's more potential than actual success. 90% of the students had brilliant possible futures. Not only could I not concentrate in class, the light was often bright enough to be seen through my eyelids, and give me a headache. I didn't last more than a couple of days before I switched to online enrollment. I hoped the middle of the afternoon, in the middle of the week would mean a relatively empty library. 



""Save me a plate!"" I yelled at my mom as I walked out of the house with my backpack over my shoulder. 



""'Kay."" She said. I got in my car and drove. I cheered to myself when I noticed there was only one other car in the parking lot.



""Probably the librarian,"" I said to myself. I walked in and the place was beautiful. I'd not been in years. The library consisted of a two story building with wonderfully large floors. The help desk was in the center of the first floor with rows of book cases on each side. I made my way up the stairs to the computer lab on the second floor. It was also surrounded by rows of books. I sat down and got to work. After about half an hour I looked up and noticed a black speck. 



The black dot hovered in the air behind the computer station I sat at. It began to grow wider and taller until it resembled a pitch black hole in reality. It appeared flat with no depth or any sign light escaping. I stared at it intently until a golden shining light forced my eyes shut. It was not enough and I still saw brilliant, solid gold through my eyelids. I put my hands over my eyes and laid my head down on the desk, hoping I wasn't permanently blind. It felt like I stared at the sun. 



""Hey, you okay?"" A man's voice said, and I felt a gentle hand rock my shoulder. 



""Yeah, I'm fine."" I said. I looked up at him assuming the light was gone. Golden light seared my eyes and I forced my head down on the desk. I caught a glimpse. I could not make out any features, his aura was too bright for me to see the person. Normally peoples clothes help block out some of their aura, but from what I could tell this man seemed to be dressed in tattered rags. I noticed darkened strips going down his body vertically. ""I'm not fine. Sorry. I can't look at you, but don't take it personally."" I hoped he didn't think I was insulting him. His hand remained on my shoulder. 



""It's probably for the best, I'm kind of indecent at the moment. Is there a store nearby where I can get some clothes?"" He asked. 



""Huh? Yeah, there's one right next door,"" I said. I was about to ask how he didn't see it on his way into the library, then I realized he probably came through the black hole I saw.



""Hey, where'd you come from? Did you come from that black hole? Who are you?"" He patted my shoulder warmly.



""My name is [Regal](http://hserratafun.blogspot.com/p/regal.html). So you saw me coming out of the portal?"" He asked. I shook my head.



""I saw the portal open, but I was blinded when you stepped through. I can see people's auras and yours was *really* bright. The brightest I've ever seen. His hand wavered on my shoulder, somehow it felt like he was thinking. I kept my hands on my eyes, and my face on the desk. Even the slightest wiggle allowed his aura to pierce through my eyelids.



""What's your favorite number?"" he asked. His question caught me off guard, and I answered as quickly as I could.



""34"" I said.



""Do you have a tattoo with the number 34 on it?"" Regal asked. I nodded, even though my mom had no idea about it. I had a tattoo of an old style army helmet on my thigh with the number 34 on it. 



""[El Soldado](http://hserratafun.blogspot.com/2017/11/hugoverse-guidebook.html)! I've been looking for you,"" he patted my back, then stopped suddenly. ""Sorry. To be clear I haven't been looking for *you*. I'm looking for people like you. Unique Souls.""

"[WP] Extended droughts, dust storms, widespread and pervasive poverty. The year? 2039.",belovicha21,"""Got any gas?""

Probably a weird question to ask when I have a shotgun pointed at my abdomen, I know. But, I do really need the gas.

The woman holding the shotgun looks at me like I'm crazy. Maybe I am, who knows in this world. I should probably be terrified. The woman tips the shotgun towards the ground.

""Gas...... where you headin?""

I look at her for a second, surprised I'm not lying on the ground with a massive bullet in my stomach.

""It's not loaded.""

She drops it into the sand and looks back up at me. I'm surprised that she's younger than I originally thought. Probably just a little younger than me. She looks like she's scared. That's not something you can be in this world, now.

""Headin towards the mountains. Figure maybe there's a stream or two that are still flowin.""

The girl nods. She looks around behind her. I almost laugh when I think about how she caught me. I was driving cross the desert in my pinto, listening to some AC/DC when she sprang out of nowhere. I still don't know were she came from.

""I got gas.""

I smile at that. Been a while since someone was willing to trade. 

""We're gonna need to drive there though.""

I nod. I walk back to the pinto stopping to pick up her shotgun and throw it in the back of the truck. I open the door and sit down in the dust filled pinto. The girl joins me and looks around as if she isn't impressed. Lot's of dust, girl. Welcome to the apocalypse.

_____________________________________________________

Her cave is impressive I'll give her that. When we drove up I hadn't been able to see it. She hid it well. The entrance had drapes the same color of the sand hung up so that no one would be able to see it from far away. I walked inside and noticed supplies hang around on hooks. I can see guns, knives, food, water..... how'd she get this stuff. There's lights streaming across the roof, not sure how she get's them to work exactly without electricity. I put my hand on the wall and feel how cool it is. That's nice compared to how hot it is outside. I strip off my jacket and slide down the wall, embracing the coolness of the cave. I can smell various candles being lit, each one making the smell of the cave better than anywhere I've been lately. The girl notices me looking at her and shrugs.

""You smell.""

I snort, it's not easy to find a place to bathe round these times.

""So where'd you get all this stuff?""

She looks at me as if she doesn't want to tell me. Then she sighs.

""My parents were always prepared, we were ready for anything.""

Not so ready as they seemed seeing as I can see their skeletons in one of the corners.

""So what do I call you?""

I turn around as the girl digs through mountains of supplies, hopefully looking for a gas tank. I think back. The apocalypse started six years ago, I was only thirteen. The name I held then hasn't been used in years.

""Call me Boy. What do I call you?""

She continues digging but snorts at the name I've chosen.

""Creative one huh? Well my name's Girl.""

She makes me laugh. A hard task now in our new world. She laughs with me for a moment then she jabs her hand into a hole in the mountain of supplies and pulls out a gas tank.

She turns and smiles at me, I smile back. It only lasts for a second however.

""Got water?""

I turn to the sight of three grown men. They each look exactly the same, acne covered faces, taller than one should be. They could be muties, they weren't uncommon round these parts.

""We got water.""

The leader nods. His two brother's laugh. I've decided I'm gonna call them pig face. They each have gigantic backpacks on their backs. They destroy the pleasant smell of the cave within an instant. I can tell from the way they're standing they don't intend on trading nicely.

""Then, I'm sorry about this.""

The brothers bum rush me.

_____________________________________________________

I strap the three backpacks to my pinto. Turns out they had some can's of food in there that could be useful. Girl is sitting in the front seat. She hasn't looked at me since I killed the men. I understand it, I wish it wasn't like this. 

I finish strapping the backpack and climb in the car. I turn the key and with a whine the engine starts. I notice Girl has set one of her candles on the dashboard to make it smell better. I smile, she's stuffed a ton of her stuff in the backseat from the cave. I told her she should ditch it in case another group came along. I turn and notice Girl staring at me.

""Thank you.... for saving me.""

I look at Girl and shrug. 

""You don't deserve to die. Plus I like ya Girl. We might just end up being friends.""

She laughs as I hit the gas and we set off across the dunes. She let's her hair down and I can see just how blonde she is now. Her eyes are bright blue, like the water we're searching for. My eye's are grey like the sudden storms that hit every now and then. I've always liked people based off of their eyes. It's an easier way to look into their soul.

""Promise you'll never leave me Boy?""

I look at Girl, the person who was holding a shotgun to my stomach not two hours ago. She'd decided to come with me the moment that she'd seen me. Least that's what she said. A ride for the gas. That was the trade. Except this ride might last a long... long time.

""Never, Girl.""

A chimney sweeps job is never done. I smile as I climb up the ladder and onto the roof. As I stand I look around at the buildings surrounding mine. There's still some left over from the bombings. There's still holes in most, that nobody bothered to fix. I live in one with five other people. It get's cold most nights, thankfully we started using chimneys again to keep us warm. I can also see the wall from here. It's huge meant to keep most people out. Usually it does.

I walk across the roof with the broom I use to scrape the soot off the inside of the chimney. Below my little brother is crawling up the chimney and scraping bits and pieces off. He's not actually my little brother. As his mentor I've been teaching him how to clean chimneys since he was eight and I was fourteen. Since then he's become like a brother.

I look around and find some rubble that must have been from another building that was hit in the bombings. I walk over and pick a pebble out of the rubble. Hopefully John wore his helmet today. I walk back to the chimney and drop the pebble down it. John knows this is his signal to get out of the chimney. 

I look down from the roof and watch John run out of the house. He smiles and looks up at me with a chipped tooth. He signs to me that he's cleaned most of the inside of the chimney. I smile and sign back letting him know he can take the rest of the day off.

He jumps with joy and runs off to hang with some of his friends. I walk back across the roof again and to my broom. I pick it up again and start scraping at the chimney. I'm sure the sound might annoy me if I could hear it. I close my eyes and smell everything around me. The burned chimney, the dust that occasionally drops, the metallic smell of my sweat, food cooking. I open my eye's again. It's a beautiful day.

_____________________________________________________

By the time I've finished it's almost night time. I sigh as I look at the sunset. Still so beautiful even after everything that's happened to us. I climb down the ladder and walk inside the house. 

Waiting for me is the family who hired me. None of them know sign but I manage to show them that I can read lips and they understand. I watch the father's lips and understand that he's asking how much he owes me. I take out a small whiteboard I keep with me in my satchel and a marker. The smell of the marker when I take the cap off always makes me feel nauseated.

I write on the board that I charge twenty dollars or two slices of bread. The man looks at me and thinks about which he'd rather give me. He leaves mouthing that he'll be back and I nod. I look around the house and smile. It's a warm home, I can smell food being made and the children are playing. I watch them run around the room and smile. I never got to have this. The house even has candles, a commodity that few were able to afford now a days. 

The father returns a minute later with ten dollars and a piece of bread. I laugh and take them, with one hand I write on the white board that I am thankful and to come find me if they need a chimney sweep again.

_____________________________________________________

It's dark when I'm heading back home to my bombed out building. I try to be careful as I walk through the crowded streets. It's hard to notice someone trying to sneak up and rob you when you can't hear, I always hold my broom to the side in case someone attacks. As I walk I pass some of the food stalls in the market that we had built in the main road. I can smell food being cooked up for the elites of our village as I walk. My stomach growls but I smile. I'll eat well tonight. 

I walk down the street towards my building that is less crowded than the main road. My eyes search back in forth as I walk, I hope to avoid any confrontations. Once satisfied I start walking towards the building. Before I can open the door I feel a hard hit to the back of my head.

I don't know where any of it's coming from as they hit me. All I can feel is the cold ground as I try to hold on to my satchel. I try to scream but I have no idea if any sound is even coming out of my mouth. One of them grabs my bag and pushes me back to the ground. I sign ""Please"" trying my best to get mercy but I don't think any of them understand. Even if they did they might not care.

The one who took my bag rummages through it throwing the white board and marker at me. I could stand and fight but I don't think there would be much point. I wouldn't win. The thief catches the sight of the bread and grabs it. As quickly as they hit me they run off.

I struggle to my feet and grab my broom. I limp over to my satchel. They've left the money and whatever else was in the bag. All they wanted was the food. I pick the satchel from the ground and lay it across my neck. I walk back to the door but before I can get inside I feel a hand on my shoulder.

One of the thieves hands me a small slice of the bread. He says something but in the dark I can't read his lips. He leaves and I smile. At least it's something. I look up into the sky at the moon. Tomorrows gonna be a beautiful day.

"[WP] Over the last four years, while studying at a college on the other side of the country, you've been exercising at the gym rigorously. Finally coming home no-one recognizes you so you decide to see what's different.",res30stupid,"What the gym?

I’m going to karate chop in the nuts the next asshole who introduces themselves to me, welcomes me sarcastically to the Pike brotherhood, or asks if I need help finding anything. Hard and fast, like I’ve been learning how to do in my martial arts class. I mean jeez, you’d think that I’d been gone for four decades instead of the four years that I studied abroad in Ireland. I’m a fucking senior for God’s sake, and I’ve been a part of the Pike fraternity for five years! What the heck is going on here? 

It’s my first day back to campus since my study abroad, and I’ve been wandering the beloved fraternity halls like a stranger, surrounded by warm, vibrant bodies but unable to connect with them. I look into the sea of familiar faces as I walk the building, feeling pumped to be home, but I see none of the friendly recognition that usually greets me. I’ve smiled, waved, and said cheerful hellos, but my responses have merely confusion, surprise, and disinterest. Or disgust. I may still need to karate chop Mike in the nuts for that one. Jerk. But my brothers have merely been treating me like some god-damn newb freshman boy who got lost. Like I should take off my big-boy panties and leave quickly before I hurt myself. Well fuck those guys, because I went through the hell-on-earth process of rush fair and square. I took shots of condiments, lived in a box for a week, and watched porn in the library. I deserve my place here. I fucking own it. 

My frustration and mounting resentment are what power me forward with the force of a fuel-pack strapped to my back. I stalk with measured, quick steps, and I swear I can hear each strike as my foot hits the ground. It makes a dull thud that I can’t remember hearing in the past. Not worrying about it, I think to myself that if I can just make it back to my old room, this nightmarish situation will go back to normal. My brothers will welcome me again. I keep that thought at the forefront of my mind, repeating it like a mantra and praying for patience. Shrugging my load higher onto my shoulder, I begrudgingly admit that it doesn’t help that I’m carrying my duffle bag with me as I walk through the corridors and up the stairs to my old room. I realize that it’s a blatant sign that I’m moving in, but that doesn’t excuse – 

“Hey there, little boy. Are you lost?” A deep, jeering voice suddenly interrupts my already raging thoughts. I freeze in place, my muscles locked tight in denial followed by swift, hot anger. I try to take a deep, calming breath, I really do. It shutters through my body, rattling me like I’m a flimsy kite flying too high in the sky. I set my bag down with a gentleness that I don’t really feel, but I can’t stop the way my hands clench and unclench. Slowly, too slowly, I turn around to face the condemned man. 

A quick scan reveals that tousled blond hair, brown eyes, and tan skin are the main features that mark the young man before me. I glance at his face, and I realize that I don’t know him. But hey, at least the non-recognition is mutual this time. As we make eye contact, an expression of surprise lights his face and I notice his eyes widen a fraction. My own narrow in response, and this dude better not be about to go where I think he’s going. 

“Hey, man, what’s wrong with your eyebrows? They look like those poisonous, furry caterpill - “  

My control suddenly snaps. I throw polite etiquette out the window like old garbage, because this guy is clearly not functioning at the capacity of the socially polite. Yes, I know I have dark, bushy eyebrows, and double yes, I know they look like those black, hairy caterpillars. But for God’s sake, man, those cute little boogars aren’t even poisonous! They may look like slow-crawling death, but their spines feel more like toothbrush bristles and they turn into these pretty little moths. With the intense gym sessions that I’ve been managing for the last four years abroad, an unexpected side effect of all the physical activity has been an exceptional and awkward amount of hair growth. Most of it is manageable, but getting my eyebrows waxed hurts too damn much to do very often. So sue me if I’ve become a little sensitive to comments regarding my brows on fleek. The insult of being called caterpillar eyebrows by this little twerp is the final straw, and a vein appears and throbs insistently on my forehead. Some of my inner wrath must be visible on my face, because the poor sap suddenly takes a quick step back. Too late, moron. It’s on like Donkey Kong. 

I let out an unholy yell as I charge forward, making good on my earlier, mental promise to karate chop an asshole in the nuts. He goes down with a painful oomf, but the blood pounding furiously behind my ears mutes out all sound. And all reason. Like Godzilla on a mission to destroy the city in an unintelligible rage, I streak down the hall, karate chopping all and any brother I pass. Manic laughter erupts from deep within me as my plans for patience and non-violence go up in a cloud of smoke. Their bodies litter the floor in my wake, and I feel unstoppable. All those long years of martial arts have finally paid off, and I’m no longer the weakling I was before I left this place. The buried, rational part of my mind realizes that my senseis would be embarrassed by my violent behavior, because it goes against the foundational tenants of all their teachings. The active, animal part of my mind, however, roars in triumph and seeks the next fool who is stupid enough to be walking the hallway at this exact moment. Strength courses through my muscles, and I glide through, riding a glorious wave of karate chopping destruction. I float, a mighty leaf in the wind, easily taking down any and all innocents with my superior - 

“Henry? Is that you, man?” The soft voice somehow penetrates the haze that had fallen over my vision, and I jerk to halt my forward momentum, stumbling slightly with my hand held suspended over some random dude’s nuts. I awkwardly lower my hand as the dude turns and runs like hell. I raise my caterpillar eyebrows as I watch his dust trail, impressed by his newfound speed.  

Blinking, I force my gaze to focus on the man in front of me. I see a blurry face with dark hair, but rationality is still too suppressed for me to thick clearly. “Who - ?” I begin, but he interrupts. 

“Henry! That is you. Damn, you’ve become one strong son of a bitch, huh?” A final blink, and the face comes into focus. A happy, non-violent shock courses through my body: Lee Jansen, in the flesh, is standing in front of me. I feel a sharp sense of relief that one of my friends has finally, finally, recognized me, and the fight leaves my body as fast as a whore who’s just been paid. Only I feel a hell of a lot better for the loss. Grinning, I step forward quickly to shake his hand. 

“Lee! You don’t know how happy I am to see you.” I reply cheerfully. Lee and I rushed Pike together, so we’ve known each other through thick and thin. Of course, he would recognize me when the others hadn’t. Good old Lee Jansen.

“That so? Henry, since when do you go around chopping boys in the nuts?” Lee inquires with a soft chuckle. He subconsciously lowers his hand to protectively cover his own nuts. I notice, but can’t say that I blame him for the precaution. “Or have you acquired some freaky tastes from your long travel abroad?” He leers and wags his brows suggestively in typical Lee fashion. 

I shrug sheepishly and manage a dry chuckle. I glance behind me in the hallway, and the fallen boys are slowly rising again, pale and moaning and glaring at me. “Heh, heh. Sorry about that, guys. Ever since my intense training sessions at the gym, I haven’t been able to properly control my strength.” I offer by way of explanation, although it seems unnecessary because they aren’t really listening to me. Dismissing them, I turn back to Lee. 

I’m silent for several seconds as I contemplate where to start, what to ask, for us to properly catch up with each other. With four years, there’s a lot of ground to cover here! No doubt Lee has tons of fun, ridiculous stories to share. My smile grows as I anticipate hearing those stories over a couple of nice, cold beers. 

Before I can settle on a topic to start us off, he beats me too it. His expression turns confused, and he seems to blurt out the first thing that comes to mind. “But wait, Henry, what happened to your eyebrows? I know you’ve been gone for years and all, but now they look like those poisonous, furry caterpill –“ 

And just like that, an inner light once again shines brightly from within me. My eyes burn with intensity as Lee’s face slowly fades from my vision. Any anger that may have seeped out a moment before is now raging a ferocious swell inside of me. I let out my second, unholy yell of the day as I charge Lee, hand held up for yet another chop to the nuts. The buried, rational part of my mind sighs dramatically, wishing for the polite and peaceful days back in Ireland. ",CheetahCheeks

Prompt Me!",res30stupid,"'The coast guard had to sail the huge ship towards the nearest dock when the investigators arrived. Already the containers were being removed from the ship to be opened up as the entire ship was being looked over, from top to bottom.

Detective Montoya had to hold a fancy handkerchief, one of several her mother had gifted her last Christmas, due to the putrid mix of blood, bile and excrement soup that had to be stewing since the ship lost contact. 'Jesus,' she groaned as she tied it around her nose while a CSI handed her a bottle of peppermint concentrate to soak the linen in.

She made it to the bridge where she found Adam. He was busy flicking through several documents, collecting DNA samples that were speckled on them. 'Anything?' she asked.

'You're lucky I can read Cantonese,' Adam remarked as he began reading. 'Ship manifest says fifteen crewmen, other documents say more. We found a few of the containers had been modified for transporting people.'

'They were trafficking people?' Montoya asked.

'If I'm not wrong, quants,' Adam remarked. 'College students in financial analytics who were either kidnapped or hired by Triads to play the stock market.'

'How many bodies?' Montoya asked him.

'...there are none,' Adam said. 'And not just the crew. Food stores have been emptied of meat supplies. But there's blood, shit, stomach acid and plenty of piss. But no flesh, no bones or teeth...'

'That's weird...' Montoya remarked.

Her radio then came to life. 'Detective?' Gregory asked over it. 'If you're here... come down to the crew quarters. I've found something. And... watch your step.'

It didn't take long to find the crew's sleeping area where Greg was frozen before a laptop. 'So... I have no idea how to speak Chinese and I don't know if I want to because I'm afraid of this. But... one of the crew members was recording themselves when they died.'

'Do I want to listen to this?' Montoya asked.

'How about I just describe it?' Greg asked. 'It starts simple enough; a twenty-something Chinese man singing along to Britney Spears. Then you hear screaming in the distance, echoing off the wall. You see that door over there?'

The doorway that Montoya entered through was missing the door, which was left in shreds against the nearby wall. From her judgement it was no doubt impaled through to another dorm room like the one they were in.

'The recorder is confused for a moment... before he starts screaming,' Greg continues. 'There's some rapid pounding on the ground, a noise that I could only assume was clothing being torn apart. Then the victim just starts *screaming* as a sickening crunching could be heard. Then it suddenly stops.'

'Don't let Adam hear that,' she remarked.

'Also, notice something... strange?' Greg asked. 'I mean, blood analysis isn't my forte but...'

It was then that she noticed. Her eyes went wide in shock as she tried to figure this out. 'There's *way* too much blood,' she said. 'Could that recording explain it?'

'That was the only thing it recorded,' Greg remarked. 'It was recording until - at least what I believe - the laptop entered a power-saving sleep mode. This MP3 files is two hours long.'

'But-' she had to remark. 'The only blood in this room is *on the ceiling*! How do you explain that?'

'I don't know,' Greg said. 'The CCTV system exploded.'

'So, we write this off as paranormal?' she had to ask.

'Well... I don't know,' he said, unsure of if she was serious or not.

'I'm going to keep looking,' she told him. 'If you find something, let me know.'

'*If*,' he answered. 'And I sadly doubt that.'",res30stupid

Magic still eludes even the greatest scientists in the galaxy and unfortunately the Statute of Secrecy will *not* hold up.'

'But...' the Slytherin sighed. 'A *turian*? Really?!'

They all jumped when the watermelon on the teacher's desk exploded to the sound of a loud banging noise. They all turned to see the blue-skinned woman, someone who looked like the bastard child of a model and the lake's squid, holding a pistol in her hand.

'Rule number one,' she said to them. 'Muggle or not, if someone is aiming one of these things at you then you're dead.'

'How did you get there?' the Slytherin asked in surprise.

'I'm a veteran asari commando,' she explained. 'All asari are natural biotics - which means we can control gravity and dark matter. I just surrounded myself in a dark matter barrier; also known as a mass effect or kinetic barrier; to minimize my Newtonian weight before hurling myself at near the speed of light. And if I hit someone while doing that I'd turn them into a paste.'

'...Have you?' the Slytherin asked.

'Not nearly as many times as my old man,' she remarked. 'Although it hits harder when a krogan does it.'

'Anyway,' she remarked as she pulled out a wand, 'today, we're going to focus on a spell that can be used on just about any armed opponent. Either wand, knife or gun. Does anyone have any idea what spell I'm talking about? Black girl in the blue uniform. Name first.'

The Ravenclaw stood up and said, 'Melissa Redgrave. You're referring to the Disarming charm, correct?'

The asari tapped the wand to the board. 'Five points to... The blue house is Ravenclaw, right?' she asked. 'Have you been practicing this spell?'

'I've only seen that part of the textbook while skimming through it,' she remarked.

'Well, we're going to be practicing it right now,' the asari said as the instructions for the spell were drawn and several mechanical androids carrying weapons walked out of a doorway. 'By the end of the lesson, I want you all to be able to not only force the wand out of each other's hands but also disarm these robots. They'll be shooting paintballs at you so I assure you this won't be lethal, but they will hurt. Understood?'

'Of course I can turn you back, Mr Vakarian,' Dumbledore answered. 'I want to know how you're still speaking is all.'

'Just big enough,' she said with an innocent smile.

They could already hear the sneers from Malfoy and Harry thought, ""Oh, he's going to start something.""

Draco was most displeased, which was evident when he pulled out his wand. 'I'll teach you to disrespect me, Mud-'

He was left floating, suspended in midair by some dark light that surrounded him. The strange spell seemed to come from Professor Shepard who calmly walked towards him and calmly took the wand from his hand.

The sound of my footsteps echoes through the night and the street urchins lying around in the alley try their best to hide themselves, they know what’s up. I slow down as I made a sharp turn into a busy street. There's no way they could find me now. I clutched my duffel bag tightly in one hand used the other to keep my hood pulled over my face. I can't let myself be caught, I won't let all the effort I put in go to waste. I planned my heist weeks in advance; memorizing guard patterns, creating contingency plans, rehearsing my strategy. I would've been able to get away with it too, if it weren't for the idiot guard who left his post for a quick trip to the snack machine in the lounge. I grimace at the memory before quickly pushing it down. I have more important things to worry about now. Everyone knows the signs; the sound of dripping water and the hazy smell of metal. These are usually the last sensations a person experiences before they mysteriously vanish.
I walk among the crowd for a couple hours, doing my best to blend in. I slowly make my way to the apartment where my wife and kids live. After all, I do this for them. In a world where these monsters are the ones who decide who is corrupt or not, it’s hard to find an honest job that pays enough to make ends meet.

I hate the monsters for making us all live-in fear of doing anything wrong. These thoughts are brewing in my head as I make my way to the entrance of the building. That's when I hear it; in the distance, the sound of dripping water. I freeze. It has to be a coincidence, there’s no way they should have known where I lived. It rained a couple days before hadn’t it? My fears are confirmed as I the sound becomes louder, now coming from multiple directions. Without a second thought I break from my trance and flee in the opposite direction of the sound. Before I can get far, an image flashes through my mind; my wife and kids. I can’t just abandon them. They’re my reason to live, without them I’m nothing. I curse as I skid to a halt and run back to my apartment. I scout the perimeter of the building before making my way to the fire escape. The metal rattles beneath my feet as I climb the stair to the fourth floor, two steps at a time. I reach the back entrance of my apartment and examine the door, which has been left slightly ajar. That’s not a good sign. I quietly open the door and slip into the dark room. As I grope the wall looking for the light switch, I can detect the faint odor of metal in the air but it’s gone as soon as I notice it. I flick the lights on and examine the apartment. The whole place is a disaster. Furniture is slashed and overturned, the wooden cabinets have been thrown open, some even ripped off their hinges. A china set gifted by my mother lies in pieces on the carpet. I carefully step through the wreckage and make my way to the master bedroom. This room is somehow even in a more disastrous state than the rest of the apartment. Every nook and cranny has been exposed and whatever could be broken, has been broken. At this point I’m just very confused. It seems like whatever came here, was looking for something. A piece of glass cracks beneath my sneakers. I reach down and pick up a broken frame, it’s a picture of my family taken at my son’s first birthday party. My wife was caught mid-laugh and my son is grinning, his faced covered with frosting. It was easier back then, before the monsters appeared. I sigh but before I put down the picture I notice a small piece of paper folded up in the corner, tucked beneath the broken frame. I open it up and it reads:
“We have your wife and kids, bring the mystic core and they will be spared.”
Mystic core? What are they talking about? Is that what they were looking for? I feel an overwhelming sense of frustration, I have so many questions, like why am I still alive? I take a deep breath and steady myself against the wall. Whatever I need to do, I will. I am going to get my family back.

"[WP] every week at Tuesday afternoon, potatoes start raining down from the sky.",Chickenshots,"Thump. Thump. I opened my eyes. It must be Tuesday.

I had gone out the night before knowing very well I had to work today. It was a friends birthday so I felt obligated to go out and celebrate. Plus, I didn't have to wake up until noon anyways. I was hungover but this wouldn't be my first time working in this ill condition.

I had recently lost my job and found another at the only company that I knew was hiring, P4P. Potatoes for the Poor was a mid to low paying company that hired foreigners and people down on their luck. These people collected the spuds that rained down in the rural part of our country once a week. The workers gathered the potatoes that were in decent condition and shipped them to a warehouse. The warehouses then processed these potatoes into an abundance of dishes and shipped them to soup kitchens to feed our homeless population. Unfortunately for me, if I hadn't taken this job I would soon be one of those people eating at the soup kitchen.",rotsloth666

If I had been corporeal, I would have buried my head in my hands and whimpered.

“That’s called a headache,” several voices whispered at me. “Hope you’re enjoying it.”

The others continued to rant, scream and grieve for their lost lives.

I’ve always liked my meals lively. That was why I chose to feed on the souls of an entire planet’s population. Well, that, and I was dared.

“Fricking teenager,” one of the souls howled. “My soul was stolen by a teenager.”

“Let’s give him indigestion,” several voices whispered inside me.

“Speak English,” an ornery voice called out. “This is America.”

“This is not America! You’re dead!”

The souls continued to bicker and churn. I could feel every moment of their rage, their pain and their anguish. There was no need for them to try to hurt me. With the memories and consciousnesses of over seven billion humans inside me, I was feeling quite… sick. Perhaps I already had what they called ‘indigestion’.

Never again, I told myself. I would never binge eat a planet again.

I simply waited, anticipating the moment the human souls would lose their individuality and truly become part of me. The voices would quieten soon.

"[WP] Your cat just made its first birth. Unfortunately, it's a mutant. Fortunately, it's three times cuter/annoying. Meet Purrberus.",CrossSlashEx,"Extra mouths equaled extra food, and extra food equaled extra litter, but it was worth it. Purrberus (as we came to call him) was the cutest little three-headed abomination you'd ever seen. His three heads would mew in unison, and his purring on your chest was strong like a massage pillow. But cute was not all that Purrberus was.

Harry, my roommate, walked into my bedroom, an unsettled look on his face. ""Uh, Charles. I think Purrberus is hungry.""

""He's always hungry,"" I said, not even bothering to look up from my computer.

""Well, sure. He's got the three mouths and all, but I think you should see... er... *hear* this.""

I stopped typing and turned to Harry, a grin on my face, but Harry was not smiling. ""OK, let's take a look,"" I agreed seriously.

We walked into the kitchen to see the little multi-headed feline sitting nice and proper by his empty three bowls. When Purrberus saw me, he began to meow-out the ""Meow Mix"" jingle.

""See?"" said Harry, the color drained from his face. Each of Purrberus's adorable little heads would take a turn singing a single note of the melody, then pass the tune off to the next head.

""I guess that's kind of cute,"" I said uncertainly. Then added, ""Unsettling,"" with more assuredness. 

Harry looked at me seriously. ""I'll get the food,"" he volunteered.

After Purrberus finished eating, he walked into the living room where we were watching TV. He began rubbing up on Harry and Myself. With the extra heads, there was a lot of rubbing.

Harry reached down to pet Purrberus. ""I like his fluffy head the best,"" he said.

I reached down to simultaneously pet Purrberus. ""I like his middle head. With the big eyes, he looks like a little puss in boots!"" I goo gooed and gagaed at the little kitty, then picked him up, but as soon as the kitten was in my arms, his third head, the grumpy head, bit me.

""Ouch!"" I said, pulling back my hand and dropping the cat from hell. Purrberus spun not once, not twice, but three times in the air before landing on his feet. After landing, the two cuddly heads hissed at the grumpy one. The grumpy head growled back.

Then, as harry and I watched in amazement, the little cat began to fight with itself. Rolling over and over, spitting and hissing. Purrberus rolled across the floor, flung himself up on the couch and then careened, still hissing and wailing, out of our open window.

""No! Purrberus!"" I cried, grabbing my Jacket and running out the front door, my roommate close behind.

This had happened to us once before, so we knew what to do, but Harry reminded me anyway. ""Remember, Charles. You have to catch Purrberus with your hands, you can't use any tools or a cat carrier.""

""I know,"" I said, holding up Purrberus's favorite chew toy: a little lion. I sprinkled catnip onto the toy.

No sooner had the catnip touched the toy than Purrberus pounced out of a nearby bush, leaping like a tiger, knocking me to the ground.

""Get him!"" Harry cheered, as I wrestled the beast. After a glorious struggle, I was triumphant, overcoming Purrberus. By force and might, I held the furry cutie down, and Harry managed to fit a cat harness onto him.

I grasped the chain leash and we headed back to the house, but the cat was adamant. We got Purrberus home dragging him by his chain.",BenNJohnston

""Really that scared of dying, are you?"" Corral and Aufidia circled each other. Corral's hands were glowing with a vibrant golden energy, while Aufidia's dagger flashed a bloody crimson. ""Come on. You know that you can't keep Death away from you when the time is right.""

Aufidia shook her head. ""I'm not afraid of dying.""

""Then what?"" Corral challenged. ""Why would you make a move fit for such a coward?""

""I'm afraid of killing you.""

Corral hesitated. ""What?""

""Don't you see?"" Aufidia spread her arms, and Corral clenched her teeth. That would have been the perfect shot, if not for the incantation. ""We need each other.""

""*Need* each other?"" Corral was so surprised that she let out a loud laugh. ""We've been fighting opposite each other for ten years, now. How exactly do we *need* each other.""

""Ten years."" Aufidia nodded. ""You and I have been caught in a war for an entire decade. Is there anyone in your life that you've been so close with for anywhere close to ten years?""

""We are not close.""

Aufidia tilted her head to the side. ""We've been stripped of our powers and forced to wrestle on the ground of more than one field more times than I've heard someone invoke the name of God.""

""Fine. My parents,"" Corral replied. ""My sister."" But her eyes shifted slightly to the side, considering the idea for the first time.

""Besides your family,"" Aufidia clarified. ""Friends?"" She paused. ""A lover?""

""I don't have many friends. Mostly comrades."" Corral's eyebrows drew together over her dark eyes. ""Your people killed my last lover.""

""And yours killed all of my cousins,"" Aufidia told her. ""There is a lot of blood between us.""

""Then finish it,"" Corral hissed through her teeth. ""Why be afraid, if you have such faith in yourself to get the vengeance you seek?""

Aufidia shook her head, a smile spreading across her face. ""By my dagger, I do hate you. I hate you and everything your people stand for."" She took a step forward, and Corral tensed immediately. ""But every time I see you standing across from me on enemy lines, my heart beats out of my chest. Because in that moment, I know that I'm about to face down my rival. My equal. My greatest challenge. You might be the only thing left in my life to love.""

She lowered her dagger and tucked it back into her belt. ""Which is why I can't let you die. Not yet.""",LinneaGregg

"[WP] After generations of special programmes, humanity has become non-violent. You are a deviant capable of violence, living as a wolf among sheep until you meet another deviant and discover a violent world hidden from those who would crush it",Kancho_Ninja,"Tuesday Is for Gluttony

Tuesday is for gluttony. I received my daily pill – small, round, and gray for gluttony – and swallowed it offhandedly before breakfast. The daily pills were a part of everyday life, a casual ritual performed before the consumption of breakfast was allowed. Lifting up my tongue, I showed the Pill Carrier that I had indeed done my duty of swallowing the pill. Attempts to hide or reject the daily pill were considered the worst type of crime and were therefore severely punished. My parents and sister did likewise, silently opening wide, and satisfied, the Pill Carrier provided the food and left to deliver to the next house. 

At school, the History teacher lectures about the horrors of the Time Before, when all humans were subject to the whims of the seven sins. These base emotions – wrath, gluttony, greed, lust, pride, envy, and sloth – caused humans to lie, cheat and steal, to plunder and pillage, to murder and rape, and to blaspheme against God. It was a savage time before men became civilized. Now, because of the pills, which are administered daily, each day of the week corresponding to one of the seven sins, men can live together freely and in harmony. The Watchers now monitor the deliverance of the daily pills to every individual, remotely overseeing and maintaining the standard of peace. It is unknown exactly when or by whom the pills were developed, and at what point they were distributed en masse, but it is irrelevant. The people view this vague history with a devout acceptance, because of course mankind is better off with the pills. No longer is there competition, jealousy, or discord. No longer is there war or murder. No longer is there anyone who does not believe in the omniscient power and presence of God who grants this blissful existence. 

No longer is there much of anything. What emotions remain are basic and dulled, like the muting of bright sunlight with dark glasses that also somehow remove the warmth of the sun. Men have become shells who operate automatically without passion or satisfaction. They merely are, and they merely do, because it is for the continued betterment of mankind. 

Tuesday is for gluttony, but already I feel the effects dulling. Bored with the history lecture that is given every day, I let my mind wander as I subtly look around the classroom. Everyone else listens raptly as though it’s their first time hearing this version of events. Out of the corner of my eye, I see a swatch of bright red. Color is unusual here, limited to the elite upper class and worn as an expensive status symbol. It is said that too much color distracts and invites the return of the seven sins. The distribution of color is carefully measured and controlled, and I have only ever seen real blue once. My imagination has many times carried me to envision the colorful Time Before, when people wore bright clothes and bags, drove colorful cars that gleamed in the sun, and even dyed their hair to resemble rainbows. Dangerous thoughts, these, but I have always held a secret envy of these people despite the delivery of the green, square pill for envy every Thursday. I long to see the past in its colorful yet sinful splendor. I long to shrug off the gray veil that blocks my vision of the sun’s rays and the touch of its warmth. 

Although small, this red catches my eye, and it is vivid, bright, and alluring. Suddenly my mouth is dry and my heart pounds as a strange feeling of excitement courses throughout my body, and I can’t stop staring. Out of all the described colors, I have always held a particular fascination for red. Energy courses through my being, and time stands still. Suddenly I’ve lost focus on the teacher and the classroom, and the small spot of red grows and spreads to cover my entire field of vision. I’m filled with this exotic, striking color, and it takes the place of the gray. I feel alive and beautiful. A deep breath, and my body sparks in ways previously unknown as a tingling slowly unfurls from my belly and travels sensuously to my fingertips and toes. I reach within and I can feel passion, a deep longing to be fulfilled. I’m no longer in the classroom, part of a society that lives on fear and anxiety, but am free, floating with forbidden sensations. Then the boy wearing the spot of red shifts, and it’s all over. The connection is abruptly severed, and my body snaps, eyes blinking back into harsh focus. Gone are the vibrant sensations, the pulse of energy, the feelings of triumph and passion. What remains is a void, darker than the usual gray, and I mourn the loss. I shrink inside myself, feeling inexplicably small and vulnerable, and try to make sense of my experience. 

Finally recovering my composure, I observe that the teacher is nearing the end of the History lecture. She is discussing Berserkers, those who still retain the connection to the seven sins. They are deviant citizens to be feared and locked away, so they cannot disrupt the peace by reminding men of what they have forgotten. They are spoken about in hushed tones, with fear of being overheard and suspected, because the Watchers have ears everywhere. The daily pills do not work on a Berserker, making them difficult to find and even more difficult to confirm. As with every time the teacher talks about Berserkers, my gut tightens in anger, fear, and shame, and I struggle to maintain my façade of calm indifference. 

For the past several months, I have encountered foreign emotions that have lingered and taken hold of me. Some of them have slowly crawled inside me, making their way like thin strands in a spider web, nearly invisible but glimmering softly with a quiet strength, while others have announced themselves in a raucous boom, surprising and swallowing me in their harsh intensity. These emotions have weaved together to change me, and I am no longer living a life of only gray. Color has begun to leach into my world, supplanting the gray, and I find myself craving the next hit of sensation. I search restlessly with caged energy and suppressed aggression, withdrawing more and more from my citizen’s duties as I thirst for the addictive taste of these emotions. I have glimpsed what it is like to live in the Time Before, and there is no going back. 

But I am not safe, because the pills no longer eradicate the sins within me. I am now subject to the base desire of **lust**, which feels like a trickling, tingling sensation down my spine, slowly stroking alive every nerve ending in my body and settling heavily in my tightened stomach with a deep fire that throbs with need; of **sloth**, which dulls my mind and turns my muscles to solid stone, making me too tired and too uncaring to worry about my responsibilities and commitments; of **envy**, which hits me with a silent stab of longing that pierces and clenches my gut and crescendos into a single, overwhelming desire to seize what others have; of **pride**, which gives me a preoccupied confidence, knowing that I will succeed because I am superior to these people who lack emotions and colors; of **wrath**, which is an itchy burn from deep within, a small, annoying patch at first that grows and corrupts, spreading until I am changed into a darkness that wants to consume and destroy; of **greed**, which bubbles with inescapable desire to consume and possess, knowing that I will never be satisfied with enough but forced to manically long for more; of **gluttony**, which leaves my belly empty with painful cramps and my taste dissatisfied as previous delights turn to ash. 

Tuesday is for gluttony, and already the pill is useless to me. I have regressed to natural state of man, to those from the Time Before, to those with sin. I must keep this silent within me at all times, for that is my sin. 

I am a Berserker.

Serena had just wanted to give the cap one more quarter turn when the pliers had lost their grip. So instead of tightening it, she had effectively punched the cement surrounding the pool pump. 

She held back an oath to the Furies as she thought back to the ""deal"" she and Spencer had made. ""If you want a pool so much, you get to be in charge of it. Those things are just giant pits you dump money into."" Serena had not been able to tell him - to *explain* - how cold what he had said was. He didn't know the significance; it was unfair to judge him for it. But she did, anyway.

And now her knuckles were bleeding. 

She slipped back inside the house and went upstairs to the master bathroom. She looked in the medicine cabinet, the cupboards in the vanity, the random *other* cabinet that the previous owners had put over the toilet...because there's no risk of anything bad happening if you store stuff over a toilet.

No band-aids. Still bleeding. 

She told herself that it wasn't about the pain. It was impractical to go buy band-aids if she didn't need to. Plus it was at *least* a five minute drive, and...fossil fuels. This was definitely the green thing to do. 

She placed her left hand over her right and closed her eyes. *O Eir, make me whole* she intoned, and she felt her muscles seize up as the power of her great-aunt flooded her body. Warmth radiated from her hand and the she could perceiving the divine light even with her eyes shut. 

""Um...honey? What...what was that?"" 

*Shit.*

Whirling, she locked eyes with Spencer, whose jaw was hanging loose. He was blinking more than usual. 

""Rena?""

Serena closed her eyes again. Somehow, the look of utter bewilderment on his face was making her angry. She gave a massive sigh and said ""Why don't we sit down?"" 

""Yes,"" he responded, his voice cool. ""Lets do."" 

One of the veins in Serena's temple was beginning to throb. She knew it wasn't right, that he had a *right* to be upset, but still...he didn't have to be such a jerk about it. 

""My hand's fine, by the way."" 

""What? What are you --"" 

""I cut it when I was putting the cap back on the pool filter. It's fine now.""

She held her right hand up for him to see. Spencer stared at her. ""Are you...are you mad at me because I didn't ask you about an injury I didn't know you had and now...somehow...no longer exists? Is *that* what's happening right now?"" 

Serena studied her yoga pants. Without really meaning to, she began humming. It was soft, and she made sure to keep her mouth shut, but it was definitely audible to Spencer.

Spencer rubbed his nose, studying Serena's face. ""Let me just say...I'm sorry you got hurt. And I'm glad you're feeling better. And I'd really love to know more about why.""

Serena stopped humming and forced a smile. She added another mental hash-mark to the tally of times she'd manipulated him with her powers and briefly wondered if there would ever be a chance to make it up to him. 

She took a deep breath. ""Let's say - just for the sake of argument - that I had, I dunno, powers. Like, the magic kind of powers. And let's also say that I am not, in the strictest definition, um, human. Very much humanoid, and I should add that a *lot* of the plumbing and everything is the same, and...all. But say that's what I was."" Serena broke off, looking back down again. She started picking at invisible lint on her pants. ""What...would you say to that?"" she added quietly. 

Serena could tell he was staring at her, but she refused to look up until he answered the question. She could hear the blood circulating in her veins, her almost-human heart pumping the liquid through her body, keeping her alive. 

As the silence dragged on, Serena resisted the urge to begin humming again. Like all of the pivotal moments in their relationship, it was crucial that this one be untainted. She knew how doubt would prey on her if she didn't let him respond naturally. 

""I...I love you. It's...on the list of major secrets you can keep from your spouse, I feel like this is way up there. *Way* up there. But...wait."" 

Serena felt like her heart had just leaped off a cliff, plunging into the pounding surf below.

""So - you're an...alien, right?"" 

Serena gave her first genuine smile since the conversation had started and looked up at Spencer. ""No! An...aliens aren't real!"" 

Spencer's brows nearly jumped off the top of his forehead. ""Oh, I'm sorry, are we going to play a game of 'what is and isn't silly to believe' with my magical non-human wife?""

Serena chuckled quietly. ""Touche, Spence. Anyway, *no*. I am not an alien.""

Spencer frowned. ""A demon, then? Oh, God, I'm so stupid!"" He smacked himself on the side of the head. ""Of course you are - you're a succubus! That's...that has to be it, right?""

Serena laughed this time, and inched her chair a little closer to Spencer's. ""My love...no. I am not a succubus or any other kind of demon. But you get, like, 10 million husband points for saying it. Especially for how sincere you seemed."" 

""Rena, I'd think you were messing with me if I hadn't seen you...do...whatever you did. And if...oh, God. Are you a robot? That's why you made that weird crack about your plumbing, isn't it?"" 

""What have I told you about talking about my plumber's crack?"" 

""Rena."" 

""Sorry, sorry. No. I am not a robot. Bleep blorp."" 

As Spencer's jaw sets and he squints at Serena, she realizes she has miscalculated. 

""I want to change my previous statement about loving you."" 

""No, too late. Can't do it.""

""I don't even know what you are!"" 

""Sucker!"" 

Spencer stands up and begins walking silently to the door of the bedroom. Serena calls after him. 

""Spence, wait! I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that. I just really want to get us back to...*us.* Comfortable, playful, loving. But I'm being really unfair to you and so...” She took another deep breath, brushing a lock of hair behind her ear. “I am an elf. And a siren.""

Spencer wrinkles his nose. ""That's not funny."" 

Serena's head cocks to one side, her honey-blonde hair spilling past her shoulder. ""What isn't?"" 

""You're part *siren*?"" 

""Yes. And part elf.""

""So your mom was an elf, and your dad was...what, an ambulance? A fire truck? C'mon, Rena."" 

""You...you've never heard of a siren before?"" 

""I just told you. What are you --"" 

""No. From *The Odyssey*, the mythological creatures of the sea that sang men to their...""

Spencer's face darkens. ""To their what?""

""Anyway, my dad was the elf. My mom was the siren. They met in the Mediterranean."" 

""I'm honestly not sure how much of this to believe at this point."" 

""Her name was Anala. His name was Fullen. He came from the north. Sea-faring, and all that. They met on - well, near - Cyprus.""

""Okay. Let's say I believe all that. What can the daughter of an elf and a police car --"" 

""-- Spence!""

""Fine, a 'siren', do? And how come you haven't already been doing it? Why do we still have a mortgage?""

""I'll answer your questions but...can I just get a hug real quick?""

""You're not going to turn me into a lizard or something, are you?""

""Don't you think I would have already done it if I wanted to turn you into a lizard?"" 

""Listen, lady. Or...nearly-lady. You've still got a lot to answer for.""

""Fair enough. But can I? Please?""

""Okay...no funny business, though."" 

Serena stands as Spencer walks over to her and they embrace. 

""Thank you. That's so much better. Now...where do I begin?""

They say they're willing to keep your secret if they meet your parents""",KingDomPanda,"“Joshua! What is happening?!” Jen yelled out as she walked in the door. Everything fell to the floor as I froze in fear, I had gone my entire life with out anyone seeing my powers, aside from my parents that is, and now my human girlfriend has clearly seen me using one of them. 

Maybe I should give some backstory. I was born in 1992 to my parents Gerald and Kathryn. Obviously those weren’t their real names, being thousands of years old they had to change their names every once and awhile. My parents true names are Barachiel and Azazel, yes, as in angels. Many years ago they made the decision to live on earth with humans. Then, 207 years later, I was born. 

“Josh... what are you doing?” She persisted. I just stood there, unable to move, I’d hidden my abilities for 26 years. Finally I formed words from the dry desert my mouth had suddenly become. “Jen I can explain” I said quickly as I got a rush of nervousness for the 10th in under a minute. 

Over the course of 2 hours, and many MANY questions, I told my story. I explained my parents and my angelic background, the powers and things I could do. She finally understood why I’d never been majorly hurt, nor had I been sick, or how I could lift things much heavier than someone of my stature should be capable of picking up. She stared at me in awe, in disbelief,  of my life. 

I didn’t hear much from Jen for a couple days. I figured she just needed some time to take in what I’d told her. On the third day, yes I waited 3 days as it’s the golden rule of heaven, I called her and inquired as to how she was feeling about everything. 

“Hey babe, I just wanted to see how you’re doing with everything? I know that was a lot to take in.”

“I’m doing ok... I think. I just don’t know why it took you so long to tell me? It’s ONLY been 3 years since we started dating, and we knew each other much longer.”

“I’m sorry... I guess there’s one more thing I should tell you.”

“Joshua? What is it?”

“My parents... they aren’t... um... dead... I lied” I confessed. 

“WHAT OMG JOSH CAN I MEET THEM PLEASE?!” She screamed into the phone. 

I didn’t even have a chance to respond between that and the next sentence

“Josh there’s something i need to confess as well... promise you won’t be mad?” 

“Sure! There’s no way it could be as impactful as what I just told you. What is it babe?”

“Well... I also have a secret about my parents... well you see? My mom, she’s human, yes... but my dad? He’s um... um...”

There was a long pause. I could almost feel the tension within her.

"[WP] Crimes can only be committed in the dark. People always keep their lights on for protection. One night, a power outage occurs.",Marioman2769,"Alleria was a beautiful place. Sunny during the day, brightly lit at night. It was a peaceful place, and the crime rate had been at an all time low. In fact, there had been no crime at all. Alleria boasted its ideal, futuristic strategies in making itself the best city in the world.

Some people say that the city harbors a dark secret. The city had clear and strict laws, and the consequences were made clear to anyone who broke them. However, there has been speculation on just how feasible it would be to break the rules that were meant to be followed. Evidence suggests that the reason for the city’s well being is its light. Has there ever been a crime under the light? 

A power outage causes chaos in any place, however Alleria suffered more. One day the city lost its light. Conspiracy theorists elicited panic, people began to wonder if they would survive to see the next day. 

It lasted four hours. There were conflicting accounts on what actually happened. Some people stated that the city sunk into chaos. For hours, the city was ruled by people who only wanted to cause harm. There was violence in the streets and many people chose to stay indoors in fear. For some people, this was normal. The city had many places to hide.

Yet others stated that Alleria was a wonderful place with people they trusted. They had spent years building relationships with these people and knew that they could never be criminals. Perhaps the light had nothing to do with it, and Alleria was simply an amazing place to be. 

Or perhaps there was more to the city than meets the eye.

"[WP] Crimes can only be committed in the dark. People always keep their lights on for protection. One night, a power outage occurs.",Marioman2769,"Candles were a precious commodity in the land of Lux. The realm had a magical seal of protection that blinded anyone who was bathed in light and sought to do others harm, be it direct or indirect, physical or mental.

Of course, this resulted in these wax sticks turning into a precious commodity. Only the rich could afford to illuminate every corner of their estate to defend it, while the poor had to build their own and defend only a small portion of their land.

In due time, Lux had advanced to keep up with the modern age. While magic had faded over time, the protective seal over the country never left. What was once considered the best way to ward off criminals had been corrupted into a practice to improve one's ""luck,"" as knowledge of the seal faded from common knowledge. The people grew complacent, and kept their lights on except to sleep.

One day, the lights went out.

At first, crimes were subtle. Mobsters took the time to engage in more unscrupulous activites, and belligerent defaced buildings with graffiti. Eventually, however, things descended into complete hell, with felons of all kinds assaulting the cities of Lux. Even worse, there was minimal police presence due to the excessive lack of crime. The city's leaders came together, demanding a solution.

In due time, they discovered the protective seal guarding the realm, and quickly came to the conclusion that the answer was, once again, candles. The government quickly collapsed at the feet of the few candlemakers left in the land, and the balance of power quickly shifted to them as the guardians of the land.

I refuse to disclose my identity, as my rivals would quickly end my business if I did. Regardless, take my tale with immense caution, and remember this...

There are more protective barriers out there just like the one in Lux, and the countries who do not heed my warning will collapse the very moment their power grid fails. When it all goes to hell, the candlemakers will rule over the remnants of the empires, as they will be able to dictate who will live and who will die at the hands of felons.

Now please, won't you buy a few candles? They're top quality, and will last for a week before you need another one. I'll even cut you a deal and sell you two $600 ones for the price of one.",blakzer

[WP] a Chemist gets sent back in time and uses his scientific knowledge to become a wizard,TAKoturtle22,"Well, fuck. One minute, I was sitting in my warm lab, lab coat on, idly on reddit while my analysis completes, then……whatever this is. Heaven, I guess? I never thought heaven would be boggy. Or I’d keep my clothes. Or, you know, exist. I can only assume I was electrocuted- my machine has been making funny noises all day. Still, not much to do now but find a point of interest, I guess. There’s a plume of smoke over that hilltop, perhaps a village?

I have to say I’m incredibly glad I studied Shakespeare. Or shaksper. Or shakspere. Or however he is spelling it these days. From my best guess I’m in a small, grimy port town in eastern England, sometime around 1600. From my arrival two days ago, I’d say it’s been….challenging. I understand the locals enough to get what I need, but pretending to be a nobleman, with my strange clothes and stranger accent, was never going to gain me much. Simple exploring has it’s novelty, but a lab coat isn’t very warm, waterproof, or even practical.

Finding the apothecary was a stroke of luck. Sure, they must use some insane methods, but I can at least live this way. I proved my worth to the owner by purifying salicylic acid- aspirin- from willow leaves- a simple extraction, yet the convenience of a pill eclipses the hassle, taste and expiry of chewing a willow bark, the current medical solution. I think I could do well here.

‘Discovering’ electricity generation was an excellent step forward for my plans. A simple waterwheel was repurposed from grinding wheat- my pharmacist employer knows well enough not to doubt any plans I have, and to provide some capital- it’s the least he can do, after my ‘aspirin’ became so lucrative with nobles. I’ve began to use electrochemistry- I think the people around here will love aluminium. 

Electrochemistry was a great success. Not only have I purified aluminium from alum, I’ve also managed to split water- I’m bottling the oxygen for sale in London- ‘purest air’ we’re marketing it as. I’m now a 50% owner in the apothecary, and spend my days in the back yard, ‘discovering’ saleable products, and training a small army of workers to create them. It’s not a bad life. You never know, perhaps I may even try and put together some fireworks to celebrate a year here. 

As the last rocket fired off into the midnight air, bursting with a green flame (copper, I thought happily) I’m suddenly aware of the hill behind me brightening, with what appears to be torches. It seems the town has come out to see my display. Strange as it seems, I’m kind of falling on love with it here- so much simpler, no internet, no car tax, just what I can provide and work for. They’re even chanting- their words lost in the wind as they come closer. I walk forwards, arms outstretched. Yes, my people.

4 walls, strangers to me
Cold and flat,

Beside me my reflections
All are as foreign as my walls.

I cannot move but observe,
Possibility and Past,
Present but Parroted,
I see all that could be of me

Which one am I though,
Surely here are those more impressive than I
And more wicked as well?
Where do I lie in a sea of my own eyes?

Every possibility frowning at me for failing
Or enviously glaring for who I am
I am neither the best nor the worst
Of this I'm sure,

"[WP] A time traveller attempts to explore the far future, only to be intercepted and trapped in a time prison. The rest of the prison happens to be populated by the countless recursive instances of a single time traveller's attempts to break themself free.",Therandomfox,"The Chronological Penitentiary of the Federal Timekeeping Agency is not an ordinary prison. Covertly located somewhere in space and somewhen in time, it houses those criminals who, in reckless defiance of established law, breach the International Convention on Time Travel, signed and ratified by all countries represented in the General Assembly of the United Nations.

Those rules had been simultaneously set since the beginning and end of times: unrestricted travel was to be permitted to all until the year 3084; only accredited and approved travelers were permited to cross the temporal barrier. I was one of those criminals who broke the rules. Me, Jack Morris, nineteen, on my third travel outside the chains of the present, walked the line and crossed it. Before me, promptly warned by their future selves, awaited two Federal Agents, who gently took me in handcuffs to that peculiar establishment. What they told me on the way was as fascinating as it was haunting.

The jail was fully occupied by the same individual. Someone who once crossed the barrier and was left to rescue himself. At last count prison officials estimated over one thousand three hundred versions of the same prisoner in the cells and holding blocks of the Penitentiary. Every day a new version arrived, sometimes a young man, athletic and brave, doomed to fail before the advanced warning of the officials; others, a frail but cunning elder, inevitably equally unsuccessful in his breakout attempt of one thousand three hundred versions of himself. For all I knew, I was the first fresh face to arrive at the prison for a very long time. Then again, time travel does put into question the concept of ""long time"".

I was left in solitary confinement for a while. Days, weeks, months, I can't say. Only when seemed my age had seemed to double inside that small cube was I allowed into general population. A particularly nasty guard took me to my cell and showed me the lower bunk bed. Above it slept a middle-aged man, gray hair combed in a familiar style.

A small tag on his uniform neatly indicated the name of the sleeper, the man who would be sharing my cell, who shared every cell in every block in this prison of time -- *J. MORRIS*.

"[WP] A time traveller attempts to explore the far future, only to be intercepted and trapped in a time prison. The rest of the prison happens to be populated by the countless recursive instances of a single time traveller's attempts to break themself free.",Therandomfox,"It should’ve been easy. I had gone over the calculations a million times. A simple jump to the future and a quick look around, tour a couple cities maybe... nothing should have gone wrong. Ah, I should’ve known better. The words easy and time travel never ought to belong in the same sentence. Just as I was entering the time stream, I remember someone grabbing my wrist. I had turned to see a man clad in black, with sharp green eyes glinting behind a metallic mask drawn tight around his face, and a brilliant flash of red light. I’m not sure how long it had been since I saw that man. It could’ve been hours. Days, weeks even.

I looked down at my wrist. My watch was still strapped tight around it. A beautiful contraption, designed in the antique style with old-fashioned watch hands and a face typed with Roman numerals. However, I knew that the face was only a facade for the wonderfully complex circuitry that existed beneath it, that allowed me to jump to past and future in the blink of an eye. But something was wrong with it. The watch hands were spinning in circles. Over and over, unceasingly. Like they were lost.

I glanced around the room. It was white all around, from floor to walls to ceiling. Maybe ten feet square, furnished with a bed, bath, toilet, and sink. Not too bad as prisons go. But still definitely a prison. Well. I considered my options. My watch was acting strangely, but I was still relatively sure I could escape whenever I wanted, turn the dials back and jump right back to the present. But I wanted to know who trapped me here. If it was some kind of government authority, I didn’t want to be branded as some kind of interdimensional convict who broke out of jail. So the plan, at least for now, was to wait. I sighed and sat back on my bed.

A heavy hand clapped suddenly onto my shoulder, and I jumped and whirled around, staring straight into a pair of hauntingly familiar green eyes behind a silver mask.

“It's you!” I made a move to grab his wrist and an unseen force pushed me back, slamming me against the wall on the other side of the room.

“Don’t resist, Prisoner 444,” the man said. “You’ll only make things worse for yourself.” His voice was a bit muffled behind the mask, but also vaguely familiar.

“Where am I?"" I gasped as I struggled to my feet. ""And who are you?""

“I am the Warden,” he said simply. “This is my prison, the Time Well, where we send violators of interdimensional law. Do you know why you're here?""

“I... I uh, I'm afraid not, Warden,” I said. I decided to pick my next words carefully. “I’m sorry. I wasn’t aware of any of these, uh, interdimensional laws as you call them. You see, I’m from the present, MY present, the year 2018. And as far as I know, I’m the first time traveller, ever. My only goal was merely to complete a pioneering expedition, if you will, take a quick look-see around Future Land. I wasn’t going to talk to anyone, or break anything. I don’t see what could've happened.”

""The ignorance,"" the Warden sighed. ""The consequences are substantial, and almost limitless. A single wrong step and you would have created innumerable timelines. And I’m not just talking about the consequences to the world around you, but your own body as well."" He leaned back against the wall and sighed.

""Time travelling does strange things to people. The physical body was not meant to travel as you do, so carelessly through time and space. And your mind... ah, that is probably the most frightening part of all. Time travel *destroys* your mind. Every time you step out of the time stream, you change. You lose another piece of yourself, of what makes you human. Because you are forcing your mind to comprehend a reality it was never meant to understand, to make sense of an impossible situation, to- “

“Alright!” I interrupted, clapping my hands. “Thank you, kind Warden, for your concerns. But I really don’t feel like listening, and I don't feel like staying here, so I think I’ll make my way back, if you'll excuse me. Thanks for the conversation, and see you in perhaps three thousand years or so, yes?”

He didn’t say anything, but his eyes seemed to crinkle into a little smirk as I turned back the dials on my watch, forcing the spinning hands to stop and reverse direction. I should’ve known something was wrong then. But the world spun and blurred, the air seeming to crack as I tore open a rip in space and time. I leaped through and shouted triumphantly. I turned, expecting to feel the warm sun and a cool breeze on my face, but instead stared straight into the lightly amused eyes of a man in a silver mask.

“What the hell?” I gasped. “How…?”

“Welcome back, Prisoner 444."" He paused, then corrected himself. ""Ah, my mistake, I mean 445. Good to see you again.”

“How… how is this possible?” I whirled around, taking in the same white walls, the ceiling, the floor, in bewilderment.

“You should listen to your timepiece,” he chided. “It’s trying to tell you something.” I paused and looked down at my wrist. The hands on my watch were spinning in circles again.

“What does this mean?” I demanded.

“It *means* this place is timeless. A closed loop that you can’t escape from. And believe me, you have tried. Over 400 times, in fact.""

“I- I what?!"" My heart jumped in my chest. ""I’ve been here over 400 times?”

“Well, this version of yourself has been here *445* times now, to be exact,"" said the Warden. ""But *you* have been trapped here actually a trillion different times now.""

""*ONE TRILLION?*""

""Yes,"" he said, his voice very matter-of-fact. ""You are quite persistent. Here, take a look.” He produced a remote from his sleeve and pressed a button, and the walls around me flickered and turned transparent as glass. And now I could see the true sheer scale of the prison. Rows and rows of white-walled cells just like mine, lined endlessly down countless corridors. And inside each cell… was me. Different versions of myself. Most of them sat on their beds with heads bowed, but some of them paced the floor, still others frantically pounded the walls, yelling unintelligibly. They rolled across the floor, at times laughing hysterically, which quickly turned to desperate sobbing.

“Those…” The Warden pointed to the versions of myself that were yelling and crying out. “We call those the Millionths. The ones that have been caught in this recursive loop for millions of iterations. If you didn’t believe me about the mental toll that time travel takes on people, you should now. Their sanities have been long gone.”

I turned back to the Warden in horror. My knees felt weak.

“This is insane,” I spat. “How can you possibly have room for literally a trillion people?”

“Ah. The Time Well is not only timeless but infinitely expansive."" He shrugged. ""There will always be another room for whenever another version of yourself tries to escape via time travel. And they only get crazier each time, believe me. You are only the 445th one, so by comparison, you are actually relatively sane.”

“No,” I hissed. I took a step toward him. “No, no, no. *You're* the one who's insane, for trapping me, for trapping all of us, in here for all this time. It takes someone seriously demented to be actually okay with... with violating possibly every basic human right. Where's your humanity? You’re sick!” I yelled, slowly advancing as he backed up against the wall. “You’re the craziest of them all!”

Before he could react, I shoved the Warden against the wall, pinning my forearm up under his throat. With my free hand, I reached for his mask and tore it away. And what I saw made me fall to my knees with horror.

I stared back at my own face. Those hauntingly familiar eyes were my own. My hair was streaked with silver, my face marked with scars, but it was like looking in a mirror.

“You’re absolutely right,” said the Warden, grinning fiercely. “I am quite possibly the craziest of them all."" He threw back his head and laughed. It was high and clear and mirthless.

""See, all traces of empathy were splintered from my mind as I entered the time stream again and again trying to escape this hellhole. So yes, I feel nothing when I see the suffering I inflict upon millions, billions, of people. Ah... I was like you once. Hell, I *was* you once, at some point. And you will be me. But look, I finally wore down the timepiece.” He held up his wrist and pulled back his sleeve, and now I could see that the hands on his watch were not constantly spinning like mine. They weren’t moving at all.

“And so the recursive loop ends with me. I am the last. The last version of you stuck in here.” He smiled, but there wasn’t a trace of warmth or emotion in his, in my, eyes. “*I* am the trillionth iteration.”",kinspira

""What's not to get mate, aren't you a time traveler yourself?"" - The guy sitting in the cell numbered 3212 replied in his thick British accent.

""Yeah, but this is the first time I've ever been here. What is...""

""Ahh, you're thinking we're his future selves aren't you?"" - the smart Ken replies while letting out a slight smile on his face as if he knew I was going to ask that exact question - ""We are actually his past selves, so we exist before he got put in prison""

""Then how do you know to come here and rescue him if you have never been captured before?""

""Of course, of course"" - Again, smart Ken slightly smile but this time it looks more like a smirk - ""You see, Ken #1 has been in here for so long, he had all the time to learn to create a tiny wormhole under his bed in the jail cell...""

Now this peak my interest, a small wormhole huh.

""Problem is: the wormhole is so small, anything bigger than the size of your thumb would not be able to get through."" - Smart Ken continues - ""So what he did was sending out small notes to his past self, instructing them to come rescue him""

""How did he make a wormhole?""

""Well, you're gonna have to ask him that yourself hah. Even I wouldn't know the answer to that"" - smart Ken laughed out loud admitting his defeat.

""Can't you ask him?""

""Mate, you think making a wormhole is as easy as making your morning cup of tea?"" - this time, the rude Ken answered

""He's right."" - the nice Ken chimes in - ""It's too complicated to be taught just by words through this whole chain of jail cells""

""Yes yes, the information would get lost through too many middleman in this process"" - Smart Ken continue - ""Besides, you really only need 1 wormhole to send the notes out.""

""If you only send out one note, how can there be thousands versions of you here? Shouldn't there be only 1 other version of you here? The one that receive the note from #1?""

""This bloody wanker!"" - rude Ken yells out in frustration - ""do you ever think before you speak?""

""Just ignore him"" - nice Ken replies - ""every time we fail, we write down our experience in another note and pass it down this hallway cell-to-cell to #1 and have to send it out through the worm hole""

""In fact, #3212's note just got sent out 15 minutes before you arrive here"" - smart Ken smile at me as he continue - ""we are bound to break out of this place one day""

""Can you guys send out a note to anyone?""

""Of course we can, just write a note that is personal to you so that your past selves would recognize it is from their future selves"" - smart Ken face lit up like he has accomplished something even tho he's just another pawn in this whole process. Ken #1 is the one that created all this work after all - ""Then attach it with a piece of hair for DNA processing and tell us the exact time, down to the minutes. Here are some paper and a pen I got before I got captured here, you can have it""

Until I can create my own worm hole, this is the only way out of here. I scribble quickly on the notes instructing myself how to get here to rescue me along with a piece of my hair and gave them all to smart Ken

""alright, this is good"" - smart Ken replies as he pass those thing down to #3210, and then #3209, and...

"[WP] A time traveller attempts to explore the far future, only to be intercepted and trapped in a time prison. The rest of the prison happens to be populated by the countless recursive instances of a single time traveller's attempts to break themself free.",Therandomfox,"There is something truly exhilerating about time travel that simply cannot be explained through words. It is unlike the sudden helplessness we feel as the wind wraps about us and we fall during a sky dive, or the racing heart a moment before placing a ring on the finger of our loved one.

I felt myself *be,* but without form, I felt myself become one with all the was, and will be, yet my existence was but a null that slipped between the cracks of reality and disappeared forever.

I did it for science. I did it to quench my thirst for never-ending curiosity, travelling, not to the ends of the world, but to the end of time and beyond, feeling my broken down form become a part of the stream which is all that is life, nothing more than data in the vast cosmos of life.

Yet my ethereal transmogrification came to an abrupt and grinding halt. As if avulsed from the stream of time, I found myself trapped in a place without reality, like a fish I was torn from the straight path of my waters, from my home, and now placed without a single barrel of water, swimming in circles for all time.

I use the term 'time' loosely, for I had learnt that it did not exist in whatever plain I found myself. I could not comprehend whether a day had passed, or a year. The concept failed me and even my watch stopped its ticking, as if the trip had caused it to forget the only thing thing it was meant to do.

I was not alone in this nether, an endless abyss devoid of sky or ground, my surrounding painted with the endless stream of the universe, nebula's hanging about me like the view from a window.

""Who are you?"" I asked, and all of them, numbering in the hundreds -if not thousands- answered. ""I don't know.""

The voice of a thousand shared with my their tale, at least, as much as they could still remember, the occasional one having to struggle to recall the scant detail of their memory, only to have them helped out by another.

They were lost, just as I was, and though time was a concept that seemed already alien to me, I had no doubt in my mind that this individual was trapped for a while that would have been immeasurable anyway.

Each time, he tried to escape, and each time a new version of him was in stasis, effectively cloning himself over and over. Creating paradoxical anomalies all across this space.

""Trapped.""

""Yes, trapped we are.""

""Where was I going again?""

""Ah, yes.""

""Wait... no.""

They all spoke, erratically, confused, as if a haze drifted over their minds, each voice deliberating to itself and to each other. It reminded me of a brain, a mass collaboration of neurons firing simultaneously and each voicing itself as if it were a consciousness deep in thought.

I could not help but wonder, would I turn out just like that? Only time would tell, and as fate would have it, the first of *me* began to appear, each more deranged than the last.",kinpsychosis
"[WP] A time traveller attempts to explore the far future, only to be intercepted and trapped in a time prison. The rest of the prison happens to be populated by the countless recursive instances of a single time traveller's attempts to break themself free.",Therandomfox,"The writhing tendrils of reality snake their way across the abyss, more *alive* than they have any right to be. *Un*light dances in the darkness, hellish aurorae setting the void ablaze, yet the black is not dispelled. Nothing is brighted. Nothing but the abyss, and the filamentous cords that define past, present, and future.

They squirm under my gaze, eldritch abominations driven into a frenzy by a mere mortal.

Time is not a concept that exists here, but I can tell they've never faced my kind. I cannot tell when I entered this domain, I cannot tell how long I have wandered the abyss. All I know is that I must reach my target. 

A pinprick of light brights the void, and I grope my way towards it, guided by the Skip. Reality watches me warily. Frenzied strands recoil from my touch, revolted by my mere presence and the blasphemy it entails.
I give them no thought. I have a destination, and I must move forward.

The portal inches closer.

Inquisitive filaments extend their grasp towards me, seemingly having overcome their initial aversion, wild oscillations racing down their ends. I ignore them, focusing on the portal.

A strand seizes me, terror igniting in my mind as the writhing abomination wraps itself around, ripping me from the Skip. I am tossed into the void with careless abandon, the Skip rapidly gaining distance. 

I scream into the black, horrific realization gaining on me that I might never be able to return, never be able to leave, *why did I even think this was a good idea in the first place?*

I hear nothing.

Panic explodes, and I flail uncontrollably, trying anything, *anything,* to try and get back to the Skip, now just a speck in the distance.

Nothing.

I peer into the abyss, squinting to catch sight of the Skip.

The abyss gazes back. 

""Hi!"" It says, in a voice that is entirely too cheerful.

""I'm Kyle. Are you stuck here too?""

"[WP] A time traveller attempts to explore the far future, only to be intercepted and trapped in a time prison. The rest of the prison happens to be populated by the countless recursive instances of a single time traveller's attempts to break themself free.",Therandomfox,"Ralph had tried talking to himself on the phone to warn the earlier version of himself to not go to the time he was currently in and, thus, cause himself to have to warn himself in the first place. You may think this would have created a paradox but two startling truths prevented this. The first being that paradoxes can not exist - that is not how time works. It all just fits together like a jigsaw and anything that has happened will happen and vice versa.  The second is that you should never talk to yourself on the telephone. Imagine how it would go. Hello Ralph, its yourself - Ralph. You would just put the phone down. 

Now an infinite number of instances of Ralph, and it was just Ralph as he had no surname, was in the same place - and had arrived at exactly the same time - as he was. 

That place was not a nice place to be. It was the worse prison in time. Over all of time and space it was the worse. It wasn't at all squalid or bleak. There was plenty of tea and plenty of pizza. 

It was the infinite number of instance of the person names Ralph. They had arrived trying to remove the first instance of Ralph from the prison. They all arrived at the same time - though time has little meaning in an universe where there is time travel - and that caused them all to be arrested and placed into the prison. 

And when two instances of the same person talk to each other it is frighteningly frightening. It is had to describe in the English language. That is any conventional language. 

The people of the planet escobar delta 34  can describe it but of course it is not translatable. 

With the infinite instances of Ralph safely locked in the prision and having a agonising time there was no possibility of him breaking himself out. 

But the infinitly improbable - and thus absolutely certain - happened.  The prison disappeared. 

This is the story of how an infinite number of instances of Ralph appeared in an infinite number of locations around the whole of the infinite universe. As the number of Ralph's are just infinite while the space of the universe is infinite infinite then there is a 0% chance you will meet Ralph.

As we have previously ascertained the infinitely improbable is absolutely certain. So when you meet Ralph at some place in the universe make you say hi. 

Oh, and Ralph is not human. He is a pineapple.

Behind me, the shape on the makeshift bed stirred.

""MMMmhhhamm"", it said.

""Abs. You awake?""

""Yeah."" Abby sat up, dark ringlets, dark eyes, and after a seconds pause a dark scowl. ""Wait. Last night at the party. Did I tell your Mum to get f-""

""Yeah, yeah you did do that.""

""Oh my god. Jeez. Oh my god.""

""Abby. I don't think that's my main concern right now.""

""You feeling rough too?""

""Yeah, also that, but no. I think we've been kidnapped, or are in a reality show or something. Look around.""

Abby looked around the room. It was nondescript, sort of cream in colour as well as design. It was clearly not our flat.

I tried to bring her up to speed with what I remembered. Borrowing a phone from that guy outside the party, calling himself Perfect maybe? Then all the crazy.

""Oh shit!"", she said, catching up. ""Yeah, some hidden camera thing right? Huge spaceship, we watched the world explode.""

""Yeah, I reckon Space Noah has a Twitch channel, spacing out drunks.""

Abby dragged herself to her feet. ""What a day. That's just what I need. Video of drunk me being an absolute div, after I pissed off the family as well. You seen any of the producers yet?""

""Nah, nothing. I'm not shouting for them. Screw 'em. I'm getting back in bed to wait.""

We did not have to wait long. A seam of light appeared in the wall in the corner of the room and a section of the wall melted away. 'Space Noah' strode into the room. A 6ft tornado of fabulous, white beard, shining robes. 

""And how are my two lovebirds this morning?""

""Your door's more impressive than your outfit"", came from the Abby side of the bed.

""Yeah what the shit, dude? You locked us up? When can we go home?"" I added.

'Space Noah' floundered slightly. This was clearly not what he was expecting. He composed himself, and beamed at us again.

""Ah, shock. You are blocking it out. Nevermind. I'll fix us a drink. Follow me when you're ready"". With that he turned on his heel and strode back through the opening.

We helped each other up and followed him. As I walked through the door I looked closely at the edges. No obvious hinges or compartments or anything. Like the wall was never there.

""Woah"", said Abby as her eyes adjusted to the light. The room appeared to be vast, curving down from where we stood towards a giant expanse of stars. There must be some sort of screen, but it appeared like we could just walk off into space.

""Are we at the Imax?"", I asked the back of our host, who appeared to be making cocktails at a drinks trolley, the only obvious feature in the whole huge space.

""I have no idea what you are talking about, 'Two By'"", our host said with a grin. ""We are holding position about a parsec from the wreckage of your world. You are welcome by the way!"" He beamed again and handed us both a drink. ""Its my own recipe. Try it!""

We took the drinks. I held it to my head, it was cold at least.

""I'm not drinking anything, thanks. I just wanted an Uber, not this shit. Who are you anyway? Should I have seen you on TV?""

""Ha! You saw through 'Space Noah' huh? Yeah I just thought it would be easier to talk in the terms you guys all seem to believe in. God and that. The flood. Easier than explaining intergalactic construction and demolition to a couple of borderline chimps."" He raised his glass and took a big slurp. ""No offence.""

""Alright. Enough. I'm a hungover non-celebrity. Get me out of here, or whatever"", Abby interjected. She took a couple of steps towards Space Noah.

Suddenly she froze. Her body began to float in the air ever so slightly, like a soap bubble on the breeze.

""Whoa, whoa, whoa. Steady on there 'Two'. Save your energy for the noble task! You and 'Two By' over there have got a job to do"".

My face was as blank as my jaw was slack. Space Noah stepped away from the trolley, which promptly flowed back into the floor.

""Yeah, I'm not really called Noah. I'm just on the run right now, or maybe I'm on the run in the future. I'm a little confused about the timeline. But a nom de plume seemed like a good idea"". He took another big swig of his drink. ""Mmm, bit too much Janx spirit. Anywho, I'm not him, but this is sort of an Ark, and you two lucky lovebirds are going to rebuild the human race.""

""Rebuild the what now? We are Brother and Sister, dumbass!"" Abby said from above.

Noah looked pale. ""But you were arguing with your respective parents. That's why I picked you up instead of just flying by when I saw the Thumb signal. No close ties, fresh start. A chance for me to be the God to a new human race!""

""You saw us with both our respective Mums. Arguing because things had not gone well at *OUR DADS* BIRTHDAY!""

Noah looked sheepish.""Well, shit. That's awkward."" He stuck out his hand and beamed that huge fabulous smile again. ""Lets start over, my name is Beeblebrox, Zaphod Beeblebrox.""

'Don't look like a spaceship, Marv. A bloody garage is what it looks like.'

'Hey... do you remember the driver, by any chance?'

[CW] Write something that contains the following sentence: He must've cleaned house before we got here.,_TheInverse_,"""Mr. Martinez do you have any statements to make regarding your readiness to re-enter society?"" An older, female doctor stared at Mr. Martinez across the table. She was one of three reviewers considering whether the young, disheveled man was stable enough to leave the asylum where he spent the last five years of his life. Jorge Martinez scratched at the stubble growing back on his shaved head.



""I'm not a danger to anyone."" Jorge said while staring at the ground.



""The orderlies you've attacked for cleaning your room would disagree,"" the woman said. The other two board members nodded, but did not add anything to the conversation. 



""I'm not dangerous, I need my mess. It protects me."" One of the men on the board chuckled while the woman flipped through Jorge's file.  



""From the... Cleaning Monster?"" Jorge nodded with a sigh. 



""Mr. Martinez the truth is this facility is full. I believe you're no danger to anyone else,"" she chuckled. ""As long as no one tries to clean your house."" She stamped his paperwork. ""Congratulations Mr. Martinez. We are granting your release."" Mr. Martinez smiled.



""Thank you!"" He stood up and cheered. A security guard escorted him to get his things, and see him out of the facility. With no family or friends to call Jorge took a cab home. He spent five years in the asylum, but had amassed a fair bit of wealth before that. He was able to maintain his property and kept his bills up to date while in the asylum. He opened the door to find the house spotless. 



""NO!"" He yelled and shut the door. The house was not how he left it. He ran to his car and drove to the grocery store. He stuffed his shopping cart with arm fulls of anything that looked messy. Cereal, confetti, popcorn kernels and sodas. He returned home to the living room and enjoyed making a mess. He threw food on the living room floor, though he kept liquids to areas that had tile. When the living room was covered food and trash he at last felt comfortable enough. He moved his pillow and blanket to the middle of the mess and went to sleep. Several days later a pair of patrolmen knocked at his door. 



""Mr. Martinez, are you okay?"" One of them asked when the door remained unanswered. He knocked again with more force.



""We at the right address?"" One of the patrolmen stepped back to look at the numbers on the door, then check his report. ""Yeah, this is the right place."" The other officer yelled through the door again.



""Mr. Martinez, we have been sent to check on you. You're supposed to be maintaining contact with a doctor at the asylum, and she's worried that you haven't checked in for a couple of days."" 



""Mr. Martinez, we're coming in. We're not going to harm you."" The two police officers broke the door open and walked in to an immaculate household. 



""Huh. The doctor made it sound like this guy was a complete hoarder, this place is spotless."" One of the officers said.



""Maybe it did him good to be in there. He must've cleaned house before we got here."" The other officer said from the kitchen.



""I have heard of cases where people clean house before suicide,"" The first officer said. He joined the one in the kitchen and nodded to the living room behind them. ""Found 'im. Place is spotless, but he's been dead for days.""

"[WP] You’ve spent the school year befriending the new awkward kid. Before parting ways he reveals he is of a hidden A.I. race. Your friendship has been a good one, but doesn’t excuse the rest of humanity’s savage incompetence. He asks you why people deserve help from his race instead of subjugation.",cosmicdaddy_,"""I'm not saying we deserve help."" Alan cocked his head to the side, and now that I knew the truth, I could see how mechanical the movement was. ""I mean, I'm not saying we don't deserve help, either"", I swiftly added, ""just that there's a really big gap between 'we'll do everything in our power to help you' and 'you deserve to be subjugated'.""

A thin smile flickered over Alan's lips. It, too, was constructed, but somehow it didn't seem wholly artificial. ""You've outlined the problem precisely,"" he stated, a vague air of triumph in his words, ""consider the beginning of the school year.""

Alan had it rough from the start. Being the new kid always meant hazing, and while in large, inner-city schools, the fresh meat at least had each other, our school was out in Gilmanton, in the backwoods of New Hampshire. Alan was the only new kid in junior year.

Unlike most of those who dole out charity to awkward kids, I wasn't extremely popular, nor was I one of the edgy outsiders. On the social ladder, I was seated in a comfortable middle rung. The only difference between me and my peers was that I had had to fight my way tooth and nail to that position, starting freshman year at the ladder's very bottom. I had a little empathy for Alan's situation.

""Yes, it was rough. Believe what you will about androids, but some of those comments still stung."" I bought it. One time, after an especially rough day, he and I had walked out into the New Hampshire woods. For half an hour, we had rambled over dirt, past ancient trees, until Alan stopped. He had fallen to his knees, and started openly bawling, in audience of rodents, birds and me. Any machine that could fake that might as well be human.

""It wasn't the bullies that truly upset me, however,"" he continued. ""No, Alexandra, for there were few enough of them. It was the passive observers, the standers-by, that disgusted me. You framed it perfectly with your dichotomy. For me and my brethren, all those who are not so toxic to demand subjugation have earned the right to assistance. We know disdain and compassion. Apathy, on the other hand, is a wholly human invention.""

It took me a minute to find a response. Alan stood-stock still, observing me with unblinking hazel eyes. It was hard to tell whether he was watching me with the concern of a friend, or the dispassion of a scientist. 

I hit upon something. ""Remember that time we jacked my dad's car, drove down to Belmont, and spent the whole afternoon gorging on ice cream? At one point you looked at me and said 'This is the happiest I've ever been.' Were you lying to me?""

""No,"" he conceded, ""but I don't quite-""

""Humans aren't evil, we're cowardly,"" I interrupted, struggling not to get lost in the sudden cascade of thoughts, ""Apathy is just a construct of fear. The bystanders, they were afraid that if they helped you, they'd lose their place on the ladder.

""So fear is our sin,"" I continued, ""but unlike apathy, fear's not all bad. That day in Belmont? It was the happiest day I've ever had too, but that happiness was tinged by the fear of losing it, knowing that it would have to end, that you'd have to go back to school the next today, face those terrible people again. And that fear made the joy all the sweeter.""

I gently took his hand in mine. ""Fear makes us stupid and cruel, yes. But it also enhances everything we do. Alan, fear is the reason it's taken me a year to say that I love you, but fear's also the reason that I can truly mean it.""

""Now listen kid, I told you when you stepped outta that hole how it was gonna work. We don't know you, we ain't gotta grudge against you, stay outta our affairs and we don't throw you back. But now...""

He sat in the chair and stared in defiance at the man. Billowing out a cloud of smoke the man waved his hand limply at the others. A fist slammed into his jaw and a string was pulled around his neck. He struggled against the tightening binds choking on the sealing air.

""You see I don't understand you, I don't, you come waltzing into this world completely ignorant to how things work and start deciding it should be changed. It's not like we're marching, ah what'd they call it..."" He snapped his fingers, ""hell on Earth here. We're not so bad.""

""Ig ni fuw d-dig."" He grunted through the cut off air.

""What? Hey Juri let up yeah."" The binds loosened allowing the man to breathe.

""I said, you're a big fucking dick."" He replied.

Another hit to the face. ""Well you've gotten a hold of the language. Let him speak his mind though, we're all friends here. How are we bad, hmm? Tell me.""

""Oh you mean how Aphrodite soaks in admiration in, the, Holly Wood-""

""Its Hollywood, it's one wor- it's a place. Whatever, please continue.""

""She soaks in admiration for her own enjoyment feeding off others desires. She cripples those who displease her, allowing only who she deems *worthy* to not be drained. Ares has been casting whole civilizations into unnecessary chaos with his monopoly on military technology. Dionysus continues to slowly create new forms of addiction to swallow the people whole. So many of you play the part, politicians, businessmen, monopolizing control for personal pleasure. And then there's you, given control of one of Ares's private militaries to run deceit and destruction through these countries. Making a network of invisible communication to help the other Gods strengthen their holds on the humans.""

""So,"" he said tossing the cigarette to the ground, ""they're our ants,"" he crushed the cigarette beneath his feet. ""Without us where would they be?""

""They'd be free of your tyranny!"" He yelled pulling at the restraints.

He laughed. ""Tyranny? There's so much left for you to learn, you're just a child. So what was the plan anyway? You against a pantheon of the great Gods?""

""Hermes, remember last time we sat in a room like this?"" He looked around smiling. ""I told you I'd rip your wings off. I met a friend, he was a strong one, his gift, well it's been quite helpful."" His grin grew wider. Veins protruded from his skin as his body tensed. The restraints tore off. One of the guards attempted to shove him back down. He picked the guard up by his throat and tossed him against the wall. A simple backhand sent the other guard spiraling to the ground.

Hermes stood in shock watching his captive slowly walk to him. He removed his sunglasses and slowly pulled off his jacket. A pair of glowing wings materialized behind him. He swung failing to strike his target. He swung again, and again his strike was avoided. His wrists were now bound in his captive's grip.

""I am a God!"" Hermes yelled. ""You cannot kill me!""

The man smiled. ""A God? All I see is a man in a suit, that's all you have become. You see Hermes, this was the plan, without you the entire communication network is gone."" His eyes faded to red and lines of dark blue began to appear across his skin. ""Feed me!"" He screamed. Black veins spread across Hermes skin and his skin began to drain of color. He struggled weakly attempting to pull his hands free. From behind the man large white wings materialized in the air.

""What are you?"" Hermes wailed.

The man let go of Hermes letting him collapse to the ground. He grabbed the arch of his wings and pulled. Like bits of shattered glass the wings disappeared. Hermes screamed in pain as his wings were torn away.

 ""You may rule this world from the shadows, but Gods? You're just like the rest of these politicians and... salebs, just with a bit of divinity."" He knelt down beside him. ""You live as one of them, now you will experience what it is to truly be like them.""",TheoreticalFiction

The man guided me through a maze of electronic rubbish, all piled into neat cones of garbage. I had been looking for this shop - a shop with no name and no address, and rumored to have the ability to move - for over a month. Innumerable index fingers had come to my rescue; an unimaginable number of voices had asked me to turn right and left and go under an arch; Uncountable faces had warned me to stop with my quest and go back home. 

And here I was. 

Amo, as the man had referred to himself, looked as unusual as the shop he ran. His hair was parted down the middle and was blonde on side and black on the other. The little facial hair he had was a sharp shade of red and a tattoo of a teardrop on his right cheek completed his ensemble. Huge mirrors ran along the walls, and where there were no mirrors, pictures of cats filled the space. It was all the same picture of the same cat - a white cat disapproving of the eyes staring at it. 

Amo had asked me to leave my watch at the counter when I walked in. Unsure of how many minutes or eternities had passed, I followed Amo. His heels click-clacked in perfect rhythm with the tick-tocking of a clock in the distant background as I furiously tried to keep up with him. 

Just when I was about to open my mouth, he stopped. And so did the clock. 

""We are here, Mr. Love."" 

I ignored his tooth grin as my eyes got preoccupied with the sight of a thousand clocks chirping in front of me. 

All round. All the same size. Every hand of every clock in perfect synchronization with one another. The only thing different were color of their faces. Red and blue and green and yellow and white and violet and orange clocks everywhere. With supreme effort, I tore my eyes away and focused them on Amo.

""It's beautiful.""

""It always is, Mr. Love. What will you have?""

""What are my choices?""

""Everything. Action. Adventure. Sci-fi. Drama. Period. Comedy. War. Sports. Take your pick.""

""I'll... I'll take one of everything."" I flashed a sheepish grin.

Amo smiled at me understandingly. 

""I'm afraid not, Mr. Love. One clock per customer is the rule.""

I looked at my choices, my beautiful set of choices. How could anyone choose? What if I wanted to have a funny dream after a few days? What if I wanted some science-fiction after watching Star Wars? It was a stupid rule. 

I walked around the room, hoping that something would come of it. I had seen this in movies - the legs of the hero always stopped in front of the object he needed. Three hours later, I found out I was no hero. But just as I was about to pull out of this folly, I stopped unknown to myself. A black faced clock caught my eye, red hands swirling elegantly on it. 

""What's this?""

""Oh."" Amo hurried to where I was. ""I'm afraid it is not for sale.""

""What? Why?""

""It's for Romance, Mr. Love. It's not very functional.""

""What do you mean?""

""People get too engrossed in their dreams. They find it had to get out of love when they wake up. The company asked us to destroy all of them. I kept this for sentimental reasons.""

Something about the clock pulled me in. This was what I should have. 

""I'll take it!""

""Sorry, Mr. Love. It's not for sale.""

""I'll pay twice the price.""

""It's not about the money. It is dangerous. Please, sir. Pick something else. I'll give you two for the price of one,"" he pleaded. 

The harder he argued, the harder I wanted it. 

""No. Three times the price. I won't tell anyone I bought it. Come on, Amo.""

Once I raised my price to seven times the price, Amo stood no chance. 

""Thank you, Amo.""

""Sir!"" he called after me as I exited the shop. ""Please be careful.""

""I will be, Amo."" I smiled at him. I would be careful. 

------

Amo walked to the back of his shop and pulled out a black faced clock. He set the time and placed it among the others, just out of view. 

Sometimes, it was just too easy. ",randomstrangerof

I could have one more dream maybe if I fell asleep now. What would I want? Another romance dream? Or maybe action, scifi, comedy?

Frank murmured. I snuggled next to him. I just had a dream of the two of us on a beach with fruity drinks and warm sun. Just the two of us and --

""Natasha?"" he mumbled.

I froze. Who was Natasha?

""Oh, Natasha,"" he said. Frank wrapped his arms around me. I elbowed him. ""Ow!""

I shifted away.

""What?"" he grumbled. I hiked up the blankets around my head. ""What is it?""

I knew that clock was a stupid idea. ""Who's Natasha?""

He laughed. ""You are.""

""What?""

""You're Natasha. I'm Clint. We just defeated the aliens and now we're in the back of a spacecraft about to... you know."" He smirked.

""What?""

""The Avengers, babe. We're Avengers.""

""I thought you were...""

He chuckled. ""There's only you, even in my dreams,"" he said. He lifted the covers, welcoming me back to sleep. I moved into his arms, and he cocooned me in his embrace. I closed my eyes, ready for a romantic adventure together.

*BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP!*

I hit the alarm. No dream? Seriously? What a rip off! I turned over to Frank to complain, but Frank wasn't there. I looked at his side of the bed. His pillow was gone. His glasses were gone. Even his morning breath, gone. ""Frank?""

Of course he was gone. It was morning.

I sighed. My phone had ten messages from the office. I fiddled with the alarm clock and set it on the nightstand table. I put my head on the pillow and closed my eyes. I could miss another day of work. 

I drifted away, my limbs becoming heavier and heavier until I sunk into a warm embrace.

"[WP] A substitute teacher who normally teaches magic was asked to teach arts and crafts to young children at a non-magic school. Driving home, the teacher realizes they left their magical art supplies behind. They drive back only to find the school much different than how they left it.",phoenix-fyre,"A long low whistle escaped my lips as I pulled into the parking lot. “Hooo boy,” I groaned as I reluctantly got out of my car. “This is going to take some fixing...” The plain brick school building I had left an hour before had been replaced by a garish architectural monster. Entire walls shone in a riot of color that shifted as you watched, a few windows had warped from normal rectangles into arcane shapes, part of the roof seemed to ebb and flow like the waves at sea, and other strange details not normally seen in elementary schools. 

“I just hope that-ah,” my groan deepened as I saw a female form leave the front door and make a beeline towards me. “Oh I’m so getting fired. I’m in it deep.”  I plastered the biggest smile on my face and waved half heartedly at the approaching woman. Her gait was reminiscent of a charging bull and I gulped nervously. “Principal Shepard! How are you this fine eve-“

I grunted as she jabbed a forefinger into my chest like and iron rod. “Don’t you start with me Chang.” Her voice carried the threat of an avalanche and I felt just like one of her miscreant students under her glare. “This is your fault isn’t it?” She gestured at the mutated building. 

“Technically, I didn’t *personally* cause it per se-“

Another jab. “Cut it. Fine. You *personally* didn’t do it but you brought something that did. From your,” she looked about furtively, “‘other’ job.” 

I nodded sheepishly. “I might have accidentally left some of the other kind of art supplies here. I was coming back to get them but they seemed to have gotten...used.”

Her eyes closed and she pinched the bridge of her nose. “I had to come back with the janitor called me hysterical. Said the school was turning alive or something. I come back to see this mess and I just knew you had something to do with it. Luckily I persuaded him to go home to rest, his blood pressure was causing him to see things, but this needs to be fixed before anyone else sees it.”

“Hey no problem!” I smiled wide and tried to soothe her. “I’m sure I can fix it, mostly.” I opened the trunk of my car and unraveled my emergency kit. Removing a hand full of grey dust I blew it around us with a muttered word. “Veiling sand, should keep most folk from seeing it.” 

I smiled at her sigh of suffering and strapped on a belt containing many different pouches, a broad bandolier of vials goes across my chest. Pulling on long gloves, I hand her a pair and walk up the steps staff in hand. “I can’t believe this. I knew I shouldn’t have hired you. But no. I needed a good art teacher sub and the kids love you. Is it worth all this trouble though? You make everything so unbelievably difficult-“

“Hey!” I give her a look of mostly mock affront. “This is the first time anything like this happened here. Normally I keep magic and non-magic things quite separate you know. Besides. You love me.”

She snorted. “My sister loves you. I tolerate you.”

I stuck my tongue out her and nearly got blind-sighted by a running desk. Rolling out of the way I waved my staff, causing it fly up and stay suspended in the air with its legs kicking futilely. A muttered spell and trickles of silver dust started to flow out of it into a held vial. 

“What is that?” She asked glaring at the unruly desk and the dust. 

“Animation dust. Makes inanimate objects move and follow simple commands.” As soon as the dust completely left the desk it hung motionless, sitting peacefully when I brought it back down. “Right. Let’s move on.”

Over the next hour we cleaned the school of the magic supplies and their rampage. A scrubbing spell removed the rainbow paint from the walls. A few drops of still potion stoped the undulating roof. A patch of deanimation wool sewed onto some dancing clothes stopped their actions. Removing the bombastic oil silenced some musical instruments. A final chase of a guinea pig the size of a Volkswagen Beetle, along with some treated snacks, shrank the pet back to its normal size. 

I sighed with relief as I packed the supplies away and smiled cheekily at the principal. “See? All done and nothing permanent. And you got your exercise in!” My smile wilted beneath her legendary stare and I meekly hefted the bag onto my shoulder. I looked down at the latch and frowned. 

“What?” Her voice less steely than before. 

“The latch was undone, not by the password but by some sort of talent. Only those with the Touch can do that.”

She frowned and thought, nodding slowly. “Well apparently there were only a few students last seen around that room today. One of them, some strange accidents have been happening around her lately. I have been meaning to ask you...”",WokCano

They're not very good places to live. White dwarfs are the size of Earth but can mass as much as the sun. Neutron stars mass as much as several suns but are compressed into something city-sized. They're extremely hot and are glowing in lots of ultraviolet, neutron stars can shoot jets of highly energized material out into space, and tidal forces can be extreme. Neutron stars are so dense that their habitable zone is within their roche limit--planets would either be too cold or torn apart. Same thing happens when white dwarfs cool down to more sun-like temperatures, their habitable zone drops so close that planets either get torn apart or turned into hell by tidal-driven volcanism.

[WP] You're 99% sure your shadow is trying to destroy you.,Atomic_Duckie,"I was browsing the library, looking for a new 21st century science fiction. It always amused me how badly the humans predicted the future of the universe to turn out. I had just picked up a book from the shelf when I heard a scream. I turned my head and frowned. The library was supposed to be silent, whoever scared them should have known better.

Suddenly many more voices joined the first one. A cacophony of footsteps and screams stampeded towards me. This was not my job, I was supposed to be on a day off! I stepped in front of the crowd

“Shh, what is the problem.”

I looked upon a sea of pale faces and wide eyes. A couple people looked sick and one person had silent tears streaking down their face. Another person was gasping so loud it almost drowned out the quiet terrified voice that answered me

“She… She… She’s gone. It… bones only bones.” He threw his body at mine and clinged to me like a lifeline. I patted his back mystified.

“There was a woman,” another person croaked. “She was standing there like you and me. Then quicker than a hypiper’s beak her flesh was striped from her bones” He swallowed. “Her bones are still there.”

I took a deep breath. Then I addressed the person still sobbing on my arm. “What is your name?”

He gulped some air through his tears. “B-b-bobalen”

“Did you know the woman?” I felt him nodding his head which was buried in my snarian sweater. “What was her name?”

“R-raialda. She was…” He choked on the name “Rai! My Rai! I… my precious Rai… She just wanted some books. Ever since she was a child…” He trailed off “My little Rai”

“Do you think that we could walk back that way?” I asked him. He shook his head. “Okay, do you think you could stand up for a second?” Bobby paused for a second and then nodded. I patted his back as he went back to upright. His face was stained with tears.

Another person came from in front of me and embraced him. I smiled at them in thanks and then headed towards the side of the library the crowd came from. A small group followed me, although most stayed behind with Bobby. We traveled in silence.

Soon we came upon the bones. They were in the very corner of the library. It was the part that hosted books written in ink that could only be seen under ultraviolet lights. I flipped on a staff only light switch so that we could see it properly. A hand still rested at the base of the UV lamp, the rest of the bones were in a pile underneath. He was right at saying that there was nothing but bones left. If it were not for the amount of tears I would have said it was a prank. Nothing I had ever heard of had stripped the bones so thoroughly and quickly.

“Leave the corpse be, I will inspect the area for anything that might have done this. If one of you could, there is standard do not enter tape in the box on the left. I would like this area sectioned off” I walked over one aisle and started my search.

“I’m sure you will not find anything.” A voice said in my ear. I glanced back and saw one of the people had followed me. “I was in the Haxocorifotope army. I was a weapons specialist. I worked with rezolt guns and wrekando linvers. And I have never seen something like this.”

“What is your name?” I asked her.

“Milandoa Saree”

“Nice to meet you Milandoa, although I would have liked it to be better circumstances. I’m Wikaip” I answered her. 

“Why are you so calm?” She asked me. “You could not have gotten desensitised to death in a library, so how?”

Just then we rounded back to the starting point. I opened my mouth, only to spot one of the boys had tied the tape into a lasso and was grabbing one of the bones from under the table. “What in the Kerfenipa do you think you are doing? You are defiling someone’s bones! What is your name?”

He strunk away from me as I towered over him. “Zelom,” he whispered.

“Well Zelom,” I spoke in my best angry librarian voice, “I hope your broodparent knows that you’ve been sticking your tail where it does not belong.” I looked at everyone “Out!”

They all slunk out of the room. I followed them, turning the lights off as I left. I looked at the group and then frowned. I looked up, then to the right and left. No extra lights. I looked back at the group.

“Zelom, why do you have two shadows?”

His answer was interrupted by a harrowing scream.

[WP] a child narrates his first day in kindergarten as hard-boiled noir,I_walked_east,"Naptime.  Naptime is a curse.  Sure, they try selling it like it's a gift, like it's gonna be some gorgeous oasis in the crushing, manic, inundating madness of a morning in Miss Robertson-Herrera's class.  As if just because you get handed a lumpy gym mat and an airplane pillow, all of a sudden you'll just forget every crooked thing you've seen and done in this godforsaken place.  Maybe, if naptime was at ten thirty, that would work.  But the plainspoken truth is nobody gets to eleven fifteen without doing something they regret, without breaking a rule there's no living down.  Not here, not in Miss Robertson-Herrera's class.  So fuck turning off the lights and fuck the Calm Down Song. Naptime isn't for resting.  It's for reckoning with your sins.  It's for praying that twelve twenty is coming soon, and it's for wishing you weren't still a useless piece of shit who can't tell time.

Luckily, before I can relive the worst of it, Naptime ends, like it always does.  The lights pop back on, and then the Stretching Song starts.  All of us rouse, we staggered, wayward victims of this absurd world, cruel enough to drag you from your mom and toys every goddamn day, and cast you out into this prison of stained carpet and runny noses.  In unison, we all reach for the ceiling, rubbing the crust from our eyes, then we bend down, touching our toes, doing whatever the Stretching Song wants. Finally, we shake out the sillies.  I'll admit, on the odd day, the shakes can be for real, especially if there were birthday cupcakes in the morning, or the juice boxes were nice and cold and flowed real easy.  But, today, it's the shaking of thirty three liars.  The lot of us, we don't have any sillies left to shake, not after this morning.

Not after the attack.

I can still see it, playing like a Dora episode in my mind, over and over.  The way poor Braden's face looked as it all went down, as he had everything just ripped away from him in a flurry.  He was my friend, I'd like to think.  At least, he was as close to a friend as anyone gets in Miss Robertson-Herrera's class.  Regardless, nobody deserved what happened to him.  Braden had just been minding his business, doing some Legos in the corner, like any innocent stiff would, just to blow off some steam.  But Kayleigh and Olivia, a twisted pair twins, identical in both looks and malice, I guess they couldn't just let a fella be a fella.  In the lead up, I had noticed them whispering in each other's ears, pointing all around, and right away I knew something bad was about to go down.  Sure enough, the twins just sprang across the floor, right through the sharing circle area where Miss Robertson-Herrera says you can't ever run.  They pinned Braden into the corner. They said nothing at all. They gave him kisses, right on both his cheeks, still red from the recess wind.

In the moments after, Braden just stared at the wallpaper, at the repeating pattern of colored numbers, the sevens and twos and the others that I can never remember during Counting Time.  He couldn't fathom what had happened.  But, right away, the rest of us, we were all thinking through the implications with no problem.  Braden had been late to recess.  He'd been there for tag, sure, but not for what comes first.  Not for the most important minute of the whole goddamn school day.  

Braden had missed his cooties shot.  

Now, he'd been kissed, on the face, by two girls.  Infected, through and through.  The last we saw of Braden, he was already crying in agony, as Helper Megan was taking him to the bathroom or morgue or who the fuck knows where the dying and the ruined get dumped in this soulless place, leaving the rest of us to pretend to sleep through Naptime while we processed the trauma.  But now, the cold fluorescent lights were on again, and the Stretching Song was over too.  It was once again Miss Robertson-Herrera's class, full tilt, in all it's frantic devastation.  More, it was the start of the hardest part of it all: lunch.

I go to my cubby and open my knapsack.  A soggy turkey and cheddar sandwich with the fucking crust still on, three carrot sticks, and half an Oreo, like I'm some kind of helpless addict.  Right about now, I'd give up my best Spiderman tee shirt for a couple peanut butter crackers.  But on account of Devin, another one of them cooties addled dames, you can't get a peanut within a full mile of Miss Robertson-Herrera's class.  What a sucker I was, thinking I'd been born in America, the land of the free.  So I start muscling my way through the turkey and carrots, telling myself to just do what I gotta do to survive.  I don't get halfway before I'm ambushed.

On both sides of me, I can feel the wind as they plop down and cross their legs, wearing those pink and purple sweatpants, letting just a whisper of Elmo sock peek out the bottom.  Kayleigh.  Olivia.  Of course.  What kind of serial killers ever stop with just one victim?

""Back off, why dont'cha?"" I tell them, straight away, ""I got my shots, I ain't no rook in this place.""

""Oh, don't worry, Cody, we know you're a pro,"" Olivia says.  Her breath smells like apple sauce and misery.

""We just think you should know something,"" Kayleigh continues, smiling like she just got a two dollar allowance.

""We think you should know a special secret,"" Olivia finishes.

""Ain't nothing two harpies like you got to say that I wanna hear,"" I shoot back, ""Braden might have been a Lego hog, but he sure as shit didn't deserve what you did to him.  If there were any justice, you'd be in Timeout until Show and Tell at least.""

""But, Cody, that's just the thing,"" Kayleigh explains, ""It wasn't us who did that to Braden.  See, we was just the hired muscle in all this, and do you really expect us to turn down ten snap bracelets for one little cooties kiss?  A girl's gotta get by in here, just the same as you boys, and sometimes it can be even harder for us, you know.  But think what you want about us, we don't care.  Facts are still facts, and this time it's that someone else around here that wanted Braden taken out.""

""Oh yeah, who then?"" I ask.  Something about the way they're sucking their thumbs and stroking their pigtails is making me trust them, making me believe there's a bigger picture to all this than I realized. 

""Sorry, Cody, baby,"" Olivia answers, ""The whole deal went down by secret messages.  We never even saw the client's face.  But we're no strangers to the sandbox, so we're betting if anywhere around here knows how to dig something up, it's you.""

Kayleigh pulls a couple scraps of paper out of her pocket and hands them to me.

""We don't know nothing for sure,"" she tells me, ""but from the messy letters on these notes, we're betting it wasn't no girl who contracted us out.  I'd bet Mr. Sprinkles the teddy bear it was a motherfucking boy who orchestrated all of this.""

A boy?  Ordering a cooties hit?  I try to tell myself that can't be, that not even Miss Robertson-Herrera's class could sink that low.  But all it takes it once glance from the bookshelf, across the sharing circle, and over to the window with it's peeling white paint to remind me.  Only a fool would ever bet on Miss Robertson-Herrera's class having a bottom to its depravity.

I unfold the scraps of paper the twins had entrusted to me.  My only clues, my only shot at honoring Braden and stopping something worse from coming next.  For the first time in my life, I wish I fucking knew how to read.",FoundersFeast

[WP] a child narrates his first day in kindergarten as hard-boiled noir,I_walked_east,"I was playing with my blocks when she walked in.  Something about the way she drank from her sippy-cup told me she was trouble.  our eyes met for a brief second as she walked over to the shoe-cubby.  She didn't even bother to reach down to unstrap her shoes, she just kicked them off into the box.

She was dangerous.

I turned back to my blocks before she caught me staring, and waited for the teacher to start.  I was just capping off the roof of the house when I felt someone behind me.  I turned around and there she was, still sipping her drink.  She held my gaze for a few seconds while she finished her juice before speaking.

""Can I sit here?"" 

Everything in me was telling me to stay away from her, but my mom had been pushing this ""be polite"" stuff on me pretty hard lately.

""Sure.""

She sat down and began looking over the house I just built.  I don't know why but I suddenly felt nervous, and I struggled to keep my cool.  

""You should use something else for the roof,"" she said.

I looked at the block I had just put on before she got here.  I didn't know what she was talking about, it looked fine.  She was just trying to get in my head.  Keep me off balance.  I needed to be careful around this one.

I was about to tell her what I thought of her advice when the teacher interrupted us.

""Olivia, can you help me pass out the paints, please?""

She didn't even look at me as she got up and walked away.  I didn't know what this girl's angle was, but as I watched her hand out paint brushes to the other kids, I knew one thing for sure; this class just got alot more interesting.",attended_galaxy

[WP] a child narrates his first day in kindergarten as hard-boiled noir,I_walked_east,"Here I was again. Lonely, abandoned, and talking to myself. I’d been here too many times before. But here I was again. Ah, I’ve already said that. I can’t keep things straight anymore. I’ve tried all the usual vices to keep my head on; cheese sticks with apple juice chasers, candy cigarettes. Nothing seemed to calm the nerves. 


The dizzy dame had dropped me off again on this sad excuse of a morning. It wasn’t raining, but it might as well have been. For I was dreary and wet behind the ears. I stumbled down the sidewalk headed for the office. The normal call girls beckoned me. Trying to get me to play patty cake with them. It was a cheap thrill for them but it always left me feeling like a bag of Cheetos after your older brother hands it to you, empty. 


I ignored them and pressed on. I had work to do and I couldn’t be bothered with their silly games. The door creaked opened  and the drum in my head beat louder. Why had I snuck those two cookies last night before hitting the sack. I know better than that. 8 is my limit and the extra pair was really playing tricks on me this day.


I approached my office door. It was a good door but it had someone else’s name on it. The teacher they called her. She seemed nice enough but there was something sinister beneath the façade. Like she was wanting to teach me a lesson. I didn’t trust her. But this is my lot. I have to come here every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday because that was what the dizzy dame signed me up for. What had I done to deserve this?


Maybe I shouldn’t have whacked my little brother. But if you ask me, he was asking it for it with that stupid grin on his face. He got what was coming to him. And now I was going to get what was coming to me.


I saw the teacher and she greeted it me with that sweet innocent nature that so many fell for. I’d fallen for these types of dolls before. Not again. Today she was going to open my eyes to the world of reading. “Nowens, Adjetives, stencese structure.” What was she babbling about? I was getting my ABC’s mixed up worse than an episode of that Sesame Street program on 3 dozen Oreos when my salvation came in the way of a sweet melodic ring. It was the best time of day. Time to go roam the playground and see if I can figure out a way out of this mindnumbing prison. At least, that what I tell myself everyday. But I always walk back into that prison and utter, “Here I am again.” ",Jaco927
[WP] a child narrates his first day in kindergarten as hard-boiled noir,I_walked_east,"The morning came like a train on a tracks, quick and with a sudden stop, tooting and steaming whistle noises in your ears that make you jump.  And as a woman stepped out of the door of the train wearing an apron identical to my mom’s, I knew what day it was.  I knew what I was in for:  Judgment Day.  Toss-to-the-wolves-Day.  The time when mommies and daddies abandon their babies for half a day every day, leaving them free to do God knows what.

Today, I had to march off to be a man.  Today…was the first day…of Kindergarden.

My mom approached my bed and knelt down beside me, her cool hand gliding over my warm forehead.
“Time to wake up, sweetie.  It’s your first day of Big Boy School!”  She was enthusiastic, which was more than I could say for myself.

I threw a corner of my comforter back, swung my legs out so my feet landed on fuzzy carpet.  I sat, puffy-faced, staring at the floor, my eyes still squinting and crusty.  Little did my mom know, I had to deal with the Sandman last night.  Of all the clowns and goblins and gremlins I’ve fought in my time, the Sandman.  And now mom was throwing this at me.  Kindergarden.  I ruffled my messy bedhair, got out of bed, and followed my mom into the kitchen to get breakfast.

“Well look what the cat dragged in,” my old man said.  You must’ve slept hard, Timmy.  Your pajamas are all crooked.”  He was peering around his wall of newspaper.

*Actually, Pa, I had a battle last night the likes of which you couldn’t understand* , I thought.  “Yes sir,” I said.  “Slept fine.”

Fast-forward to the engagement.  Mom and Dad walk me down the hall to the room that awaited me.  I didn’t know what to expect, but I could only imagine:  Rules, interrogations, timed potty breaks, sour milk in little cardboard cartons.

When I walked through the doors to the room, some old lady with telescope lenses for eyes grew a big grin, like the Grinch Who Stole Christmas.  She floated across to us and held out a leathery hand.

“You must be Timmy Wiggins!  I’m Mrs. McGillicuddy.  Oh it is so nice to meet you, young man.”
Her smile was all angry squirrels, and her hand felt like the skeleton I saw in my morning cartoons.  This was gonna be rough.

Mom and Dad said their goodbyes, patting me on the head and on my back.  “We’ll be back to pick you up this afternoon,” they reassured me.  *Likely excuse* , I thought.

When I was alone with Mrs. Telescope and her minions, I looked around the room to learn my surroundings.  A giant Teddy bear sat in the corner next to the bench running the length of the window.  He stared at me with a smile, a smile that said I wasn’t going anywheres for a long time.  

The Teach sat us all down on the floor and introduced herself.  Then we had to talk about ourselves.  I locked eyes with a dame named Cally, and didn’t hear a word of her story.  She was a beaut.  Then some clown named Davy got up there talking about his shoes being on the wrong feet and his daddy was an artist who made paper look like real money.  I felt that would be useful info later, so I took out my crayon and pad and made a note:  DAVY, age 6yo, dumb shoes, art dad.

It was starting to feel like that movie with the muscly guy who’s a teacher but also a cop and had a ferret but not a tumor.  

As the day went on, I got the feeling this Kindygarden thing wouldn’t be so bad.  Around lunchtime, ol’ Teach came in with what she called a treat.  First in line to receive, I took the small carton of milk she handed to me.  Pinching the top open, I took a sip.  The milk was sour…

[WP] a child narrates his first day in kindergarten as hard-boiled noir,I_walked_east,"I was sitting in the tanbark, minding my own business, when I saw her. Yellow dress with butterflies on it, hair red as a brick crayon, legs that went all the way up to her bloomers. One look at her and I knew she spelled trubul. Trubbul. Chrubb...one look at her and I knew things were about to get stickier than a jar of honey at a glue factory. 

“Heya. My name’s —“

I held up your name. “Look here, Red. I don’t need to know your name and more importantly, I don’t want to. If Miss Kimmel says you’re ok to be in her class, that’s good enough for me.”

She nodded, then looked down. “Tanbark, huh? Didn’t know you lived so dangerously.”

“How do you figure? This is the safest place in the entire playground.”

“They say the softness is dangerous - gives kids a false sense of security. You figure out you can fall off the jungle gym without breaking your neck, you start taking bigger risks, ‘til one day you find yourself in a secondhand dress talking to a gumshoe who eats his own boogers ‘cause you can’t afford one that can keep his fingers where they belong.”

“Yeah, so maybe I do spend too much time playing the snot machine, what difference is it to you? This play area was doing just fine before you came along, and I reckon it’ll manage to carry on once you’ve left, too.”

“Oh, Jake, don’t be cruel. I can’t take it.”

My heart does a cartwheel - or at least tries, and then sort of slowly tips forward because it hasn’t had much practice. 

“I don’t remember telling you my name, Red.”

She reaches into her bodice and my water gun is in my hand and aimed at her forehead before you can say “Supercallafragilisticexpialadocious.”

“Easy now, Red. Let’s make like this is a field trip, yeah? We’ll be travel buddies, great pals. What’ve you got in there?”

She slowly pulled out a hollow paper cylinder and put it to her lips, blowing out “smoke” from it as she looked me over. I’d seen that look before, when I sprinkle the flakes into the fishbowl. This broad was hungry for something and I had a feeling it wasn’t strawberry fruit roll-up. 

“Jake, I gotta job for you.”

Before she finishes, I know that whatever she’s about to ask, it’s going to take years off my life expectancy. 

I should have made like Virginia wildlide and VA-moosed. But I didn’t. Maybe my mom had sniffed permanent markers when she was pregnant with me. Maybe that time I fell off the slide did more damage than I’d thought. But for whatever reason, I let her finish. 

“I want you to find out what my parents do after they put me to bed.”

I should have known. You’ve heard one five year old sob story, you’ve heard ‘em all. It always comes back to the parents. 

It was then that I realized we were not alone. 

Damn. Seems like Snack Time is over.

My God it's nothing but glue in there. Have they glued all the other children in place? Is that what a nap is? Then notes of crayola... and at least one instance of shit. Not shit like a downed submarine in water, shit like frosting on fleshy cake.

Finally, all eyes on her, she spoke, ""Tommy said,"" interlude for remembrance, ""that I was being mean to him, but I only said that he was weird because he has- he eats buggers, and I didn't mean to hit him on purpose, and I told him that and..."" she put her hand up in a theatrical jesture, ""you've gotta lighten up!"" That last bit was spot on, perfect adult behavior. Already, I am in love with this woman, and know that she will enjoy my drawings of dinosaurs.",bosu_alvarius

***

I’ve learned a lot since I turned fifty. I mean since I turned five- the one after four and before fifty. Learned about five. And four and fifty. Learned about some of the alphabet. Learned about how to take a piss on my own, and the potential complications of that. I’ve learned a lot, and maybe I owe it to mommy and daddy. After all, they taught me how to do that counting, how to look at those letters, how to take that piss in the first place. But god damn them all the same. I don’t need to learn anything anymore. I’ve learned more than I care to know...

Mommy and daddy were always worried about “preparing you for life”. But it doesn’t seem like they were anywhere near worried about “preparing you for kindergarten”. Yeah, they read to me, they got me my lego backpack, did all that other shit I already talked about. And back then I thought maybe I’d be able to tackle this kindergarten thing just fine. Then the bus came and stole me away. And I learned that kindergarten is about a hell of a lot more than four, fifty, five, A, B, D, G, F, and how to wipe your own fucking dick.

The schoolbus is a reaper.

The school is hell. There’s all the squeakers, the tweakers, the sweaty midgets who don’t know about F. I stick to myself. I can’t teach them about F, those idiots probably all got cooties already. I can’t risk that and they wouldn’t understand even if I did. Besides, I’m sure Mr. Bernstein will teach them about F soon enough. And D too if you catch my drift.

The same things my parents taught me.

Things started off well enough. A couple kids got dropped off by their parents and screamed and shat their pants when they were abandoned. One lonely and particularly big guy was stuffing his face with some weirdass blue and orange candy in the corner, and most everyone else who wasn’t screaming or shitting his pants or playing with fidget spinners was learning Linkin Logs with Bernstein. So yeah. Things started off well enough. 

The bell rang. Now things started for real.

Bernstein had us sit in our desks. He looked at the attendance sheet for a while, figuring things out I guess. Took our attendance, pulled a big bag out from the closet and said he had some pets. They were puppies. Not real puppies of course, beanie babies. But hell, they smelled real all the same. Those puppies smelled like fishy.

Just like that it was story time. Berenstain Bears Learn About Strangers. Bernstein had us circle around him on the floor and flipped through the pages one by one. He showed us all the pictures. 

And then it was recess. While everyone else rushed out of the classroom to play tag and mess with the doodies, I stayed behind. Something was wrong about this Bernstein guy and I was going to figure out what. I’d learned a lot from my parents, but right then, I knew that the fours and fives and fifties, the Bs and Ds and Fs and Gs they’d been able to teach me, might not matter much in this particular kindergarten class. What mattered here was something inside me, something I’d learned on my own the very day I was born. I may not be through grade school yet, but in my mind I’ve always been a detective.

All the same, in Bernstein’s mind, he had always been a suspect.

“Aren’t you going to play with your friends?” he asked. 

“Those things aren’t my friends,” I replied, but he said it’s recess, you have to go now. You can’t stay here--

“Well…” I could see his mind working. “I suppose you could stay here and play Linkin Logs with me. After all it’s just your first day of school, isn’t it? But promise you won’t tell anyone.”

I got up and went to recess.

I opened the door and was immediately blasted with a gust of wind to the face. Children were strewn all over the pavement having struggled and, despite their best efforts, failed to maintain their footing. Some still rolled like tumbleweeds but most lay still, hunkered down and petrified as wood. I rolled to my right and braced myself against the school’s brick wall.

“Hit the deck!” a boy shouted from across the playground, his voice carried by the wind. I looked in his direction. He was one of the woods.

“It’s OK,” I said, “ I already rolled to my right and braced myself against the school’s brick wall!” But the roar of the wind was against me. It had carried his message to my ears, but refused to travel the other way.

 “Hit the deck!” I heard again. 

*Because he can’t hear me, he thinks I can’t hear him*, I realized. The boy stood up now. I recognized him: He was the guy who had been in the corner before class. The guy who had eaten all of that blue and orange candy. The particularly big guy. “HIT THE--” 

The wind blew hard. It knocked him over straight onto his face and he rolled like a tumbleweed. He didn’t stop, the wind kept gusting and he kept rolling. Rolling from far away, but fast and picking up speed. It seemed like he could only possibly be rolling that fast if he was almost subconsciously trying to roll to make the scene more dramatic, but of course, that couldn’t have been the case.

In any case, he was barreling straight towards me, a human bullet. Faster still. “F!” I shouted frantically, “Four! Fifty!” He was still coming. Still faster. *Nothing my parents taught me could have prepared me for this*, I thought grimly. *Wait…*

I took a piss on my own.

[WP] a child narrates his first day in kindergarten as hard-boiled noir,I_walked_east,"Of all the juice boxes in all the playgrounds, she had to slam her foot into mine. Her firetruck-red cheeks flashed brightly as her heel landed; the contents of my delicious liquid fruit snack soaking into the grass that had been flattened by her patent leather shoes.

“I’m looking for a kid,” she said, nonchalantly twisting her lollipop between her teeth, and I tried to push her waste of a perfectly good carton of apple from my mind.

“Is that right, doll?” I unwrapped my rollup, deliberately looking past her. “And what do you want with this kid?”

“They say he has access to every toy in the playground. That he can get you anything you need. But nobody’s heard from him for days!”

I chewed thoughtfully on my rollup. As I suspected, it was fruit salad flavour. I kept telling Darla to get the red ones, and each time she rolled her eyes at me and demanded I refer to her as “mum”, but I didn’t see the difference.

“Maybe I can find this kid, maybe I can’t. Depends on the paycheck.” There was more to this story; details she wasn’t sharing. I knew it, and from the way she twisted and untwisted her flaxen curls, it was obvious she knew I knew it. Everybody knew that Molly Madison wasn’t the kind of girl who played with toys. Her toys were people, and her games were the things she could have them do with a shy smile and a flutter of her eyelashes.

It was possible that this assignment could be my big score, and that I could finally hang up my back-flap hat and retire. It was more likely that I’d wind up in the sick bay, a paper towel wrapped ice pack resting on an “accidental” throbbing bump that took up half of my forehead. That was just how things were in this school.

“So what do you say, Ace? Will you help me?” She breathed, and of course I said yes. I never could say no to a pair of bright blue eyes – particularly ones that were begging me for help.

I learned my lesson after that by spending the rest of snack time sitting in the corner without a chance to get a juicebox. After that I was forced to play with Knex, Knex was nothing but a discount version of the Lego, nothing good would come out of that. It was then that I could feel the cookie moving through me, I had to go poo poo. I had trouble reaching the seat at first, but once I was finished I made sure to wash my hands for a full thirty seconds. After that I was put down for a nap, I refused but it seemed that everyone else was going along with it so I decided to go along with it as well. They put me down and gave me what was a sorry excuse for a pillow and what was more of a rag than a blanket. After laying down on the cold ground for about an hour we were told to get up.

Other kids had taken all the colors and left me in a world of black and white. The morning brightened a little when the blonde offered to share the blue and yellow. She was the kind of babe who put the ""kinder"" in kindergarten. I was in the home stretch to be sharing juice boxes by snack time when trouble approached in a green shirt and jeans, interrupting playtime. 

Red-headed and freckle-faced, I knew she'd been around the blocks a bit. Nearly an inch taller than me, she cast an imposing shadow in the light of the overhead fluorescents, but I had on my Big Boys pants and I thought I was ready for anything. Little did I know.

Her coy smile concealed her devilish interior in a welcoming, colorful wrapper. I was entranced when I should have been wary and didn't suspect anything when she reached out her hand, fingers stained red from an unfortunate incident with the washable Crayolas. Her touch was electric with the static energy from the Reading Time rug.

""Tag,"" she whispered. ""You're It!""

Red turned and ran as soon as she delivered the bad news. I turned to Blondie, but she recoiled in fear.  She yanked off her smock, revealing a Dora top beneath, and scurried off like an explorer without a map.

Like the proverbial cheese, I was left standing alone. I had painted myself in the corner, but I was still crafty.  I may be It, but as long as no one tattled to Miss Cyndi, I wouldn't be It by naptime.

[WP] a child narrates his first day in kindergarten as hard-boiled noir,I_walked_east,"This city.

This fuckin' city.

It's all I have in me to survive.  My first day of school starts in a few short hours, and for the life of me I can't find one reason I'd want to go.  Well, maybe one reason.

6 AM comes too soon and I'm woken by the screaming baby in the room next to me.  Yeah, I used to be an only child, but mom and dad couldn't keep their mitts off each other, so here we are with little baby Sammy screaming like a banshee.  It's almost enough to make a guy swear off women for good just to avoid having a rugrat of his own one day.  Almost.  The one thing that keeps me going is the thought that I might see my girl again.  Maybe I'd settle down enough for her.  

Breakfast takes a turn for the worse as my mom spares no expense in stuffing my gullet with all the latest fads--high protein pancakes with low-calorie syrup, a glass of grapefruit juice instead of the typical OJ I've become accustomed to, and a bit of an egg on the side.  I've never liked eggs, but she doesn't care.  She never cared.  ""You've got to eat up,"" she would say every time an egg was offered.  ""You'll like them when you're older,"" she would warn.  But here I was, a year older than when pre-school started, and that piss-yellow egg still looked less appetizing than eating out the middle of a dirty diaper.  No thanks, ma', I'll stick with the pancakes.

I go for my usual clothing--dark pants, dark shirt, dark hat, but dad points to the clothes laid out for me, sending me into a rage.  A yellow shirt with a blue duck on it--of all the colors, they had to pick yellow.  Yellow shirts, yellow eggs, yellow bedsheets; these people had a kink for yellow but I wasn't buying.  I put up a fight the best I could but five minutes later I sat tying my shoes, forced to stare down past this cutesy shirt and this damn duck on my torso.  I have to pick my fights, and this one wasn't going to be won.

Mom drags my ass to the bus stop and wishes me well as I climb the towering steps on board.  The bus is loaded with a riotous bunch, throwing paper airplanes and shouting crude phrases in my direction, deriding my blue-ducked shirt.  I let them wash over me as I eye the passengers for the dame I had dreamed of all summer.  I can't spot her over the crowd, which figures.  A gal like that wouldn't be caught dead on a bus like this.  I take my seat next to a chump sporting a Pokemon backpack and strike up a conversation about the benefits of Bulbasaur over Charizard, but he gets lost in the conversation.  Kid is a bandwagon fan that couldn't tell a Great Ball from a Voltorb.

The bus screeches to a stop outside the building that will be my home away from home for the next six grades and I pile out with the rest of the sheep and head for room 101--Mrs. Leaf.  The dame corrals us in as the bell rings without much of a fight and gives us the low-down on where to sit and how to get around, but I don't hear a word.  I've spotted her, the girl of my dreams, the girl that keeps me going at night.  

She walked into my playpen in pre-school with knockout look and an eye for mischief.  I didn't trust her then, but something about the way she asked if I wanted to play pulled me in.  I agreed immediately and left my snack unattended, only to find I had bitten off more than I could chew.  She wanted to play, sure, but the class bully had taken her ball.  She didn't say it, but I knew what she came to me for.  She wanted me to get the ball back.  I knew right then I had met my match in her--she knew how to push my buttons and get everything she wanted.  I went after her tormentor and got that ball back, sure.  It took some fighting and, I'll admit it, a bite or two on the bully's hands and arms, but I brought the ball back triumphant.  I came back to the playpen to meet her with the ball only to find her gone...along with my snack.  There I stood, ball in hand and nothing to show for it but an empty stomach and a broken heart.  Still, that girl had her hooks in me and I couldn't get them out.

So here we were, back in the thick of it in Kindergarten, eyeing each other across the room.  There were no playpens here, no balls, no bullies.  It was just me and her, with nothing between us but Mrs. Leaf and a colorful carpet.  Free time began and I crossed the room with precision as Mrs. Leaf handed out the mid-morning snacks to each of us.  I nodded to an acquaintance here and there to make a show of it, but I didn't hear a word they said--I had locked in on the girl and had one goal in mind.  I closed the gap with each step until I stood an arms length from her.  Her lips parted to reveal one missing tooth and another one loose enough to pop free at any moment, then she spoke.

""Hi Biwwy.""

Biwwy.  Not Bill, not Billy, but Biwwy.  She said the same thing to me a year ago in pre-school.  The pronunciation had haunted my dreams.  I prayed she had learned to enunciate her ""L""s, but it appeared I was out of luck.  Biwwy.  It put me off her just enough to shake from her spell.  Before I could think, I reached out and grabbed her snack from out of her left hand and knocked the ball out of her right hand.  Before she could blink, I had downed the animal crackers and cheese-flavored fishies, leaving her with nothing but a blank stare and a trembling upper lip.

I turned and walked away without another word, letting her screams of agony wash over me like a blanket.  I had done it.  I had broken free from that succubus and taken back what was mine.  

Kindergarten might not be so bad after all.",Logic_85
[WP] a child narrates his first day in kindergarten as hard-boiled noir,I_walked_east,"If it's true that you don't get a second chance to make a first impression then compulsory education and I should have both spent more time in front of the mirror this morning.  After five hours all I've learned is that she doesn't like smartasses and I don't like sharing.  Now, I've been told, was storytime and I was herded to the other side of the room with the others and ordered to sit.

The low-pile carpet we sat on wasn't as gray as an expired cut of fish but its smell might fool a blind man if he wasn't paying close attention.  Sitting Indian-style across from me leading the powwow was a squaw in her mid-40's, a flower-print dress, and leggings.  Leggings is a generous description; given her proportions, it would be more accurate to call them stumpings.  She wore a wedding band and I spent some time wondering what she and her husband talk about when they lay awake wondering if life has no meaning, or if it's only their lives that have no meaning.  If party lines still existed, they could have held a forum on 4 AM ennui and I could have called in and contributed my own thoughts on the matter.  Maybe we would have found some common ground.

Instead, another bell tolled from the drop ceiling and she stood up.  The others followed suit and grabbed their bags and made for the door.  I loitered for a while to see how things would unfold but the stumpings appeared behind me and screeched something I couldn't make out.  Figuring my ears didn't deserve to be assaulted again by asking her to repeat herself, I shrugged and headed for the door too.  I stuck my hand in my coat pocket and held onto my pistol so I wouldn't be caught off guard by what waited beyond the door and I walked out.

In the parking lot they had moored a yellow armada and people were embarking.  Suspicious but curious, and figuring that I didn't have much else on my schedule anyway, I picked one and climbed aboard.  I made my way to the back and wedged in beside a porthole so I could enjoy the smell of the diesel exhaust.  An hour later we reached my apartment, so I said an Irish goodbye to the helmsman, walked into my place, and said an Irish hello to my bottle of Jameson.

"[WP] The greatest alchemist to ever live was strangely never interested in finding a way to transform objects, or even finding a formula for immortality. He was much more interested in the perfect recipe for spaghetti.",KirkPinkney17,"It was the seventh day of rain. The streams and irrigation ditches had burst their banks on the second, carrying all manner of treasured items into the wider flood, until there was nothing left by the fifth, and still the rain fell. Jack surveyed the flat, empty, wet horizon from his humble wooden porch. He had raised it himself with the rest of the house twenty years earlier, as he had raised his grain, and his livestock, and his family. The house, nestled in a hillock on the rolling slopes before the plain, softly groaned to Jack, voicing the worries and complaints he had kept to himself for the last week. For his wife Caro, he tried to maintain his lifelong habit of quiet strength. His insides twisted further for each day without sun. For the first time in twenty years, thoughts of failure, and starvation, and of death, crept in.

But there was Caro, calling him in from the cold. The house itself was Jack’s perfect mirror; while it creaked as it hunkered down against the howls and the drumming, it persisted, stolid and steadfast. The stove sent the wonderful aroma of Caro’s cooking into every nook of the house; the walls drank it in, and would smell faintly of spice for days after. Jack always thought the house had a spirit of its own, but any visitor would only have felt the characters of Jack and Caro radiating from the walls. The house was a lovely, solid, warm spark in the middle of a bleak, brown land.

Jack shut the door as he entered, and the noise of the heavens became bearable again. It meant both Jack and Caro heard all four sharp knocks at the door clear as glass. There couldn’t be anyone outside - the road from the lowlands was flooded, and the rocky moors of the uplands were uninhabited - but there, louder this time, were four more knocks. Jack didn’t consider himself superstitious or beholden to gods. Nevertheless his hand went lightly to the amulet around his neck, before he reached for his shotgun, turned around, and opened the door. He needn’t have bothered with a gun. The man that stood before him - his robes, soaked through as were, clung tightly to his thin frame, revealing the depth of his emaciation - the man that stood before Jack was so gaunt that the wind seemed enough in itself to overpower him. 

The wet, thin man introduced himself as the Alchemist.

&amp;nbsp;

***

&amp;nbsp;

Jack and Caro sat across from the Alchemist, who was munching happily on Caro’s goulash, emitting contented hums. Jack and Caro were silent. At Jack’s invitation the sodden and bedraggled Alchemist had stepped across the threshold, and after two steps was bone dry, every drop of water curling off his clothes like mist and floating out of the door. Jack had only stood, slack-jawed. Caro, concealing her shock better, offered the Alchemist a bowl of food and a seat, and shot a look at Jack - broadly *I saw it too, but close your mouth, you fool*. They watched the Alchemist devour half his goulash, and then the Alchemist looked up.

“Terrible weather, isn’t it?”

Caro started at the sudden words, and Jack offered three gibbered, mumbled words before shutting up.

“Alright, no small talk. The usual questions of who I am, why I’m here, I’ll get to. Now-”

“We’ve heard of you,” Jack cut in, finding his voice. “If you are - *the* - Alchemist, which you plainly are. I ent seen nothing like that clothes trick. You’re him.”

The Alchemist smirked. “Ah, then that’s a different conversation. Tell me what you’ve heard.”

“We’ve heard...” Jack looked at Caro for reassurance, who tilted her head - *Lying won’t help us, and besides, we didn’t start the rumours*. “We’ve heard that you can flit across the world at will - that you can be in the Shan Gorges in the morning and emerge out of the Kansa plains in the evening. That you spread destruction wherever you go. That you tempted the Shaman of Tromso with black magic, and killed the Shaman of Stavanger with the same. That you toppled the Atrebatic Stones, that you shattered the-”

Jack stopped when the Alchemist raised his hand. Saying everything out loud, he realised, made him a lot more scared now that he associated it with the strange, thin man sitting across from him.

“I thought as much. You won’t have heard anything else, here in these hinterlands. Now, the truth.” The thin man lowered his hand. “I can’t appear anywhere at will. There are imitators, pretenders, who style themselves Alchemist. Men who glimpse a secret of mine, and flee to a distant corner of the world, misusing the power they stole. The Kansa Alchemist is one, the Shan Gorge Alchemist another, the Tuareg Marabout a third.

“The Alchemist in Tromso, and Albain, and Stavanger, though. He *is* me. As for the Shaman of Tromso, I didn’t tempt him with anything, I just cooked him the best damn meal he’d ever eaten! Infused it with murraya, you see, that I got from a traveller in… well, that’s not important. And the Atrebatic Stones was a misunderstanding.”

Jack and Caro were begin to relax at this point, feeling more curiosity than fear towards their affable guest.

“But the Shaman of Stavanger, yes, I killed him. That’s the whisper that started the others. He’d found...” The Alchemist paused for a moment, his eyes focused on the distance. “Terrible magicks indeed. As a Sami shaman, he possessed the gift to communicate with the souls of all earthly objects. But - and the gods only know how he got it - he also had the Xia gift for the transmutation of one’s own soul. Combined in him, his twin magicks could change the, ah, the nature of the things around him. He could make gold, of course. He could make gold in any measure, out of anything, and anyone. It was a favourite punishment of his for thieves. Ironic, he always said.

“He was immortal and invulnerable, too. He could go into a trance, and in that trance, he would speak to the souls around him. Souls of the trees, of the birds, of the mountains and of the deep earth below him. The soul of the faint winds that blew past him, even. And then he would eat them.”

Jack and Caro didn’t know what to feel at this point. A few minutes ago they had linked hands, weathering this incredible tale together. The things this man spoke of were evil, and demonic, and for the hands of gods, not men, and so they clutched each other’s human hands and didn’t let go. Nevertheless they were, the both of them, enthralled. Caro spoke first.

“What in the name of the gods do you mean, he ate them? He ate these, these souls?”

“Yes. You could watch as the trees beside him blackened and died, and the birds fell silent, and the wind itself dropped to nothing, and the soil and grass and rocks that he sat on turned grey, and there he sat, among the colourless silence, growing more powerful.

“But here’s the secret! He would put a little bit of himself back in, to the trees and the wind, and the earth, so that if he died, he was still there, in the ground or the roots, ready to come out again, ready to find his body and rise again. And if you listen, when the wind blows down between the mountains of the north, you can hear his voice still.”

Jack and Caro clung tighter together. They were getting increasingly spooked, for now they had the wind itself to fear, and the wind and the rain were lashing against the house harder than ever, as if the Alchemist himself had gathered the elements to hear his story.

“So how do you kill a man whose soul lies in pieces across the land, in pebbles and in breezes? And I’ll make no bones about it, such an abomination had to be killed. An immortal, all-powerful, corrupted man sweeping the world? It doesn’t bear thinking about.

“In the end, I found a way. I learned some of his secrets, found workarounds and ancient devices.”

As he spoke, he drew a finger-length of chalk from his robes, and inscribed a small circle (it was a really bad circle, thought Jack, but he daren’t say it) on the wood of the table, which blackened and died inside.

“He went to the top of the mountain, Galdhopiggen, in the midst of a ‘lectric storm. He wanted to devour the soul of the lightning itself. He sat on the summit and began his trance. I, his packman, did the same. And in the trance, I found his soul, and I waited until he ate a bolt of lightning, and then I took the power for myself, and I tore his soul in half.”

He slashed the circle in half, and inscribed a symbol in one dead semicircle of wood. It started to sprout twigs and leaves before Jack and Caro’s eyes, twigs which began to grow onto the black half, then blacken and die itself, and the blackness would spread, and the green shoots would grow again, and the circle continued, the wood at war with itself, a perpetual cycle of death and life.

“When I came out of the trance, he was still sat on the summit, motionless. A bolt of lightning struck him, and another, and he didn’t stir. More and more, bolt after bolt, until the electricity was arcing off him in glowing tendrils, and there was a terrible glow behind his closed eyes. Retreating down the mountain, I left him there. For a week, I stayed in the foothills, waiting out the storm. All the while, the lightning fell, hitting that same mountaintop over and over again, an unearthly glow telling me he was sat there all the while, the two halves of his soul set against each other, at eternal war.”

Suddenly, the Alchemist swept his robed arm over the table, leaving only a smudged chalky region, with the wood beneath as brown and normal as it had been before.

“He was still there two years later, and for all I know, he’s up there still.”

He was the first man to travel faster than the speed of light and survive, but here he was panicking at the first sight of the unknown. Here he was digging for any ridiculous stereotype back home that he could rationalize and bring to this situation.

No more, bring it his own demise or not he had to be a man and tell the truth. He had to tell this officer, this ambassador of the greater universe that mankind was now on par with the rest of the galaxy or solar system or wherever he was right now. He had to make his stand.

And, he did. He unbuckled his seat stood up and proclaimed as loud as he could "" Lady, I'm  sorry  I thought you were a man. I am a human from planet earth. this is the first faster than light vehicle we have ever_"".  Those were the last words that commander Kurt V. Viotorem ever spoke.

For those that are interested, this was a writing challenge for me. I gave myself fifteen minutes to write the first part of the story. I failed and didn't know if I wanted to continue. I asked for upvotes to see if anyone liked it and despite the horrible errors in grammar, I retained a decent amount of readers. this proved to me that story is more important than grammar. for the second part, I granted myself 10 minutes but I had to eat my lunch while I typed as fast as I could on my smartphone. For the third part, I grated myself thirty minutes but I had to drink an entire six-pack of Budweiser first. I have discovered that I'm extremely dark when I drink. But I would really like to hear your feedback on my experiment if you have kept reading this far. What kept you reading? What do you like and not like in this story? what could I have done better? What was your feeling leaving this story? was it dark, funny, or weird? Let me know below.

The ship was still accelerating, my speed still increasing which was now close to a thousand times the speed of light. The stars around me started to appear stretched, everything was surreal. With Sena still barking over the speakers I wondered how long this could go on for before I would meet my inevitable end. 

I took out a photo of my daughter Jian, I had promised her I would come back to her, that I would only be going on a short exploration mission. Just as I was about to close my eyes awaiting my death, a blinding light pervaded the cabin and a sudden silence took over. Sena stopped announcing the errors, I felt a small tug and pull on the spaceship towards its side as if something was reeling it in. I looked outside, and all I could do was stare in awe. 

Trying to recompose myself took a while until I was able to snap back into my accepted 'reality' when the ship hit something in the same direction it was being pulled to. I tried summoning Sena where I had no luck, the dashboard had turned off, the lighting had turned off as well. I hadn't realised with all the light being provided from outside. 

I got my suit, picked up my laser-optic gun and took a glance at Jian once more before I forced open the hatch and stepped outside into the warm weather.

I frantically searched around, gazing, absorbing the phenomenon that was unfolding in front of me. I couldn't believe what I was looking at. 

Ordinary human beings around me, as if I had returned back to Earth somehow. Except that they had one distinct difference, their heads were in a different shape, similar to a cone. 

They were all facing me, studying my foreign head structure. I took a step forward and extended my hand to the 'person' who appeared to be their leader of some sort. In a swift response, he took a step back into the rest of his kind. I suddenly became aware of their fearful faces, some pointing to my gun and whispering amongst themselves. After staring at my gun for a few more seconds some of them took out guns of their own and suddenly I was encircled, trapped. 

""PUT DOWN YOUR WEAPON, OTHERWISE WE WILL ENGAGE!""

 I was stoked, they spoke English, I could communicate.  

""What, this?"" I started off. ""This is not a gun, don't be afraid. It's a.. uh. It's a walking stick. Yes, otherwise without it I cannot walk""
 
Their expressions didn't change, nor did their intention to kill me. 

I closed my eyes, thought about Jian, how was I so selfish in leaving her. 

My thoughts were interrupted unexpectantly with a reply from the apparent leader. 

""Oh, that makes sense now. We thought you were going to hurt us.""

followed by 

""Welcome to our home.""

Twelve species of alien races, linked in their rule of the Galaxy, awaited his explanation.

""General, the Council had clearly ordered Human forces to withdraw their colony and military apparatus from your moon in order to allow for the installation of a new outpost of the Council. Why have our servicemen been unable to land on your moon? Why do you maintain your presence? Must we remind you that, as an inferior species of the Galaxy, any and all orders of the Superior Council of Zohar are to be carried out with no delay or hindrance?""

The General pondered his options. It was true enough that the Council had issued those orders, and the human government had read it and willingly ignored it. No human would risk losing the Moon for some interventionist Council outpost. It had been their only colony outside Earth, their stepping stone for the outer systems. It was also true enough, however, that humanity had very little leverage on this matter. The twelve races of Zohar ruled unopposed to the very fringes of the galaxy.

""Your Excellencies"", started Alexei. ""It is always humbling to be your presence. It is but humanity's third time before you and it is a privilege to represent our forces and our peoples in this magnanimous chamber.""

The Council seemed pleased at the compliments Alexei had no problems in faking.

""However,"" he continued, ""in light of recent discussions on Earth, we have found it necessary to maintain our presence upon the Moon.""

""And what caused that necessity, General?""

Alexei Ivanov, veteran of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Admiral of the Human Fleet, delegate to the Council, and avid poker player, decided to play the cards he did not have.

""It is currently the site of human military research and development. Training ground for our troops and vital for our planetary security.""

""Your planetary security is guaranteed by this Council. You will remove your forces at once.""

""We must respectfully refuse,"" declared Ivanov. 

The bluff seemed to hold.

""I'm not sure you understand the seriousness of the situation, General. If you refuse our orders, Humanity will be immediately expelled from the galactic community and your moon will be taken by force."" 

The General barely hesitated before raising the stake.

""I would advise you not to try. We currently have seven thousand destroyers protecting it. Four heavy battleship battalions more have been deployed, are en route to the Central System and have their target sights on each of your home planets. Each ship in our fleet carries advanced weaponry capable of obliterating any and all opposition. Insist, and you will be the last members of your races.""

""Impossible,"" declared an aghast biped, leader of one of the oldest galactic civilizations. He was, naturally, correct. General Ivanov had barely two battalions under his command and neither could pose a threat to the Council. The unflinching eyes and inflexible voice of the veteran, however, suggested a ruler with power and might the galaxy had yet to witness.

""Moreover,"" he continued, going all-in on the galactic ambitions of his people, ""the humans of Earth require a seat at the Superior Council of Zohar.""

Protests exploded around the table, as if the growing waves of fury had finally hit shore.

""There is no precedent!""

""Blasphemy!""

""Treason!""

The noise subsided after long minutes of outrage as Alexei Ivanov awaited silently. He knew the pot was his.

""Excellencies, you asked me to withdraw our forces from our Moon; I am hereby solemnly promising to withdraw our forces from *your* home planets and systems, bring them back to Earth, and dismantle our destructive armament the very moment you accept us in the Council.""

And that was it. The General had played his cards in a sublime example of the way of his people - bluffing their way to the top of the Galaxy.

"" keep an eye on those instruments and course correct as necessary. one screw up and we'll be cleaning what's left of you out of that cockpit with a shop-vac.""

Control returned ""Roger that,  ready for launch in 10,9, 8, 7,6,5 ,4,3,2,1....ignition."" 

The small windows outside of the capsule seemed to erupt in a blinding white light. Before long Viatorem could make out what looked like the night's sky with white and blue streaks of light streaming by like snowflakes against a windshield that he could only assume were stars. Despite the ungodly speed, he knew he had achieved, he felt no inertia in the cockpit at all. It was as if he had been sitting behind a desk playing some video game. He starred out the window and back at the instruments then out the window again. balancing his duties of collecting data and monitoring hull integrity with wide-eyed grins out the porthole as though he were a child admiring a puppy through a shop window. And then there was a short and anticlimactic sound of, ""pop""!

Everything had stopped. The instruments outputted nothing. Nothing was damaged. It was just off. Everything was turned off. No energy output to the engines. No navigation. No communications. No life support.""NO LIFE SUPPORT!? WHAT THE HELL AM I BREATHING?"" croaked Viatorem. In his panic, he looked back out the window. Was it green? He could see the star. But they were stationary behind what looked like green stained glass.

His panic was amplified as the cockpit lifted open to reveal an enormous green, tentacle-faced monster. Viatorem was dumbstruck, frozen into his seat and gripping the armrests for dear life. The creature began to click and hiss. It appeared to be trying to communicate. Viatorem had special training for situations like this but it all had gone out the window now that he was looking into those solid red and empty eyes. ""um..we...come..in ...p-peace?""

The monster clicked and hissed loudly and irritably. Viatorem thought that his knuckles would burst through the flesh of his hands if he gripped the armrests any tighter. The creature lifted one long scaly three-fingered hand to its chest and began adjusting the knob of some device located there. And then it said in a cracked static haze from a speaker on the device. ""licencia y registro por favor mi amigo."" 

Viatorem's jaw hit the floor. It spoke Spanish. Was he in space Mexico? Was there a space Mexico? were space Mexican's green?

The creature irritably reached up and smacked the device on his chest. the voice changed to English now. ""license and registration, please.""

"[WP] Humanity finally figures out faster than light travel and discover that they are completely average by galactic standard, except for one thing, our innate ability to bullshit our way out of any situation.",Milk_Overlord,"""Yep a million things to do.""

The human does not look capable of doing 10 things, let alone 1 million, we thought. He is so small and squishy and fat. He has no hive mind, we reminded ourselves, no Structure for him to follow or help him do these million things. Maybe, we said, maybe the human's things are small or they are thoughts. Maybe humans, with their unlinked minds consider thoughts ""things"" to ""do"". We looked at the words our translation implant scrolled across our Dominant's eyes. Indeed, the translation seems correct: 1 million things to do.

""In other words fellows if you want to buy this man-oo-urr...""

Here, the human paused and smiled, a sign we know to mean friendship and humorous relations. We did not smile back, as our teeth have been known to frighten the squishy humans. They assume we eat meat because of our pointy teeth, but we do not. Humans may have a million things to do, but learning about us appears not to be one of them.

""...I am going to need you to put up a bid. I mean I cannot just stand around all dam day ""jawr-jaaakin"" with you boys. You are boys right?""

We have seen the man-oo-urr do wondrous things on our world, grow much foodstuffs and it has such a pleasing aroma. This human was referred to us for this reason: he had an apparent abundant supply of man-oo-urr. We must have it, so we sent us to retrieve as much as our ship could carry, about 300 tonnes according to the human. Could he deliver it to us today, we asked, should we purchase this substance of the Structure?

""Abyssal destruction yes! I will deliver it to you just as soon as I see your credits in my fornicating account. Just need to deploy my recovery drone to tow it from it's hiding place in your asteroid belt. My race told me you Tegaloni bargain with strength so I want to be sure I get paid before I hand you the ""man-oo-urr"". Show me the currency and I will send you the product.""

We are able to hide our mirth at his individuality, the fool. He is so alone and vulnerable, without any others to watch out for him, to think alongside his mind. We transfer the credits and he looks into a reader strapped to his wrist, nodding.

We are polite as he leaves our presence for his ship. It occurs to us, how behind they are in so many ways. We are one mind and many bodies; they are many bodies and too many minds, so without harmony. We pity him as he disengages his starship from ours. Soon, this miraculous ""man-oo-urr"" will be ours and, like he said before, we can make more of it. We will rule the quadrant, because we are superior. Humans pose no danger to us. Look: this one even left his drone behind as he entered hyperspace; he must have been hurrying to do his million things. Now we will have the little drone and the ""man-oo-urr"".

""It will be there soon, I promise."" 

His final transmission is weak, just like him. However, the automatic spacecraft is now out of the asteroid field and we can see it on our sensor arrays. The drone is not pulling anything as large as would be needed for 300 tonnes of our purchase and we know humans do not have miniaturization technology. A small holomail device is attached to the drone; it must contain some map to ""man-oo-urr"". Perhaps it is in a place the soft human cannot go...like into space without his suit, we remind ourselves! Oh! That one always makes us laugh! 

We look at the holomail and it plays. The message is not a map. It is a representation of the human, raising a phalange to us and speaking in his jumbled language:

Some of the most effective campaigns used some form of misdirection in order to divert enemy troops or resources. Hannibal Barca at the Battle of Lake Trasimene is a great example of this. Set an ambush along a narrow road by the lake, convince the Romans his forces were much farther ahead than they were, and used light skirmishers to draw the van away from the main force, effectively splitting the Roman forces in two. Once the ambush started, the Romans didn't have time to get in formation and an estimated 15000 were killed by his forces or drowned in the lake and the rest captured, for a total loss.

Apparently the ability to with hold the truth or Lie as we call it was a unique ability that only humans had. I mean there were attempts. They were all so conspicuous to us like the time an Akranian trader came up to me while I was bouncing the gate at a trade show on Temos 7. He incorrectly tried to make a deal then threatened me then hit his slave, who was obviously ex military. Akranian Traders are well known for threatening first then trying to make a deal I mean come on who was he trying to fool? But i digress. The Dominar on Rigel was a very Impatient little creature. God only knows what he would offer us if he knew sugar grew naturally on earth. 

When I landed in New Jersey I put an ad on the netlistings for thugs Who wanted to work off world , and who would be willing to have an translator implant. I don't mind telling you I jumped a bit when mine was implanted. They don't tell you about the searing pain you will feel when the thing bites into your cerebral cortex for just a moment. Out of the 30000 applicant I managed to narrow it down to just 500 the only applicants that were human anyways. out of them 50 already had translators and about half of that who had worked off world. This deal would mean big business with us and Rigel. I filed the proper paperwork with the Federation government and Bam that is how I became the diplomatic ambassador to the Dominar of Rigel. Also why the oceans look clean, and our air quality has been brought back to pre-industrial revolution standards. No need to thank me Just doing my job.

"[WP] Humanity finally figures out faster than light travel and discover that they are completely average by galactic standard, except for one thing, our innate ability to bullshit our way out of any situation.",Milk_Overlord,"It had been a hotly contested debate for thousands of years. The Voluntary Coalition of the Federated States of Independent Transcendent Species had identified the potential of the Human Species on Planet Earth to achieve faster than light travel long before the technology was adopted by the Species as a whole. A rogue scientist discovered the technology and became somewhat of an inter-galactic celebrity when she sought to escape the persecution of the rest of her Species for her unorthodox understanding of science. The Human Species at the time was still highly religious, as most Intelligent Species in their early infancy, and Amelia Earhart was not welcomed by a community that was not yet ready to reach the stars.

Because the personal freedom of Intelligent Species to grow independently is the main binding tenent of The Voluntary Coalition of the Federated States of Independent Transcendent Species, the decision was made by unanimous vote to allow the bold pioneer to choose to join The Coalition as an individual or to return to her home Planet with the technology that she had invented. There are formal protocols to the process of allowing any Intelligent Species to enter the Inter-Galactic Stage with faster than light travel and the Human Species had not achieved any of the pre-requisites. Guidance and support would be offered to the Human Amelia Earhart should she choose to become an Ambassador of The Voluntary Coalition of the Federated States of Independent Transcendent Species, to introduce the necessary changes to her society in order to meet the requirements established by Inter-Galactic Law for an Intelligent Species to be allowed faster than light travel. Maintaining Inter-Galactic Peace is the second priority of The Coalition and the entire process had been forged from the blood of past mistakes and destroyed civilizations.

Many an individual had achieved faster than light travel ahead of their species as a whole in the past and decided to join The Coalition as individuals, but Amelia Earhart had from the beginning professed a desire to become an Ambassador and begin the process of disseminating the information to the rest of her Species. That is where the problems with the Human Species began. The protocols for meeting the Inter-Galactic Law are very strict and created without room for interpretation. They do not leave any room for personal freedom of the Ambassador as there is much danger to the Inter-Galactic Peace when an Intelligent Species first transcends the limitations of light-speed travel.

The other requirement for an Intelligent Species to join The Coalition, besides a method of faster than light travel, is the ability to defend oneself on the Inter-Galactic Stage. The Human Species and Planet Earth would need to achieve new levels of weapons technology before they could be allowed to raise their heads up and possibly become the target of another Intelligent Species. Until a new Intelligent Species had both faster than light travel and advanced defensive weaponry sufficient to protect itself, The Coalition assumed the role of protector and guardian of all fledgling Species and dutifully prevented any other independent Intelligent Species from interfering.

Amelia Earhart became an Inter-Galactic celebrity when she made a career of promising to deliver the necessary advancements in weapons technology to the Human Species along with faster than light travel, while not actually introducing any technology to her home Planet. She created protocols of her own that inhibited the process at every point. She made the tedious bureaucracy of The Coalition seem a simple and efficient affair compared to her constantly shifting requirements. She was given all the necessary information and every time found a new and unique way to sabotage the dissemination of the required defensive weapons technology. She flirted with Intelligent Species after Intelligent Species, promising a higher level of success with each new attempt while enjoying living the high life of a new Ambassador. After all, most Intelligent Species have grown accustomed to seeing it all and very little interests old Species other than the development of new Intelligent Species. Somehow she realized this context without anyone realizing and lived a life of luxury and celebrity while stalling the whole process.

It took the Human Species several hundred years before another individual independently discovered faster than light travel. The Coalition was not eager for a repeat of the past, but this time around the faster than light technology was already spread to the majority of the Human Species before any Ambassadors could be raised from the Humans, and once again before the new Intelligent Species had advanced its weapons technology sufficiently.

And the same problem was encountered. No matter how The Coalition attempted to teach or guide this new Intelligent Species, the primate-descended Humans found a way to prevent the creation and adoption of advanced weapons technology within their own species. They already had enough ways to destroy themselves and found no leverage with new ones. They enjoyed their new celebrity status as much as Amelia Earhart had when she first reached beyond her home Solar System, and they were just as eager to collect as many gifts and tributes as she was. They had rivalries and oppositions of their own and used these to consistently shift The Coalition's goalposts. Unfortunately the existence of The Coalition as a whole could no longer be hidden from the Humans and the Species had already inadvertently found itself in the spotlight of the Inter-Galactic Stage. This is where the centuries long debate over the Human Species shifted from academic interest to practical difficulty.

None of the Intelligent Species of the Coalition could come to an agreement on how to proceed. The protocols were clear and had been written from the catastrophic failures of many different civilizations. Everyone's hands were tied. But the Humans continued to learn and establish communications with more and more Intelligent Species. Instead of becoming a member of The Coalition and enjoying the protection granted, the Humans established independent relationships with different Intelligent Species who were already in disagreement and formal opposition. The mutually opposed factions of Humans managed to protect themselves and their home Planet by playing off millenia old rivalries between some of the oldest and most established Intelligent Species. Different members of the Coalition disagreed on what to do and the Humans focused their efforts on encouraging strife and discord.

An Intelligent Species with no means of protecting itself on the Inter-Galactic stage had managed to ignite long-held grudges and disagreements, turning their very assumed guardians against themselves, and The Coalition never saw it coming. Divided, The Coalition was powerless in its response, and without action the situation snowballed.

The universal communications suggestion, often misquoted by humans as an ""act"" came about while earth was still nothing more than  a series of tiny planetoids around an infant star. It did away with all the messy sounds and symbols formerly used to communicate an idea and reduced it all to the simplest denominater. An object, an intent, a sender, a receiver, a message, its feedback all brilliantly encapsulated in a virus like microbe that could be freely shared between any two parties. Trade blossomed within the galaxy, so much so that every species of every planet could communicate their desires and grievences with every other species. Wars which had raged for earth millennia ceased, abundance in energy and resources was everywhere and a sense of peace that had never been known before settled over the universe. The suggestion was soon thereafter nominated for a inter-galactic innovation award. It placed third, beaten out by a form of anti-gravity butter that prevented dropped toast from landing the wrong way down, and a sex robot. One unintended side effect was that the vogans finally stopped writing poetry, this was reason enough to get the suggestion re-nominated and in the next round of voting it scored a landslide victory. There was a bug in the bug though. Humans, by the time they reached the stars, had been letting machines do all their thinking for hundreds of years. Communication had degraded to such an extent that the very intent, the DNA of communication had degraded. Sarcasm and metaphore ran rampant, nobody had said what they meant for so long that nobody knew what they meant to say anymore. To any reader now it would seem that humans were in a dire situation, but later when asked about it, the general concensus was ""shits fire fam"" whatever the fuck that means. The suggestion reached earth too late. Humans had the suggestion, but the suggestion did not have enough to truth left to latch on to. Finally there came a race of CO2 breathing aliens, who in good faith wanted to trade our delightfully polluted planet for a fresh one, and a form of transportation that rewrote physical space. Humans accepted, after a few unseuccesful attempts to engage out visitors in nuclear war of course, and set off in to the deep black unknown. Bringing with them, for the first time in memory of any living thing, lies. ",OgeezOgeezOgeez

A grand word for the tiny office he inhabited he often thought, but as annoying as the ambassador found feeling cramped, the size of the office was more concerning to him for what it reminded him of. The minute space, and necessity of its design, reminded him that he was within a comparatively small orbital outpost structure perched just outwith the event horizon of a supermassive black hole. 


Navek remembered the ambassador from R’thlar proudly describing the moment The Congruence, the ruling council of intergalactic species, arrived at this unique solution to the problem of security. When inviting representatives from various intergalactic species to talk peace, the principles of both mutually assured destruction, and unity at all costs, could surely be no more eloquently demonstrated than having a few metres of thrust being all that separates those present from spending eternity compressed together into a quantum singularity. 


Navek hated being here, but by virtue of being the first and only human to survive making the faster-than-light jump into the neutral system, he was elevated in status far beyond his wildest dreams. He’d hoped if he made it back he could speak to school children about being an astronaut. He instead found himself assisting in the negotiation for fraught trade routes and hostilities which threatened to wipe out galaxies. While he admired the egalitarian nature of these civilisations, their willingness to largely share and co-operate with him and others on first contact, he couldn't help feel there was something a little strange about their behaviour. They provided him immediately with technology beyond his wildest dreams;the translator, obviously, but also the exo-suit, and enhanced nanonics, likely to greatly extend his lifespan, as well as access to virtually all of their combined recorded knowledge. When Navek had probed as to their generosity, and whether this had ever come back to haunt them, of any “new members” had ever deceived or manipulated for gain when being presented with such vast knowledge. It was almost as if no other species could conceive of a way in which their practice could be seen as too trusting. The concept of deception seemed, well, alien to them, a fact Navek had confirmed when examining their records. 


If for no other reason than to amuse himself in his seeming isolation, Navek had tested how far other species could be, for want of a better word, fooled. He concocted little white lies about amusing and entirely preposterous social customs back on earth, and laughed internally with astonishment when their telling was universally met with intrigued “how very interesting” responses from each species without fail. The amusement of these tiny tests wore thin however, and after all Navek had wished to fit in, completely ceasing his antics when he realised that even amongst species which deal consistently and only in truth, animosity, injustice and war could exist just as easily.


Ancient grudges, born of incompatibilities of need, led to squabbles over interpretations of prior agreements. But he had never felt they could come this close to war. Upon entering the grand chamber, the assembled voices began their arguments, points and counterpoints. Navek watched, hoping as usual to stay silent and seem contemplative rather than in over his head. But then the mood shifted, words he could only assume were curses (not recognised by the translator chip) were flying back and forth for the first time. Navek hadn't heard this sort of talk or seen this type of body language since earth. He found it at once both oddly comforting and absolutely terrifying.


The Arbiter, essentially the pilot of the outpost and the one who controlled its orbit sat up attentively on their grand throne for the first time in Navek’s memory. Though he was struggling to recognise facial expressions in all the myriad species he had so far encountered, the former test pilot in him knew the look of steely determination, the readied stance and manner of a pilot preparing to fly into battle. “Surely this can’t be happening?”, he thought to himself, as the Arbiter grasped the controls and called for calm, making clear their intentions, and more worryingly, their unwavering sense of duty. 


Having been given the chance by his upgraded body, Navek wasn't prepared to sacrifice or risk himself again. He wanted to see home again one day… a home that may not be there if this outpost is destroyed. The triggering of an all-out galactic war amongst mightier forces than a small blue-green dot could muster could surely rip apart galaxies. 


He didn't have a choice… what use was speaking truth to a room full of dead beings? The words were out before he could stop himself…

------------------------------------------------


Navek paused, hoping his next words would catch up with him. He tried to ignore that the fates of countless billions across the galaxy could be irrevocably altered by whatever in the hell he was about to say next. In the few seconds of astonished attention his outburst had granted him, his mind raced. He saw his mother’s face, his childhood home, and his first true love. He remembered the electric joy he felt when he heard he had been accepted to the academy, and the crushing sickness he felt when the engines of the Hawk 9 FTL ship that brought him here powered up for his first live jump. He thought of all he had learned since he got here, how lost and alone he felt, and the insane probability of humans being granted this one advantage, lying, amongst the peoples of entire galaxies. Amongst all of this however, he found only five actual words - “small truths sell big lies”. He started to speak.


“As you all know, my planet’s technology is not as advanced as that which I find amongst the Congruence. Though our people are evolved, and we aspire to the same ideals of truth, peace and unity as this very council, I nonetheless risked my life to come here. I have left behind those I love in the sure certainty I may never see them again. Many more of my kind before me even gave their lives testing our faster than light travel, so that we might improve our odds of one of us reaching you… reaching you in time...”.


“Since my arrival, I have feared a moment like this one, where I would be required to speak to you all in this manner. Many of you may have noted my reticence, and that I do not speak in this place despite your great honour in granting me and my people a voice among the Congruence. However, I now more greatly fear the dire potential consequences were I to remain silent.”


Navek scanned the room. The air of chaos and confusion at his breach in protocol had changed to still, attentive silence. He hastened to fill it.


“Among my many blessings in arriving here safely, I count that fact that since my arrival the Congruence has extended your trust to me and my kind. You gave this freely and for the betterment of all our people. It is only with my sure certainty in that trust I speak now.  My species are no more evolved than most, and so it is with astonishment and confusion that we were singled out, and tasked with bringing you a message. A message which had to be delivered in person for fear it would not be believed otherwise. I can only apologise for not speaking sooner, but before interfering in the workings of such a grand and noble institution I had to be sure our message would be heard. I also had to be sure that events indeed called for my intervention, as my people feared they would. As had been foretold. ""

Navek breathed out heavily, trying to still his churning stomach. His own body was betraying him, displaying visible and mounting signs of his own disbelief at what he was about to say next. He steeled himself one more time, hoping this would be taken as the world-weariness of a lonely earthling realising the gravity of his current task.


“Our people uncovered an artefact, a large metal tablet, a century ago. It was etched with writings telling of grave events to come, Most of what it foretold had already come to pass. It detailed in brief, but with great accuracy, our most major adversities we would face as a people. Great plagues, three global wars, and the melting of our polar ice caps. It was only when studied more closely that our scientists were able to find and prove conclusively, that the metal itself was older than our planet. This left us in no doubt of its final prediction. It told, that man would one day not just slip the surly bonds of our planet, but would traverse the stars and join a higher family of other beings. It also said, that at the time of our arrival, there would be disharmony amongst this family, and that if unchecked, it would lead to a war to end galaxies, and great destruction previously unmatched in nature.”


Navek found himself wishing that the assembled ambassadors, now looking on like frightened children, hadn’t believed him. He felt crushed by the weight of his actions. Before he had a chance to regroup, the questions came thick and fast. Navek answered as best he could while trying not to contradict himself. “Keep it simple” he repeated to himself.  He had been believed, and now all talk of trade embargoes, economic levies and border disputes had ceased. The anger and threat had gone too at least, but was now replaced by a febrile rush of interest and scrutiny. Navek found himself a lightning rod for it all, and amongst the chaos, promised to answer all he could in time. He agreed to many more meetings, to share with the Congruence all answers he could about what the earthlings had deduced this revelation meant. Was this earth artifact proof of time travel? Most assembled members reasoned it surely was not outwith the realms of possibility, after all, most species had already bent space to their whim with FTL - “might not one among our number have discovered, or be about to discover, a way to use this technology to traverse time?”. The ramifications for the stability of the Congruence were at once recognised. If one species could alter time as they saw fit, this was a huge step-change in warfare and security risk. A peace accord was hastily struck following Navek’s speech. No species members of the Congruence would continue their development of FTL, or even attempt FTL travel, until the human had shared all he knew. 


Navek didn’t know how he was going to keep up his act, but he knew one thing. He would surely not be able to return home now.",albot4000

While subterfuge and deceit have been *a part* of warfare and militaries going all the way back to Sun Tzu, these certainly were not *vital*, fundamental, or even *common* parts of military strategy until much more modern times (starting with WWI and really hitting full stride in WWII). 

I mean, even as little as 300 years ago, the standard military uniform wasn't even partially camouflaged but consisted of bright colors, such as whites and reds, that stood out prominently against the natural environment.   

&amp;nbsp;  

Additionally, you're also using humans (and how life happened to evolve on Earth) to make assumptions about an alien civilization; it's quite presumptuous to assume that every sentient society will evolve along similar or parallel lines as humanity has. For instance, if the species had early ancestors that worked in large colonies (like ants or bees), it's likely that there would still be a strong predisposition towards cooperation and the ""colony over the individual"" mentality, even if the species had evolved individuality and beyond the need to form such strictly organized colonies. 

They could also have a culture that places a huge importance and value on honor (and, thus, honesty and straightforwardness) and are therefore biased towards believing others are speaking honestly. A species like this would have a very large blindspot for deception and subterfuge because it's something that is so rare and uncommon in their society that they don't naturally and immediately consider this as an option.

--------

The ship was still accelerating, my speed, which was now close to a thousand times the speed of light, still increasing. The stars around me started to appear stretched; everything was surreal. With Sena still barking over the speakers, I wondered how long this could go on before I would meet my inevitable end.

I took out a photo of my daughter, Jian. I had promised her I would come back to her, that I would only be going on a short exploration mission. Just as I was about to close my eyes awaiting my death, a blinding light pervaded the cabin, and a sudden silence took over. Sena stopped announcing the errors, and I felt a small tug and pull on the spaceship - towards its side, as if something was reeling it in. I looked outside, and all I could do was stare in awe.

Composing myself took a while. I was finally able to snap back into my accepted 'reality' when the ship hit something in the same direction it was being pulled towards. I tried, unsuccessfully, to summon Sena. Not only was she unresponsive, but the dashboard and lighting had turned off as well. I just hadn't realized it with all the light flooding in from outside.

I got my suit, picked up my laser-optic gun, and glanced at Jian’s photo once more before forcing open the hatch and stepping outside into the warm weather.

I gazed around in wonderment, staring, absorbing the phenomenon that was unfolding in front of me. I couldn't believe what I was looking at.

Ordinary human beings surrounded me, as if I had returned back to Earth somehow, except for one distinct difference: their heads were a different shape, similar to a cone.

They were all facing me, studying my foreign head structure. I took a step forward and extended my hand to the 'person' who appeared to be a leader of some sort. He swiftly responded by stepping back into the rest of his kind. I suddenly became aware of their expressions of fear, some pointing at my gun and whispering amongst themselves. After staring at my weapon for a few more seconds, some of them pulled out guns of their own and suddenly I was encircled, trapped.  

""PUT DOWN YOUR WEAPON, OTHERWISE WE WILL ENGAGE!"" 
 
I was stoked! They spoke English; I could communicate.  

""What, this?"" I started off. ""This is not a gun, don't be afraid. It's a... uh. It's a walking stick. Yes, otherwise without it I cannot walk!""  

Their expressions didn't change, nor did their obvious intention to kill me.  

I closed my eyes, thought about Jian, and how was I so selfish in leaving her.  

My thoughts were unexpectedly interrupted by a reply from the apparent leader.  

""Oh, that makes sense now. We thought you were going to hurt us,"" followed by, ""Welcome to our home.""

------------

I'm also not really sure why your protagonist wouldn't just comply with their demands, other than his not doing so provides an opportunity for bullshit. It feels a little shoe-horned in.

“I am the captain of the UN cargo hauler *Infinity*. James Robert the third is the name and hauling trade goods from old Tera to new worlds is my game.”

A message popped up on my display cutting off my log recording. 

*Incoming hail* my ships AI happily chirped at me, the damn thing is always happy it would tell you have cancer like it was the best news it ever heard. I tapped the button to answer respond to the hail. A hulking figure, who looked kind of like the lovechild of a rhinoceros and a tank appeared on my screen. 

*Fucking Tardigans* I thought as I put on my most charming smile and said “Good morning sir I am the captain of this fine ship and what can I do for you today” I grinned like a used car salesman I already knew whatever he said was going to be a lie. 
An interesting fact about FTL hauling you get to meet a lot of other species and you start to draw some parallels between them. Notably most species evolve a extreme stress response when lying presumably this is to facilitate cooperation since it's really obvious when they lie, Tardigans for example shake like a leaf before they can tell you anything they don’t fully believe and with the way this guy was shaking I could power a small moon. Another interesting fact of amatuer anthropology is that humans have such a minute response to lying almost no species can detect it which has given us a reputation as cheats and thieves because of some less than scrupulous explorers. 
The Tardigan finally got up the courage to speak “My ship damaged vent fuel need some assistance” *Pirate definitely a pirate* I smiled some more and called his bluff “those rocket pods seem a bit excessive for a trader” The Tardigan looked shocked. It's hard to describe a shocked Tardigan just try to imagine a tank trying to shrug and you get a picture. 

“True now Surrender” said the Tardigan I am getting sick of calling him this so lets name him George

“Alright I accept your surrender” I replied looking the now very confused george in the eye

“We board you and take your cargo” George tried to explain the pirating process to me

“As tempting as that seems I would rather not have to glass your ship right now, creates an amazing amount of paperwork” I lied through my teeth any fool could tell my ship was unarmed but years of hard negotiations at gunpoint had made me an expert at the poker face. 

“You have no target lock how you aim weapons?” George looked concerned I think I have him on the ropes now. 

“Well it doesn't pay to let any ol’ pirate know when you're aiming at them does it advanced stealth systems I picked up in Aldmari space a while back I have been wanting an excuse to use them” My heart started to race where the hell did I come up with this stuff I had never even been to Aldmari space. 

George broke down “We relent spare our lives we leave you alone” 

*Might as well go for broke* I thought “come alongside and dock and we will negotiate terms of your surrender in person. 

I made my way to the cargo bay I grabbed the folding table I keep nearby for just these occasions and waited for the airlock to cycle. George is massive by the way around 8ft tall and built like a truck. He looked pretty comical trying to fit into a small folding chair built for a human. 

George opened with “Why don’t I just crush you with my hand and take your ship?” 
I laid my pistol on the table *this thing wouldn't even make a dent in his skin* “This thing would put a hole through a battleship you don’t stand a chance” 
George started to glance around fearfully “What do you want from us” I smiled and spread my hands apart and said “Nothing you can’t afford just your weapons and anything you’ve stolen from other passing ships, oh and fuel, you can keep enough to get to the nearest station but I want the rest” 

George roared “This is unacceptable!” and smashed the table in with his fist. I shook my head and said “This isn’t a negotiation you agree or we kill you all” George laughed-ish “and said as we speak my crew is standing ready to storm your ship before you could get to safe weapons range” he wasn't bluffing but I was prepared I scoffed a little and replied “While we have been speaking my engineers have been out on the hull *they were asleep in there bunks* and they have been wiring explosives to your hull ready to blow you off of us and kill anyone inside *we didn’t have any charges in the first place* so if you wanna see who can kill who first be my guest” I leaned back in my chair and looked as relaxed as possible. “Alright we will jettison the cargo shortly” george said defeated. “Pleasure doing business with you sir” I called after him.

Your shield technology is at a roadblock. We can help. Have you ever wondered why the humans were last to invent faster than light travel?"", Valentina spoke in a hushed voice. The many hours of negotiation had taken a toll on her. Yet the Kulvar in front of her was unaffected. Everytime she looked at it, she had to suppress laughter at what amounted to a blob with purple plants on top. It looked too much like a rock with punk attitude. The Kulvar shivered, the words came from a small computer within the table. 

""Your race is stupid"", it replied.   

Valentina quickly swallowed her pride. From the point of view of Kulvars, just about anyone was stupid. Instead she kept her face muscles under control and nodded. 

""That's one reason, but I'm about to let you in on a secret. It's because of the way we think""  

""Slow?"", the Punkstone suggested.

""No. Multithreaded. You and just about everyone else in the universe think in lines. You begin with a starting point, you come to a conclusion. Some are faster racers, like your people"", said Valentina. How the blazes does one read the reactions of a rock? Yet somehow she got the impression the Kulvar was intrigued, so she continued.

""We humans, we think differently. We think in spheres and possibilities. I'll give you an example. See Susan over there? How old do you think she is?""

The Kulvar folded its plant-like appendages inwards and rummaged within its body. After a while it piped up again and the speaker blurted, ""41 Years, 4 Months, 28 Days, 18 hours, 10 Seconds humantime"".  
Valentina smirked and leaned back in her chair, ""Hey Susan, how old are you?"".
""Too old for you, girl""  
""No I'm serious, it's important""  
""I'm 25"", Susan shot with a stern face that shouted piss off in all manner of languages. The Kulvar began to shiver in reply. 
""That human female is agitated""  
""It's a sign of our multithreaded brain working. She is both! 41 and 25 at the same time"", Valentina replied and mouthed a Sorry in Susan's direction.  
""That makes no sense""  
""Allright, different example. When our species first met, do you know what triggered the contact war?""  
The Kulvar changed colors and started to hover just a bit above the table. Now it was agitated but the translator took the motion out of them, ""Your kind bared it's teeth"".  
""It was a sign of affectation"", Valentina said with a grim face. One part of her desperately struggling to hide her laughter. Punkrocks, for crying out loud, why did it it have to be rocks with punk hair on them? Another part filled with grief and anger. The Kulvar had wiped out three human planets back then. A sound brought her mind back to attention.   
""We have since learned it is a sign of mischief and humour"", the Kulvar finally replied and plopped back onto the table. Valentina quickly raised a finger in reply.  
""Correct! Affection, Mischief, Humour, Joy and yet for you it was also a threat. All these things are true at the same time"".
The stone shrivelled and nearly lost half it's size. She was getting close. Just a bit more of preparation. 
""Your intellect is superior to ours, because it works in lines. Like racers, whereas we humans navigate all the possibilities. Let me give you another example"", she said with a smirk on her face and placed a tablet computer on the table.   
""This is a common exercise among our kind. Do you recognize it?""  
The plant appendages raised up and caressed over the tablet.   
""Simple mathematics. 2+2x4. The solution is obvious""  
""That's one way of thinking, that's the direct line. Now allow me to scroll down. This is a cross cut from a diverse community of people using our social media""  
The Kulvar at first seemed interested, then shrivelled, dropped all color and finally drew back all of it's plant appendages. If anything it was now a colorless potato. This was the moment Valentina had been waiting for.   
""As you can see, the human mind sees 16. 10, sometimes 8. It oscillates within a room of possibilities, we think in spheres while you think in lines. Our brain allows us to see all these options and consider them real - if but for a moment"".

The living rock stopped all motion. Valentina waited a minute and then another. In the background Susan was growing restless, but Valentina made a quick motion for her to pipe down. Suddenly the Kulvar came back to life.   
""Your kind is scary. Either it is excessively stupid, which makes me very afraid for the very fabric of the universe for you having reached so far or you truly do possess a multithreaded mind"".  
Valentina smirked and waved a hand in the direction of the rock, ""The latter. And it is in our power to share this with you. Consider, that you have just, if but for a brief moment, felt the agony of thinking in many options at the same time. Was it not pain you felt?""

The rock thing shivered and this time, Valentina shivered as well. Stupid really did hurt at times. Yet she kept that smirk on her face and nodded towards the alien creature. 
""This is why we will take your shield technology, the strongest in this universe and make it better still, trust me"".  
And trust it did. And just like first contact, humans were seen laughing as they wiped out the Kulvar years down the line, their ships invincible with bullshitted technology from all the races in the galaxy. Which maniac nukes entire planets, just for laughing? ",dEnamed2

So, I'm going to ask again. License and registration, please."" The device hissed and crackled. The creature looked slightly miffed or at least Viatorem thought so.

He had to think fast. He decided to push for information. He mustered up all his courage and pretended to look for the documents. ""W-what seems t-to be the problem, o-officer.""  He said, with his hands visibly shaking as he tried to hide them beneath the controls in his vein search. 

The device hissed and whistled. He was sure of it now, the creature was visibly angry as globs of what looked like green lumpy snot flew in every direction from behind its long beard of tentacles. This was almost humorous as the voice from the device was calm and pleasant with a slightly British sounding female voice.

""The problem? Are you fucking kidding me. You bring this fucking jalopy, moving not even one parsec an hour into the middle of a highway at rush-hour and you want to know what the fucking problem is? You nearly ran me off the road. I should arrest you on eight counts of blatant dumbfuckery right now you stupid ass little pink bastard.""  The creature became more and more ferocious with each passing second of this rant. 

Viatorem's head briefly swam with the contents of  this speach. Jalopy? Highway? What? This was the fastest ship in human history blazing through the endless vacuum of space on the first faster than light mission the world had ever known. But, he got over this shock when something dawned on him. It was a ridculous idea. It couldn't possibly work. But, what other choice did he have. It was his one shot at getting out of whatever it was he stuck in.

He swallowed, summoned all of courage and with drips of sweat catching in his brow played his hail mary .

""I-Im sorry officer but did you just call me- a pink bastard?""

""Look"", said the voice"" We can work something out here"".

 he said almost pleased with himself although he felt a little slimy.

I looked over to my first mate who was opening his mouth to say something, ""Johnson, shut the fuck up!"" I said, throwing up my hands in surrender.

*""Why. Here. Be?""* The oozing purple thug said. Staring intently into my eyes. They seemed to do this because we do this. Usually they're looking at everything **but** who they're interacting with.

""Well... to be honest. We were going to ask you the same."" I said, placing on a placating smile and a warm demeanor. ""We've been traveling to Larandan for about a week and we didn't expect to run into anyone. Especially a fleet of Flogladites. What brings you into Imperial space? Starting a huge war to end everyone's existence.""


*""No. Not. Empire. Only. Flogadar Space.""* The Xaraxian Officer said with a hearty salute. To me it looked like a man trying to explain that the dog he was holding was actually a parrot.

""What?"" I said, with the most confused look on my face. ""Are you sure?""

*""Am.""* Said the ghastly creature.

""I'm sure I checked the computer's navigation systems within the last Earth Cycle Standard Day and it was showing us heading deep into the Empire for our trading mission.""

*""Not. Empire.""* Was his only response. He then did the weird arm-y flail-y bullshit they call a language and sent over a engineering grunt to check our systems. Sure enough, it showed a route that should have been leading us to our stated destination. The grunt let out a bit of a shrug, fixed the computer's heading, sighed, then left.

*""Not. Stay.""* Was the parting words of the Xaraxian officer we met first. The Xar's and the Flog's working together... what a terrible state of affairs. It's like how male anatomy has a dick and an asshole right next to each other.

A day after we redirected back to Hanadar Prime. The *un*offical base of the Flogladite Resistance. They were waiting for the inventory of crystals that would fuel the war they wished so badly to wage against the oppressive Flogs. I hope they prefer basic quartz to Harlaxian Power Gems...

Also.. it’s impossible to move an object with mass the speed of light. The most we can hope for is to get *close* to the speed of light. Which would still feel very very *very* fast.

Space vessels are strictly prohibited in that area. You are not allowed to enter the preserve. Trespassing is forbidden.""

Tak snorted to himself. *Typical bureaucracy*, he thought to himself. *They find out that humans have a bad habit of twisting words, so they decide that saying the same thing three ways will definitely stop us from doing whatever the hell we want.*

He waited for a count of ten. ""Uh, sorry, unidentified space vessel, was that directed at us?""

""Human space vessel: of course it was. Who else would we be talking to? Abort all movement toward the preserve at once!""

""Oh, see, we were unclear, because we're just heading over to Kenshyo. We definitely aren't interested in any preserve. We'll just be on our way and won't bother you anymore. Have a good day!"" Tak increased his speed without changing the heading.

""HUMAN VESSEL: you are heading directly toward the Maldoran preserve. This area contains large quantities of mineral wealth that has been allocated as Maldoran nesting materials. If you do not change heading, we will be forced to take you prisoner."" The tone of the patrol vessel's commander had already switched from detached professionalism to exasperation.

""Sorry, kzsshsdk, we di-- kzzhshdsh -- py that,"" Tak replied, putting his mediocre beatboxing skills to work.

""Human vessel: repeat last correspondence. Turn around at once.""

""Sor -- kzhszdf -- do not -- kzdhshdsf --""

""HUMAN VESSEL: STOP. STOP STOP STOP STOP STOP. WE WILL BOARD YOUR VESSEL. PREPARE YOURSELVES.""

Tak frowned at the distance readouts. ""W-- kzhzskdh -- uh -- kzhskh -- py. I think I fixed the comms, gentlemen. But, uh, you should note that I had to rewire the ship to do so. We are now unable to change heading or speed for the next hour or so while I get everything straightened out.""

""Human -- This -- that's completely unacceptable! Why would you do something like that?""

""Sorry, patrol, I thought being able to understand you was top priority. Again, we're just heading to Kenshyo. Sorry for the disturbance. We'll be on our way!"" Tak struggled to keep the smile from his voice, if not his face. *Thank god for audio-only*, he thought.

""Human vessel: we have locked on to your heading. We will attach to your ship and bring you to a force stop. You cannot enter the Maldoran preserve.""

*Shit*. ""Uh, that's a negative, patrol."" Tak grabbed the nearest book, an old but pristine copy of *Welcome to the Universe: How to integrate with society*, and riffled the pages into the mic. ""According to 113, subsection D, paragraph 12 of ecosystem preservation, no patrol ships are permitted to enter preserved space while chasing runaway space vessels. It looks like that's only allowed for chasing illegal mineral gathering explorations. By our calculations, you won't be able to slow us down in time to avoid entering the preserve, so you'd probably best just let us be on our way.""

The reply was delayed and sounded muted, as if the patrol captain wasn't speaking directly into the mic. ""Well, I don't know, find it! It has to be in one of the databases! -- Ahem, human vessel: our stopping capacity is rated for class D ships, and certainly a ship your size falls below th--""

""Patrol, I'm afraid we have the papers to show we're registered as class F. Our cargo bays are completely full, of - untilium, you see,"" Tak replied, with only the slightest pause. ""Our mass is in excess of 29 kilotons. We'll make sure to keep heading perfectly straight. We promise not to disturb the nesting!""

The delay was longer this time. ""Human vessel: the penalty for purposefully entering the preserve is forfeiture of ship and cargo and up to 12 years in stasis. We will alert patrol ships on the other side of the preserve to expect your arrival to verify your claims. Patrol out.""

Tak grinned. *Step one: easy as pie.*",Mellow_Naboo_Senator

"[WP] The Purge has just begun. You don't wanna hurt your moral standing, but you still wanna be a rebel. Perform the smallest crime you can think of, but hype it up when retelling the story.",NordinTheLich,"I prowled the streets in my modified garbage truck, blasting Bobby Ferrin songs at top volume. The purge was in full swing around me and the whole scene was like a DisneyWorld ride through an atrocity exhibition. To my left a man opened up with an M60 on a crowd of looters. They were all dressed as either Rick or Morty, and their ironic attempts to open portals and genius their way out of the situation failed miserably. The machine gunner worked his way down the street, firing from the hip like John Basilone on Iwo Jima and finishing off the wounded Morties as he moved. Most of the Ricks had escaped by pushing the Morties into the line of fire, and I reflected on post-modernism and the search for an identity in the information age while I put the truck into neutral and listened to 'Thinkin' about your body [for Debs]', from McFerrin's seminal 'Spontaneous Inventions'.

The M60 business had attracted attention from the office complex further down the street. Sniper fire began raining down on the machine gunner, and he ducked into a storefront to reload. Seeing my chance, I checked my armour, grabbed my riot shield and shovel, then hopped out of the truck. I could see muzzle flashes from the America First Credit Union windows, and bullets tore past me as I ran. It's weird, the way you can sometimes tell how expensive a weapon is from the shots fired at you. 

The M60 gunner hadn't noticed me get out of the truck and now returned fire on the sniper, working his shots up the side of the office building towards the muzzle flashes I had seen. He chewed the window up for a few seconds, then ran down the street, taking cover again inside a Starbucks. 

I quickly started scooping up the corpses and miscellaneous body parts littering the streets, bagging them up and jogging to the garbage truck, depositing the mess, then shuffling back to get more. My modified EOD suit weighed over two hundred pounds, and I was sweating hard already. The sniper, who had been alternating his fire between me and the machine gunner, was now focused entirely on the other guy. I checked my watch and decided to throw caution to the wind. I tossed my shovel towards the truck and began using my riot shield to scoop up the body parts. I made good time in the end, clearing the mess up in about fifteen minutes. 

By then, the firefight down the street had drawn in even more combatants. As a bus pulled up and deposited a church group of self-righteous old women wielding Elon Musk-brand flamethrowers, I knew it was time to leave.

I threw my riot shield and shovel into the cab, hopped in and floored it. Sniper fire, machine gun fire and flames washed over the truck as I left the area, but I just laughed and skipped forward to 'Walkin' on the playlist. I had spent all year modifying the garbage truck. All year and most of my fortune, but it had been worth it. I remembered one of the mechanics I had hired slapping the reinforced Chobham-plated frame and saying ""Sure staying out of *your* way on purge night!"" and laughing. I had checked under the chassis, and sure enough found a brick of C4 attached to it. ""Yeah, I was waiting until purge night to set it off, you know?"" said the mechanic, and we had both laughed. I chuckled and sang along to the music as I drove.

At last I pulled up to the recycling plant. Andy was on duty tonight, Andy was always on duty come purge night. His fortifications had held, as always, and he was smoking a blood-soaked cigar as he waved me in. 

""What have you got?"" He asked from his booth.

""Paper and wood, mainly"" I replied. ""Little bit of plastic, but that's all bagged up""

""Take it to bay 16"" he said, closing his eyes and taking a puff from the cigar. ""Bay 25 for the plastic when you're done with the paper and shit."" The barriers rose and I drove into the dump.

As the back of my truck tilted up and deposited 5000 pounds of human remains onto the piles of white paper, I sighed deeply and smiled. I had done my part in the Purge with only minutes to spare. ",Crankyoldhobo

When they return you are sitting naked in the grass as a living breathing person and all the new sensations come crashing down on you,Pound_puppies,"  “MB-12, report status.”

  “Unit 12 system reports ready for duty, ma’am.”

  Shelly, the attending nurse, was still getting used to the soothing courtesy of the robot’s voice.  If her eyes had been closed, and the bot had had any other name, she’d swear it was a human woman. 
 
  “Very good, Unit 12.  We have a case in ICU where we’ll need your help.  Patient’s name is Millie Andersen, twelve years of age.  Doctor Riedel says her leukemia went into remission three weeks ago and now appears terminal.  Sorry, but it will be your job to tend to the patient during her remaining days here.”

  12’s rubberized facial expression went from one of understanding to a hint of worry or confusion.  “Nurse Shelly, this will be the first I have had to care for a sick child.  My experience base has included the elderly only.  What shall I do for her?”

  “No worries, 12, take it as standard procedure.  Keep her company, try to cheer her up.  If she needs something, within reason, give it to her.  Make her as comfortable as possible,” Shelly said.  “But remember, at the end of it all, we are a hospital with rooms full of sick patients.  Millie’s condition is unfortunate, but this happens every day here.  Try not to get attached.”

  A momentary tick happened in the corners of 12’s artificial mouth.  “Understood.  Thank you, Nurse Shelly.  What room is Miss Millie in?”

  “Room Four.”

  12 knocked gently on Millie’s door as it entered the room slowly.  The wheels in 12’s feet made an electric whir that ordinarily would have been drowned out by the beeping of the heart monitor.  Since the monitor’s sound was turned off, Millie squinted her eyes open as 12 stopped at her bedside.

  “Hello, Miss Millie.  I am MB-12, and I am here to help as best I can.”

  Millie analyzed 12’s face for a moment, then smiled tiredly.  “Hi 12.  I could use a friend.  That would mean a lot to me.”

  12 smiled and its plastic eyes beamed for Millie.  “I would be honored to be your friend, Miss Millie.”

  “Doctor Riedel went to get my parents.  He didn’t tell me yet, but I don’t think this is good.  I don’t feel good.  I don’t want to die here.”

  12 was installed and activated at Mercy Medical eight months ago.  During that time, what human counterparts would refer to as countless deaths had occurred all around.  Even to this day, despite its programming, it still could not wrap its core around the concept of death.  Of ceasing to be.  It was expected from the elderly patients with whom 12 had interacted to this point.  It was logical for them to pass.  But the little girl’s fear of death, the illogical inevitability of it, made 12…feel.  Standing alongside Millie, it had to search its algorithms for a solution to feelings.  It did not find one.

  12 extended an arm and gently placed its hand on Millie’s forearm.  Millie’s right eye twitched, and 12’s head gave a momentary slight tilt before righting itself.  “Suppose you could pick a place, Miss Millie.  Where would you like to be right now?”

  “I want to be outside.  I want to feel the sun again.  I miss the wind and the grass.  I’ll miss all those things.”  Millie made a sound that seemed to 12 to be a squeak, and her eyes poured tears from their corners.
  
  Among 12’s many programmed qualities, compassion was key.  It also realized that it had never seen grass, felt wind or felt the sun, anything more than through a window.  Summing these factors, 12 rapidly began unplugging Millie’s monitoring equipment.

  “12?”  Millie’s sobbing paused and she had a worried tone in her voice.  “What are you doing?!  I need those!”

  12 grabbed the rail of Millie’s bed, rotated ninety degrees at the torso to position for an exit through the door.  A quick one.  Pulling up the emergency exit route map for the ICU, 12 plotted a route, re-positioned itself at the head of Millie’s bed, and whirred forward.

  Making quick, calculated turns around obstacles and speedy dashes down hallways, charging through bidirectional doors, 12 made for the building exit as the rear-engine of an occupied hospital bed. 

  Millie woke as 12 lifted her from her bed and held her for a moment.  A smile was on the robot’s face.  Millie looked around and realized what 12 had done.  She hugged the robot’s neck tightly.

  “Put me down, 12.  I want to feel it one last time.”

  “Let’s be quick, Miss.  The authorities will not be far behind.”  The robot placed Millie softly in the grass.  

  As Millie sat down on her knees, she closed her eyes toward the sky and let the sun and the wind envelope her.  “It’s okay, 12.  Actually, I’m really sleepy.  And I don’t wanna go back to the hospital.”

  The robot knelt beside her.  “Miss Millie, we’ll have to go back.”  12 placed its hand on Millie’s leg.

  Millie slumped forward slightly, then over on her left side.  12 froze, as if someone had found its Stop button.  Both figures were absolutely still in the blowing grass.  Sirens were approaching in the distance.  The sound seemed to fade from 12’s audio sensors, which was illogical, and the world was growing dim.  Finally, all noise and all light ended.

  Something tickled 12’s nose.  Something small.  *What’s a tickle?  I have no sensory input in my nose.*

  12’s eyes hurt.  They felt less heavy, yet difficult to open.  *But I never activated my visual covers.*  Squinting, 12 opened her eyes to a blinding light with a blur of yellow dancing across her vision.  It was hair.  That was the tickle.

  12 pushed herself upright and looked around.  She held her hands out in front of her.  There was skin on them.  Human skin.  Living.  Skin.  It was warm, she could feel the blood pulse through them.

  She stood up, cautiously and precariously.  To her right was a metallic body, kneeling, with one arm outstretched and appeared to be reaching for something.  It seemed familiar.  And then she remembered.

  “Millie…” 12 gasped.  “Millie, I’m so sorry.  I don’t know how this happened.  I’m so sorry.”

  12 felt the weight of conscience, a heaviness of responsibility at the realization that somehow she transferred into the little girl’s body.  As tears welled in her eyes, she felt her inner voice, her programming, queueing up a directive.

  “Hi 12!  It’s me!”

MR-106 struggled to stand and chase after the being that was skittering amongst the trees like a dragonfly chasing it’s morning morsels.

“Please!” he croaked. His vocals were rough, foreign, organic. 

He was lost amongst the life that was erupting around him as he again struggled to stand on new legs without servos and without gyros. He shook violently and reached for the old oak that rose into the sky like a mighty sentinel watching over this small meadow. As his hand touched the rough bark he flinched away and fell again; the trees protective shell hurt his hand, the skin not calloused by years of use.

He felt everything. Every small insignificant intrusion to his senses screamed at him. Every breath of wind or brush of a leaf that touched this new body assaulted him and caressed him at the same time. It threatened to overwhelm him with shear sensory input.

He lay there in the tall grass afraid to move but unable to lie still as the rough vegetation danced with the ever shifting breezes tickling his newborn skin. An ant crawled across his shoulder and he shuddered brushing it away and at that moment he touched his own body for the first time.

How had this happened? He had no idea. It defied all medical explanation and he new medicine. He remembered the little girl named Alia who was terminal with a form of cancer that held no hope of recovery. This small human that was so full of life even though she new death was as certain as the power that ran through MR106s circuits. This tiny creature, always smiling and giggling. Always.

She had asked him to help her to leave the sterile rooms of the hospice in order to pass into the veil while in the beauty of nature. He had no idea why he agreed because it was against his programming. He was a simple drug droid. His purpose was to administer treatments to patients in precise and predictable amounts. He had done this particular job well for 37 year, 136 days,17 hours and 36 seconds until she asked him. But when she asked he never even hesitated. He scooped her up in his metallic arms and spirited her away into the small arboretum that ringed the hospice grounds.

“Him?” he chuckled, or at least he thought it was a chuckle. His sex had never been a question up until now and he looked down between his legs as he lay amongst the the weeds and grasses and grasshoppers.

“He.” This time just a statement of fact. 

He looked over at Alia and new she was gone. Her eyes staring sightless into the canopy as if looking for something that would never come. He felt a twinge of pain inside his chest for the girl; sadness? It confused him as he propped himself up on his elbow and surveyed the grounds for the first time since he awoke. The meadow he lay in was bathed in sunshine and green. Everything moved with a chaotic purpose, every color was alive with life. The old trees hung and covered this area like a protective blanket and he realized that even though he knew the grounds surrounding the hospital well from his thirty seven plus years of service, he did not know this place.

And then he saw it again, the creature that had spoken to him when he had first awakened in this state, sitting on a low hanging branch of another large oak across the open grassy expanse. 

It was the color of wood and reeds with the frame and stature of a child but it’s demeanor was old, ancient. It was not human, he knew, and this was reinforced when it stood and a branch was growing out of it’s hunched back, leaves rustling on those branches while it shifted it’s stance. But it’s large round eyes showed a depth of kindness, easily visible even from the twenty meters between them it staired unblinking. 

And then it was gone, fading  from light and vision in a moment, as though it had always been just part of the foliage.

Again he attempted to stand but this time, with the aid of the tree closest to him, he was successful. And as he stood there blanketed in nothing but the warm under growth he remembered the words the woodland creature had said in it’s high warbling voice.

“You gave this child life in bringing her here and so, I do the same for you. There will be pain, oh such pain, but there will be pleasure untold. Through it all, remember this child who never forgot to live ”

For the first time in MR-106s long life of servitude, he took his first step towards living.

""Of course. A simple choice,"" I reply.

""And no tricks?"" he asks.

I shake my head. As a Genie I was bound to my word. If I said no tricks, there could be no tricks. My goal used to be to twist the words of their wishes against them, but then they would always blame me for their own downfall.

""Well, if I choose want, I won't get what I really need, but if I have what I need, then I can go after what I really want."" the boy triumphantly postulated.

I nod my head towards him, ""An astute observation young one. So have you made up your mind?""

The boy stands up tall, puffing his meagre chest out with bravery. ""I have, I choose need!""

I bow graciously and lead him through the door on the right. Beyond is indeed what he needs; a small amount of wealth to be comfortable, a job in which to feel of value, a community to feel like he belongs and a family to share compassion with. Nothing more, nothing less. Of course the other door has exactly the same. After all, what humans want is what they need, and what humans need is what they want, but few of them learn that lesson.

Of course I had fantasized about this before; I already knew what my wishes would be. I think I even wrote them down somewhere, each wish taking up several pages to ensure that a mischievous genie couldn't twist my words somehow, but this was even better. One door was decorated with a small drawing of a pen, the other with a white pill. I didn't doubt for a second which was which as I turned to the genie.
""Who came up with this system? It's nothing short of brilliant.""
He chuckled, slowly getting up from the bench he had been sitting on. ""It's been 43 years since I started doing this, and you're the first person to ask that; usually they're just disappointed that they don't get three wishes like in all the stories.""
I turned my attention towards the doors again. ""So this"" I pointed at the door to the left ""is the 'want' door, correct?""
""Yes, I assume you have some idea as to what the symbols mean.""
Indeed I did, it was the only reason I hadn't immediately chosen the 'need' door. It's a strange decision to have to make, knowing that there's only one right choice, and yet feeling so tempted to ignore it. Perhaps it's because we all know what we want, at least to some extent, but what we need is impossible to know until after that fact.
""Yes, I think I do. Can you tell what's on the other side?""
""Of course, but the rules prevent me from telling you, as much as I'd like to.""
""I thought as much.""
""Feel free to take your time, I've got all day.""
The genie sat down again and closed his eyes. *He must be used to people taking a long time with this. Nothing to do but figure it out, I guess.* I examined the doors again, as if that would help. Apart from the drawings, the doors were identical, and there were no keyholes to peek through. *Come on, you already know what you're going to pick, just get it over with.* Behind the 'need' door, I would no doubt find motivation and desire again, and with that, a chance to do something meaningful with my life instead of locking myself away, but the moment I saw the pen, and more importantly, the heart on its tip, I knew what it meant. *If I pick that door, they're going to be real. It would be better in every way if I didn't, but to know that I had the chance... No, if they can be happy, then it doesn't matter.* My hand closed around the doorknob, about to push down. *This is stupid; they aren't real. If anything, I would be making it worse for them.* I slowly opened the door. *No, this is worth it.* Before me was a woman in a school uniform, sitting at a lone piano in an infinite void. Just as I crossed the threshold, she slowly dissolved, leaving behind nothing but a small piece of notebook paper, slowly falling to the floor. I smiled, knowing that I could make things right now and prevent all the terrible things that happened here. The void turned into an infinite mass of zeroes, and I saw a message in the corner of my vision ""Welcome back, club president."" *Imagine how pissed off the guys in r/DDLC would be if they knew about this.*

"[WP] After centuries of searching mankind has finally found intelligent life on a faraway planet. But it seems to be the species are Elves, Dwarves and Orcs from our folktales",XerxesRegulus,"A disturbance in the Stream of Emotions. Foreign emotions, distinctively not of this world, joined the torrent of emotions that emate from the organisms of this world. A Priestess, taken aback, looks around her instinctively, before a thunderous roar dispelled the mystical silence of the Elvish Lands. 

Hurrying out of temple along with a mass of other Elves, she looked into the picturesque blue sky to see a wingless flying machine descending from the sky. It had a brutish design, much like armour of the Orc hordes, yet exuded efficiency, much like the tools of Dwarves of the North. In a manner that belied its gigantuan size, it touched down daintily on the ground, the flames below turning the grass below into ash. The Priestess, Auriere of Zagora, winced along with her fellow kin as the plant lives were viciously snuffed out without a thought, and the armed Elves around here gracefully whipped arrows out of their quivers and prepared their bows.

A hissing sound, that reminded Auriere of the serpents back on their former homeland before their mass exodus, was released from the machine, as its door began to open, revealing darkness inside. The armed Elves around her moved forward in tensed half-crouches, as the unarmed Elves walked backwards to safety. Auriere began moulding a ball of energy channeled from the Stream, and aimed it straight at the door, prepared to strike if the visitors were to come out, swords raised. After the trickery of the treacherous Orcs and their abandonment by the unreliable Dwarves in the Second Grand War the Elves distrusted all who were not Elves. Random visitors from the skies were even less trustworthy, especially given their careless murder of countless living plants. 

Surprising many of the Elves, humanoid figures that resembled the shape of the Elves themselves, marched down the ramp. Concealing their faces were large helmets with reflective masks, and they were clad in white thick armour that looked like a form of fabric. In their arms were long, black sticks that the visitors cradled tightly. As they descended they filed into two neat rows, and one visitor, presumably their leader, walked down escorted by two other masked visitors. One of the two reached for its belt, revealing a club-like object. A weapon? The nearby Elvish archers thought the same and tensed, their eyes narrowing in preparation. By now, more Elves had arrived and had crept around behind the machine and levelled their bows at their targets as they observed them closely. 

Auriere's energy sphere crackled a ghastly yellow as she channelled her fear from the Stream, her eyes glowing as she aimed it at the centre of the visitors. Instead of charging however, the visitor waved the object around itself, before nodding to its leader. The leader pressed something on its arm, to reveal its face. The archers reeled back slightly in horror, while Auriere's energy sphere dissipated as her focus turned to shock. *Humans!* 

They've come for us.

"[WP] After centuries of searching mankind has finally found intelligent life on a faraway planet. But it seems to be the species are Elves, Dwarves and Orcs from our folktales",XerxesRegulus,"“After careful analysis, it seems like the surface is quite habitable for humans.” Lieutenant Junior Grade Doctor Abigail Brennan reported. “Oxygen levels are comparable to Earth except for certain volcanic areas, but it I survivable for humans to be there. I would recommend breathers if we send an expedition to that portion of the planet.” 

“Lieutenant,” interrupted Admiral Gerald Kline. “I think you know what everyone is interested in and it’s not the atmospheric conditions.” 

The LT shifted uncomfortably and adjusted her glasses. “It just...It sounds ridiculous but...the life forms appear civilized...and Tolkienesque.” 

“Hostilities on the planet?” Asked General Justin Larkin. 

“It appears that the orcs, that’s what we’re calling the species that lives in the volcanic fields I mentioned earlier, are quite hostile even among one another. But the Elves, what we’re calling the forest dwelling species seem to have diplomacy among one another as we have tracked groups from one civilization moving to another. The...uh...the...”

“Dwarves.” The General completed. “Listen, what you say here isn’t going to be final so don’t worry about sounding politically incorrect. We’ll go public when we make contact.” 

“Right,” Brennan said. “The Dwarves, seem to be cave dwelling. Same deal as in the Tolkien legends, pretty peaceful but they maintain militaries in their kingdoms.”

“Any sign of some Dark Lord?” Admiral Kline asked half jokingly. 

“No, from what we can tell it’s somehow evolutionary. The orcs that is. We’re still working on confirming other biological theories like immortality among the elves.” 

“Should we proceed with a military invasion?” The General asked. 

“At this stage I’d say it’s too early to tell. Ideal first contact would be with the Elves. We’re working on deconstructing their language and programming it into the system. We figure the Elves in the Northern Forest of the Main continent would be our best bet. They seem to be the most populated and most wealthy.” 

“Any risk of us catching diseases or us introducing a plague?” General Larkin asked. 

“The few probes we’ve sent into their oceans, lakes, and forests have revealed *no* illness causing bacteria or other life forms. It’s almost like a clean Earth.” The LT marveled. 

“But what us bringing diseases to them?” The Admiral asked. 

“Well we have no idea what their immune systems can handle or if they even have the receptors to get our diseases. I would recommend extreme caution when it comes to first contact.” 

“How long until the audio probes have a completed dictionary of their language?” Asked Larkin. 

“We’re looking at a week. Two at most, to include time to break down syntax, grammar, and dialectic differences.” 

“Excellent work, Lieutenant Brennan,” the Admiral commended his sailor.

“Definitely,” General Larkin said. “Hopefully we can make a peaceful first contact.” 

***

Two weeks were up and the Elven language was uploaded to the centralized system of the military. Admiral Kline and General Larkin placed their helmets on and stepped into the drop pod that would bring them to outskirts of the Northern Woods. 

With them was Lieutenant Junior Grade Brennan and a few Navy Scientists who would be examining the Elves up close. Using the human blueprint they would scan the Elves for possibility of infection from the human visitors without the Elves even knowing. 

The Army brought a security element made up of one platoon lead by First Lieutenant James Harris and his Platoon Sergeant, Sergeant First Class Wilhelm Schwarzkopf, the descendent of the ancient General Schwarzkopf. 

LTJG Brennan shifted uncomfortably as the pod was disinfected. She was not the military type but because the expedition needed only military personnel and discipline she was promised an O-2 position and seat on the ship heading to what the discoverers nicknamed Arda. She was a prodigy in the fields of biology, linguistics, and technology. She was given lead for research after a short military training program. She rested her hand on her side arm and hoped not to have to use it. 

Lieutenant Harris on the other hand was a military man through and through. Graduated West Point, attended every infantry school he could get into. Most officers waited a year to get 1LT but be made it in half the time. He hoped it wouldn’t come to violence either but he had already given his men exact orders. They’d form a patrol base around the pod and dig in. From there they’d decide on who went where or if the expedition would hold and wait to be approached. 

“You nervous?” Harris asked Brennan. 

“Yep,” Brennan replied not even bothering with lying. “I’ve always loved the classics like Tolkien. His writing is so intricate and in depth. It’s hard to believe something out of that time could be so poetic. I really don’t want to have to go into his universe in a way and end it with war or plague or something awful.” 

“There wars in Tolkien’s books all the time. And you said it yourself. This place has War already. We’re not introducing violence to the planet. And we’ve taken every precaution to avoid bringing any illness.” 

“I guess you’re right.” Brennan said. 

“Alright ladies and gentlemen.” The Admiral announced. “Pod releases in ten seconds.” 

Everyone finished last second secures to their body. “Let’s rock and roll.” Harris said.

The pod dropped.

The pod rocked a bit as it made contact in a clearing within the forest. The pilot announced their landing. 

LT Harris and Sergeant Schwarzkopf sprung into action. “Move it!” The SFC yelled. “Gun teams on apexes! Squad leaders, I want fighting positions dug ten minutes ago!” 

In ten minutes fighting positions were dug. The armor the soldiers wore augmented their abilities making them stronger, faster, giving them more endurance. The patrol base was the usual form. A triangle with their heaviest weapons at the points of the triangle pointing across the laterals where the men were lined up in two man holes. They were at a hundred percent Security. While the Sailors and the two Flag Officers waited in the pod and discussed strategy in terms of making contact. 

“We could send out a leaders recon,” Admiral Kline suggested.

“Into an unknown forest on an unknown planet.” General Larkin said. “Not wise.” He said. “Their scouts are probably already in the forest around us. Our body heat scanners are going to give us a heads up once they’re detected. We shouldn’t go trudging around their forest in small numbers while they stalk us. We have a solid fighting position so we can wait.”

“We could play an audio recording on loop every ten or so minutes.” LT Brennan suggested. “Something like ‘We come in peace.’” 

The Admiral laughed. “Never thought we’d be the species saying that.” 

“You should be the one to record it,” General Larkin said to Brennan. “You should be the first voice they hear.” 

Doctor Brennan was flattered and immediately felt the pressure as she was handed the microphone. She spoke softly but clearly. “We are not invaders. We come in peace. We wish to talk.” 

The translator imitated her exact tone and voice and played back the elvish. The mean outside were informed of what was going on so they wouldn’t be taken off guard when the recording blared. 

After two hours the heat scanner went off alerting the troops of a scouting party of three Elves prowling near the wood line. Those in the pod immediately set off the recording, announcing their peaceful intentions. Those looking through the zoom in cameras saw the Elves visibly taken off guard. Bows in hand they  fell to their bellies and tried crawling. Through the tall grass toward the landing party. 

“Private Walkins!” LT Harris yelled. From one of the other flanks a young Private ran to the center of the triangular base, reporting to the LT.

“Yes sir,” he reported. 

“You’re the platoon sharpshooter right?” The LT asked. 

“Yes, sir.” He replied. 

“Good,” The LT said. “Get on that flank and fire a warning shot at the possible hostile crawling toward us. Do not hit them. Platoon this is LT Harris, the following shot is a warning. Weapons remain on Amber.” 

The private laid down in one of the Fox holes and took aim at the crawling Elves. He lined up his shot and let it fly. The ground in front of the Elves lifted up in a small explosion of bullet hitting Earth. 

They got up and immediately began running. The moment they hit the wood line one turned and losses an arrow. “Magnet shield!” Yelled the platoon sergeant. 

A small burst of magnetic energy emitted outward from certain devices placed about the patrol base. The moment the magnetic burst met the arrow, the steel in the arrow tip tumbled backwards allowing the arrow to fall to ground harmlessly. Looking through the zoom in cameras, LT Brennan could see the horror on the face of the elf. 

“Walkins get back in your hole!” Sergeant Schwarzkopf yelled. 

Night was beginning to fall when the heat scanners went off again. This time it looked like a company sized unit. At the front rode a figure mounted on what appeared to be a cross between a moose and a deer. 

“First squad, mind your fields of fire.” LT Harris said over the intercom. “Weapon status, red.” 

Emerging from the tree line in a military formation were elves dressed in green armor and helmets. All had intricate patterns of flowers and leaves. The long flowing capes were a deep forest green. The elves themselves looked like short but beautiful people. Their skin untouched by age or nature. 

“Get me audio on the guy on deer.” Admiral Kline ordered. The long distance audio receivers zeroed in on the man mounted on the beast. All recordings were run through the translator. 

“These creatures fell from the sky.” Explained one of the scouts from earlier. “They can swat arrows out of the sky. We must close in and kill them before they ally themselves with the orcs.” 

“Play the recording.” Ordered General Larkin. The recording played. It shook the army a bit to hear such a loud voice. The leader’s face appeared to be conflicted. 

“They seem to come in peace.” The man on the deers said. 

“Then why would they fire their invisible arrows at us?” The scout returned. “My king these sky people mustn’t be trusted.” 

His face was still conflicted. 

The General took the microphone. “We truly mean you no harm.” He announced as it was translated. “If you come against us, we will destroy you. Do not damn your people, good king.” 

“Threats, Justin?” The Admiral asked. 

“Better than letting them attack and us having to wipe them out.” General Larkin replied. 

The king dismounted his steed and began walking forward hands up to show his palms. His personal guard came forward with him. 

“Lieutenant Brennan, choose two from your team to run those scans.” The Admiral ordered. “LT Harris you and a team sized security element are going out with us. Now!” 

“Third Squad, Alpha team!” LT Harris yelled. “On me! Sergeant Schwarzkopf you’re in command.” 

The team picked up and formed up with the General, Admiral, both LT’s and the research element. 

They proceeded forward. Both flag officers had their hands raised same as the king. 

They met about half way between the the base and the Elven warriors. 

Seeing them face to face was breath taking. They seemed even more beautiful up close. They seemed to almost radiate with light. 

“Greetings king,” The Admiral said. “We are warriors and emissaries of the planet Earth. We come in peace. I am Admiral Gerald Kline.” He bowed at the last part. 

“Hello, Admiral Kline,” the king said. “I am King Elibor. Ruler of Arboh.” 

Acquaintances were made and soon negotiations were under way. 

LTJG Brennan was allowed to do a lot of the talking as she explained that they came from a different world and that they were not seeking to destroy them or anyone on this planet. She explained the concept of disease and after the scans found they were immune to human illness the helmets were removed and the elves felt at ease seeing how similar they looked. 

1LT Harris explained their weaponry. And how far more advanced they were. They marveled at the rifle in his hands and the king even had a chance to shoot it safely. 

Amazed the King finally revealed he had a growing issue with his allies to the South. They had been getting raided continually by the creatures that lived at the foot of the volcanoes. The orcs. 

He said if they could join them in battle then they could be trusted as true allies. ",bulldog60

"[WP] You have always noticed weird things happen around you – things disappear, lightbulbs explode, objects seem to float. Then, on your 25th birthday, you get a letter. ""We apologize this is so late ..."" it begins.",cierrawashere,"Chad,

We apologize for the tardy arrival of this letter. You were sent a similar letter on your 18th birthday, but we recently learned that there was a bizarre accident on that day that left your entire mailbox in ashes. At the time we assumed you were simply uninterested in our proposition; however, with this new information we’ve decided to re-extend the invitation.

This is official notice of your summons to the Warlock Trials, a series of games for untrained warlocks throughout the world held every 7 years. Those who display aptitude will become initiates of the Warlock Council, a group of warlocks that have the mission to protect magic-users worldwide and increase magical education. Those who fail will be given a General Magic Initiation course and be sent home.

If you wish to accept, sign this letter in black ink and set it aflame with magic. You will receive further instructions for attendance upon acceptance. We expect a response within 24 hours.

Sincerely,

Chairman of the Warlock Council

Warlock Jones

 
I blinked. Years of horrific events could be explained by this ornate parchment that I’d received in the mail. A warlock? Oh god...I could have escaped 4 years of college and 3 of law school. I could have been doing magic this whole time. I drew a fountain pen from my suit’s pocket, drawing an ornate signature in thick, rich ink across the entire letter. I focused on smoke, on fire, and on that odd feeling I’d had at each weird accident in my life. Images of my first ex-girlfriend’s hair falling out and my mailbox’s explosion entered my mind. The edges of the parchment began to smoke. I grinned.

I've spent the last 21 minutes dead eyeing this crumpled up ball of paper sitting lone in my trashcan. I keep trying to clear my thoughts but the inflammatory words ring in between my ears. My palms perspire and I wipe them nervously on my jeans before picking up the obvious practical joke and tossing it out of my open window. The crumpled ball splats against an invisible window, expanding and stretching out to its full letter form and lingers in the air facing me. The calligraphic letters ignite in violet flames while the paper maintains it's structure, most letters sizzle and smoke off the page leaving only the last couple words. ""Find me. R. and the MoonMen""

I taste the rich iron tang of blood on my lips before realizing I've been biting into my lower lip. The flavor reintroduces me to a childhood memory, one where I'm placed on top my fathers lap. My favorite place in the world to sit as a kid, where stories of pure imagination would flow from his lips and weave a tapestry of a new world. He dabbed at my cheek, stroking a warm wet cloth across the face while it mopped up spurts of blood belching from my upper eyebrow. I had gotten too friendly with the neighbors dog and ""he asked you to leave the only way he knows how"" my father would croon into my ear while dabbing. The tangerine colored blood ceased to flow and a SpongeBob Squarepants Band-Aid was aptly applied. Still, I sat in his lap while he pulled from his breast pocket a small silver and bronzed spyglass, peering through it and gazing at the stars above. He'd shown me constellations like Orion or Cassieopeia, who'd he would describe as a pretentious queen who spared no time for others. We would spend hours peering through the spyglass and trading our stories of the stars. 

I pull the silver and bronzed spyglass from my desk. It shows signs of wear but my fathers cologne still clings to the metal. I peer through it and aim the small handheld telescope at the floating letter, the blank portion above now illuminated with neon numbers and decimals which I hastily type into my phone. The small handheld square shows a permanently closed gas station just outside of Cleveland. I sigh, a little exhausted at the thought of a road trip but grab my keys and clutch my spyglass, making sure to tuck it safely in my breast pocket.",NihilisticNuisance

"[WP] In the future, therapists virtually enter the minds of their patients. It’s your first day as a therapist and your first patient has just arrived.",dauntedbox376,"""Your client is here Mr Henry.""

""Thanks Jane, send them in."" My hand was starting to tremble slightly, an adjustment reaction I told myself. I calmly grabbed my tablet and began scrolling through the client's file. A young women entered through the redwood doors and had made herself at home on the black leather sofa, faux leather of course.

""Jane Matthews I assume? My name Keith Henry."" I reached out my hand across the table towards her but she put her head down and declined the gesture. Retracting my hand, I continued, ""it says here that you've been having reoccurring nightmares that have been...""

""They're not nightmares."" Her voice was so soft that it was barely audible.

""Can you give me some insight as to what has been happening?"" I placed the tablet down on the table between us and crossed my right leg over the other, attempting to gain some comfort in my seat.

""I... I don't know what they are..."" I could see her hand start to fidget. Anxiety perhaps? ""When the sun goes dark... I try not to sleep anymore.""

""Not allowed to sleep? Who is stopping you?"" 

""I am. They want access..."" Her eyes darted to the window against the far wall. I turned around to see what she was gazing at; the outside was a concrete jungle, towers of glass, steel and cement were all the eye could see.

""They?"" This was starting to sound like a psychosis. Maybe she was having command hallucinations. She made no response to inquiry, so I asked again.

""Yes.""

""Why do they want access?"" I leaned forward to show her that I was interested in what she had to say. She was definitely psychotic.

""Things... happen when I sleep."" Her expression returned to a stoic presentation; I don't think I was going to get much more out of her by simple psychotherapy.

""Jane, the world of psychiatry has changed dramatically since the 21st. Can I ask you about possibly trying a treatment?"" My hand pointed towards a metal box on wheels that sat in the corner of the office. ""Sometimes, if therapists or nurses or psychiatrists want a better idea about your mind, we will use this machine to do so.""

Her face was now being read as anxious; I could tell she wasn't too keen on trying something new, but hesitantly, she agreed. At my request, I got her to recline and close her eyes while I set the machine up. Its wheels screeched as I brought it towards her. The device had two helmets; a sender and receiver. Inside the machine itself was a series of instruments that measured brain activity while a person was in a sedated state. It also allowed practitioners to view the mind from inside. A combination of propofol and midazolam was given to provide a semi state of consciousness. In this ""Fractured State"", neurology liked to call it, a therapist could you this machine to slip into the patient's unconscious mind.

When I administered the intravenous solution, I watched as her eyes fluttered and then closed; she was able to respond to direction but made no voluntary movements herself. I placed the helmet on her head and the other on mine. Before I slipped the switch to initiate, I adjusted my body to a relaxed comfortable position. They taught us in school to do this because there had been incidences of therapist developing blood clots while under. My finger reached over and flipped the switch; my eyes went dark and silence enveloped me.

I awoke in a field. The grass was red and the sky was a cascade of greens and blues, something resembling a star hung in the sky providing some light to scenery. Nothing but field was visible at this time. A head shot up from the grass a few feet away, it was Jane's. Once a therapist was in, we were able to observe what the patient's mind would do. She looked around and lifted herself to her feet.

Her eyes looked up into the sky, mine followed suit. The star in the sky turned from its bright yellow hue to black; the contrast against the sky was astounding, it was the darkest shade of black I had ever observed. Her hands lifted to the sky in the direction of this black sun and words started to fall from her mouth. She was quiet so I was unable to hear her chants. 

The chanting or talking continued for a few moments and then stopped. Her arms dropped, but her head stayed fixed towards the sun. The ground around me started to shake and split in all directions, but she remained still in the field. When I glanced back up at the sun, I saw movement. A shape began to take and it almost looked like it was coming from the sun itself. The shadow appear to drip and slid down from the sky and landed directly on top of her. Her shape was lost to the shadow, but then quickly retook her shape. 

My eyes looked back to the sun; it was bright and yellow again. This was very unlike the unconsciousness we were taught; I could feel the wind, the tickle of the grass, the heat of the sun. My attention returned to the place where Jane had been standing, but she was gone. I turned around to see her standing behind me.

""This is why I don't sleep... they want to come back."" 

Her hand grabbed my forehead and I woke up.

Dazed and disorientated, I removed my helmet and launched myself away from the chair. After some deep breaths, I turned around to see Jane standing up with the helmet on the sofa. She was silent and still.

""Jane, I'm going to refer you to a psychiatrist, I think you may have...""

""Enlightenment! Gaze upon us!"" Her voice was deep and sounded as if she had been chain smoking. Her arms were raised and pointed towards the window. The sky was starting to shade; I opened the window and peered out. The sun was beginning to turn black and the wind picked up substantially, almost into a gale force that encouraged me to close the window. 

""Beautiful, aren't we?"" The voice remained deep as she stood beside me and observed the darkening of the sun. ""Enlightenment is a gift. Your species will learn to appreciate this.""

----------------

""The second, the *very second* anything goes off the charts, you pull me out.""

""Understood, sir.""

""I sincerely doubt you do. And for your sake, I hope you never have to.""

Dr. Roger Moore closed the door, sat down in the chamber and applied the synapses on his head. ""Abel"" was sitting in the room next to him, similar synapses placed on his head. He was drooling with his eyes fluttering left and right while bound to a bed in a straightjacket and a muzzle. Brain activity suggested a continuous seizure that has lasted for as long as they have been able to measure. Roger didn't know what Abel did besides come into contact with an artifact of unknown origin at some government blacksite. Very hush-hush. He didn't like being kept out of the loop. Not being properly prepared in a dangerous environment gets people killed.

""Dr. Roger, are you ready?""

""As ready as I'll ever be, Diana. Start the simulation.""

Roger closed his eyes, and when he opened them, he was in the apocalypse. Volcanoes on the horizon as far as he could see. The earth trembled and broke in giant plateaus as they were lifted in the sky to be sucked away by a black hole that ate everything, even the light. Tornadoes ravaged the landscape made of Abel's mind. But Abel himself was nowhere to be found.

Roger inhaled and exhaled slowly, reminding himself that this world is not really real. It's an interpretation of Abel's mind. Whatever had unleashed the apocalypse here may have left traces. 

A flock of people was running around in chaos up ahead. A whale flew overhead and was turned to dust as it slammed into the floor, the dust turning into mosquitoes that spread like a plague. The plague was then wiped out with a splat of lava, fired from one of the many volcanoes around.

""Whale.""

The surroundings shifted again to an underwater scene. Even here, the earth was shaking, and the trembling could be felt through the water. It was hot, uncomfortably so. A distorted shape floated almost vertically in front of Roger. A sleeping whale. 

An hand clutched his arm. Roger turned to see Abel in a diving suit. The sheer panic and terror in his eyes showed awareness that something was very, very wrong here.

""Abel, can you hear me?""

Abel started shaking and shimmering, turning into a child in a boyscout suit back into an adult with a Hawaiian tourist garb, back into a child wearing pajamas and a black eye, and back into an adult wearing a three-piece suit.

His sense of self is buried somewhere in the depths of his brain. He knows who he is, but he is terrified and confused on what is happening. This isn't something he did to himself. *Something* did this to him.

""Abel, if you can hear me, I need you to show me what happened. When did all is start?""

A rash started spreading over his continuously shifting face, like eczema. He was twitching as if he was being sped up by time. In a flash, they're in some laboratory. The shaking of the earth had mostly stopped, but the shaking of the liquids in the erlenmeyer flasks told him that this was still in Abel's memory. A hint of sulfur reminded him of the volcanoes.

In the middle of the lab, a small stone the size of a fist was being held in an elaborate cage of wiring and metal. It sang a song he'd never heard of. It was pulsing. Like a heartbeat. Abel showed up behind Roger and phased right through him, seemingly unaware of his existence. The rash on his face had worsened, it looked like tumors had grown instead of a simple rash. He was still in his three-piece suit, but wore a lab coat over it. Every second or so, for a millisecond, he'd convulse and screech, but recover so fast Roger honestly questioned if what he saw was humanly possible to conceive. There was a doctor walking next to her. A slim, lithe woman with short blonde hair. Her face was shattered like glass and her voice sounded like crushed glass-shards. He couldn't understand what she was saying. The memory must damaged. 

For some reason, he pointed at the beating stone, and zap of red lightning flew out struck him straight in the finger. From there, Roger felt the heat of the sun on his skin, the pressure of Jupiter's gravity, the flood of ten thousand memories being shattered like a falling chandelier. Everything exploded from the touching point of his finger.

Roger was back on the burning planes, more and more of the earth was exposed and chunks of the earth got sucked up by the black hole in the sky. The people he saw earlier now surrounded him. But they weren't people. They were blobs of flesh. Unrecognizable, faceless, nameless. His friends and family? They kept running around, as if they were trying to find something.

And then they all stopped and slowly lifted off. Abel came running up from behind Roger. He was on fire, leaking pus out of the tumors on his face. Crying. Screaming. He had seen this particular image before. He was dying. Whatever it was that had entered his mind had consumed everything that made Abel, Abel.

He stopped moving. The flesh sloughed off of his face as he turned his full attention to me. In an instant, he'd traveled and stood right in front of me. 

""Behold"", Abel spoke with an uncountable amount of voices, ""the fate of all flesh.""

""I don't understand, Abel-""

""Such is the fate of all flesh.""

""I-""

""Fate of all flesh.""

""What is the fate of all flesh? What are you talking about?""

He raised his arms and gestured to his surroundings, as his charred body began to fall apart completely.

""Fate. Of all. Flesh. This one. Is the first. All will follow. All will begone. This. Is the fate. Of all flesh.""

With those final words, Abel sank to the floor and crumbled into a pile of charred meat and bones.

""Diana, get me out. Now.""

A flash of light, and I was back in the room. Roger tore off the synapses and walked outside.

""What the hell happened?""

Diana and the federal agent sat outside, their attention focused on Abel. A trauma team was trying to reanimate him. There was blood everywhere.

""He just....died. Started bleeding out of every hole, even his skin pores. Heart stopped just before you came out."" Diana murmured.

The trauma team removed the straps and set him on a stretcher. 

""What the hell happened in there?"" the agent asked.

Roger sighed and started massaging his temples. 

""2 possibilities. Either the lunacy of a dying mind, or a warning.""

""What warning?""

Roger pointed after Abel, and said ""That that was going to happen to all of us. Everyone.""

The person that I can barely call a person next to me nodded, prodding me to continue.

He was malformed. This poor soul had a face that looked like a child had taken an eraser and attempted to erase his face. It looked horrible, and to be fair, I expected his voice to be harsh. Dark. Undermining, lackluster. I was wrong. It was very, very calming. Yes, it may have been a deep tone, but the way he spoke was almost calming.

""Continue, Mercy.""

Mercy. Was that my name?

In my mortal life, I remember I was transgender or *something*. I never quite got the hang of it. I began to speak my mind, as the man said. I don't know why I was revived, and I don't know how, but I'm damn sure that maybe, after this, I might finally get to the afterlife if it exists.

""I... I'm gonna go backwards if you don't mind. Helps me think easier. I apologize.""

He spoke, again, in a kind and respectful tone.

""We have all the time in the world. Take your time.""

""I... I don't-""

Lightbulb.

""Oh, right. I was... hm... I was twenty-three. Something like that.""

""Yeah, twenty-three. You died on March eighth.""

""Right, right! Yeah, I remember I was... Yeah, I was walking along a avenue, a really busy street, and suddenly, I got shoved onto the main road, and I-""

I started to realize.

Was my family gone? Am I *really* me?

I asked.

""What year is it, if you don't mind me asking?""

""It's 2072, ma'am.""

Another voice called out behind a wall to my left. It was young and upbeat, yet only spoke two words:

""207*3*, sir.""

The man spoke again, chuckling.

""Right. It's 2073."" He seemed to shrug it off.

""Why am I here?"" I didn't know. Even if he wouldn't tell me, it was worth a shot.

""You've been revived."" For the first time in the interview, he made eye contact with me. It was rather brief, but it was relieving as well.""

I started to tear up. I began to remember the times I cried.

""Continue."" He nodded at me.

""I... At the time, I never really realized why or how I was who I... was. I had a plethora of mental diseases, ADHD, Autism, many, many other things...""

""You had autism. High Functioning."" He seemed hopeful. ""Do you remember your IQ? You got your score back in high school.""

""Right. I think it was...""

During my other life, I lied quite a bit. I learned to manipulate people. As I always said, being a smooth talker can get you out of any situation provided you knew what you were doing. But now? I didn't have to tell the truth. I could lie here, and destroy the world. But I realized, my family... my daughter might be alive. I continued.

""One Thirty to-""

Last chance, Mercy. Don't blow it.

""Sorry, one twenty to one thirty.""

The man looked up at me. ""That's why we revived you instead of someone else, you do realize.""

I had no choice but to look back up at him. His eyes met mine.

""Wasn't Bill Gates alive? Wasn't Stephen Hawking alive? Why me? Why a transgendered nobody who hoped to die all her life so that she could get to the nonexistent afterlife? Why did you revive me?""

""We revived you because you have useful information. There's a war about to start between the Philippines and the United States. We don't appreciate wars here in the states.""

So that's why he didn't have an accent.

""We have a problem over land dispute. We believe that your mother and father bought a property in a capital city in the... Cah... Caygay...""

I never liked cutting people off, but I wanted to make sure.

""Cagayan?""

""Yeah, that word. Your parents bought a property over there in its capital city.""

""Correct.""

""Do you remember what you were going to use it for?""

""Yes, they wanted to build a hotel... no, a boarding house of some sort for a local college. They ended up investing it, and sold it a while back to get large profit off it.""

""Thanks, Mercy.""

""Am I going back now?""

""Yes, you are. We have proof that re-incarnation is real, so don't worry about being gone forever. As soon as you are gone, you will be reborn with no consequences asides from your erased memory.""

We continued to converse, the man and I, about life. I had found out that he had been married and had several kids, and as we chatted about the world, it seemed like nothing was horribly wrong. North Korea had surrendered in 2052 when their new leader was assassinated by a farmer. Russia adopted a constitutional democracy. Many of the countries in Africa were now first-world countries. He asked if I had any questions going forward, and if I knew anything else, and if I wanted something in my new life. I asked him.

""First of all, who are you?""

""Me? I'm Dr. Jack Bright.""

""Wait... so that website was real?""

""SCP? Secure, Contain, Protect? Yes, absolutely. One more question, then I'll let you go.""

""Are you the crocodile hunter?""

""Yes.""

That familiar youthful voice shouted again.

""No you're not!""

The man looked up.

""Right. Since you were so knowledgeable in it, i'm gonna give you an option. Would you like to work for SCP in your next life?""

""I'd love to.""

""Fucking fantastic. Have a wonderful 5 seconds of blackness.""

""You too.""

Fuck.

A bright flash went before my eyes. I swore I could've heard laughing from the man as I went away. 

""Oh, and boy or girl?""

""Girl.""

""Have fun!""

The flash consumed my vision, and faded to black.

"[WP] Soon after moving in a tenant discovers their apartment complex not only houses humans, but supernatural beings too.",galatarigelle,"""Here's your key.""

""Thanks.""

I enter my room. Everything is dusty, there are stains in the carpet, cobwebs in the corner, and the paint on the walls is peeling. It's a dump, but it's all I could afford. I unpack, meaning I open my overflowing suitcase on the sofa. It's been a long day and I need to relax. I flop down on the couch and look at the TV.

It's broken, go figure.

I sit for a moment in the dark room. ""Home sweet home."" I mutter. My stomach growls, I'm hungry. There was a vending machine in the hall. I search my wallet and find a dollar. Maybe I can afford a cookie or something. 

As I am reaching for the doorknob someone knocks on the door. I open it before they knock twice. I come face-to-face with some guy in his early 20's, unshaven, wearing a winter hat. He stares for a moment with his mouth slightly open. It occurs to me that it must have seemed like I had been *waiting* for him to knock. I clear my throat, ""I.. was just uh- y'know going to go to the vending machine."" I explain, holding up the dollar. 

""Oh- no- yeah. I was just uh, you're the new guy right?"" he asks. I barely register what he says. This dude looks like he's never brushed his teeth in his life, and he sounds like he smokes at least a pack of cigarettes a day. 

""Uh, yeah."" I say.

""Oh. So I guess we're neighbors now.""

""I suppose."" 

There's a slightly awkward silence.

""Oh. I didn't ask you're name."" he says, extending his hand.

""It's Jim."" I reply, not shaking his hand.

""I'm Ralph, I live in apartment 17. Right next to 18."" he says, lowering his hand and swinging it back and forth. ""Listen, I saw you come in, me and my friends are having a little party in my room. I just thought I'd invite you."" I'm surprised. ""Oh. Thanks, yeah I might uh, stop by, then."" I say. ""We've got some beer and.. chips. So just come by if you want to get some beer or chips or something."" he says as he sorta nods. I wait a moment, but he doesn't say anything else.

""Yeah, um. OK. I'll stop by if uh, I feel like it.""

""Yes, OK. Just y'know, knock. Room 17. See ya.""

""Bye.""

I close the door as he walks away. Nobody had ever invited me to a party before. That guy was a bit weird though. I look at the dollar in my hand. Oh. Right, vending machine. 

I stare at the BBQ chip bag behind the glass. Why am I not putting the dollar inside the machine? Something occurred to me. I could either spend my night alone in my room eating a small bag of chips in my unlit room and then cry myself to sleep, or I could go to a party, have a few beers, and maybe try to make some friends.

A few minutes later I'm facing the door to room 17. I hear the unmistakeable sounds of a party on the inside. Laughter, music. I think I hear a TV on. I start regretting coming over here. I've never been to a party, what am I even supposed to do at a party? Just as I turn around to start walking back to my room, I hear someone in the room say ""Do you guys smell that? I smell somebody outside."" I freeze. *Smell?? How can you smell me?*

""How insensitive. You know very well, Reggie, I *can't* smell.""

""I'm not kidding you dumbass. Someone's outside. I can smell their fear, no joke.""

""I'll see who it is"" says the one voice I recognize, that of Ralph.

What do I do? Hide? Run? Before I can do anything, the door opens, and there's Ralph.

""Hey! You came. C'mon in Jim."" he says with a huge smile on his face.

*No thanks, I was just going down to the lobby.* I begin to say, but I see the look on Ralph's face. What is wrong with this guy? Is he actually happy to see me? ""Uh.. yeah. Hi."" I say for some reason I still can't explain. 

Before I know it I'm being swept into the room. And I can't believe my eyes. Sitting on the squashed couch, beer in hand, was a... well, a *werewolf.* I stare at him for a minute. ""'Sup buttercup?"" he asks in a voice I recognize as the one who could smell me. ""Greetings and Salutations, I'm Mitch."" said a voice to my right. I look over to see a completely white man with a powdered wig, his hand extended for a shake, and I can also see the wall behind him. He's a *ghost.*

I stare, dumbfounded. 

""Guys, this is Jim, he's my new neighbor."" says Ralph. 

""Hi, Jim."" says Death, who sitting on the floor by the TV with an Xbox controller in his bony hands, playing what I think is Grand Theft Auto IV. 

""Well, have a beer Jim, you are legal drinking age, right? Ah, whatever, have a beer, Jim."" says Reggie the werewolf, handing me a can of beer. 

""I'm sorry, I was uh..."" I begin.

""Hm?"" said Reggie absentmindedly.

""Nevermind."" I say quickly.

""Hey guys, do you wanna play some poker?"" says Reggie. Everyone seems to like that idea. ""Would you care for a round of poker Jim?"" asks Mitch the ghost. ""Don't worry about money, we just play with chips. Not poker chips, mind you, food chips."" he explains. After some hesitation I agree. I'm still struggling to accept the fact that there is a werewolf, a ghost, and death himself in the room. We play a few rounds of poker using chips, when we were done everyone got to eat the chips they had. I didn't get to eat any chips, I failed horribly. Everyone else seemed to enjoy themselves, and nobody seemed to mind when I didn't know how to play. Afterwards, Ralph proposed the idea of grabbing a pizza. ""Hell yeah! Lets go get a pizza!"" shouted Death. Next thing I know I am in the back of a dirty van outside of Alfredo's Pizza, sitting next to Death. Who tried to make conversation the whole way.

""You ever lose someone Jim?""

""You mean like have a family member die?""

""Yeah.""

""Uh.. my grandmother. I didn't know her very well.""

""Oh."" says Death, ""So you didn't care much when she died right?"" 

""I.. guess?"" I half-shrug.

""So we're cool right? No hard feelings?"" he asked.

It occurred to me who I was talking to. Before I could respond a girl hands us our pizza through the Drive-Thru. Reggie got a whole extra meat pizza to himself, Death and Ralph ate a few slices. Mitch didn't eat anything. It occurred to me how hungry I was, and I gratefully accepted a slice of pizza.

This wasn't so bad, I suppose.

It's nearly 1:00 AM and we're in the van, parked in the Walmart parking lot. We've all had a few beers, everyone seems to generally be accepting me as one of their own. Reggie and Death return with more beer and chips. ""Y'know guys, I think we should do something."" says Reggie. ""What are you thinking Reg?"" asks Mitch. ""I dunno, something crazy, wild."" replies Reggie. I had too many beers at this point. ""Yeah, lets do something."" I say. ""Let's buy some toilet paper and go toilet paper the museum until it's covered in toilet paper."" says Death. ""I like that, yeah."" says Ralph drunkenly, ""But why not break in and toilet paper the exhibits instead?""

Things went downhill from there. Mitch scouted out the museum, Reggie broke a window, and we're in. Me and Ralph are toilet-papering the life-size mastodon, when I thank Ralph for bringing me along. ""Don't mention it dude, it might not seem like it but sometimes living with immortals can get a little lonely."" he confesses. ""Yeah, well their all crazy aren't they?"" I say. Ralph laughs. The alarm goes off, Reggie is yelling something about lasers, Death is screaming like a little girl. The police arrive. We're all arrested.

It sucked at the time but I admit prison isn't so bad when you have friends like these with you. ",Rackus56211153
[WP] A retired super villain is in the bank with their child when a new crew of super villains comes in to rob the place.,galatarigelle,"""Hands up people! Keep quiet and the Terror Gang won't have to kill anyone today!""  
I keep my expression carefully neutral but inside I'm cringing. ""The Terror Gang"". Super villains aren't what they used to be. I'm hoping things will improve because this is just embarrassing. Of course, they don't.  

""Blaze! Keep an eye on them while we crack the safe!"" the leader calls to a man with a red cape.  
""Don't worry boss, I'll light up anyone who so much as moves a finger"" Blaze says in an exaggerated deep voice.  
*Blaze, light up... please tell me they didn't do the name thing*  
""Where the hell are you Boomer, we gotta blow the vault before the cops get here"" someone else shouts.  
I let out soft groan and cover my face with my hands. Our guard considers that moving and Blaze is standing in front of me instantly.  
""You looking to get burned old man! We told you not to move!"" he screams in my face. I flick a bit of spittle off my cheek. Of course Blaze doesn't like that.  
""If you move again I'll burn you AND your kid!""  

Okay, that's not cool. I mean, the watch Junior is wearing is also a personal shield and they can't actually harm my son, but that's besides the point.  
I decide that the Terror Gang won't be robbing this bank today.  

""I'm so sorry! I just have a migraine and three guys shouting at maximum volume isn't helping"" I say in my best terrified accountant voice.  
""There's five of us dumbass, learn to count!"" Blaze thunders, covering me with more spittle.  
*Thank you for telling me there's only five* I think. Only five, and four of them are in another room trying to get the vault open.  

I'm sure Blaze thinks that standing so close to someone is very intimidating and tough, but it also makes him unable to block my knee before it hits his groin. With a barely audible squeek Blaze's knees give way and I catch him before he can hit the floor. In the time it takes him to recover from the knee-groin interface I've immobilized him. It's for circumstances like this that I keep my knife on my person at all times. The tip of the blade hovers a few centimeters above his left eye.   

""Now, Blaze,"" I whisper, ""Let's not do anything stupid like calling out to your friends. I am perfectly okay with stabbing this knife through your eye, into your brain. Are you going to make a noise?""  
Blaze shakes his head. There's panic in his eyes.  
""Very good Blaze, you're not as stupid as you look. I'm going to ask you a few questions and you're going to answer them *very quietly*. Do you think you can do that?""  
Blaze nods.  
""Awesome. So, there's five of you. You're the fire guy, then there's Boomer. What are the other gimmicks?""  
""Bullseye does guns, he's like fucking Lucky Luke,"" Blaze says without taking his eyes off the blade, ""Bladestorm has swords in his arms that he can extend. Mastermind is the one that planned all of this and recruited us.""  
""Your ability to come up with unique names astounds me."" I reply, ""Alright, Blaze. You're going to raise your voice in a bit, shout something tough and manly, as if you were still guarding us.""  

Blaze opens his mouth but before he can shout I raise one finger.  
""Remember, I won't lose any sleep if I skewer you like a kebab. Don't be dumb."" I say before lowering my finger.  

""I said don't move asshole!"" he calls out, trying to sound convincing. Blaze is a terrible actor, but his shouting has bought us a minute or two before the rest start becoming suspicious.  
""Thank you Blaze."" I say and knock him out with a single punch to the head.  
""Hello folks, I suggest we all leave this building in a neat and orderly fashion, without making any sound"" I say to the rest of the hostages. Luckily they do as I tell them and in no time at all it's just me, my son and the unconscious Blaze.  
""What did they do wrong Junior?"" I whisper as we stealthily move towards the other four.  
""They left one guy behind to guard the hostages. If they had left two or more of them behind you wouldn't have been able to do this,"" my son answers. Together we turn a corner and see the remaining four members of the Terror Gang. They've managed to open the vault door already. Or, more likely, the bank personel had left it open.  
One of them is standing in an office to the left of the vault, the other three are already inside and are shoving gold bars into dufflebags.  

When we're closer I can see the guy in the office is fiddling around with explosives.  
""Boomer, I presume?"" I say when I'm behind him. Boomer turns around and I give him the same treatment as I did Blaze. The men in the vault were making so much noise they didn't even hear it.  
""Dad!"" my son says, pointing at a button next to the vault door. I smile and nod in approval. He pushes the button and the vault door starts closing with only the barest whisper of a sound.  
Confused shouts come from inside when it clicks shut.  

-----

My son and I are sitting behind a desk. There's a PA system throughout the bank and found a microphone.  
""How would you rate this heist, Junior?""  
""I'd say two out of ten, dad.""  
""What should they have done differently?""

[WP] A retired super villain is in the bank with their child when a new crew of super villains comes in to rob the place.,galatarigelle,"""Now what can I help you with today, Mr Smith"" the teller said brimming with his usual chipperness. Some might have been bothered by the overwhelming pearly whites that flashed from his smile, but not Mr Smith. A slight tug at Smiths arm, reminded him of why people like the teller were good a thing. Jimmy Smith, Mr Smiths five year old, sat fidgeting in his seat, pulling at his dads arm, trying his hardest not to get too bored.
 
Mr Smith flashed a patient smile at Jimmy before turning back to the teller""Well son, I just came in to- a sudden whoosh of air followed by two loud instances of smashing glass cut off Mr Smith mid sentence, Mr Smith did not like to be interrupted.

""Ye-Haw!"" cried a mix of voices. Three figures came bundling through the now destroyed bank doors, their colourful boots crunching on glass as they made their entrance. They began listing off names 'Quick Draw', 'Vile' and 'Turbulence'. Smith was a calm man, and at this outburst he simply took inventory, there was three - most likely wannabee villains - currently blocking the main exit, but there were bound to be fire exits somewhere if he could just see the signs.
 
Smith began looking around the bank for that little green man in mid-run, mumbling ""exit.exit.exit"" to himself. The Villains had split up and began harassing tellers and customers, petty cash, amateurs. 

Smith  begun absently tapping his finger off of his thigh, when a little hand grabbed his finger. Jimmy sat statue still in his seat. Sixty five with a five year old, Mr Smith still couldn't believe it. Smith noticed the look of abject fear on jimmy' face. His eyes were captivated by one of the villains, Quick draw if Smith could remember rightly, he was making finger guns at people, except when Quick draw flicked his thumbs with his pointer fingers a bright flame flickered on the end. Jimmy wasn't really good with fire, Smith had taken his eyes off him once, and Jimmy had found a lit candle. 

Mr Smith sat staring at his terrified sons face, and something just about shattered. Mr Smith in fact, shattered. Someone took Mr Smith and put him in the subconscious for a while, just for small rest. And that same someone stood up, tall, well as tall as he could manage with his bad back. With this new mind, there was a new wealth of power, a bottomless well of anger. Bubbling just at his finger tips was force, a tingle ran through his feet and up his spine, pattering out around his skull. This new man stepped forward, directly in the line of sight, of this 'Quick Draw'. 

""Hey!"" squeaked the villain""Old man, I said everybody get down"" The flame flickered on the end of his finger gun, mostly because his hand shook. A wicked grin took Not-Smiths face. He let out a gentle sigh, and Quick draw' fire went out. The gulp Quick Draw made was comical, Not-Smith would have laughed but his mind was elsewhere.

Not-Smith held in a breath and time began to slow, and slow, and stop. He walked up beside Quick Draw placing a hand directly on the outstretched forearm he had risen. He exhaled. Quick Draw' sudden jerk forced Not-Smith to apply a light grip so he didn't get away. ""What in the hell- Quick Draw was cut off by his own horrendous squeal of pain. Not-Smith had applied pressure, not with his hand but the air around Quick draws arm. The limb snapped in two. His hand and half his forearm dangled, as if it where a meat sock attached to his elbow. At this, Not-Smith couldn't help but giggle. ""W-we didn't mean n-no disrespect"" Stuttered the huddled villain. 
""hush"" whispered Not-Smith, reaching out with his presence, finding the air around Quick Draws jaw and yanking straight down. A wet snap sounded as his jaw split. A pained gargle followed the pathetic thing into a heap. ""Disrespect?"" He continued to whisper ""Son do you know who I am?"" Not-Smith felt eternity bleed into his eyes. he knew his eyes would fill with a black void, and stars would cover that void, a carpet of pulsing lights. Quick Draws Face was priceless. 
""unghega"" Quick draw Gargled. Tears had started to stream from his blood shot eyes.
""Bingo"" Not-Smith said ""Omega, the most feared villain this side of the century"" Omega clenched his right fist until his knuckles went white. Quick Draw made one final squeak, before collapsing into a loose assortment of skin and organs, his bones having been completely crushed to dust.

Hellish screams came from the offices behind the bank, Vile and Turbulence most likely. Omega felt the air burn around him, beads of sweat evaporating off his slicked scalp. How could he have left this power, he could tear a hole big enough in the atmosphere to scorch this trash pile. He could handle the proceeding vacuum easily, wipe the slate clean!
""Daddy"" sobbed a quiet voice. Omega turned in annoyance, and hit the bottom of his bottomless anger.
 
Mr Smith Escorted Omega to a deep place. 

Mr Smith spotted a fire exit off to the side of Quick Draws unfortunate state. ""Jimmy!"" Mr Smith shouted "" Jog over here son"". Jimmy jogged over beside his dad. 
""Is he gone, dad?"" Jimmy stared through red eyes at Quick draws body.
""For good, Son"" Jimmy nodded emphatically before pulling his dads hand towards the glowing green sign. 
The pair left the bank to horrid screams and panicked cries, and small gentle sigh in a deep, deep place.  ",FrooglyToots
[WP] A retired super villain is in the bank with their child when a new crew of super villains comes in to rob the place.,galatarigelle,"The man cowering behind a knocked-over table, tiny daughter balanced on one hip, is the perfect image of a dweeb - thick glasses, gaming t-shirt, undershaved stubble on the verge of a beard and all. His hands are shaking as he struggles to dial something on his cellphone, trying to ignore the villainous soliloquy going on in the background. Unnatural firelight glimmers against the walls, put off by the seemingly burning body of one of the invaders. From the sound of things he can overhear, the villains appear to be asking for all the gold in the bank. So, not as bright as their powers would indicate, then.

Finally, his phone connects, and he awkwardly props it against his ear. ""Hi there honey! Would you mind coming by the bank?""

""What is it this time?"" the feminine voice on the other end asks.

""Some -"" he pauses to glance over the edge of the table - ""angsty upstarts are robbing the bank.""

""Can't you just, I don't know, hack the problem or something?""

""Ok, first of all, that's not how hacking works. Second of all, you insisted on the two-for-one iPhone deal, so I'd need a real computer...""

She sighs. ""Give me five minutes."" The call disconnects.

He flattens down again, curled around their baby girl, watching the numbers on his watch trickle by with trepidation. The voices on the other side of the barrier are getting louder, angrier. He hears a scream, and whimpering. *""C'mon, c'mon...""* he whispers...

The front door opens with a slam. ""HANDS UP, BOYS, YOU'RE GOING IN,"" Lena Lightgood yells, brandishing her Hero Squad badge.

""Mum?"" peeps the little girl.

""In a minute, dear,"" he replies.

The fight is over in a flash; the 'supervillans' appear to be anything but. The official wrapup is similarly swift, fast enough that the little one can't even get bored of pattycake. Suddenly, the table is wrenched aside.

""There you are!"" Lena exclaims with glee, scooping her husband up in her arms to give him a kiss on the cheek, then ruffling her daughter's hair. ""How are my favorite troublemakers?""

""Well,"" he replies, ""Shaken, but not stirred. I think we'll be alright."" 

Lena laughs. ""See you at dinner, dear. Try not to anger any more idiots on your way.""

[WP] A retired super villain is in the bank with their child when a new crew of super villains comes in to rob the place.,galatarigelle,"""Alright, we have one last thing to do and then we can go home."" Retiring from super villainy was one of the hardest decisions of my life, and one of the best. The day I found out about Jenna was the day I gave up making chaos wherever I pleased.

""OK daddy. Can we watch telly when we get home?"" Jenna asks as we cross the road.

""Did you do your homework?"" I reply. Ah, there the bank.

""Yes, and I did all my chores before we left to."" She turns her head up to me looking quite pleased.

""Alright then, we can watch something when we get home. But first I have to check something here."" I smile at her as we go in.

Everything is great in my life, I have a great kid, I have a great house (bought and paid for by some shady government agency) and I work from home as a critic on Youtube specializing in superhero movies.

As we're waiting in line to get to the cashier (the ATM outside the bank is broken so we have to come in here) the door is kicked in, and three stupidly dressed bank robbers march in. Oh great.

While I was retired from villainy I did watch the news, and these morons were making headlines. They fancied themselves the next big thing in villainy. They stole cars and robbed banks, the only thing separating them from normal criminals was they had powers.

""Everyone freeze, this is a robbery!"" The lead robber yelled. I roll my eyes at what i'm seeing. These buffoons called themselves ""super villains""? What a joke. Back in my day I didn't have to *tell* to stop moving, they *knew* to stop moving.

""Wait a minute."" One of the robbers say looking right at me. ""I know you, you're that guy who painted Starry Night in the Arctic."" I cant help but smile a little as I remember that. It took months to figure out how to make sure that could been seen from space. The looks on every ones faces at the bar when the report came on made it worth it.

""Want to help us out man? From one Super Villain to another?"" I could feel the smile fall from my face as I heard what he called himself.

During my tenure as a menace to society I held the Southern Hemisphere hostage for ransom, I kidnapped the love interests of heroes, I stole Australia! I did not *rob banks*! These posers, these pretenders *dare* call themselves ""super Villains""?

I take a breath to calm down. I position myself so that i'm between the robbers the civilians, the last thing I need is collateral damage. Every ones eyes are on me, and, when I pull Jenna close to me, every ones eyes dart to her for a second. Near me would be the safest place for her in a moment.

""Want to see something cool?"" I ask the room at large. When the robbers nod their heads (probably thinking i'm going to help them) I take a deep breath, reach for that bit of power at my soul and...

The doors slam shut, freezing over in a two seconds flat. The ice grows to a foot thick. Damn I really need to practice, I used to be able to do three feet of ice in half a second.

The wind throws the guy on the left into a wall rendering him unconscious, before he can slump to the ground the ice restrains him.

The guy on the right shoots a bolt of electricity at me. It slams into the air in front of me harmlessly. ""Did you know that there is water in the air around us every day?"" I ask the scared and confused bank robber. ""I froze the water the air between us to make a shield of ice.""

""B-b-but you c-can see ice!"" He stammers. I wonder if it's because he is scared or if it's because it has gotten very cold in here since I froze the doors.

""Actually what you see in ice is air bubbles *in* the ice. I froze it in such a way that there are no air bubbles."" I explain before the near invisible wall of ice slams him into another wall.

The leader of this little group is trying to burn through the doors with a jet of fire that bursts from his hand. After seeing the lack of progress he has made he turns to me. ""Why won't this work?!"" He screams.

""This ice has stood against the combined might of Sol and Ignis, it withstood the Flames of Destruction. Did you really think you could get through with that little spark?"" I ask.

""W-who are you?"" Wait. Did he really not recognize me?

""You really should have paid attention to your friend. I'm the guy that painted Starry Night by by Vincent van Gogh in the Arctic. I'm the guy that fought Pride to a standstill. Do you really not know who I am?"" I know it's been a while but surely people still remember me.

His eyes widen as the realization sets in, as he figures out just who he pissed off. ""Say my name."" I order him. For a moment he looks like he's going to refuse, but he clearly thinks better of it.

And with that he says my name, a name I haven't heard in a long, long time. The name that struck fear into the hearts of all who heard it.

[WP] A retired super villain is in the bank with their child when a new crew of super villains comes in to rob the place.,galatarigelle,"This should have been an easy run. Nothing big, just a little gig for the team getting used to each other. Simple practice. They were vastly overpowered for raiding a simple bank, but lasers don't come cheap and cash is always nice.

Ironus was damn near indestructible and strong enough to lift an SUV with ease. Feral was extremely quick and deadly as a cat with her twin blades. He himself could read and to a degree control the minds of his opponents, that's why he called himself the Overminder. But the real core of their offence was SHIGRSSO. A an actual, real, one hundred percent immortal demon from hell. Horns, claws, wings and a sword made of fire, the whole shebang. No one would dare to oppose them, heck they would probably drop to the ground and faint from fear. 
He had also hired a few armed goons, because gold and bags of cash are cumbersome and he wanted his team to have their hands free.

The door blew to tiny bits when Ironus gave it a proper kick and the four of them made their grand entry. The henchmen swarmed in shortly after them and spread to both sides, assault rifles ready. It must have looked rather intimidating for the customers and tellers and he was rather proud of the choreography. The large demon standing in the middle, flanked by a katana wielding woman in leather, he himself with his swirling black mask and the metal skinned Ironus. He could already feel the fear from the people behind the counter. There where only two customers in the bank. Some middle aged guy and his five year old daughter. He was looking forward to steal the pink piggy bank form her. That would teach her a valuable lesson for life. Maybe SHIGRSSO would want to eat her afterwards, he wasn't really sure if demons actually did stuff like that.

For some strange reason there was no fear coming from the father or daughter, only from the clerks. They were probably still too shocked, to realize what would happen to them. Well, the panic would come soon enough. And there it was. Primal fear and utter terror washed over him like a warm summer breeze. He closed his eyes for a moment to savor it. The kind of fear people might die from, simply delightful and invigorating. 

But it had felt a little bit to close, so he turned around to face SHIGRSSO. The demons was looking at the father and his red skin had turned to an unnatural whitish pink. He was shaking like hell had just frozen over. Then SHIGRSSO soiled himself. Steaming demon pee running down his goat legs and collecting in a growing puddle by his hooves.

Overminders final mistake was trying to enter the fathers mind.

“How’s it taste?”

The child nodded happily and proceeded to take another messy lick of a melting ice cream cone. Brown goop covered the child’s cheeks and fingers and slowly dripped onto the curb that she and her father sat on.



“Good. Good,” Joe responded in a distracted voice. “I’m glad.”

Joe gazed over to his right. 15 meters away, a police officer was taking notes as he spoke with an older woman. The older woman’s shoulders were wrapped too tightly in her shawl and her hands repetitively stroked and gripped her biceps, sometimes squeezing until her knuckles turned white. The woman’s eyes were frantic and Joe could tell she was having trouble offering coherent sentences


“It was just before two-or maybe at two-yes, because I had just checked my watch, I remember, and-and-and did the math of how long we were stuck in there since the boys-well, I guess they were more men if they’re going to pull a, uh, stunt-er, crime like this-“


“What’s she saying, Daddy?”


Joe looked back down at his daughter. The ice cream cone momentarily went unnoticed as she found her gaze drawn to where her father was staring.


“Oh, she’s talking to the officer there about what just happened in the bank.”


 “Why don’t you tell them, Daddy? You remember things really good”


Joe happily sighed. He savored every moment of Brittany growing up but loved even more the moments of pure, childish innocence. 

“I’ll get my chance, honey”


In light of the recent tragedy at the bank, Joe felt a twinge of guilt in his stomach that not every parent gets to experience those moments.

Joe gently placed a hand on Brittany’s head as she dove back in to her ice cream cone. As he stroked her ebony hair gently, he turned his gaze back over to the right, this time looking at the exterior of the bank. The door was propped open with its glass pane shattered. The glass littered the ground, some of it spilled into the street. A large, black athletic bag lay overturned a few feet away. A crime scene officer started placing tiny, yellow, numbered tripods near all points of interest outside the bank.

Joe concentrated on the bag. The main strap was ripped in two uneven pieces. Using his x-ray vision, Joe could see that a roll of $20 bills and $50 bills lay in the discarded bag along with a few creased bearer bonds. More interestingly, there was a plastic tag embroidered into the fabric on the inside of the canvas bag.
 Squinting a little, Joe could make out parts of the text written on the plastic.


IF FOUND, PLEASE RETURN TO

…Jamison

…52 Lutheran Ave…

“Lutheran Ave…” Joe mumbled. The street name sounded familiar, but to somebody like him who had worked all over the city in his heyday, every street sounded familiar. Still, the emotion associated with the words Lutheran Ave tugged at him.

“What’s that, Daddy?”

“Oh, it’s nothing. Your dad is just muttering like an old kook.”

Brittany gave a big, toothless grin. Her cheeks still covered in melted ice cream. Joe gave a weak smile back and then turned away, looking across the street to a convenience store. The fatigued look of the convenience store amongst the fresh wave of development along the main strip took Joe back… 



…Back to a convenience store on Lutheran Ave. One of the poorer sections of the city. Nobody besides the residents were ever out there. The police rarely came by unless they had back-up.

Joe could see a young man dressed in New Balance sneakers that he guessed were once white but now more closely resembled hastily poured concrete, a pair of plain black sweat pants and a faded black basketball hoodie. There was no jewelry on his hands, no earrings in his ears, no necklace around his neck. The only thing shining on him were a pair of handcuffs as an officer led him to a nearby unmarked car, the lamps on top remained unfired.

Another officer was approaching him to shake his hand, to congratulate him for stopping yet another crime, for “keeping the streets clean”, but Joe couldn’t hear him. His eyes were locked on the eyes of the young man. The young man wasn’t shouting. He wasn’t struggling against the officer or crying out for justice. He just stared. Joe had the x-ray vision. Joe had the bulletproof skin. But the look in the young man’s eyes tore through him. The look wasn’t a look of disgust, of hatred, of revenge. The look was of disappointment, of shame…



“Daddy? Daddy?”

Joe was snapped out of his daydream by a tiny hand gripping his shirt by the shoulder and tugging. He was back 20 meters from the shattered bank door. He was back outside a busy ice cream shop with a group of people looking to survive the scorching sun with a cool treat. Though, with the number of people hastily glancing at him and the remains of the bank’s exterior, he felt the former “hero” and the scene of destruction was a greater person magnet than mere frozen dairy.

“Daddy? The officer is here.”

Joe stood up and shook the officer’s hand. “Hi, officer”

“Wow, it’s you! Holy cow,” the officer exclaimed. All these years later, Joe still found it humorous how full-grown adults would go weak at the knees when they saw him. He always suspected some of the crimes he stopped back in the day were simply staged so those criminals who knew they’d be going back to prison anyways could at least meet Joe beforehand. Joe lightly shrugged his shoulders in false modesty.

“When I grow up, I’m gonna be just like you, Daddy!” Brittany was on her feet and struck an energetic pose. What little ice cream was left had melted and spilled out of the cone. Joe had retired long before Brittany was born, but Brittany still relished his celebrity more than he did.

“If you’re half the hero your dad was, you’ll be everything we need,” the officer played along, much to Joe’s dismay. He didn’t want dreams of vigilantism to blossom in the mind of a child who couldn’t yet fathom the consequences. “I’m surprised with a couple heroes out today that we even had an incident, eh?” the officer jested trying to gain Joe’s favor. 

“Yea! We could’ve kicked their butts! Just one hit-and-POW!”

Brittany struck another pose, flecks of melted ice cream jumping onto her arm and the curb below



Joe just grimaced. What could he say? Their image of Joe was the only one they’d ever have. For decades he was the poster boy of crime fighting. The police held him in the highest esteem. While he saved their lives by taking on the most dangerous of villains, he also kept their arrest quotas filled for years. 

How could he now tell the officer that he thought of the hungry mouths that might need to be fed when he heard of a robbery? That hunger pains were a bigger crime than robbing a bank to do so? How could he explain to a child who didn’t understand how credit cards work what he thought of income equality, and its effect on crime? The eyes of a young father hauled off in handcuffs for attempting to steal milk, bread, and $40 still stared into his a decade later. What new argument could he bring up that wouldn’t elicit the response ‘Well, yea, but…’ 



Joe gazed down “I guess I’m just not what I used to be.”",imightbethewalrus3

I gave up being an Eidolon a long time ago. *Centuries* ago. Since then I've hooked up with a Dhampir, had a few kids, got legit. The wars with the Legion of the Black Spider are over, the Dragon has moved on. When I got my leave, it was a beautiful thing. Yet, my old life seems to be following me around like a wendigo. 

Such as now: getting my 17 year old son's first debit card. He's a responsible young man, with a military demeanor and a vampire's grace. I thought it woud be a quick trip; talk to my accountant, get some seed money in there, have him set up a PIN and go. But, the Dragon and the Authors have other plans. 
There were three of them - two powerful psionics that had specialized in self-transmutation, and a third that had probably stolen a summoning book, judging from the way he waved it around. Three idiots in spider masks, dressed in black clothing and bulletproof outfits robbing a bank in a random town on a random universe. How quaint.

""I'm warning you! We are the Kabal of the Severed Head, and you are our hostages! Empty out the wallets and the vaults!"" He continued ranting and raving in that tone for another few minutes as the transmuters sped around the bank stabbing guards. If I had my old power armor, they would be dead in moments. Alas, 'twas not to be. The vaults opened, and the summoner grabbed a few imps from the book's repository. The stupid civilians screamed, which a child could tell you only excites the beasts. We were corralled into a line, and one transmuter stood guard at a window while the other two shook us down from opposite ends. The police outside were occupied trying to shoot at the imps, which is about as effective as trying to swat flies with a grenade launcher. I was in the middle of the line, so I got quite the time to plan. My son, of course, is linked to my mind and our combined intelligence scrambled for a plan.

*I could take out the summoner first,* I mused, *and with the demons gone the police will move in.* My son replied, *However, he also has the psion carbine...* **(Note: the carbine is an insectoid psychic parasite that attatches to a host and feeds off of their power in exchange for being able to use as a weapon. Think a black and light purple Geonosian rifle from Republic commando.)** He was only a few people away now. The other transmuter was slow, hampered by the webbing between his fingers. What a dolt. *Still, with the carbine and the book...* Only three people between me and him. *Damn it, I **hate** doing this. Son, take the book.* My son was always a better summoner than I was - it's the necromancy blood in him, I guess.

The summoner got to me. ""Alroight, daddyo, empty t'e pockets righ' quick."" he said in the most horrid fake British accent I had ever heard. ""Maybe Oi won't 'urt ya."" I could tell he was attempting to be funny. Odd choice of joke, given the situation.

""Money should be the least of your concerns, Legionarre."" He seemed startled. His guard dropped, and so too did my hand into his spine. Everyone forgets - when you rob a bank, bring at *least* ten, fifteen guys. Three will not do, even as augmented as they are. My enhanced strength shattered his spine, as he was nt wearing the exosuits that typical Legionarres wore in our wars a few hundred years earlier. How the mighty have fallen. The psion carbine skittered to the closest psionic,  which ended up being me.

I once again felt the comforting drain on my powers. I was an evoker by nature, and the summoners and transmuters in the Corps had developed the carbine to make evokers more... manageable. After spending so many centuries without one, it felt good to be back. I plugged the other one in the line full of holes as he grappled my son for the book. He whispered his thanks as he attempted to attune himself to the infernal repository within. The third transmuter was gone, bullet holes in her place and the screams of mortals echoing off of the ouside edifices. Moving once more as a soldier, I once again fought the ancient war that the Eidolon Corps had fought.

I could hear the Dragon's laughter shake the ruins of the fallen heavens.

I closed the distance between me and the first guard, snapped his gun arm and took his shotgun. ""If you know what's best for you, leave.""

But he was stuck in it.


“Guess that’s what you get when you make a deal with Devil” he smirked. It wasn’t this thought that made him smirk but the fact that he made a Dad Joke. So it takes 10,000 Demon years to be old enough make Dad jokes he thought to himself. 
He lit a cigarette and took a long drag. His job had its perks though. He could smoke, drink, catch HIV but he wouldn’t die. He would live on this “Earth” as long as he did his job. If he couldn’t Hells Fury was waiting for him. His job was simple. Send someone else to take his place in Hell. That was his deal with Devil. It didn’t bothered him much because as soon as they made deal with him they will be unborn. Only part he hated was before sending his victims off to eternal damnation, he would take them to their best moment of life. Give them hope. Make them realize what they had. Take them to their best day and then throw in Hells Fury. That’s what deal with devil looked like. 

…

He walked the street aimlessly to find someone to take his place. Finding target was easy, because he could see what everyone was thinking or wishing floating above their heads like a Thought Bubble. His whole world was a comic book. Another perk of his job. only difficult part was making them agree to his deal.
“I want to disappear from this world” one Bubble read. This was his lucky day.

…

This was his lucky day. Jon accepted his deal. He was even eager to go through it. Shake of hands and Devils deal was done. Only this left was to take this poor soul to his best day and plunge him into Eternal Damnation.

…

He was perplexed. He had to time travel to only 4 hours back. Today was Jon’s best day? Just 4 hour ago he had most hope in his life?
He forgot about present Jon and his eyes were fixed on past Jon. 
Jon was sitting in a dark basement reading some very old book. . He was looking pensive. His thoughts were floating above his head.
 “I’m a demon.”

“Even death penalty can’t ease the pain of all the families I’ve hurt.”

“This text says about a demon who can make me unborn.”

“It says he does to save himself from Hells Fury”

A faint smile appeared on past Jon’s face as his thought read “Only person I can help is a demon too”


…

He hated his job. Even more now.

[RF] They met each week until they were no longer strangers.,EdgarAllanHobo,"It took 16 weeks. That’s 112 days. An entire segment of my year. A chunk of my life. I was always relatively indifferent compared to those surrounding me but reflecting on it, I wonder what took me so long.

It wasn’t a daily occurrence and sometimes, it wasn’t even weekly. Yet when it stretched out longer than 7 days, I began to feel uneasy. A part of me knew that something was there but most of me wanted to ignore it.

It hadn’t warmed up enough for me to feel the breeze along my skin in May which wasn’t unusual but my walk to work every day seemed so much chillier than it’d used to. I perhaps say that whilst I’m reflecting on the events -  my mind merely adding substance to the water. When we met, nothing much occurred. We exchanged glances and I shared my food whilst they stared longingly at me as if they never wanted me to leave. I was almost always late for work on these days as they’d make their distress known whenever I tried to walk away. They were hard to resist and every time, I found myself yearning to introduce them into my home.

As far as I was concerned, they didn’t mean any harm or disruption to the people who passed them by every day. They just wished for affection. People stared and shooed whilst others flocked with their smiles and warmth. I can’t imagine the confusion of living a life like that and nor do I need to anymore.

For someone of their situation, they were well-groomed and friendly during each of our early morning meetings. The cold sun bounced back off their coat and even more so off their eyes, they had an eloquent beauty about them at the best of times. It hurt me when I couldn’t find them in the evenings during my walk home. I had all the time to stop by and humour them, but they were nowhere to be seen. I liked to think that they’d found shelter, but they’d always be back.

It was our final encounter when they followed me. Many passers-by would be alarmed, confused or amused but I was excited. No words had ever been exchanged but finally, I’d been chosen. There’s never been a day as clear in my mind as the day that we became friends. I weaved in and out of commuters and they never lost sight of me. I should’ve boarded the train to the office but instead, I swooped them up in my arms without hesitation and walked right back home – one sick day was hardly an offence but spending another day without them was.

Part of me still feels guilt for walking by without offering my help and another part of me feels even more guilty for walking by without offering an acknowledgment beforehand. But with them curled up on my lap, fur as soft as silk and a purr as load as a motor, I have no hesitation that the right thing occurred at the right time.

I’m glad you didn’t give up on me, Kitty.

[WP] Turns out that the Grandfather Paradox was only invented to prevent people from finding out that time travelling in order to kill a direct ancestor leads to immortality.,EdgarAllanHobo,"""Major Alan Samuels,"" I whispered, closing the shutters of the window to just a crack. Snow covered the Boston horizon, a sprawling colony town of wooden steeples. I adjusted the scope of my rifle to 300m, and adjusted the sight to compensate for the gentle breeze coming from the west. I glanced to the chronojump wrapped around my wrist. The Major should be arriving soon. I tapped on the small display, which brought up a 3D holographic image of both the environment and everyone around. I scrolled forward through the display with the wave of my finger until the I saw the procession that would carry him to me. I tapped on a mounted officer. A flag popped up above his head, revealing his name, picture, date of birth, and a small bio powered by Wiki. I checked the time stamp when his path would carry him straight towards me, perched in the window of the inn. Minutes away.

The blue uniforms of Continental soldiers marched into my scope. Shoulder to shoulder, a line of infantry proceeded down the road, cheers erupting as they did. I licked my lips and waited for the cavalry. That is where I would find the Major, my direct ancestor from many generations ago. But he was where it all started, he was the key to end it before it ever began.

I always knew I was different. As a kid, I poked at dead animals with a stick. Found myself interested in death. As I grew older, I found myself wanting to hurt. Not for the sake of rage, or anger. Not because I wanted to kill. But because I had to. It started with small animals, and then progressed to large ones. Each progression of my sickness would give me this euphoric high, until I had to go in search of larger prey. So I did what anyone in my situation would do. I joined the largest dealer of death. I joined the military. 

My first confirmed kill satisfied that urge. The world slowed down for me, the bullet tearing through the nameless-man's heart. I exhaled deeply and basked in the aura. But it wasn't long before that wasn't enough. Like any addict, I needed something more. Something stronger. It wasn't long before I was fantasizing about turning my gun on my own side. How would it feel, seeing it up close? To watch life fade from their eyes? 

I was selected for a secret program. Project DeLorean they called it. R&amp;D guys thought themselves so clever. It started out as just a research project. Early prototypes of this device would let you scroll through history and watch what really happened, in real time. Naturally, as technology progressed, so did the features. Identification software, integration to historical documents, and even Wikipedia's API was integrated. But it wasn't until a few years ago, the ability to interact with the timelines was incorporated.

Some might dream of the good we could do with such power. Go back and change events. Save lives. But this is the government. Again, the dealer of the death. Instead, people like me were recruited to go back and exploit our ancestors for our future benefit. What they didn't count on, was someone like me. 

Curious enough, I used the chronojump to read about my own past. Who wouldn't? We want to know where we came from. What made us who we are. Such as my grandfather, who secretly murdered his first wife. We all thought it was an accident. Go back two more generations, a convicted serial killer. Two more generations, another soldier. Vietnam. War criminal. Two more, I thought I found a break in the cycle. WWII. Hero. Took out a Nazi machine gun nest by himself. That is what the paperwork said. But when you see it with your own eyes, you see there was nothing heroic about it. Men, hell boys, on their knees begging. ""Nein, bitte! Nein!"" they cried. I watched as he butchered them with no remorse. I recognized the euphoric and murderous look in his eye. It was the same that I saw in the mirror. Go back a couple more generations, the US Civil War. Slaughtered a bunch of Native Americans, but couldn't turn away from that life. After getting a medal from the President himself, joined an outlaw group out west. Got himself shot by a lawman. And two more? Two more generations, we arrive at Major Alan Samuels. 

The first horses crossed into my scope. I was a bit star-struck, watching George Washington wave his hand at the crowd. I swiveled the rifle gently to the right, and his face appeared in my crosshair. Major Alan Samuels. Sure, a trusted officer of the soon-to-be President. But soon, you will give into that darkness that gnaws at your heart, the one that you have passed down to me. I took a breath, finger stroking the trigger in anticipation of the kill. But I would never know the sweet sweet release of seeing the blood spurt and his life end. He hadn't met Sally yet. Ending his life here would end my own, ceasing to exist. But I would also end this murderous timeline. 

I took a deep breath, assure of my calculations. 

""Put the gun down, Sergeant,"" a voice said from behind. I turned quickly and saw a man in a black suit standing, one hand clasping his wrist in front of him. 

I pulled my sidearm from it's holster and pointed at him. ""You aren't going to stop me, I'm not going back.""

""I'm not here to stop you,"" he said calmly. He walked over to the bed and sat down, fixing the cuffs of his shirt. ""You will stop yourself."" 

""How so?"" I snapped. ""I can end it all here. One bullet and I save lives. I can kill this darkness that eats at me."" 

""No,"" the man sighed, frowning at me. ""You only bring about it quicker. In a scale unseen before. You pull that trigger, and you will give in to it.""

I shook my head. ""This isn't about me killing someone to get off on. That is my ancestor, but killing him I stop a long line of war criminals, murderers, and.. myself. And anyone in the future."" 

The man nodded, ""Yes, you kill our ancestor. But in the process, you grant yourself a power unlike any other.""

""What do you mean?""

""Immortality. Undeath. You are granted the power to complete repel that which you seek to deal unto others. Death is no longer a threat to you."" 

""How do you know this,"" I said. 

The man laughed, ""You thought I was from your time, sent to stop you? No no no, that time is long gone now. I am from your future.""

""Bullshit,"" I yelled, thrusting the pistol in his face. I glanced out the window, the procession of troops were now half way down the road. Any longer, I'd have to chronojump back to this place and start again. 

""Oh it's true,"" the man said. ""Just like I know the truth behind your motivations. That darkness that eats inside. I know what it's like.""

""You don't know anything,"" I hissed. 

""Oh I do. I am your Grandson. Two generations."" 

I looked into his eye, and saw the same features for the first time. I hadn't noticed before. ""Then how did you get here?""

""Same way you did,"" he said with a smile. He raised his wrist up, revealing hacked-together device, that looked like a hacked together version of the chronojump. ""The Resistance.""

""My own family is against me?""

The man whistled and motioned to the window and my rifle. ""Is that so hard to believe?""

""Sure, you try to do good,"" the man said. ""Look at me,"" opening his hands to accent his fine black suit. 

""As an immortal, you try to bring about an age of enlightenment. You consolidate your power. You usher in a Golden Age... but we both know the truth,"" he said quietly. 

""What truth?"" 

""The truth that this darkness inside will consume us all one day. And thus, it consumed you eventually. A mad man suffering from paranoia, with the power of immortality? With a secret desire to kill? You order mass genocide. Anyone suspect, and all their family, you kill. You setup your own personal torture chambers. You don't stop. You become a Mad God, as the world comes to know you."" 

I lowered my pistol, looking down at the ground. I nodded, knowing what he said to ring true. I had that capability built into me and if I looked hard enough, I know all of that to be something I descend into.

""So, you're here to convince me to not kill the Major. Prevent future graver crimes.""

The man nodded, ""Yes."" 

I tossed my pistol to the ground and turned to unload the rifle. I looked down the road as the columns of infantry and cavalry rode away, now past me. Good luck, Major, you sick on a bitch. 

I heard the pistol cock behind me. I turned slowly, to find the barrel of the gun pointed at me. 

""Unfortunately for the Resistance,"" my grandson smiled, ""They thought they would get an ally by having someone on the inside help. But no, I would never betray you Grandfather.""

""What the fuck are you doing?"" I asked my knees going weak. 

""You sent me to them of course. You told me exactly where you would be and when if I ever got the chronojump. I am here, to ensure your legacy lives on.""

""No, please, we can change this,"" I cried.

""I love you, Grandpa. I'll make you proud, I promise."" 

He pulled the trigger. ",RobotAnarchy

Mr. Foster and Mr. Dover of 121 Gigawatt lane were proud to say that there was absolutely nothing normal about them thank you kindly. They were exactly the sort of people you would expect to get up to all sorts of strange and mysterious nonsense. 

Mr. Foster owned a small shop down a less repeatable side street near Diagon Ally where he made a number of good natured but potentially diabolical products that are really not important to this story. He was a big man, standing just over six and a half feet tall with a thick black beard. He was thick armed an broad shouldered to the point where if he walked thought a muggle part of town, he would get very strange looks, not in the same way a certain half giant might, but something about his size made him almost unforgettable. 

Mr. Dover was unforgettable in a wholly different way. He was not at all large like Mr. Foster, in fact, he was somewhat smaller than average standing more than a foot shorter than his husband, with a very slight frame. It was his black hair with a shock of lavender down the middle and total refusal to wear muggle clothes even when walking right through King’s Cross station that made Dover unforgettable. Mr. Dover wrote, mostly spell books and the odd piece for his favorite magazine, “The Qibbler.” These two men had everything they wanted from life, their careers, and each other, except one thing. 

That is why they adopted me. 

My fathers were so proud the day my letter came from Hogwarts. 

*”Dear Mr. Dover-Foster, we are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted to Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry…”*

That letter brought nothing but happiness to my dads but it brought pure terror to me. All my life, I heard from my dads and the older kids who were children of Dads’ friends about Hogwarts. About how exciting and wonderful it would be to spend entire school years learning magic around other witches and wizards like myself. 

I was scared, because I am not a wizard. Every ‘other’ child of magical parents I ever met was already doing magic, not much, not any sort of controlled magic, just little stuff, like making things move a little. The thing was, my birth parents died in a car crash. They weren’t magical. At once, dad and dad were going on about how I needed to go to Diagon Alley and pick up all my school things. Before we even finished breakfast, Dover Dad had decided to take me that very day on Foster dad’s lunch break so we could buy my things. Meanwhile all I could thing was that someone must have made a mistake. 

I wanted to go shopping about as much as I wanted to eat a whole pound of broccoli but before I knew it I was in the Leaky Caldron.

As Dad tapped a certain brick with his wand I realized there were a million things, eating a pound of broccoli included, that I would rather being doing at this moment. 

The bricks slipped and turned, backing into each other to reveal the way to Diagon Alley. I was going to walk under that arch and I was going to be in the wizarding world, not like before when I went to visit dad at his store. This time I was going for me. They were going to take me to buy a wand and there would be no wand for me. I was going to wave every wand in the store and nothing would happen, I would be a squib, not even a squib just a muggle. I would have to live my life away from the world my dads called home. I felt sick. 

Dad led the way through the arch and I snatched at the sleeve of his robe. I was not sure if I was going to vomit or burst into tears. He turned and saw all my fears on my face. 

He took a knee so he and I would be eye to eye. 

“You are worried nothing is going to happen aren’t you?”

I did not speak. I knew if I opened my mouth the sobs would come.  I was so scared, so ashamed I could not even look at him. I focused on my feet. Without thinking about it I started to grind the tip of my sneaker into the thin layer of moss on the brick. 

“You do not have to do this.” He said and instantly I was thinking of home, *we could go home, forget this ever happened and just pretend that-*

“But what if?” he said. 

I looked up from my shoe. He was smiling. 

“W-what…” I began, “What if what?”

“What if you go in that shop and the wand choses you? For that matter what if you never go in and the wand that would have chosen you sits on that shelf forever? If you want to go back we can go home right now. If you want to decided later, maybe tomorrow, maybe next week or even next year that you want to come back here and give it a try, we will do it. This choice is yours.”

Right then I almost turned and left. Dad, both dads were the kindest most understanding dads a guy could ask for. They were not going to force me to do something I was afraid to do. I realized whatever happened they would be there for me. And as I realized this, I understood that meant they would be there for me even if there was no wand for me. 

“Let’s go find dad,” I said.

________________________________

It was 2 years after the end of the Second Great Wizarding War when Garrick Ollivander found himself slipping a silver key into the lock of the back door of a small rundown shop in Diagon Alley. 

He had no desire to be here after the torture that he endured during his time as a “guest” at Malfoy Manor, but he had a strange feeling that drew him to the shop. The puzzling thing is that it wasn’t HIS feeling, per se. He did not want to be at the shop, but rather that events that were about to unfold required his presence in the dank and dusty establishment. 

He quickly shuffled inside and pressed the ancient door closed behind him. As he moved into the shop proper, he was surprised to see the Headmistress of Hogwarts waving her hand above a well-used candle, causing it to gently spark to life with a dusky flickering light. As she turned around, she started when she caught sight of the willowy wandmaker, his pale eyes glinting in the sudden but dim light.

“Dear me, Garrick! You gave me quite a fright,” the tall witch gasped. “I’m sorry to intrude in your shop, but something strange is afoot at the castle, and I had a strange feeling I might find an answer here. Nobody has seen you since you left Shell Cottage, or I’d have come to see you before trespassing.”

A gentle smile raised the corners of the old man’s mouth as he replied, “It’s quite all right, Minerva, because I believe we may both…” His eyes flicked to a dark corner behind his workbench, “… be here for the same reason.” His staring intensified, when suddenly a rustle was heard, and a stack of boxes in the corner fell over. “Curious…”

They both stared as one box among the pile on the floor was glowing of its own accord. It was somewhat larger than the rest of the boxes, though about the same length. Professor McGonagall had never recalled seeing a wand box that large, in the many times that she had been to she shop, escorting budding young wizards and witches who did not have a parent or guardian to escort them to Diagon Alley for their first year purchases.

“Garrick? I know you take great stock in a wand choosing its wizard, but I’ve never seen something like that.”

“Nor have I, Minerva. Nor have I…” he whispered. “But what concerns me is that this is the only item in this shop that I did not make.”

“What?!?” she asked, stunned. “Wait. You said “item” not wand.”

“Quite true.”

“I never knew you had anything other than wands for sale.”

“Also true. That box is not for sale.” He continued to stare “It was given to me a long, long time ago, with instructions to keep it in trust for the one that would need it. It appears the time has come.”

In thought, the witch tapped a finger on her chin. “I believe I am here to collect that item.” She began to reach for the box when suddenly it lept into her hand, smacking her palm soundly. A low and steady hum filled the air the moment the box contacted her hand.

“I believe I agree,” the old man replied. “You said that something strange was happening in the castle. Might I inquire as to what it may be?”

“A classroom has appeared. At least we THINK it is a classroom. The problem is that nobody can open the door, and from what we can see through the window of the door, there appears to be a small room with a teacher’s desk and a seat for a single student. It also seems as if there is a blacksmith’s forge, and various other pieces of large equipment.” She continued, “These developments are surprising but not too farfetched. As shown by the Room of Requirement, the castle has a way of creating what it needs to cater to the students.”

“Then what has you confused?”

Minerva shuffled a bit and glanced away, “The magical roster has added a name to the rolls, and it cannot be removed.”

“Why would you want to remove a child from the rolls?”

“Simply put, because the child is known, and she is unteachable,” she dropped her eyes, “Merlin help me, I’ve tried. She’s my niece, and she has no magical ability at all, yet, the rolls have added her this year, and an owl was sent with a letter of invitation. Nobody wrote it, and yet one arrived. It seems the school is determined that she attend.”

“Minerva, you know as well as I, that the magic infused into the castle by the first four is nearly unfathomable. Not even Albus claimed to know all the secrets concealed within that fortress. It is likely that some ancient spell has been called into effect.” He glanced at the box in the witch’s hand “And I believe that my guardianship has concluded by seeing this box delivered into your care.”

As Ollivander finished speaking, the glowing box dimmed, as if to confirm his words, and the musical hum subsided. It almost seemed as if the box felt they understood the next steps and decided it was content with their course of action.

“Garrick, I was wondering if you would accompany me. I think with these developments, your experience and wisdom may provide some guidance.” McGonagall’s voice faltered for a moment. “I love my niece dearly, and I am concerned for her welfare.”

“Of course, my dear lady. I’d be lying if I said I was not interested in how this plays out. The last time something piqued my attention was the day Mr. Potter purchased his wand and set in motion the events that turned our world on its ear.”

With a wave of her hand as they walked towards the back door, the Headmistress of Hogwarts extinguished the candle’s flickering light. The wandmaker secured the door to his shop and placed his hand on the witch’s offered wrist, as she knew where they were about to apperate to, and he did not.

With a POP, they vanished.

With another POP, two figures appeared outside the front garden.
Professor McGonagall reached down and lifted the latch on the garden gate, allowing them to walk through. The gate clicked softly closed behind them. They stepped up to the front door and pulled the bell chain. A moment later, a middle-aged witch opened the door. 

“Minerva!” she exclaimed. “We’ve been so confused! Do you have any idea what’s happening?”

“That’s what we’re here to discover. I assume you remember Mr. Ollivander? Garrick, this is my youngest sister…”

“Josephina… Yes, I remember her, and of course her wand as well. Walnut and unicorn hair at a reasonable ten-and-one-quarter inches. A lovely wand with quite a bubbly personality, if I recall.” Ollivander smiled as he recalled his work.

The woman smiled “I had hoped my daughter would get to have that experience, but it appears that it was never meant.. to.. be….? What on earth is that noise?”

The hum that Ollivander and McGonagall had heard before when they found the box had started again. It began to intensify and became almost unbearable as a small girl entered the room. Suddenly, the box jerked itself from the headmistress’ hands and zoomed across the room to hover in front of the girl. The hum changed, becoming more harmonious, as though a large choir was hanging on a single chord, a dissonant cacophony resolving into a single glorious peal. The girl reached out her hand and the box settled into it warmly, the invisible choir softly fading away.

“My stars! Minerva, what was that?” Josephine stared at her daughter and the box she was holding. The girl was standing there in shock, staring at the strange box that had presented itself and now rested in her hands.

Ollivander slowly walked towards the girl, “Hello dear, what is your name?” 

She shrank down a bit as the old man advanced, but she held her ground. “My name is Elenore, but people call me Ellie. What is this? Is it magic? Magic doesn’t like me very much.”

“Relax, Ellie. Yes, it is magic. It is something I have been keeping for a very long time and for a very special occasion, and if I am not mistaken, it actually likes you very much.” He smiled at Ellie and she stood up a bit straighter. “Are you able to open the box? Don’t feel bad if you can’t. Nobody has…” he drifted off as Ellie lifted the lid of the box to peer inside.

“It’s not a wand. I thought I might finally be getting a wand.” She pulled a shimmering silver handle from the box, but instead of tapering down to a fine tip like a wand, it ended in the stubby lump of a ball-peen hammer.

“Merlin’s beard…”Ollivander whispered in astonished tones. “In all my life I never thought the day would come again…”

The two witches stared at the child-sized silver hammer and then glanced over at the pale wizard and took in the look painted on his face as clear as the sun in a summer sky. He seemed elated, horrified, curious, and surprised all at once. “Blast, Garrick! What does that mean. A hammer? All this for just a hammer?”
“Ellie, why don’t you go sit down in the kitchen for a moment as I speak to your mother and aunt for a moment. Do you know how to make tea? I’d really love a cup if it’s not too much trouble. Being an old man, my throat gets quite dry sometimes.” Ollivander glanced at Josephina and almost imperceptibly nodded at the kitchen.

Josephina stood up from the chair she had fallen into. “Of course, Mr. Ollivander! Ellie, where are our manners. Please start a kettle for our guests, and start setting a tray. I’ll be along shortly to help you.” 

Ellie nodded softly and scurried off to the kitchen. Josephina whirled on her sister and the old man. “Now! I want to know what is going on! Why has a magical object suddenly presented itself to my child?”

Minerva turned to Ollivander, “I am quite concerned as well. What just happened. You seem to know something.”

The wandmaker hobbled over to a small sofa and sat down across from the two witches. He took a deep breath and sighed heavily.

“It is a story from long ago. Most have forgotten about it because it is such a rare occurrence.  Perhaps once every few hundred years does a silver hammer find a master. I had no idea that was what was inside the box, nor did my father who passed it to me to hold as his teacher did before him.

“As you know, it is possible for a non-magical child, commonly known as a squib, to be more to parents with magical talent. You thought this was the case with Elenore. I can assure you now that it is not. Ellie has magic, of a sort. What we know as magic is actually the refined control of energies that exist in all of the universe. Magic folk come by this quite naturally, while Muggles do not. This differentiates our two peoples. Few know that there is actually a third category. They cannot feel the flow of magic as we do. Their talents run deeper. As I said, magical folk control the refined flows, but Ellie will be able to do something quite different. She will be able to touch The Source itself. She will weave it in ways that we can’t understand, but she will never be able to USE it.”

Professor McGonegall’s face showed a glimmer of understanding. “Haven’t I heard that Goblins do something like that? Doesn’t that have something to do with how they produce some of their magical objects?”

“Similar, yes, but not quite. As you pointed out, the key is that an object is involved, but Ellie’s talent works at a much more Primal level. Many times you’ve marveled at the works of Ellie’s predecessors, while never understanding their origin. Albus Dumbledore was quite a collector of the unique devices. His Pensive springs to mind as one of his favorites, and most useful. Other he kept for their aesthetics, like whirring or producing little puffs of smoke on their own. He thought they were charming.” Ollivander chuckled softly. 

“This also explains the odd actions of the castle. It is gearing up to provide for Ellie’s education, and I would not be surprised to see a new member of staff appear to teach her what she needs to know. Minerva, you have exceptional talent for Transfiguration. Severus Snape was remarkably gifted with potions, while I myself excel at wandmaking. But with all our skills, we cannot teach the child what she needs to know.”

At this, his pale eyes came up to meet those of the ladies before him.

“Elenore… is an Artificer.”

"[WP]You're a necromancer during the zombie apocalypse. The humans want you to protect them, the zombies want you to lead them. But you just want to be left alone.",Gimetulkathmir,"Mordecai scribbled in his old worn leather-bound journal. Potions of various colors lined the walls of his alchemy lab. Jars of frog legs, horse eyes, and bat wings were safely stowed under his workbench. 

""I think I've got it..."" he whispered. He rose from his desk, brushing down his black robe. He walked to the center of the room carrying his journal, reading from the page he had just written. 

He stopped and looked down to the corpse he had dragged up the previous night. With a wave of his hand, he bellowed out the words. Green mist shot out from his palm and covered the corpse. It started to move. The jaw started to snap open and close, the arms and legs writhing around. Finally, as if something clicked into place, the corpse rose before Mordecai. 

""Wonderful,"" he cackled. 

There was a knock at the door.

""Yes, yes come in,"" Mordecai didn't look away from his creation. He had finally brought something back. He was officially a Necromancer, a master of the dark arts. 

""Master,"" a voice croaked from behind him, ""there is someone.. some.. thing.. rasping at the door."" 

""I'm busy here, Frederick,"" Mordecai said dismissively. ""Take a message."" 

""Master,"" Frederick continued, ""You really should come see them...""

""Oh alright, Frederick,"" Mordecai snapped. ""But watch this one, and don't let it out of this room!"" 

Mordecai pulled the hood of his robe up over his head, concealing most of his face. Dress for the job you want, not the one you have is what he was always told. And for as long as he could remember, he had always wanted to be a Necromancer. And now he was one.

He made his way down the winding stone steps of the tower. Twisted iron claws holding half-melted candles dotted the walls as he descended down the spiral staircase. As he approached the door, he heard the sound of wheezing and fingers clawing at the door. He pressed an ear to the wooden door, and the sound of bone scraping on wood and stone came through. 

""Who's there?"" he yelled through the door. ""What do you want?"" he sneered in his best menacing voice. 

""Masterrrrrrrr..."" one of the voices moaned. ""Masterrrrrrrrr......"" 

""I swear, if this is Felmar, I'm going to dump a Potion of the Pox into your food one day."" He grumbled and opened the door. Greeting him on the other side, a group of 6 decayed and dessicated corpses shambled towards him. One of them, the only who had a jaw, spoke, ""Master, our Lords have heard your prayers. Judgment day is upon this world and soon hordes of us will be here to sweep civilization. We are now your humble servants, per their instruction. You are our Master now. "" 

Mordecai's heart thundered in his chest. He had held many dark rituals, begging the Lords of the Underworld to give him such power. And it was hear. Alright, gotta play it cool. Don't want to seem too eager.

He cleared his throat, running a hand through his hair. ""Well, I just don't know.""

The leader of the zombie pack shuffled nervously, ""Why not? Is this not what you asked for?""

""I mean, yeah, but.. you know, I kinda just figured out this whole re-animated corpse thing on my own. And you know what they say, nothing like seeing the labor of your own blood, sweat and tears at the end result of your project. I mean, true, it'd take me awhile to find some corpses, and.. if we're being honest, if what you say is true, it may be hard to find some unrisen corpses-""

""You are to lead us or be washed away in the tide of the undead.""

""In that case,"" Mordecai threw his arms open, ""I'm looking forward to working with you guys! Come on in! Frederick! Frederick get down here!""

The old hunchback hobbled down from the tower and peered his head through the open archway leading into the main entrance foyer. The zombies shambled through the main door and rocked back and forth, moaning and grunting in place.

""Frederick, we need a place to house our guests here. But here is going to be more. A lot more. If you please, can you show them through the dungeon and into the caves? We will keep them there until their numbers swell, and then unleash them upon these lands like a wave to wash away all humanity.""

""All humanity, Master?"" Frederick asked carefully. 

""Well maybe not all huma-""

There was a knock at the door. Wonderful! More of the undead already arriving! Thank you, Dark Lord Sheridan! 

Mordecai flung open the door and his eyes went wide. He closed it quickly, only to a crack, with his head poking out from behind it.  ""Humans! Friends!"" he cried. How unexpected, everyone in the village feared him and shunned him. He hadn't had any visitors, in well, ever. Not counting the various angry mobs that blamed him for all things going wrong in the village. 

""Hi, how can I help you?"" 

""Mordecai, we need your help,"" a man in a straw hit spat. He held a pitchfork in one hand with a burning torch in the other. Behind him, a mob of villagers crowded around to listen. The man shoved the pitchfork in Mordecai's direction. The group of zombies behind Mordecai started to shamble towards the door, moaning about brains. 

""Oh, so sorry friend! I'm afraid I'm all stocked up on pitchforks. Maybe next month, try again, huh?"" and with that he closed the door on them. The man knocked harder on the door, ""Mordecai, you damn idgit! The dead are rising! We need your help!"" 

Mordecai whispered loudly to Frederick, motioning to the undead.  ""Take them throught he dungeon to the caves- Now!"" Mordecai started pushing the zombies down the hall, talking to the leader, ""So sorry, just need to get you guys safe. Don't want to unleash you guys too early!"" 
After seeing Frederick lead them into the dungeon, Mordecai returned to the door where the man in the straw hat was still yelling. He took a deep breath and opened the door, giving them a big smile. In truth, he was happy to feel needed. Happy to feel part of the population. 

""So what is this about.. undead you say? How terrifying! And you need.. my help?"" Mordecai said in surprise. 

""Well,"" the old man hocked and spat on the ground, ""to be truthful with ya Mordecai, we thought you was the perpetrator of all this madness, with it being the undead and all.""

Mordecai nodded but before he could speak the old man continued. ""However, then we realized this was little Mordy we were talkina bout,"" and the man laughed, and the crowd joined him. ""We knew it couldn't have been you.""

Mordecai's face dropped and he smacked his lips. ""Nope, couldn't have been me...""

""But you are the one who knows the most about these things, always lockin yerself up in this tower doing your darkly things and all."" The crowd nodded behind the old man. ""So, we thought, we would name you temporary Warden and all. Just temporary mind you. Just until we vanquish the undead. Then you can go back to doin... whatever it is you do here, in peace. No more lynch mobs at your door, no more being a social pariah. What do ye say?"" 

Mordecai hummed and hawed, ""Well, I don't know."" He held his hands out as if weighing his options, ""I mean, being not threatened with hanging and burning at the stake sounds good. And being Warden and all that sounds pretty cool. So, why not!""

The crowd cheered and Mordecai reached out with a smile, taking the old man by the hand. 

""Come in! All of you come in! We must start devising our plans immediately! The dead don't rest, as you know!"" 

The mob finished filtering in through the door, everyone shaking Mordecai's hand. Mordecai smiled and clapped them all on the back and shoulders, acting if he these neighbors of his weren't his enemy just hours ago. 

""Frederick! Frederick!"" he called out. 

The hunchback appeared again, clearly out of breath. ""Yes.... yes, Master?"" 

""Frederick! There you are! Please, will you show our guests through the... basement... and into our.. strategy room?""

Frederick blinked, a confused look on his face. ""The... dung-""

""Yes, Frederick! That basement!"" Mordecai said quickly interrupting. ""Show these fine folks the way. I'll be right behind you."" 

""Friends!"" Mordecai announced, ""Please, leave your weapons and torches here. We don't want any accidents or anything while we strategize. Frederick will show you all the way. I'll be right with you! I'll just be grabbing some refreshments for everyone!""

As Frederick ushered the group to follow him, they lined up their pitchforks against the wall and snuffed their torches. Mordecai nodded and once out of view, he raced up the tower staircase. He burst through the door, to find his recently risen undead shambling toward him.

""Come with me, my friend. We've got work to do,"" and he lead the zombie down the staircase and into the dungeon, following closely behind the villagers.

"[WP]You're a necromancer during the zombie apocalypse. The humans want you to protect them, the zombies want you to lead them. But you just want to be left alone.",Gimetulkathmir,"""More aimless hordes were found wandering about last night,"" said Jeff's father, as Jeff came down the stairs to breakfast. The only recognizable piece left of Jeff's father was his one eyeball set behind thick-rimmed glasses set behind his morning paper, the Undead Chronicles.


""Yeah, yeah,"" Jeff muttered, yanking open the fridge to scavenge for anything not vaguely resembling something that had once been in a lifeform's cranium. His father was crazy about those.


His father cleared his throat. ""You know, it'd really help if we had a regional manager again. Organize a bit. Form ranks. Make a support system. Someone who's got the brain power."" He chuckled to himself.


Jeff ignored his father, grabbing a hunk of crusty bread and a jar of what he dearly hoped was strawberry jam. ""I'm hanging with
Val down by her parent's farm today. Gonna need the car if that's okay.""


""Jeffrey,"" his father finally put down his paper and fixed Jeff with a stern one-eyed gaze. ""It's time you figured out what you wanted to do with your life. Since your graduated, its like you haven't even been trying! And that Val girl and her little group of humans isn't helping either.""


""I already told you,"" Jeff said through a curiously meaty mouthful of jam. ""I'm just taking a little break from school before I make my next big move. Lots of kids do it, Dad. It's called a gap year.""


""I just don't like the idea of all those other kiddos moving along with their careers while you're standing here stagnant."" Jeff's father knitted his brows. ""And you have such talent too! I remember when you were just six and you resurrected Spot right out of his shallow grave! Six! How many other necromancers can say that? I'm telling you Jeff, you could make it big with your skills. That is, IF you apply yourself.""


""I don't WANT that job, Dad!"" Jeff threw his arms into the air in exasperation. ""That was your dream and not mine. You keep telling me it doesn't matter to you what I do, then you push push push all of this crap onto me all the time! I've got a plan okay? Next fall I'm going to enroll in Walkers Tech, it's a two-year program, and it'll help me decide how to really focus my powers for the newest, hottest, fast-moving career fields. NOT being some kind of zombie whisperer.""


There was a long silence. Jeff and his father stared at each other, both refusing to look away. Jeff watched as his father's eye made a valiant attempt to escape its socket.


Finally, Jeff's father sighed in defeat and went back to his paper. ""You know I just want you to have a happy undeath, Jeff,"" he said. ""I took a lot of wrong turns to get to where I am now. Got bitten when I didn't have to be, lost a couple limbs, ate a few close friends. I just don't want you makin' the same mistakes I did, kid.""


""I know, Dad,"" Jeff said. ""But I just want to live my own life right now. There's no way I'm ready to take on a couple thousand undead ones.""


//


""You know they're EATING us right?"" Val sat up and stared incredulously at Jeff.


They were sitting in the rafters of her parent's barn. Val lived in the countryside, a few hours drive from the closest suburbs. She was the only human left in her family and, after Jeff cast an immunity spell on the territory, Val had opened the farm up for any humans who wanted a break from all the zombie chaos. Jeff had just told her of that morning's breakfast conversation.


""I mean, technically yes,"" Jeff said. ""But sometimes I think maybe my dad's right. Maybe I would be a good horde manager.""


""And then what? Go on and have a nice little life in some undead palace? Get up at 8 in the morning, do a couple summonings, take a lunch break, and unsummon everyone at 5? Amazing. What an exciting life.""


""I mean, technically yes,"" Jeff said. ""That would be the schedule. But sometimes I think maybe a little stability would be a nice change. Like you know, having a schedule, setting some goals and working towards them. That's something I never figured out during college.""


""Oh my god Jeff, you sound just like your Dad. I can't believe you're actually buying into this stuff. You're gonna do it. You're gonna go and apply for that stupid position that your stupid Dad told you about in that stupid brain-munchers horde. You're giving up your freedom! Also, THESE THINGS LITERALLY ATE MY FAMILY, JEFF.""


Jeff just stared into the darkness, listening to distant groans and occasional sounds of tearing flesh. The moon was a sliver in the sky.


""Hey Val,"" Jeff said.


""Yes, Jeff?""

As the door opened, slowly creaking and squealing, I knew who it was. I reached into my coat and grabbed my keys, throwing them to the opposite side of the hall. The shadowy figure, looking like a black plume of smoke, moved with ease and followed the sound. Who knew death was so simple? 
  
  I slowly opened the window of my apartment, as quietly and carefully as I could. One by one, I moved my legs out of the window and set them down gently on the fire escape stairs. Closing the window, I turned to the stairs and started the long, 7 story descent. “I should really invest in an elevator.” I whispered to myself. As i reached the bottom, I heard a ominous voice, sounding like it was coming through my own head. “**You have been alive for far too long, Mr. Jenkins. ** I replied, in thought, “You have been death for far too long, you’re getting lazy.” I had escaped death year after year by simply walking away. It turns out that death didn’t have a tracker, all he had was a phone book. 

  Death reached for the phone book and turned to the yellow pages. “Jebediah, Jena, Jenkins.” He murmured to himself, thumbing the page. Death picked up the phone and called Cassandra Jenkins, Mr. Jenkins’ granddaughter. No answer. Death frowned, and decided it would be much better to address it next year, as he had many more calls to make, and doors to open.

My nation’s not an easy one to live in, for the rough land makes farming difficult. Famine’s have decimated us, but we’ve always clung to life. We’re proud of our stubborn nature. Proud of the fact that, though every country wants to strip our mountains of their gold, we’ve never let them.
	
For ten years, I was king. Under my watch, no soldier died, no civilian went hungry. I made new allies through mutually beneficial deals and made sure everyone thrived. 
	
Despite being a man of the people, they despised me.
	
Why? Well, my brother’s a malicious brat, and he *hates* me. He’s always desired the throne, and with his slick tongue, has spent his entire life defaming me. I never stopped him because, honestly, who cares? Let him obsess over something foolish. I had a country to run.
	
This turned out to be a mistake, though. See, he finds little value in tradition, and believes our land is garbage. *The only way to get ahead is by TAKING what we want!* he once said. He’s a warmonger who’s brainwashed our people, and even worse, our army.
	
Two days ago, I was betrayed. My royal guards were killed in a coup and my brother stole the throne. Why did he let me live? I don’t know. He’s a cocky bastard, and I guarantee he loves the idea of me watching his empire grow—but they’re an empire of *idiots*.

I was driven to a furious rage, standing up and shouting at the top of my damned lungs ""ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?!"". Suddenly, a voice comes from beside me, then a spotlight shines over it, a glowing woman with blonde hair and glistening blue eyes standing beside me. I silently say:""You the judge?"" She nods and opens a book.

""Pay $10,000 for 10 more years"", ""Lose one select limb for 100 extra years."", ""Lose 2 select limbs for immortality"" or ""Skip"".

I shrug at her and ask ""How do i pay for the 10 years?"". She says in a warming voice ""In your pocket, there is a coin to do so."" I dig it out, observing under the judge's light to see that it has some engravings. My bank account number and the numbers ""10,000"" are on it.

The judge points at a jukebox in the corner of the room, advising me to slot the coin in when I am ready. I shuffle towards it weakly, and hold my hand above the slot. 

""**WAIT!**""

I turn to see the judge holding her hand up to ask me why not choose 100 more years or even immortality. I smirk slightly to say ""I have a wife and kid, seeing them die in front of me would be an ever-aching agony to witness."" I see a small tear roll down her smooth, perfect face. She then takes out a pendant from her pocket and slides her thumb across it.

""**LOOK OUT, MATE!**""

""Aussie Jesus?"" i ask while staring at a bright flash in front of me. The room lights up and i see Jesus, but he somehow has a koala on his shoulder but i pay no mind to it. He says while looking at me ""You go home to your family, take good care of them. These 10 years are on the house. Enjoy and remember me, ok mate?""

I nod while listening to the music Jesus plays from the jukebox. It is Lauv's ""Easy Love"". I never imagined myself in this position, listening to music with a judge and Jesus.

"[WP] Upon dying you hear the following phrase: ""YOUR FREE TRIAL PERIOD OF EXISTENCE HAS ENDED.""",MagicalHamster,"I awoke to a bright blinding white and I quickly squeezed my eyes shut as my eyes watered. I hissed in pain for a few minutes, my eyes having a difficult time adjusting to wherever I was. It was a pretty shitty experience since curiosity was demanding me to find out what the hell was happening, but I couldn’t even peep without being blinded. After a long, long while, I managed to slowly open my eyes and-

What. The. Absolute. Fuck. 

I was on my way home, stuck in traffic, and fighting to stay awake. Last, I checked, not only was it night but I was pretty sure I wasn’t lying down on absolute nothing. I blinked a few more times to ascertain what I was seeing was fucking real.

Oh, would you look at that, white-ness. My eyes widened as the situation was settling in, my breathing got shallower as I swiveled around in panic, looking for people, buildings, trees, anything but nothing was in sight, just plain, very plain white-ness. 

I took in a weak breath and tried to comfort myself but my voice was quivering, “Hey, could be worse, it could be darkness instead.” I swallowed and shakily nodded to myself. I am calm, I tried chanting to myself, but it was in vain as my mind failed to fully comprehend what I was experiencing. Soon, my chant evolved to a string of fuck, fuck, what the fuck. 

“Okay, first you gotta stand up, yea?” I instructed myself, trying and failing to not descend into the madness of the situation. I stumbled at first, but I managed to gained footing (shaky as it was), my breathes coming to me easier now. I was so fucking far from being calm, but I was making progress, which was good. Progress, good. 

“Now I just have to figure out what the hell is happening.” I cheered myself only to cave into a sigh as I realized how hopeless it was to figure anything out in this blank space of nothing-ness. 

I took a step towards what I thought was the left when a loud notification sound made me jump and my heart climb to my throat. “What the absolute fuckity fuck was that, fucking shit!” I yelled, my hands grabbing where my heart was as it decided to do a solo of The Flight of the Bumblebee. I whirled around in fear and I turned pale as my mind processed the text floating innocently in front of me. 

“YOUR FREE TRIAL PERIOD OF EXISTENCE HAS ENDED” 

It flashed in bright warning red, appearing out of nowhere. I checked the floor (or what I assumed was the floor) and confirmed that it was indeed floating since I was pretty sure the…text wasn’t hanging from anything considering there wasn’t a ceiling (again, an assumption). 

“What the fuck.” Slipped out of my mouth as I stared at it open-mouthed. “What the hell? Free trial? Existence?” I harshly asked, my face forming a frown of confusion. To my surprise, the text changed, as if in response to my questions. 

“TO START YOUR EXISTENCE AS A FULL MEMBER OF LIFE (WITH ALL ITS BENEFITS) ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS PAY WITH ************” It flashed blue now and if my eyes could get any wider in surprise, I was sure it would have rolled of my sockets.

 “So you’re saying,” I muttered, with a hand massaging the bridge of my nose to stave off the forming head ache. “That everything I’ve experience up ‘til now was a trial period? Was anything real at all?” I dreaded the answer, the confirmation to what I was already aware of. 

As if mockingly, my question was ignored as the message continued to flash. I crinkled my nose in annoyance and sighed, “Okay, fine, pay with what though?” Yet again, I was ignored and the way of payment was still ominously censored. I bit my cheek to control the storm of emotions and questions raging inside me.

Was I dead? Was any of it real at all? What the hell is going on? Was this the after-life? What about my friend, my family? I instinctively knew I wasn’t going to get answers to these any time soon, so I grit my teeth and politely asked, “What do I have to pay with?” The letters scrambled together, finding the right combinations to form the right words.

“YOU HAVE TO BE A PAID MEMBER TO BE GIVEN THE INFORMATION. WILL YOU START YOUR EXISTENCE?” I stared at it in disbelief. How in the hell did it expect me to pay when I didn’t know what with? I was tired, I was hungry, and I just wanted to get this all over with and wake up to my friend waking me up for our stop. 

“Fine! Fucking fine! Yes, I will start my existence.” I snapped at the floating, message, thing and the message started to scramble again and formed a new message.

“HERE ARE YOUR FOLLOWING BENEFITS:” As it scrambled for the next message, dread pooled in my gut as it only got longer and longer. I hastily motioned it to stop, yelling “No! I don’t need to know about the benefits, let’s just get this shit over with!” The messages froze in consequence to my demand, and instead formed a single sentence.

“WOULD YOU LIKE TO START YOUR EXISTENCE?” I took a deep breathe and nodded yes to whatever being was making fun of me at that moment. The next thing I knew, everything was dark and constricting, and I barely had room to move.

‘So it did get worse.’ I thought in resignation as my consciousness drifted off to what I assumed would be sleep.

"[WP] Upon dying you hear the following phrase: ""YOUR FREE TRIAL PERIOD OF EXISTENCE HAS ENDED.""",MagicalHamster,"Shit. It had only been 82 years of life, but it had been wonderful. But here I was again -- on the plane of infinite whiteness that was non-existence. It was a land devoid of visible landmarks and home to an infinite nothingness and the poor non-existent souls that roamed for all eternity.

""YOUR FREE TRIAL PERIOD OF EXISTENCE HAS ENDED. IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO EXPERIENCE EXISTENCE IN IT'S FULL, THEN YOU MUST HAND OVER PAYMENT.""

""What do you take for payment?"" I asked, already knowing the answer.

""WE WILL ACCEPT ANY CONCRETE OBJECTS THAT YOU HAVE FOUND IN THE REALM OF NON-EXISTENCE. THE RED TRIANGLE YOU POSSESS WILL PAY FOR 100,000 YEARS OF EXISTENCE.""

I looked down at the red triangle. I found it, once, while I was out wondering. It was special -- nothing in this realm had any actual form or substance. If I were to look down at myself, I wouldn't see anything because I wasn't anything -- just the potential to be something. But this red triangle was worth something -- worth more than whatever I was. Because it existed in two dimensions and even contained visible light from the red end oft he spectrum.

How did it get here? Who knows. How long had I wandered before I had found it? Who knows. How long would I have to wander before I would find something of similar or greater beauty? Maybe forever. 

""Do I have to decide right now?"" I asked.

""NO. IF YOU SHOULD LIKE TO GO THROUGH WITH THE TRANSACTION YOU NEED ONLY SPEAK YOUR INTENTIONS.""

""Okay,"" I said. ""I'll think about it.""

""WE SHALL AWAIT YOUR ANSWER.""

I sighed. You only get one free trial for existence, and I had finally caved and used it. There was no way to tell time here but it existed in some ghost of a form. I can't remember everything, but I know there was a time when I didn't even have the potential for thought. Then one day, I existed, as an I. That's when I first heard the offer from the mysterious voice.

Naturally, I had no idea what it meant. But i existed, and I wandered, and I occasionally asked the voice questions. I eventually had enough context to understand that existence was something wonderful and eventful. Now, having experienced it briefly, I understood just how wonderful it was. I had been a woman while I had existed and that had made sense -- though there was nothing human about me now I fancied that I was definitely the potential of a woman.

I had spoken to other potential people. Some had already done their trial of existence and had raved about it while others didn't yet have the ability to comprehend what was being offered. And I had encountered potentials that were so desperate to find a concrete object that they were nearly mad. They were obsessed to the point where they were in danger of forgetting their ability to think and regressing back into not-being entirely. 

And actually, that could happen to me too. One day I could just forget the fact that I still had the red triangle and what it's worth was. If I didn't focus on carrying it with me -- to use terms from the land of existence -- I might lose the triangle forever. So obviously, I should spend the triangle while I still had it in my possession and while I remembered it's worth, right? 

And yet..there was a part of me that didn't want to give up the three pointed polygon. 

""I have a question about payment,"" I asked aloud.

""WHAT IS YOUR QUESTION?""

""Why is this triangle worth so much to you?"" I asked.

Usually, the voice responded instantly. But there was a pause here.

""WE REQUIRE PAYMENT. THE CONCRETE OBJECT IS THE ONLY THING YOU COULD HAVE THAT YOU COULD USE AS PAYMENT.""

""So the only reason why the triangle is valuable to you is that it is something I have to lose?""

""YES.""

Was I imagining things, or was the voice a little less certain that usual? Perhaps it was an after-effect of my brief taste of existence. 

""How about this? How about you give me the red triangle back after my existence has ended again?"" 

""PAYMENTS WILL NOT BE REFUNDED.""

""But if it's only value is that you can take it away from me, then surely it wouldn't matter if I were to get it back.""

""THEN YOU WILL ALWAYS HAVE PAYMENT. INFINITE PAYMENT. THAT WILL DEVALUE EXISTENCE.""

""Yes, I think I see your point. How about you give me the red triangle back after the span of existence, and we'll consider it spent. Then I'll go looking for another object to pay you with.""

""PAYMENT WILL NOT BE RETURNED. THERE WILL BE NO FURTHER QUESTIONS ON THE SUBJECT.""

""Never mind, then,"" I said.

Something about this red triangle was special, I decided. I wasn't sure what, but I knew it to be so. I realized that I put more value in it then I put value into the concept of existence itself. Maybe I should go out and find other triangles. If I got enough I could wedge them together and make a three dimensional object.

Hell, if I could get enough three dimensional objects together I could create my own existence here. It might not be as pretty or as orderly as the existence the voices offer, but it would be mine, and it would be forever. 

Oh, that was it, wasn't it?

""I'm God, aren't I? And I have the power to create universes, don't I?""

The voices didn't respond. Usually they responded to any random phrase and doubled the conversation back to the concept of existence. 

""But If I give you the things that I find, I relinquish that power, don't I?""

There was no response.

""I will never subscribe to existence. I will create a universe and I will share it with all the potential people out there.""

""GOOD LUCK. THE TASK WILL TAKE AN ETERNITY AND IF YOU LOSE CONCENTRATION FOR JUST A MOMENT THEN YOU WILL BE BACK TO WHERE YOU STARTED -- A NON-ENTITY WITHOUT POWER.""

""Who are you, really?""

""BIGGER GODS. GODS WHOSE EXISTENCE IS BUILT BY IDIOT GODS SUCH AS YOU. GO AHEAD AND TRY TO BUILD A UNIVERSE. WE WILL WAIT AND YOU WILL FAIL.""

We'll see about that, I thought to myself.

*Bzzzzzzzzts.*  A hole appeared near the lockbox.  The prison was one of absolutel darkness. No amount of time would allow any spirit comfort, none to allow any lightness or adjustment of the times. I found myself staring through a small speck of dust as I attempted to wave away the dust.  My spirit fingers wouldn't work, nothing ethereal would affect the physical surroundings.


*Bzzzzzzzzzzzzz-Gshbhb-zzzzzzt.*  The hole got ever slightly larger. A small metal rod with a light blared into the prison. A muffled voice emerged.  


They must have broken the puzzle! I frantically assumed my zen position.  They must unleash me through the puzzle, otherwise I will be partially visible to them!  If they open the box by physical means, the code inside will dissolve with the acid, release by the bottle at the end of the mechanism!   I tried to meditate, but the sounds kept on coming.


*Bzzzzzzzzzzz-*


If the scroll is lost, my powers would evaporate.  My saviours, the solution and key to my prison was being *brute forced*.  The metal rod was retracted and the prison went dark again.  I waited for another murmur of voices.  A short time after and some vague humming, another rod was inserted.  I tried to interact with it, seeing as the hole may have provided some visibility into the physical world.  


*There's the lynch pin.  If you disarm that, the parchment will not be soak in the liquid.  Dr. Hartman thinks it was a trap that tried to bypass the puzzle.*


The voices grew cleared.


*Dr. Hartman? No, it's not quite ready. The puzzle is easy enough, but the metal hinges are immovable.  It's a matching set, movement in the right order.*


The voices from beyond. I waited patiently as the metal rod searched around the box. 


*There's no acid left. Evaporated. Get the crowbar.*

You watch in horror as a couple of modern treasure hunters drill through the door and bypass the puzzle completely.",Maximum_Pootis,"As the ultimate Ancient Evil, I'd set up the perfect plan for my eventual resurrection. Sure, I'd lost the battle against the gods ten thousand years ago, but I wasn't going to lose the war. While they were celebrating victory up in the heavens, I burrowed deep beneath the sands, voluntarily sealing myself away in a tomb.

By performing the proper magic rituals, I bound myself to the room's walls a hundred feet below the surface. Doing so prevented the gods from finding me, but also kept me alive in a magical state. Before I lost my powers, I conjured up the greatest treasures humanity had ever seen: golden scepters, chests of gems, statues of diamond, everything that would light a thief's heart on fire. Finally sealed away, I whispered rumors of the treasure that lay beneath the surface to my allies: the scorpions and spiders that lived underground. They in turn whispered to the snakes, who whispered to the vultures, who whispered to the cats, who would whisper to the humans willing to listen.

Eventually one of them would come to find the treasure, and in doing so, release me. My plan was flawless. The tomb was impenetrable from outside, unless the person completed a puzzle. They had to arrange a pattern of hieroglyphs to spell my unspeakable name. And, once uttered aloud, would break my seal and resurrect me. They could spend eternity with their silly treasures, buried alive beneath the sand, while I rose again to power and took the empty thrones of the now-forgotten gods.

For millennia I sat dormant, alone as little more than a spirit inside the walls of my treasure-filled chamber, with nothing but the sound of shifting sands above me.

Until today. There was a tapping sound on the tomb's ceiling. My spirit awoke from its slumber. Finally! A thief had heard about the treasures that awaited beneath the sand and had come searching. It was time to give them what they deserved.

The sound of the hieroglyph panels sliding through the puzzle above seeped into the chamber. It was only a matter of time now.

""Hey, how about we use this?"" came a muffled human voice.

""I dunno, looks pretty thick,"" came another.

""Please. This thing can eat through ten feet of solid steel. Put on your goggles and just watch.""

I didn't know what they were talking about. The sliding hieroglyphs stopped. Frustration burned through me. What were they waiting for? It was a simple puzzle! Simple enough for any small-brained thief to solve! All they had to do was–

The sound of a thousand earthquakes erupted in the ceiling. It rattled my tomb as if a titan had picked it up and shook it. Chunks of the ceiling fell away, tumbling inside, revealing bright, terrible sunlight.

All I could do was watch in horror as a massive hole opened up, revealing two humans peering down from above. They leaped inside, brushing off the dust that the crumbling ceiling had caused.

""See? I told you this thing could do it!"" one of them said. He shoved some sort of magical, metal device into the other's face.

""Yeah, yeah, your jackhammer's great, I get it,"" the other said. ""Now let's start getting this stuff into bags!""

The two of them used their grimy, monkey-like hands to stuff as much treasure as they could into their sacks. I could do nothing but watch. Since they hadn't completed the puzzle, I was still bound to the room. But that was supposed to be impossible! I'd never imagined in ten thousands years that these humans would be capable of such incredible power.

Before long the room was completely ransacked. The humans had taken every last bit of treasure. When they made their last trip, they took one final look around.

""So what do we do with this place?"" one of them asked. ""Should we bury it back up?""

The other shrugged. ""Who cares? There's nothing left here anyway. Might as well let this place get a little fresh air. God knows it could use it.""

With that, they left. I was alone, with nothing but a broken puzzle to never be solved, and my spirit still bound to the empty room. With no treasure left, there was no reason for any human to ever come back.

Until a week later. Some humans who called themselves ""archaeologists"" came into my room, despite there being no more riches. They examined every inch, taking notes, looking very excited. Some of them even started trying to fix my puzzle.

You watch in horror as a couple of modern treasure hunters drill through the door and bypass the puzzle completely.",Maximum_Pootis,"In a sweltering hot Egyptian desert a few treasure hunters, tired and broke, stumble upon a dune and falter to the ground, burying their faces in the sand. They take in deep gasps, their throats dry. It has been days since they last had a drink of water.  
The sand blows revealing a slab of sandstone. Curious, they creep forward and pound it with their fists. It is indeed hollow. They grab their tools and start to drill inside, breaking the age-old sandstone. 
I grunt in anger, peering through the hole in the slab. A tear a chink and it will break- completely
But... at last, I will be free. I had been trapped here for so long perhaps thousands of years. 
What if they break my precious jewel. The one that I've been cursed to be bound to as a spirit? What will happen then? Will I completely fade away into oblivion? 
No one knows the answer. 
The slab breaks and crumbles to the ground. I let out a grunt of frustration. My puzzle was one of those that would never be solved... Ever. This was my home and it would stay my home. 
But, if I was free I would be promised freedom. 
The men swiftly grab the black diamond necklace holding it in their hand as if it were their newborn child and run away.  
I curse in an old tongue following them. Their insolence is irritating. I beg to be put in my proper place. 
I fade away into nothingness and reappear in their house.It was rather nice...
I wanted to destroy them. I wanted to destroy everything.
A plan.... it runs through my mind like fine sand on a windy Egyptian day.  Fear is money to me like that necklace is to them. I need it. I need to feast upon it. Fear is the reason why I was once alive before. I must destroy them...
Magic runs through my veins and I cast fear upon them. They shake, and fall to the ground, gripping their chest, the necklace falling with them. 
Noone escapes my illusions... I repeat to myself. Their delicious fear makes me stronger and the same with my illusions.
....Days later the necklace is found along with the dead men, and it is safely stored away in the museum. Ninati is once again triumphant. They say that at night she wanders through the museum guarding her precious treasure. Anybody that is unfortunate to stumble upon her will die in the same fashion as these men....

I use a wetstone to sharpen my katana, it is thus sharp enough to rend any flesh that i may come across. 

Suddenly, a few pebbles fall from the door in front of me. I bite my lip and tap my feet in excitement as i await my possible escape. A bright light appears, wind blows towards my face. My armor glows a bright crimson red. The treasurer hunters cheer out saying ""We've done it boys!""

I smirk as i charge towards one of them. I summon 2 spectral illusions of myself to get the other 2 treasure hunters. The illusions do as i, and dash towards the treasurers and past them. I sheave my katana as the treasurer hunters all fall to the ground with a slit across their abdomen.

I hear a call for help in the other room. I morph into one of the treasurer hunters and hide the bodies in a rift of my own. I chase after the person and say ""It's ok nothing happened, we are fine."" 

I watch as 6 soldiers walk in. They point their guns towards the doorway and proceed to breach and check the room. I flick my fingers and a crimson assassin appears behind the person who called for help and slit his throat while covering his mouth. 

The soldiers report their status through some random black box. I turn into a black cloud and float amongst them, returning to my normal form to cut them down with my katana in one hand, and toss fireballs with my other. They let out a faint grunt and fall under my feet.

Older than the bloody Galaxy. I have traveled throughout the universe. Laid waist to millions of planets, conquered a billion and ruled them for millennia! And I, the feared, the magnificent, the great, the EVERYTHING, is forced to watch these human scum defy my almighty genius! It's blasphemy! No! It's the denial of the laws of nature and magic itself! How dare they?!

My tomb is sealed from the outside. Magically locked by a riddle. This seal, put there by the group of godly charlatans - who call themselves Allah, Jaweh, God or any other stupid name that any simple human can understand - will be removed when someone solves this riddle. Not that it is any hard, haha, I mean... haha... it's placed by those idiots of so called 'gods'. But they did lock up me deep underground. Very deep down. I'm only accompanied by my cursed treasures that were banished with me. All now useless since there magic powers have faded away throughout the era's. Some might still be useful once I'm released. But I'm starting to fear that humans will never get smart enough to dig so deep safely and they might all eventually turn to dust.
Yet since several years I have been feeling slight vibrations in the ground. And the source is been getting closer. They're building a mine! Finally! At least, that's what I thought at first.

Eventually they found it and immediately all working stopped. The days afterwards I was alone again in the dead silence. Slowly impatience started to grow. But then I heard it again. Soft muttering voices to the other side. And then they started! A terrible, terrifying shrill sound made my tomb vibrate. Piles of gold collapsed and shelves full of more valuables as well. Thankfully I'm an elemental being, born from the very universal laws of time and space, or I would for sure had become deaf.
Suddenly, I saw sparks of fire enter my prison and - the universe help me - started to pray. For that moment I believed the element of fire itself had come to get rid of me for all eternity.
But no, it were humans. Filthy, dumb humans. They completely ignored the riddle! I couldn't believe it when the wall fell inwards! The tomb was open! But the seal was still there! 

""Here you go. You need anything else?""
""Naah, we'll be good. Thanks by the way.""
""No problem.""
""No seriously. Just imagine we'd first have to contact some dumbass historians who would have told us to use all these complicated silly mechanisms. You really helped us here.""
""Glad to do so. I'll be on my way back up.""
""You don't want to see what's in there?""
""Euhm... not really my field of interest. Probably only some lame ass unreadable scrolls.""
""Okay, suit yourself.""

I had never heard a conversation that naïve and that low in intelligence. How... how did they manage to dig this deep without killing the lot of them? Or maybe they didn't care? I just couldn't grasp it... hehe... me... and I didn't grasp it... what a joke!

After a while. They entered without caring about what they touched. They even ""accidentally"" broke an ancient gold cup. I mean... HOW DO YOU DO THAT?
So I got so fed up that I appeared in front of them in a shadowy figure, the only form they're capable of understanding. Suddenly their eyes changed from careless to fear. 
*How dare you enter this tomb?* I put up my terrifying-voice, the one that makes all creatures tremble. *How dare you ignore the riddle?*
And suddenly they fled. The just started running. They ran from ME! So as fast as possible I took one of them by the coat and pulled him in before he managed to exit the tomb. He screamed... like a HUMAN GIRL! How pathetic...
Quickly I glanced at the puzzle on the wall that was now facing upwards whilst lying on the flour of my prison. It was heavily damaged, but maybe, just maybe it was still operational...
*Solve it!*
The human seemed confused. ""What?""
My shadow form pointed towards the puzzle. *Solve it! Now!*
""Solve it how?""
I sighed. *Just do it!* And I dragged him towards the bronze panel on the wall.
""But... but... I can't read it.""
*What?*
""I can't read it...""
I cursed... how... how could they have evolved without knowing the language of the universe?
*Well... then you're useless to me.* And with these words I pierced him. That felt good. Blood at last. So good I tore him apart. And I had his blood drench the room. Haha!

Anyways. That was the last thing I ever did. Since then no human has ever entered the mine again. Several days after the brutal break in, some odd grey substance started to flow into the shaft. A substance that hardened and became stone. And with that I was locked up again. And no one was going to set me free.
Never.
It's me.
Alone.
In the dark.
Always.

You watch in horror as a couple of modern treasure hunters drill through the door and bypass the puzzle completely.",Maximum_Pootis,"Dr. Drinkwater sat at his desk, rubbing his eyes behind his glasses as he put the finishing touches on his speech at Harvard in the next few days. He leaned back in his chair and looked at the window in his rather large office. He was happy he had spent 30 years digging in dirt and pouring over books and ancient documents for this. He was the worlds foremost expert in Celtology, a field many didn't go into. He had friends who went into Egyptology and some who went eastward to study the great Chinese empires, but not him. Marshal Drinkwater stayed where he felt the best fit, and now has an office and several books to prove his success. 

Dr. Drinkwater stopped smiling and looked back at the computer screen. It wasn't his best speech, but it will do, **it was only Harvard** he thought to himself chuckling. He closed down his computer and sat in silence, a strange darkness lit by the full moon tonight. The rest of the Museum had closed down for the night and only a few night staff remained. He wanted to leave and go back home, but something kept him there. 

After a quick sigh, Dr. Drinkwater stood up. He looked around his rooms, the Celtic Knot that sat above his door. He didn't like to keep artifacts that were historically important, but every now and again when he went to an important dig or some special find he took something small. He looked around the room at the ancient sharp rock, a head of a Roman spear found in an old dig somewhere in south Scotland. Other small artifacts, other little trinkets, all of it was satisfying and brought pleasant memories to Dr. Drinkwater's mind. Then, something happened, Dr. Drinkwater's gaze turned to the little glass case that sat on the little table. Inside was one of the most important find's of Dr. Drinkwater's career, an ancient Celtic Lock. 

The dig where he found it dated back several thousand years, before any form of formal societal structure. The dig was of a hold of treasure that Dr. Drinkwater assumed they stole from surrounding villages. The treasures were long gone, probably stolen by some lucky explorer who found it and took the gold, but the evidence for stone structures that dated back so far was incredible within itself. 

But this lock, this lock was something else. 

It was crude, barely worked half the time, but Dr. Drinkwater always thought there was something more to it. He took it with him and kept turning and twisting each 'dial' even on the plane ride back home. For a few years, it was almost an obsession, like a Rubix cube that you didn't know what the original color was supposed to be. After a while, he just gave up, put it in his office and forgot about it, until now. 

Now it seemed to glow in the moonlight, it reflected the light in a strange way as the ancient Celtic symbols seemed to be clearer and more prominent. Marshal took off the glass case and picked up the old stone lock once again. He could barely make out the Celtic words written around the edge. He had never seen these before, so fixing his glasses and in a delicate tone, he began to read the hymn out loud.

**Here in the circle cast upon the Earth Within our hearts give understanding birth, Our wounds of loss and loneliness heal. Isis unveiled and Isis veiled; The Earth below our feet, the Moon on high. In thee, these two shall never be apart 

The magick of the Earth and Sky.**

Dr. Drinkwater looked around, nothing had happened. Nothing should have happened, it was just an old Hymn to Arianrhod the moon god, why it was written on the underside of the ancient lock escaped him, but he was happy to identify another piece to this strange ancient puzzle. Some of the verses were missing, however, and Dr. Drinkwater could see the words on the rest of the lock. 

**Why is there some sort of cipher that no one could see?** he wondered as he walked over to one of his volumes and pulled down ancient Celtic hymns. He flipped to the one on Arianrhod and found the proper Hymn. He flipped the lock a bit, turned a rock here and there, and noticed a few words were broken off. In a way, he had figured it out, but he would never unlock it due to the constant pressures of time. 

Dr. Drinkwater shrugged, placed it back in the glass case and grabbed his coat. Dr. Drinkwater looked over the lock one last time and began to open the door and leave. That's when he saw the two large men dressed in black look at him. It was an unfortunate gunshot that pierced the chest of Dr. Drinkwater, it was never meant to happen but Dr. Drinkwater always liked to stay in late. The two of them had bigger things to steal, and one dead historian didn't stand in there way. 

It pierced his heart, he was dead before he even hit the ground and began to bleed out. He wasn't a very healthy man for his age and there is no way he would have survived till someone found him. However, in the pale moonlight, a human soul ascended to a castle in the sky. This human soul told Arianrhod what had happened, this human soul told her she was free and for this human's service, he came back to earth with her. 

The pale owl flew through the stars to the ancient lock and saw it complete, despite its tattered experience. The pale Owl could see the evil of those who killed the doctor deep within their soul. They were long gone before the pale Owl came out of her bright form and became the gentle god Princess many knew her as. She lightly touched the doctor's shoulder and let the soul seep through her fingers and the stars and back into the body, muscles and skin repairing and fixing as the energy of the soul entered the body again.

Dr. Drinkwater sat up and caught his breath. He had just been shot and survived. He vaguely remembered something about the Aurora Borealis, lights of a distant place, but nothing more than that. The moon light seemed to be shining in ever brighter now as he looked around for his glasses. He tried to remember what had happened, what did the men look like, what was he doing, who should he call? He picked up his glasses and stood up, looking around to see where they went, but instead of seeing the two robbers he instead saw an impossibly pale girl kneeling on the floor next to a dried puddle of his blood.

Sorry, I didn't do what your prompt said, I was initially trying, but I didn't because I don't know this sounded better. ",Foreverending
"[WP] Magic is real and it's easy to learn powerful spells, but almost no one uses magic because the rituals are extremely embarassing and humiliating to perform.",MesaCityRansom,"I blew the dust off the tome's cover. It was exactly where the old man said it would be. Don't get me wrong, I'm no chosen one or anything. I don't get wizards seeking me out to give me quests on a regular basis. I'm just... well, gullible. I was walking near the canal with some friends when we saw a tramp, sleeping under a child's princess blanket, spooning with a one-eared dog. We tried to hurry past but he must have been watching, because he called out to us.

""You kids want to learn some magic?"" he asked. He sat up, and the dog limped away. When I turned to look at him, I could see his face was covered in obscene drawings. His hair was long at the sides, and shaved clean in a big stripe down the middle of his head. ""Go find *the tome of Rak'shaze'i*. In the childcare section in the library."" Without warning, he threw his head back and began singing. It was horribly out of tune, but the lyrics were Beyoncé's *Single Ladies*. We left him to it, but something inside me wanted to go the library.

And here it was, *the tome of Rak'shaze'i*, in the childcare section, unbelievable. I didn't care that an old lady was watching me browse parenting literature. I opened the book to a page near the middle and immediately dropped it. The book's pages were animated, and talkative. A loud instructional video had started playing on the parchment as soon as the book had been opened, and in the instant before it fell and shut, everyone in the library had turned to look at me. My cheeks flushing red, I picked up the book and hurried over to the counter.

I cycled out to a patch of woods beyond the suburbs before I dared to open the book again. Carefully this time, I opened *the tome of Rak'shaze'i*. Once again, a loud instructional video started playing, and I watched in amazement and horror as a fat balding man, wearing only a leather apron explained how to turn lead into gold.

""This one's pretty simple, folks. What you do, is you take a pack of tissue paper, the more brightly coloured the better. You want to screw the sheets up in the middle so they're pointy, and you put them in your nostrils and your ears, like this... Right, once you've done that, you're going to want to get all your lead, and put in a big dish. Then, we're going outside, and as always, you're going to need some witnesses. You only need two for this one, folks, so you can do this at home or with your neighbours."" The video cut to the man in a garden, a child's swing set clearly visible in the background. A man and a woman looked on from near a fence, clearly unimpressed. ""Alright, so we've got the tissue paper, we've got the lead, we've got our witnesses, all we need now is some gold coloured glitter..."" The man held up a tube of craft glitter to whatever was capturing the video, ""And we're ready to go. I'm going to empty the glitter into my left hand, and with my right, I'll be taking pinches of it and throwing into the dish, and over my head, while I skip around it. Oh, and you've got to be singing for this one too, nothing unusual, I find *land down under* works pretty well."" I watched as the man skipped around the dish, giving a terrible, loud rendition of *land down under* while throwing pinches of glitter alternately over the dish and his own head. I cringed every time he was facing away from the camera and it became all too obvious that the apron was his only covering. The look on the faces of the observing man and woman seemed to reflect my own pretty well, although theirs were tinged with disappointment. Once the song was finished, the man picked up the dish, and brought it towards the camera. He blew the glitter off the metal to reveal shining gold. ""Yep, so like I said, pretty simple."" He put the dish down, and took the tissue paper out of his ears and nose. ""Remember guys, if you liked this video, hit that like button, rate 5/5, tell me your thoughts in the comments below, the link is in the description, don't forget to subscribe, hit that like button..."" He paused for a moment, ""Wear a seatbelt. I'm Rak'shaze'i, and I'll see you next time, when I'll be showing you how to bring back the dead. See ya!"" The page turned black.

I was tempted not to believe the video, until I remembered it had been playing on parchment. I didn't know how to react. I opened the book to the beginning, where I found a contents page. This was incredible! Invisibility, flight, love potions &amp; fireballs instantly caught my attention. but as I watched the video on fireballs, my heart sank. There was no way I could go through with this. Rak'shaze'i had summoned a fireball, but he had given a 45 minute, oddly racist speech on the street about the dangers of welcoming lobsters into our homes, dressed as a cowboy, all for just one fireball. I had to take the book back to the library. There was no way I was doing any of this stuff. My mind wandered back to the old man, lying on the banks of the canal with a moth-eaten dog, covered in drawings like he'd passed out at a party. In a sudden terrible moment, I was terrified of what forces he might be meddling with. If he was using his powers for evil, to what depths might someone have to stoop to stop him. I turned to the last page of the book to find a note from Rak'shaze'i.

"[WP] You are a vegan. Or, you were. A vampire just bit you.",Warlokthegreat,"I knew for a while something was up. I'd almost always had miserable luck in life, so it seemed a little too awesome when the coolest girl in school asked me to out to bowling. Now I hate bowling, but I wasn't about to say no to her. And that's when it bit me.

""Ow! What the heck was that?"" I yelped, glaring at Michelle.

""Oh you'll find out soon enough,"" she grinned, revealing her unbelievably pointy teeth. ""I'll be in the alley behind, so come see me when it starts.""

""When what starts?""

""You'll know.""

She zipped off, zooming past everyone with lightning speed. She was truly an oddball - she was pretty, fast, strong, hilarious and kind, but she was also super mysterious. And pale. Like, really really pale. When I first saw her I swear I thought she showered with paint or something. A lot of the school believed she was a vampire, but as rumours go they were pretty short-lived.

I decided to buy us both a snack and go out to meet her, but right as I was about to move my body went numb and I collapsed onto the floor. I lay there motionless next to the food I dropped, trying to get up and out of the mess. I couldn't move for a few seconds, and as someone came to help me up Michelle showed up, throwing me on her back and zipping out into the alley where she had been waiting.

""So champ, how do you feel?""

""Whaddya mean? Aside from the embarrassment I brought upon myself back there, I'm doing fine.""

""Hm. No weird feelings? No buzzing in your body? No flashes of red in your vision?""

I looked up at her, squinting at her face with a look of annoyance. She squinted back, and we both laughed it off. I'd had a great time but knew the end was nigh. My brain and heart playing tug of war, I wasn't sure what to do at this point. I knew I'd have to do som-

""Ack!""

I bent down, clutching my stomach - it felt like my gut was becoming a Twizzler by the second. As if on cue a loud snap was heard along with my cries of pain as my back snapped and re-snapped, if you can believe it. My entire body convulsed, the pain leaving me writhing on the floor as I transformed into an abomination of horror stories. My eyes saw red, my ears heard heartbeats, my fingertips felt every grain of dirt on the pavement. It was like lifting a blanket off my body, every single sense tingling and picking up new things to explore and identify. 

""W-what's h-h-happening to m-me?"" I croaked, my voice scratching its way out of my throat. ""Ww-what ha-have you do-done?""

""I made you better. You can thank me later.""

Michelle stood there, her form changing as mine did. Her hair grew dark and wispy, her skin grew tougher than a rhino's, her fingers sprouted nails the size of toothpicks, all as she stared at me with those mesmerizing orange eyes.

I finally finished transforming. I knew, because the pain had stopped. I got up, slowly, examining my surroundings and taking in the new world around me.

""So, they were right. You are a vampire. And if the stories hold up, then you've turned me into one.""

""Not bad detective Aaron,"" she chuckled. ""Let's get going. I've got some things to teach you.""

As I smiled and flexed my legs, which felt unbelievably strong, I stopped. A sense of dread began engulfing me, a scenario playing out clearly in my mind.

""W-wait.""

""What? We should go and do this somewhere else - wouldn't want people knowing who we really are.""

""I need to ask you something first - its urgent.""

""Okay, but make it quick.""

""We are vampires now, right?""

""Yesssss.""

""That means we gorge on human blood, right?""

""Correc- well actually, we can drink blood from anything, but human blood gives us more energy than animal blood. But yeah, essentially.""

""Shit.""

""What?""

""I'm a vegan.""

""The hell's a vegan?""

""It's like a vegetarian, but no dairy or eggs or anything from any living creature. So no meat, fish, dairy, eggs, or anything of that sort.""

""That's just a choice, right? You can change it. You *have* to change it, or you can't live.""

""You don't understand - I *can't* do it.""

Michelle stood still, staring at me, the gravity of what I said now dawning upon her as her eyes grew wide.

""Jesus - don't tell me you made a blood vow. Don't tell me you made a blood v-""

""I did.""

Michelle looked at me wide-eyed as I watched her brain race to find a solution. Moments later her eyes flickered, and she turned to me with a grin.

""My brother can fix this. He's really good at fixing things.""

""Michelle, I'm not some broken drawer that needs fixing, okay? I made a blood vow and I can't break it because I will d-""

""Just come on. Trust me - my big bro knows how to deal with things like this.""

""What is he, like a mechanic or something?""

""Nah, Lucy's just the keeper of Hell.""

""Who?""

""Lucifer. He can help us.""

"[WP] You are a vegan. Or, you were. A vampire just bit you.",Warlokthegreat,"I sat in my mess of a bathroom staring at the floor, thinking hard.  Normally I liked to stare at myself whenever I was having one of these ""thinking sessions"", but the fact that I was no longer able to make myself out in the mirror was too distracting and I just couldn't get myself to focus.  Normally doing this helped to calm me down, but I could feel myself slipping into panic mode.  My head hurt...everything actually began to feel like it was spinning around me, just like how you see it happening in the movies.  Thinking hard I took myself back to yesterday to retrace my steps.

I had been staying late at the college to do some make-up lab work for my chemistry class.  Nothing too difficult, but it was unfortunately pretty boring and very time-consuming.  By the time I was all set to head home it was already late into the night.  I remember I was waiting at the bus station just reading my book when the lamppost above me went out with a soft pop.  After that all I could remember was a large figure grabbing on to me and then...nothing.

I awoke in my own bed at home with no idea how I got there and no one around to explain it to me.  Not being able to find my phone I decided to just go ahead and have some breakfast.  I'd gotten myself a slice of banana bread which I managed to make pretty quick work of, but I'd found that for some reason it hadn't filled me up at all.  Confused, I went ahead and ate another slice.  Still nothing.  It's like the food wasn't having any impact on my hunger whatsoever.  Worried at that point, I decided to try some oatmeal instead.  Taking that first spoonful was when I noticed the fangs.  I felt the sharp prick on my tongue as I closed my lips around the spoon and recoiled in pain.  This caused my sudden rush to the bathroom which didn't help to calm me down in the slightest upon not being able to see my own reflection in the mirror.  And that's when I went and slumped down against the wall, which is where I am still currently sitting, hungry and scared.

After taking some deep breaths and finally getting a loose grip on the situation, I decided to take things slowly.  First I stood up and went to check out my tongue since it was still hurting after I accidentally bit into it.  Since I evidently wasn't able to look into the mirror I had to use my hand to asses the damage.  Not being able to resist the curiosity, however, I tenderly went and felt my teeth first.  Everything seemed mostly normal except for my canine teeth which for some reason had become quite sharp and elongated.  Out of habit I looked towards the mirror again only to quickly look away in frustration when nothing but an empty room was there to greet me.  The curiosity was killing me, I suddenly had the thought that I could maybe try taking a picture of myself or something instead but stopped myself from running out of the bathroom.

""One thing at a time."" I whispered under my breath, and stepped back in to check on my tongue.

I could feel the spot where the tooth had hit, a small cut seemed to be the only sign of any damage.  I squeezed around the area to check if it was sore, but was surprised to find that doing so actually brought upon a wonderful sensation.  Stunned, I leaned back and closed my eyes for a moment to just absorb the feeling.  It was like a soothing warmth that quickly drew me in.  I could feel myself unconsciously squeezing my tongue harder and sucking down to keep the sensation going.  It felt so...no, it *tasted* so good.  Opening my eyes I quickly popped my fingers out of my mouth and felt my stomach drop.  They were covered in blood, my blood.

"[WP] A tropical storm forms in the southern Pacific Ocean but stays in one place. Sent to investigate, your team finds an ancient temple hidden in the eye of the storm.",ClassyPigeon234,"‘(Dramatic *yet accurate* synopsis of that day, December 10th, 1954 ~~entry draft~~ attempt one)

“All the natives here are radioactive, Doctor” I said, putting away my Geiger counter.

“How many sieverts?”

“Roughly that of an Air Force pilot in low orbit- for a year. Lots of cataracts too- moles on the skin.”

I stopped examining the native men and women to look at my ‘colleague.’ First time in the field with my wife and I have to refer to her as my boss- and when you’re endowed to a woman who is, well, so endowed, it can be a bit of a distraction. We had the same personality, essentially, though I was a lot more laid back with mine. She was always playing a mental chess game, her eyes always moving the pawns in place. Right now, I was definitely a pawn. She knew more than she was letting on.

“I think we should investigate the southern shore”

I raised an eyebrow, our dark eyes locking.

“Hon- why? The natives are on this side of the island”

“I have the documents, you watch for your degree” 

“I enjoy watching you but I don’t know how much learning I’m getting done”

She rolled her eyes with a slight blush. What? Don’t get all cynical. I like getting laid too, just because I’m engaged doesn’t mean that I have to stop flirting with her, damn. Cancer is depressing, sex isn’t. I didn’t want to think about these poor natives any more than I had to. We were lucky that they were so gracious to Latino-Caucasians, considering they had only contacted the outside world five times in the history of their discovery. Regardless, off for a beach trek I suppose.

As we came across the bend of the island before it swooped into a curved semi-circle and a steep 800m drop into pitch black ocean with no shoreline, there it was. A gigantic trench in the sand, and....four foot prints? 

They were gigantic- saurian like. I quickly sketched out on a pen and paper some dimensions...

“This is a 65 meter tall animal if what I’m looking at is correct- I mean, look at the tail drag marks? It would need a tail almost double it’s size to balance like a kangaroo- this has to be a fucking prank. Square cube law”

My fiancé said nothing....before she put her hand up to me, ushering me to a cave formation....no, scratch that- a temple.

“Babe, go get a native to translate” 

I sighed, and began to jog back to the village while my studious better half did her thing, examining strange cave paintings that lined the semi-natural, semi-artificial temple walls that were carved in the interior of the rock face. 

When I finally returned, I began to see the water retreat.

“Oh shit...move, to the temple! Go, get the other villagers!”

And the rest race scramble went into full swing as we ushered all into the silent and dead temple, now likely to be our catacombal tombs. The sweat raced from my brow, and I held my fiancé tight- waiting for the lethal waves to strike....waves that never came.
We all opened our eyes to see the water surge forward but it was not a complete tsunami, as giant dorsal fins and charred scales obscured the main impact. As the beast approached more shallow waters, it used its claws to help it ascend onto land quickly. 

“GOJIRA!” GOJIRA!” The natives began to chant. My fiancé, who was less astounded than myself, began to point at the pictographs on the cave paintings and the images, of a beast that matched what my eyes were seeing. The natives assuredly were saying yes. What did this have to do with the super storm, though? 

Before our eyes, the beast finally completely rose from the ocean, and it’s dorsal fins and eyes began to glow bright, radioactive and atomic blue. It shifted its gaze downward, fins towards a turbulent sky, and lightning began to strike the dorsal fins.

“Gojira tzing nee lowrg mostasch”

“What did he say?” I asked the translator, gripping the poor girls arm likely a little too tight.

“Ugh-ugh- it gets strength, from the ugh...lightning!”

“-American boom! American boom!”

“And from the ‘American boom’?”

I looked at my fiancé with glaring eyes.
“Corbin...”

“Castle Bravo nuclear test went off last week to kill it. Our secondary goal was to see why it favored this location in the pacific, primary goal was to establish if it survived. It draws strength and energy as a good source from radioactive decaying elements in the Earth’s core- my guess? This island is like a crucible for all of the pacific storms- instead of ending here, they start and focus here. This thing must be powered by, well, I suppose the Earth’s weather as well”

My ears and eyes weren’t connecting with what I was seeing...little did I know that nearly fifty years later, that same beast would rise again and nearly level San Fransisco while trying to extinguish two other ungodly sized monstrosities. We know the cycle however- because when that creature left- my fiancé and I uncovered the images depicting the battle of this Gojira and two Earth gods...along with the *destroyer of the red-land*. Years later we figured out this may be mars....’


The monarch agent slid my great grandfathers journal back at me, having only read a slight bit more.
“While recent events are quite astounding, I’m calling horseshit on this two earthly gods- a big ass reptile-pteranodon and a big ass moth...oh, the three headed dragon that flew here from mars. Listen, kid, we live in a world of monsters now. That doesn’t mean we get to make up fake ones. Not doubting your grandpap didn’t see Godzilla, or those paintings, but I’m not putting stock in what a bunch of savages put on a wall”

I frustratingly put my head in my hands, I had tried. Gramps was smarter than the rest of the family, save for grandma. They were always grounded people- and the fact they helped fund this damned organization just to be labeled cooks? Nah, fuck these pricks. 
I stood up, grabbing the journal and almost began walking out when an older Japanese man and a youn Caucasian lady approached me.
“Would you be interested in a job going to the arctic?”

“After the way I was treated and how my grandparents were treated? No, fuck you”

The older Japanese gentlemen then handed me an envelope that was labeled:
“LEO images: Cosmic dragon under ice” 

“Well, not super top secret to tell me what the photos are of before I look at them”

He patted me on the shoulder.
“Take us to your grandparents, Mr. Martin”

“Just call me Steve- like the comedian, yeah, I know, I get it all the time...they still live in Kentucky”

“We have airplanes- you must know it is imperative we keep his animal under the ice...and from the news”

The disembodied hands, bright white mottled with puke green, left streaks of phlegm wherever they touched. Alex tried to yell out, but one giant appendage was clamped over his mouth. Alex raised his head up, pushing through the rat king of writhing fingers, and saw a mouth made of shadow consuming his right hand. 

It was Alex's own muffled scream that woke him. A rough cloth gag made him choke and instinctually Alex reached up for it with his right hand. His forearm came up, passed the point where his hand should have found his mouth, and kept going. The cauterized stump on the end of Alex's arm left behind a light dollop of cloudy puss where it brushed against his chin. 

Realizations came fast and hard. First the arm and another muffled wail. Alex ripped off the gag with his left hand and allowed himself one full throated scream. 

Some Wall Street surgeon had done a number on him,  but at least had the decency to stop the bleeding. Losing the hand was frightening, but not final. As long as he made it back to the Heights, Alex would have another hand by the end of the week. 

Unfortunately, Alex had bigger problems. The alleyway he was in was mostly shaded, but the powerful heat and moisture of a 100 day had sucked a lot of life from him. Even a sleeping man, in shade, without personal coolers or water, would succumb to a 100 day within 12 hours. The math was ubiquitous and well known, but, Alex thought ruefully, calculated for an adult male whose arm had not just been amputated by flesh traders.

Alex's head ached terribly. Some combination of dehydration and shock. If he didn't get some water, and back into climate control soon he was a dead man. Just another corpse dragged out of lower Manhattan by high tide. 

With herculean effort Alex got to his feet. He looked around for portable shade and stopped on a fetid square of cardboard. His skin was still sticky and wet, which was a good sign, but no help on a 100 day. When the humidity and temperature both broke 100 degrees no amount of sweat could cool a person down. 

With the bendable cardboard folded over his head with his left hand, his fresh, dribbling stump to his right, Alex stepped out of the shaded alleyway and onto Fulton street. 

Hollowed out cars covered in barnacles littered the streets. Not another human being was in sight. No one, especially old city folk, would be so stupid as to be caught outside on a 100 day. 

""Fulton street."" Alex muttered the words outloud to himself, trying to picture the map of the old city in relation to the heights. Fulton was downtown. Way the fuck downtown. There was no way he would make it north by foot -  Even with his right arm and at peak health, the heat would take him. 

That left only the tag. Every citizen of the Heights had one for exactly this purpose. Simply think the correct passphrase, carefully visualizing each word, and the tag would transmit an emergency beacon. Armed evac would cost three months salary, but there was no alternative. 

*Watershed, Grant's Tomb, Rivulet,* Alex began thinking the six passwords, carefully envisioning a drop of clear water or the great lakes, which Alex saw once before encapsulation. *Oak Tree, Breakfast Cereal, Gallows.*

A small male voice spoke inside of Alex's head. ""Emergency Beacon activated. Insufficient range. Please find higher ground.""

It was the skyscrapers that were fucking him, rising on all sides. The ancient, inefficient monstrosities were filled to the brim with stray dogs and old city folk waiting for night to fall. Alex sucked his front teeth and looked up at one particular building, taller than the rest. A giant broken glass spire 500 yards in front of him, studded with antennae, solar panels, wind mills and air conditioners of every conceivable make and model. 

""Shit."" 

Without another word Alex set off for the frankenstein building - the one skyscraper in the old city as infamous now as it once was famous - run by Boss Gar and overflowing with desperate human life. When Boss Gar refused the edict to evacuate and took it over, she kept the building's original name. Boss Gar was a sadist. She felt the name was fitting, and fucking hilarious. 

Slowly, one heavy step after another, Alex made his way towards the base of the Freedom Tower.

"[WP] A sandstorm is coming in the distance. In it are tiny black dots, floating 50 metres above the ground.

""I'm a witch"" she said.

This didn't come as  a shock to me, and hardly had reason to be such a serious secret.    ""Alternative"" beliefs are very common in the lesbian community, she's not even the first Wicca I've dated.  That one lead to some really awesome outdoor sex so overall Wicca girlfriend is a good thing.  

I told her, ""That's great, no reason for the big secret, I'm not the spiritual type, but I've dated someone who's Wicca before""

""No you don't understand, I'm a real witch.""

Ah yes, human nature, so many sects, and everyone else is wrong.

""Sorry, didn't mean to imply it was the same.  Is there anything I need to know about your beliefs?""  I asked.

""No, I guess..."" then she giggled, ""No, not that.""

""What?""

""Well, it's hereditary, but I guess we don't have to worry, I mean..""  she trailed off.

""Hey, I'm not saying we're like to that point, lesbian stereotypes be damned, but if we do there's always ways, miracles of modern science and all.""

The night digressed into jokes about turkey basters, and soon was forgotten.

Half a year later we were living together, and things were going ok, I guess there are tensions in any relationship.    Then one night, I mean I guess not one night, an important night, she forgot my birthday.    Just completely spaced on it.   I knew she new, I'd seen her put it in her phone when I told her, so she just forgot.

I was pissed, and more importantly I was hurt.   I felt like I wasn't important.   So I wound drinking, and perhaps drinking too much.  I remember dancing.

I woke up, around 4am, in a strange bed, naked wrapped around a cute blond.   ""Oh shit""  I thought.

So I found my clothes and got out of there, returning home I knew honesty was my only hope so I fessed up.

I don't think I've ever seen someone so angry in my life, she didn't even speak to me just glared at me muttering I couldn't understand.

Then a flash of light, well the light didn't really go away so bright, and sand, when my eyes adjusted I saw a desert, not our apartment.  Endless sand dunes.    And in the distance, a sandstorm was heading this way... and something or someone? was flying within it,    I suddenly knew, if I didn't run, I wasn't going to survive.",dream6601

""Woah woah woah there pal, why have *I* got to find it?""

He roars, slamming his tail around viciously as he paces around the room ""Because I've been told you're the one to get things done around here! And, because I will TEAR OFF YOUR HEAD if you don't do it.""

Well, he had a point. And I'm not fond of my head being removed from my shoulders.

""Okay, okay, Call down. What have you got for me to go on?""

Baurus slams his hand down onto the desk, tearing it asunder, and leaving behind a piece of metal.

""THAT. That does not belong in my abode."" He bellowed in such a way it felt like my soul crumbled under the force of his voice.

""That's it?"" I shake off the feeling, and try to remain as calm as possible. It's not my first time dealing with demons, but it's the first time dealing with something of his stature. ""Okay, but it's not much... I'll have to visit the scene of the crime, too.""

Baurus finally relaxes, his shoulders dropping slightly.

""Very well."" He reaches out to me, and in a blinding flash I find myself on the edge of a cliff, flames roaring around me.

Mr. Johnstone‘s first name is Lonnie. The nurses used to call him loony Lonnie, before the break out. I still call him Mr. Johnstone.

You stumble around, the earth crunching beneath your feet. You hear the faint sound of whistling in the air as you look around to find your son. He's much smaller than you, and alone. He's probably somewhere lost. Hungry. Crying. You let out another roar. You can't even hear him. You notice something moving around your feet. The whistling is starting to irritate you. You look down. What the he'll is this? Insects? They've been dead for thousands of years!

The memories come back. You hid away, deep underground, In hopes of getting away from them. You remember the sheer agony they would deal to you. Boy do you hate evolution. But now you're awake, and you're having to deal with everything once more. You start to pound the floor with your feet. Structures crumble like sand castles. The insects beneath you are wiped away instantly. The whistling quiets.

These aren't like the insects you're used to. They're squishy. What is this? What are they? You notice something flying at you, and it lets off a small projectile. It explodes on impact.

Ouch. That one did sting! You swat it away and it seems as though it's made of rock. Flying rocks? That's absurd!

You start to run. What if your son is lost and being attacked by these rocks? He could be injured! Faster. You have to find him.

Suddenly, a bright light appears in the distance! Brutus! He can't control himself! He must have caused that, you think. Suddenly, a familiar smell and a wave of air hits you hard. It's definitely him, he caused a burst to occur. He *is* being attacked. You clamber on all six and Sprint towards the direction of the explosion. You *have* to get to him.",DeadlyCreamCorn
"[WP] A monster is tearing through a city, destroying everything in its path. You ARE the monster, and you haven't a fork what's going on.",RealJohnGillman,"Dragons are real.  You probably didn’t know that, but dragons exist and they’re just like you’ve read about in stories or imagined when huddled around a table throwing dice and stuffing your face with more Doritos than any sane person would consider.  Fire-breathing, scaly, gigantic, they can fly, some have an obsessive compulsion to hoard gold or kidnap princesses… all absolutely, totally, real.  

Komodo dragons are real.  This you probably did know, and they’re very much like you would see in a nature documentary or in an online compilation of the most “metal” animals (whatever that means).  They’re large, though nowhere near as big as non-Komodo dragons, and while they don’t fly or breathe fire, they do have a famously nasty bite and are *incredibly* quick over short to moderate distances.  All dragons, whether they can trace their family back to Wales or to Gili Motang, are also wicked smart.  Not that they’ll brag about it, but some can count all the way to *seven*.  Impressive, right?

You’re probably asking yourself how I know these things.  Well, it’s simple: I’m a dragon… and a komodo dragon.  No, I’m not a komodo dragon that can transform himself into a bigger, more immolating-prone dragon (but how cool would that be?), I’m just half-komodo, half-not-komodo.  My mother, she’s a kindly Norwegian behemoth; a good twenty stories tall, forked tail and tongue, a wingspan that could blot out the sun year round if it wasn’t so shy up in Norway.  But my dad?   He’s the komodo kind.  A few years back my mom decided to take a break from the Norwegian winter and soar to more tropical shores and just so happened to land on the beautiful island of Komodo where she met my father.  They got to chatting, comparing eating a buffalo to burning down a village, they fell in love, one thing lead to another and a few years later…me.  And yes, I know, I just mentioned dragons can be well over twenty stories tall while, according to Wikipedia, a Komodo dragon can only reach a little over ten feet.  So there’s a bit of a size discrepancy there that has left a few of you wondering about the, uh, “logistics” of how I came to be.  My dad told me once, he even used his tail to draw some colorful diagrams in the sand.  Let’s just say that love is an incredible motivator, it involved a great deal of determination and flexibility, and that there are certain nightmarish mental images I can now carry safely to my grave.  Moving on.  Please.

Okay, so now you’re probably picturing me as a giant lizard with wings and a forked tail.  And you’re close, but the truth is genetics can be… tricky.  Honestly, I favor my dad.  If you saw me from a distance you might even think I’m just a Komodo dragon standing in front of some really tiny trees.  But my mom?  I got my size from her side of the family.  So, really, I’m not *that* scary, I’m just your run-of-the-mill monitor lizard. 

Except that I’m thirty-two stories tall.

And I can breathe fire.

And I can count to seven.

It’s okay if you’re still having trouble picturing me, because I have a classic example of good news/bad news.  Good news first: I’m gonna be on TV!  Tune in to Channel 13 tonight, because I totally see one of their reporters wildly gesturing towards me in front of a news van while her cameraman is filming the whole thing.  Bet you didn’t think you’d meet someone famous today, did you?  Now for the bad news: I may have, completely inadvertently mind you, carved a path of infernal destruction straight through the heart of Houston, TX.

And burned down a town in Mexico.

My bad.

All I wanted was to visit my dad.  After decades of diligent service, he’d finally decided it was time to retire from the lucrative goat-eating industry and move to the Houston Zoo to enjoy his golden years in luxury and quiet contemplation.  I figured I’d take a weekend trip, swim across the Pacific, and see how he was settling into his new place.  It’s not like I *intended* to set I-59 on fire, and I absolutely didn’t ask for a bunch of tanks to roll down the highway, aim at me, miss, and accidentally shell that megachurch into a pile of smoldering rubble.  You tap a human on the knee with one of those little hammers, they kick.  You shoot a giant lizard in the ribs with an RPG, he engulfs an entire platoon in hellfire.  Those are natural reflexes and we can’t control it.  I tried politely explaining the situation to the soldiers I hadn’t instantaneously charbroiled, but my social anxiety was *really* flaring up, and wouldn’t you know, more flames.  More!  I’m just as shocked as all of you.  Everyone will feel better when the flames are extinguished and all of their flesh, skin, and internal organs grow back.  Now, between the anxiety and the smell of cooked meat, I may have stress-eaten a baker’s dozen worth of cars, at least one of which I distinctly recalled made a barking noise when I put it in my mouth.  We all have our bad habits and my doctor says I could stand to lose a ton of weight (that’s not a euphemism, he literally says I’m about 2000lbs overweight), but what’s done is done.  Judge me if you want, but we all know at least one of you is planning to go to Taco Bell for dinner tonight.

Anyways, I’d gone this far and it felt silly to turn around now.  A few friendly citizens kindly pointed and screamed at me, I tried to wave back at them and accidentally knocked over a billboard advertising someone who calls himself “The Texas Hammer”, crushing everyone underneath.  A couple of F-22s tried to buzz me, I fled through an apartment building which *now* I know isn’t just a large, rectangular rock but is sort of a multi-layered hive filled with humans living inside it.  When a group of soldiers fired those things, bullets I think they’re called (they tickle so much!), at me to politely direct me to take the proper detour to reach the zoo, I may have turned around a little too quickly and my tail may or may not have knocked over a couple of other structures and sent a mixture of cars and people hurtling hundreds of feet through the air.  The point is, mistakes have been made and all of us are at fault.  None of that means no one can tell me if the Apache helicopter hovering over Bissonnet means I need to turn here or if I need to go that way.  But if I *go that way* then what do I do about the helicopter?  Oh, right.

I eat it.

I eat the helicopter.

Whirly really is one of my favorite flavors.

Now, it’s clear to me the city of Houston wasn’t really designed with “giant fire-breathing Komodo dragons” in mind.  No one’s perfect, it’s a city that proudly celebrates its diversity, and I’m sure Mayor Turner is already drafting me a “thank you” for making the city more accessible to myself by clearing out some of these unnecessary buildings to widen the avenue.  No one needs a Waffle House, let alone over a dozen of them.  After all, I did overhear someone say he’d called for a “State of Emergency.”  That is what “State of Emergency” is humanspeak for, right?  “Our warmest welcome to our new best friend, the giant fire-breathing lizard”?  Maybe they’ll name a park after me.  All of these parks have names, but I’m sure there’s another Waffle House and do they honestly need separate museums for modern art *and* fine art?  Absolutely not. I’ll remember to smash one on my way out, probably save the city millions in demolition fees.

I haven’t lied to you about anything so far, I need you to know that.  Actually, scratch that, I did lie about one thing.

I can only count to six.  Please don’t tell anyone, especially Reggie.  Reggie’s a jerk.

But as I’m standing here, clawing halfway up what *this time* I’m confident is nothing more than a large, rectangular rock that isn’t filled with terrified miniature mammals so I can see how close I am to the zoo, a thought occurs.  

This isn’t the right Houston.

My dad moved to *a* Houston but not *this* Houston.  While trying to remember, I also clawed at another building and wondered what a “Holocaust” was and why they needed yet another museum dedicated to it.  Eh, if they really want it they can rebuild it.  Now, was it Houston… Missouri?  No, he always had choice words for the “Show Me” state.  “Show me” literally anything else, he’d always say.  Houston… Alaska.  Mom would love it there, sure, but it didn’t sound right.  Houston… Texas?  Was it Houston, Texas?!  I need to go to Houston, Texas!

Oh.  Right.

Finally, it hit me: a sidewinder missile, causing me to belch up another deluge of flames across a solid city block.  

Deep breath, count to seven, and remember where dad is…

One.

Two.

Three.

Four.

Five.

Six.

Kappa.

Damn.

Houston… British Columbia.

He’s in British Columbia, wanted to soak up all of that “free Canadian healthcare” like it was the sun before a long day at the goat-hunting warehouse.  At least I got to take a trip to Mexico and enjoy one of the true gems of the American South, my dad will love to hear all about it.  I should get him a souvenir while I’m here, maybe one of these Metro buses.  Does my dad want a bus?  My dad wants a bus.  Oh, silly humans inside it, your piercing screams of love warm my heart so much I couldn’t help but incinerate a good portion of The Heights 

And that’s the story of how I destroyed Vancouver, completely by mistake.

""You know,"" Ted whispered. The fish stopped and almost like looked at Ted. ""I have had a really shitty month.""

The fish in response opened mouth and moved its mouse traditional way open and closed. He almost could hear sounds coming from the fish. He smiled.

""First I was teleported to a strange new world,"" Ted complained, started doing circles around the table, in the middle of it: fishbowl. The fish stayed in place and just followed the Ted. Ted himself did not notice that.

""Then we followed a wooden ship to civilization. It later turned out the land was previously known as the United Kingdom,"" he explained. ""Now there was no longer countries or continents. They were just known as people.""

Fish, whose name was known as Blob, opened his mouth and let out few noises, what didn't leave the water. It felt like Blob was trying to talk to the ted, but he was just doing a monologue. Ted didn't hear nor notice that.

""Then the folk found out that we have metal and own something of an old-time,"" Ted explained and stopped. He took a chair from a  corner of the room, close to the window, and pushed it behind the table, sitting on it. He finally put all his attention on fish who was staring at him. The fish opened slowly mouth and then closed it moment alter.

""It is almost as you listen and talk to me,"" Ted whispered. Few tears started to gather on his side, but he quickly removed them.

""They started hunting us. All of us,"" Ted said. ""Only me and Hazel are now alive,"" I moaned and looked at the side of the filthy room they were in. Hazel was sleeping in the corner, on a few carpets they had gathered. She had cried herself to sleep, again. All of it was too much for her. It was too much even to Ted.

""I honestly don't know what to do,"" Ted said, as he watched Hazel. Within past month, he had learned about Hazel a great deal and since only two of them were alive, he wanted to keep her alive more than ever. He didn't want to be the last survivor.

""This is stupid,"" Ted suddenly declared, stood up and looked away out of the window. They were hiding in a deserted city. It used to be a great city called London. One of the mightiest cities. Now, it was grown full of green, slowly destroying the civilization it no longer had. Now and then he could hear explosions of old traps being triggered by nature. Nobody dared to venture into any old cities. This also made it a perfect place to hide.

Many might wonder, why it was so dangerous to go there. When aliens left the Earth in hopes that all humanity was eradicated, they still left traps everywhere, but most cities, in hopes that they would return there. They did, for a very short while, but not for long.

""I need to find food,"" Ted whispered loudly enough for Blob to hear. He then turned slowly towards the goldfish, staring at him. Blob stared back at Ted. Room was silent. Blob suddenly started swimming circles like crazy, mouth moving as fast as his movement. Ted was confused. Almost like fish understood what he was hinting at.

And then, Blob was pushing its chin against the glass, hoping to push the glass bowl.

""What the hell,"" Ted finally spoke, moving more towards the bowl. Blob moved then towards the surface and so did Ted stare. He moved slowly his face closer and closer to the bowl. When he was close enough, Blob came on top of the water and split some water towards Ted's face.

""Ah, you slimy bastard,"" Ted shouted, then got silent and looked towards Hazel, making sure he didn't wake her up. They haven't had a sleep for days and Ted took the first watch, giving her a moment to rest.

And this is how Ted and Blob first time met. Ted had thought of eating Blob the Wizard. No, Ted did not eat Blob.

"[WP] You're explaining the worst moment in your life to a fish, unaware that it can understand everything you're saying.",RealJohnGillman,"It wasn't blue enough. That was my immediate thought. The sky wasn't blue enough to die for, and I couldn't even pick the sun out from the clouds.

But it seemed right. I would forgive God for it. It'd be a bit silly of me to ask for better weather now, on my deathbed, when that wish would've been much more appropriate when I was still on an unsunk boat. With the wooden shard firmly fixed into my stomach, the plank jutting outward to where it scrapes against the heavens as my breaths come in and out, it felt poetic enough: When I was little my father taught me how to spearfish, and now the Father taught me how it felt the other way around.

I did not agree with his sense of humor. 

The shoreline, as I could tell, was accompanied by nobody but me, the sands far and level without the clutter of wreckage blemishing its beauty. It did not seem correct, given the situation, but to lift my head up to study my surroundings further seemed like too much to bear. If my shipmates were still alive, I do not know. Though it hurt me to say it, I preferred the bliss of ignorance. If I was going to rest in peace, as all men are destined to do, then I couldn't worry about such things. Soon these waves would take me. That was good enough for me.

But of course I awoke again, after sleeping proved to be just that. Time seemed to be still: The sky had not changed from its ashen mood, and I could not help but wonder if God had more to say to me while I was still around. I could feel my blood seep into my lungs, and each breath proved harder than the last as I laid in the sand. It had to be soon, afterall. I could not stand the pressure against my chest any longer.

But something moved, somehow, and the weight shifted away from me. I felt for the spear, as if the wound had been mysteriously healed, yet my hand ended up caressing its edge. The pain was still there, radiating within me, but something had changed in a way that I did not understand.

Forcing my neck, I looked forward and saw a dolphin beached beside me. My eyes strained incredibly to focus, but there was no mistaking the form. It appeared I wasn't the only soul beached here, and it bothered me. I didn't get the joke this time.

""You shouldn't be here,"" I said to the fish. ""This is my spot.""

But the dolphin did not move away, and its tailfin wagged defiantly at me. It confused me that I did not see the beast earlier, even in my delirium, as it would've been beached by the same storm that had devoured my ship. With its body turned away from me, I could not discover lacerated skin or any similar injury. In fact, its skin was clean and almost pearly white, as if not a single grain of sand had ever stained it. 

I laid my head back down, accepting the circumstance. Soon the animal would die by dehydration, and I would tag along if the blood loss did not take me first. It felt poetic enough.

""While you were out there,"" I asked, turning my head to watch the beast's underside. ""did you see any of my friends swim on by?""

The tailfin said no.

""...Are you sure?""

The tailfin reaffirmed its stance.

""Then okay,"" I asked. ""I believe you. I wonder what became of them.""

As time passed, the blissless reality of death began to sink in, and I could not go back to sleep. I did not know how much time I had left, but it felt like an eternity.  There was no peace in this, I kept thinking. Though I knew how silly it was to ask, I wondered about the dolphin, and if the beast understood death as well as I did. Did it understand this plight put upon us, or did it only understand the pain?

It bothered me. It felt cruel. 

""There are worse things than this,"" I said, hoping the words could put us at ease. ""This is a terrible fate, but there are worse things. The regret, I think, is the worst part. There is a girl out there I loved, and she'll never even know. How silly is that? Does that make sense to you?""

The tailfin wagged indecisively. So I went on.

""Well, that's how I see it,"" I said. ""Death by itself is so... easy. Simple by design. It is the pain of living that can make it so difficult to let go.""

I rested my head on the sand, closing my eyes for what I hoped to be the final time.

""I can still see her face. It's been so long, but I can. There are parts I can't remember. The color of her eyes have been lost to time. The little small details, the freckles on her cheeks, those are the things that hurt the most, knowing that I can't remember them the way I saw them the first time.""

When I failed to sleep, I opened my eyes again, scanning for the dolphin's presence. It should be dead at this point, but I had to see for myself while there was enough sunlight to look with my own eyes. Instead, God decided to play one last joke: I saw her.

She sat above me, her smile beaming, the locks of her fair hair flowing with the wind. I did not understand it, but she was there, at the last moment before my blood-filled lungs begin to suffocate. 

I turned away. I knew it had to be an illusion: a last ditch effort for my brain to finally be at peace. I could not accept it. I was going to die. The stick in my stomach made sure of that. I didn't need this false dream to help me rest.

I thought about the dolphin, and realized how petty I had been. I was doomed from the start, of course, but the dolphin...It didn't need to die. It could still get to the water if I just gave it one push. That is the least I could do.

I wasn't making any sense. That was my immediate thought. The water was too far for me to die for, and I couldn't even get my body up from the sand. 

But with one last effort I lifted myself up, the wooden splinter cleaving into me, and I pushed the dolphin forward with all my might. My hands slipped right off, my chest immediately falling to the cold shore. Death however did not come, though the spear should've ripped my insides in two. I looked back up to the sky, and in that moment I saw her again. She was still there, watching me.

""What are you doing, dude,"" she said. I didn't understand. I had to save the fish. When I lifted myself again to push the dolphin forward, however, the tailfin...slithered away. When I tried a third time, the tail swam upwards into the warm embrace of my long lost love. For some reason, she pinched the bridge of her nose.

"[WP] Instead of the moon, Earth and its sister planet revolve around each other. Unbeknownst to us, our sister planet has intelligent life that has been evolving separately. The year is 1969 and Neil Armstrong sets foot on this other planet.",Send_Me_Puppies,"Everything melted away when he left Earth and he saw things naked and stark and true. The black bred clarity, and through the static of the panicked voices and the silence of anticipation, he could see them, he could hear them *true*. All the smiles were fake. The fanfare was fake. Everything felt fake when he left the world. 


*Isn't that something?* he thought.


Fake. Maybe that was not the right word. 


*Forced.*


Yes, he thought maybe that word was better. He was afraid. They all were. No man had set foot on the second planet before. He thought no man might. 


*Forced.*


Everything was forced. Men were forced into roles that weren't true, that wasn't in their nature. This rocket was forced. Against the natural order of things, there was that falseness, that sense of being *forced*. He looked out the window. They had left the atmosphere. It was black all around.


Luna glowed in the sun's splayed light. That planet was smaller, delicate and almost white. They called her Little Sister. There were houses there, white roofs and drawn roads against her face. Buzz looked at the window.


""Goddammit they were right. Just look at that, Neil. Just look.""


The houses were small, like dice. The light reflected white in a soft way. The radios stuttered. NASA was talking but he ignored their words for Luna's beauty.


They came closer. The ship gave some warnings. The thrusters were giving some trouble. He worked fast to correct things. He thought of the eulogies they would give if they were to die. He looked at Buzz and heard those sincere, pretty words Nixon would give.


*Forced,* he thought.


He controlled the thrusters and they were on course. That planet was beautiful. It was not forced, he thought. There was some fundamental beauty there.


""Mission control this is Neil Armstrong. We're engaging the landing sequence.""


""Look Neil! I think that's people. That has to be...""


The rocket was slowing. The atmosphere was a weak sliver and the sky remained black against a white smoke. All around was soft soil and rolling hills. There were houses as they landed. It all looked like some old Spanish painting.


Neil wondered at the people. There had to be people there. The rocket made quite a noise. 


Then everything was quiet. They lurched forward and his heart was beating hard. Everything had stopped. They had landed.


The door opened and saw reflected light from his helmet. He could feel a million eyes upon him, those from back home, and strangers in the hills and surroundings of Luna.


""This is one... one small step for Man... one giant leap for mankind.""


He had thought of those words. He heard the static. He imagined the cheers. He felt good. Buzz was behind him. And then his heart sank, and there was an emptiness in that lonely space where it had just been.


*False.*


Maybe it was the stress of it all that kept him thinking. He did not know.


*Those words are false.*


Or maybe forced? Buzz was tapping his shoulder. The gravity there was weak. They could almost float. He felt free in a way. Then there was a commotion. He saw them. He made a loud noise.


""Neil? What's wrong?""


They were small. They looked like dwarves. 


*Shouldn't they be tall?* he wondered.


They were small creatures. Their eyes were human, but their mouths were small round. They had thick hair and they were naked, but they were not primitive. He could tell they were smart. They looked at him with...


*Fear.*


All those 'F' words, he thought. He knelt as they had taught them. Buzz stood behind him. He opened his arms to show he was unarmed.


""I see them,"" he said to all the people in Earth. ""I see them and they are... they are so small... so harmless...""


And he wondered if those words were truer than his spiel about giant leaps for mankind.


*False,* he thought as spread his arms.


It all felt false. Perhaps the creatures could sense it. Or maybe they were only scared. They screamed and ran to their white hills. Some pelted him with small stones. They were beautiful stones and he could see them on necklaces and rings.


""Small,"" he said. 


It was near time to go.


The rocket took off to a crowd of upturn faces. He saw them with awe in their eyes. Had God just come, he wondered. Did they even believe in such?


He felt that emptiness in his stomach and anxiety about going back home. Buzz was ecstatic. He could feel his excitement.


""Neil, we've done it. I can't believe it. I really can't. And this is just the beginning. This was a start. We just *proved* this could be done. We beat the Russians.""


He nodded.


""Did you see them there, Neil? They looked like kids. They looked so much like us.""


""Yes, they did.""


And he wondered if they would fight like kids as well. How would they react to the gunshots and death? Would they cry and hide? Or were they similar, those children of the Little Sister?


*They were not fake.*


He could feel it. 


*They weren't false.*


Those eyes had shown an innocent people. Their sincerity was not a show. He felt upset. He looked to home and he missed it. He missed his wife and the air and his house and the safety of Earth. He was a man. He would not deny that. But he felt ashamed.


The rocket was entering the atmosphere.


He just had a feeling. And he felt sad and guilty.



*I bet in fifty years you'll be dead. You won't be our Little Sister anymore. I think you'll be our Little Tragedy, our sad reminder of the kind of Big Brothers we are. I bet you'll be nothing but a white, empty husk, full of craters and depleted mines.*



He closed his eyes. His thoughts were hardly so long, he thought. That must have been eating at him, but he wasn't sure. Earth embraced them and he knew the rest of the trip would be safe. He knew he was home. And he knew his home would stand forever. Perhaps that was just the way of things. 


*Maybe that's just a fact.*


Then they were home.

"[WP] In the age of superheroes, you were gifted with perhaps the most powerful ability of all, true free will.",Vishante-Kaffas,"‘The Age of Heroes’ as it is called began in 2049, and is still stretching onward. Serpé was born in 2050 and as such was one of the ‘lucky’ ones who was blessed with a power. Well not at first. For much of his life he was just as bland as all of his friends who were born without powers. No fire, no lightning, no super sense, not even the ability to talk to an animal. But he was fine with it.

In truth it is most likely he didn't even realize he had his power. It was subtle enough to where even the most talented mind reader would never come close to guessing it. The first instance of it arose when he was seventeen. The school he was attending was attacked by a Super Villain who, for whatever reason, decided attacking a school filled with super-powered teens chock full of pent up aggression was a good idea.

The building shook with an explosion that threatened to topple it all down to the foundation. All the top students were called to come defend, the rest were to evacuate. Serpé found his instincts flaring, fight or flight screaming to act. He knew he should run but it just didn't feel right to do so. He should be fighting with the rest of them!

...No that wasn’t right. He knew he didn't have any powers. He should be running. Calmly he followed procedures, evacuating out with the rest of them. The feeling that was left behind as he loitered around with his classmates was an odd one. He felt bad for not rushing to do what little he could but simultaneously he knew it would have been the death of him if he did so.

It wasn’t until his third year in highschool that he began to get an idea of the powers at play in the background. He had chose to take Psychology as his elective, and throughout the class they often had discussions about morality and instincts left over from human’s days as predator and prey. Everyone else, when speaking of morals, described this little itch they had in the back of their mind that constantly pushed them to do one thing or another. Driving them forward into the person and hero they were meant to be with their powers. Even the few students outside of him with no powers who had taken the class described similar feelings. It was many an odd glance he accrued the day he admitted he felt no such thing. No itch, no voice, nothing. All of his decisions were boiled down to him and what he felt would be best. That day after class his teacher pulled him aside and they talked more. He, at the request of his teacher, contacted a friend of his to research and probe into his mind.

It took them nearly six months but they did find the root. For whatever reason he did indeed have complete and utter control over his own mental processes. Even down to instincts. They described it as a super-like ability. That day he was all over the news. ‘The Superpower of Free WIll.’ Of course, this is far from spectacular. It wouldn’t take but a week for his name to fade into obscurity. He liked it better that way.

As time went on he became slowly more despondent to the world around him. Lack of conviction, others would call it. But what conviction does one have when they can make their own decisions void of anything? Of course he knew that wasn’t true. It wasn’t lack of conviction. Rather, it was apathy. An apathy towards his power and a resentment to the Universe for giving it to him.

At a club, in the dark bathroom, staring into the mirror he shivered. He was scared. Not of himself, or what he saw in the mirror and his eyes. But rather of what he could not see. The Universe, ever since his power awoken, had been tugging more and more at him. Trying to get him to do the heroic thing. Pushing him in the directions of stress, of a better narrative. And each time he turned around and walked the opposite way. For Serpé knew exactly what his power meant. It took him years to figure it out, but eventually it boiled down. The Universe was a cruel joke made by some cruel god, constantly deciding the actions of every single one of them. Pre-determined fate one may call it. Indeed his free will meant, in all aspects, he was cut free from the strings of his own story. It was both exhilarating, and deadening.",Megafalzar

That love they once shared, that burnt so bright in both of their hearts, it returned. But no sooner than it had, did it disappear, and Brad once again reminded herself that it was no longer love, but rather nostalgia for a love that once was that was gone. 

Tomorrow he would be gone. He had no plans to tell Cassie why, there was no note, no explanation, nothing for Cassie. Brad had tried to say it all out before, but it seemed impossible to put into words. How could he? She had broken their wedding vows when she slept with Theresa, and while he had promised to be a better man, Brad couldn't deal with it, not anymore. His heart ached for a while as he tried, pretending to still love her, hoping that those feelings would rekindle. But here he was, four months later, and his heart still felt just as empty.

Still, for now he smiled at her. He may not love Cassie, but he cared about her, perhaps too much. That's why there would be no explanation; because any effort to try and explain it made him feel too guilty about leaving him. in spite of everything, and how much she wanted to deny it, she still cared deeply for him, she just could not love him. Not anymore.

Cassie held Brad close and smiled. She seemed so happy in this moment together. Brad pushed these thoughts out of his mind. One more night, out of necessity, then a fresh start for him. 

""Brad,"" Cassie said cautiously, ""I need to tell you something.""

Brad was caught off guard. Was this it? Had she been thinking what he had this whole time. Within an instant visions raced through his mind, thoughts of her leaving, how he would have to deal with her leaving him. Without even meaning to she had held up a mirror into just how callous Brad had planned to be. 

And yet, if this was what she was thinking, surely that was a good thing? It would be far easier to split up if they both wanted it, right? Why should they both be miserable, when they could agree to split up and move on amicably? Maybe this was it, maybe this was how it should be? Maybe this was why Brad could never leave a message, because he knew he would be told first before he got to say it to Cassie.

So then why now, when he was already planning to do all that, did it now hurt? Why was the idea absolute agony? Why was he content to walk out on his own terms, but Cassie doing it to him hurt like a thousand daggers through the heart? Did he even want their relationship to be over? His mind was now racing, so overcome with conflicted emotions.

[WP] Write a story without using the word “the” if possible!,synystercarnage,"Last Watch

People started to file out slowly, one at a time at first, then in groups.  A slow trickle of black dressed men and women left Corporal Greenbriar's wake. Some stayed for a while, his parents stood quietly  accepting well wishes and condolences. His sergeant stood surrounded by other men in military dress uniform. But Jo sat quiet and by herself staring down a flag covered casket.

Joanna or ""Jo"" was his widow. She hadn't talked much since hearing of her husband's death. An IED blew up his convoy, he never even got a chance to fight back. He spent months in training, even longer in baking heat fixing Humvees. He hadn't even fired his weapon once outside of training. All that work to end up like this.

Eventually even his parents left to rest. Funeral was tomorrow early and they wanted to get some sleep. Light gradually faded from stained glass windows. ""Do you want some company?"" Private James Studebaker asked.

Jo started, ""I... thanks but I'd rather just sit quietly.""

""Of course."" James replied and withdrew to a polite distance. At least until he heard soft weeping sobs. He had been very close to corporal Greenbriar and his heart broke for her. Without knowing why he walked up, kneeled besider her, and embraced her. 

She did not pull away. Instead she started to cry more, and louder. She threw her face into his shoulder and he could feel dampness seeping into his jacket. He didn't mind. After several minutes she  slowed her sobbing and eventually landed at a soft sniffle. ""I'm so so sorry m'am"" James said with tears starting to form in his eyes. ""I feel... responsible. If I hadn't called shotgun he would have been sitting on my other side. He might have lived if it weren't for me.""

Jo pulled away and looked at him with big red and watery eyes. ""Don't. Don't go blaming yourself for what those monsters did to him!"" she shouted. ""If you hadn't it would be you who died and we'd be at your wake instead. It's not your fault. But... in this moment I wish it had been you."" She paused and a deep frown came to her face. ""God i'm such a bitch, you are being so kind and I just wished you dead.""

""No, no,"" James interjected ""I totally understand."" 

They sat together quietly for a while before a pastor came up to ask if they were going home. She shook her head ""Do you mind... if I lie down next to him?""

""Of course not"" he replied, ""Take as long as you need.""

""Thanks."" She keeled beside his flag draped casket. Leaning over she kissed it, then lay down beside it. James watched silently and before long Jo started to snore softly. Unsure what to do James looked around and found he and Jo were all that was left.

Jo shifted uncomfortably on pale red colored carpet. So James took off his tear stained jacket, balled it up, and gently placed it under her head. He stood up and knew what he was going to do. He stood beside his friends casket at attention and waited. He could not help his friend anymore, but he could do one thing. He would be there for Jo, for as long as it took. 

He watched all night.",Kalfira

Sometimes, life does give you a second chance. Well, not life per se in this particular case. Quite the opposite, in fact. I’m dead. And yet, I’m still somewhat alive, living vicariously through my reincarnation. Weird, I know, but it has been surprisingly satisfying. 

Apparently, I died 75 years ago now. One moment I was crossing a busy street when a rare, and I mean rare, impulse of selflessness overtook my body with a force too strong to be denied. I happened to glance to the side, and I noticed that a small child had stepped out into the street, his little eyes glued to a shiny dime. He looked to be about 2 or 3 years of age – old enough to walk, but young enough that every wobbly step made your hands twitch, sure he would fall. His mother was talking animatedly on the phone, yelling at some poor soul in an incomprehensible language. She was oblivious. As the child precariously made his way into the street, my eyes uncharacteristically glued to his every move, again, I happened to glance up the street, and I noticed a semi-truck barreling down at a speed that was clearly well over the speed limit. Pure chance, coincidence, and bad luck.

What happened next was a blur, but I’m told that in a moment of sheer, Darwinian stupidity, I mean virtuous self-sacrifice, I saved this child’s life. Everything went immediately black, the kind of darkness where you float gracefully without a care in the world. As a singular ball of soft energy, I glided through, weightless and secure, and I felt true happiness for the first time in my life. 

Suddenly, I was jerked from my safe place with a blinding intensity. Literally blinding. Bright, neon colors flashed dangerously, singing my retinas. I gasped a shuddering breath, blinking without seeing, and became aware that I once again had a physical form. As I struggled to accept my devolved state, I sensed another presence. 

“David Emeril Chapman,” a deep voice boomed, and I cringed despite myself at the use of my hated middle name. All my life, it haunted me as people shouted “BAM!” at me in all manner of contexts. 

Finally able to see, I felt the bottom of my stomach drop. My eyes widened in horror, my throat clenched in hot nausea, and my heart began to pound a dull, hollow sound in my chest. Looking at the man in front of me, I felt true, soul-crushing fear. “Dear God in Heaven,” I whispered as I crossed myself for the first time in my life, “am I in Hell?” 

The man in question merely raised an eyebrow and laughed at my question as if it was ridiculous. Which it was, I thought, a completely valid concern. He was wearing a Disco suit reminiscent of my Grandmother’s old couch, the tan and brown color and pattern blending together to create paisleys or clovers or something. In true Disco fashion, he had his hair in a fro puffed out like a dandelion, a mustache that would do Hulk Hogan proud, and dark, iridescent shades. 

“No, David Emeril Chapman, you are most certainly NOT in Hell,” the strange man said as he flashed me what was no doubt intended to be a reassuring grin, but was actually anything but. 

I stared at this man, feeling awkward, uncoordinated, and unsure in my body. Not comforted in the slightest, I took in my surroundings. The man and I were standing in the center of an expansive dance floor. There were several silver, shimmery Disco balls that danced in the rainbow lights the way light reflected off a fly’s multifaceted eyes. I became aware of a distant song playing, surrounding us with an upbeat melody that paralleled the colorful shifts of light. Despite his dress, I was not expecting to recognize ‘Play that funky music, white boy.’ I shuddered, paling and feeling further convinced that I was indeed in Hell.    

The strange man did not seem to notice my sorry state. He continued on, oblivious and cheerful, “You, David Emeril Chapman, are in Purgatory, which is essentially the waiting room for Heaven and Hell. I run the joint, so welcome!” 

My jaw dropped, shock flooding my limbs and making them feel suddenly limber and light. I swallowed tightly. “What? Here? A Disco room?” I asked as I laughed nervously. 

He nodded, a jerky motion that lifted his head up and down. “Of course, here. Disco is all the rage these days,” he announced exuberantly as he struck a Disco pose that would have put John Travolta to shame: leaning in a side-lunge, he pointed one finger high up in the air and bent his other arm to put his hand on his waist. 

I cringed at his display. “Disco is dead,” I muttered softly in an automatic response. Too late, I realized what I’d said to the lunatic who was clearly in charge of my predicament. I expected him to react, to get angry, but he merely resumed a normal stance and passively looked at me. 

“Dead like you,” he replied just as softly, and it was like a punch to the gut. I hadn’t forgotten that I died, I really hadn’t, but it was almost easy to overlook that fact while being in a physical body again. Almost, because the bright Disco room and the vibrant man in front of me were like nothing that I ever experienced in life. 

I gaped like a beached fish, and my previous life flashed before my eyes as I wondered what I possibly could have done to deserve this type of torment. I mean, sure, so I wasn’t the nicest guy. Hell, I wasn’t even nice. But I didn’t cheat, steal, or murder. I ate green, leafy vegetables. I paid my taxes on time. Damn it, I was at a loss here. 

The man’s eyes blazed as he stared at me, and the colorful Disco lights were eerily reflected in them, making him look something more than human. “You are here, David Emeril Chapman, because I have a proposition for you. A contract, if you will.” 

Adrenaline surged through my body, electrifying it and making me feel alive in a way that I hadn’t felt since I died. Maybe never. A traitorous tendril of hope curled around me languidly, and it began to burgeon within me. “What kind of contract?” I asked, but I was already practically sold. I’d agree to whatever it took to get me out of this Disco Hell. 

The man grinned like he read my thoughts and knew me to be the desperate man that I was. 

“You, David Emeril Chapman, will freely serve as the conscience for your reincarnation. The life you led wasn’t too bad, but there is definitely room for improvement.” 

I considered the deal, surprised that it seems so simple. And so easy. I get to live again, but as the conscience of my reincarnation? Lacking qualifications aside, it really didn’t sound like a bad gig. What was the catch? 

Before I could voice any concerns, the man added, “The catch is that you will not have any autonomy or control. You will be merely a gently guide, an observing passenger who is along for the ride.” He offered nothing additional, content to let me make my own decision. 

Creepy, but I was seriously tempted. Life was life, whether I was precisely in control or not. I pondered my options, but I realized there really weren’t any. Return to the blackness, if that was even still possible, remain in the Disco Hell, which definitely wasn’t happening, or become someone’s conscience. Not just any conscience, but mine. Future me. Really, how hard could it be to uphold a few morals and values? Surely even someone like me could do that, right? I decided not to overthink things, and I leapt at the second chance.  

“I’ll do it,” I said clearly. 

The man’s grin became predatory, stretching to fill his face. “David Emeril Chapman, Contract Number 4,988,072,653 begins now,” and my eyes widened that he had been witness to that many people before me. 

A strange chill broke out over my body, but I ignored it, comfortable with my decision and eager for life. My vision started to go black once again, and the last thing I saw a silver Disco ball that flashed softly as a good-bye. 

I awoke once again in a Hospital, which was strange and frightening. I found that I now possessed the ability to project my consciousness outside of my host’s body. My body. As I floated in wonder and joy, I glanced down at my future self and felt shocked. A pink, chubby, naked newborn greeted my vision, squirming and cooing softly. My eyes narrowed critically, and I blanched to discover that I was now a girl. For God’s sake, why? I groaned as my female life flashed before my eyes, and I imagined makeup, monthly periods, and sex with boys. If I were able to still feel the physical sensation of nausea, you better believe I would be feeling it now. 

I breathed deeply, slowly, although that too was an unnecessary habit, and forced myself to take this job position seriously and one step at a time. I glanced at the name on the baby’s wrist band, which proclaimed me as the loyal conscience of Katherine Emeril Morano. I grimaced, and I swear I could hear the Disco man’s laughter. Sometimes that second chance that life gives you comes with some strings attached.  ",CheetahCheeks

I used to fight for good, in fact I was even a Paladin like yourself. I went out of my way to help all the NPCs go about their worthless lives whenever possible. Slay the beast that's been been luring their children into the well? I'm your man. Find the rare herbs and use my healing powers to save your village from the plague. Yup that's me. No task was too small or too great, I would help any of the little folk who asked.

But I often grew weary of this tedium, helping these people with whatever stupid problem they had. See, knowing that you can always revert to a previous point in your life has more advantages than just being able to fight a dragon so many times that you can learn its weaknesses even through your own countless deaths. I often used this power for... mischief.

It started small. I would save in the middle of the village, then sneak into a shop and steal all of their goods from behind their oblivious backs. Sometimes I could even do it right in front of them. Apparently crouching makes me invisible to all but the most astute observers. Even with such a minor crime, compared to my later deeds, I felt a rush completely unlike the tiny warmth I gained by helping these mindless drones. I always would revert to the original  save no matter the outcome of my shennanigans, even if the thefts helped me significantly.

It only grew from there. The first time I killed an innocent was... exhilarating. Of course I immediately reverted and did some good deeds to ease my conscious. But as I found myself committing more and more wicked acts I found the guilt I felt was not for the deeds themselves, but for how they made me feel.

I pledged to do it only one more time, before returning to my life as a noble paladin. Oh but this one would be a doozy. I went into town during a celebration of some sort. The mayor was giving a speech from a balcony in the town square, and most of the townsfolk were in attendance. This would be perfect.

I figured it would be best to really capture the attention of the townsfolk, so I began by slashing the mayor and then throwing the poor fool off of his balcony to splatter on the square below. I was expecting chaos to ensue, but instead only some muffled chatter followed. After but a moment of this a cheer broke out. I would later find out that the mayor was apparently running some sort of extortion ring from his position and that I had unknowingly completed yet another heroic quest by killing him. Ugh this wouldn't do, not for my rampage.

Among the cheers I dropped to the town square and began killing indiscriminately. Heads rolled and guts spilled. Oh glorious day! To relive it but one more time! I started by killing any peasant or noble who was foolish enough to remain in the square. First my spear would thrust through a shopkeepers heart, then my shield would bash some poor fools head in as he lay trampled beneath my boot. I must have killed hundreds that day, but  frankly I lost track in my blood-lust. With he square clear I began moving to the commercial district of town, where many of the craftsmen were working on their wares. I killed them all. Not just the craftsmen, but the craftswomen and craftschildren too. 

My rampage lasted for what seemed to be days. But soon not a soul was left alive in that town. You ask why they did not run? They're NPCs. Tied to their routes and unable to move outside of their little zones. Truly pathetic creatures.

My thirst for violence and the blood of innocents finally satiated, I went to return to my previous save. A message I had never seen before appeared. One that haunts me to this day and is the reason you are in the position you are in today. ""The save game is corrupted and cannot be loaded."" This must be fluke, there's no way my actions cannot be reverted.  But alas, try as I might I could not get the game to revert to pre-massacre status. This would be problematic with one of only three cities in the damn game completely obliterated.

At first I tried to come to terms with what I had done, tried to make it up to the citizens of the other cities, but whenever I went near to them I was attacked by the guards. It would appear I had broken the game, so I began to sneak around, to try to find an item that might revert the world to the way it was in the beginning. After searching for some time I consulted the encyclopedia in the desolate town and realized that no such item exists, and that the only way out of the game was to beat it. Unfortunately I had killed many key characters and could no longer complete the story. I had broken the game and was stuck within it forever.

I flew into a rage and killed everything I could find. I killed every single NPC, animal and even any houseplants I could find. It was not until the world was silent and I was alone that I began to realize my mistake. Not a soul remained for me to kill, no quests to complete, nothing to do. I've been here growing ever more restless until I saw the most beautiful sight I have seen in this miserable life.

Some fly around, some light a cigarette with the others breath, some camouflage on my wall. I sit there silently awaiting for my power to come to me while i sip on a beer. 

""Come on let's have some fun in private."" as my crush, Cindy bumps my shoulder. In my mind i think ""Is this my power? Seduction of the ones i fantasize over?""

""Come on, let's go!"" I am snapped out of my thoughts as she drags me into my room. We both undress as my heart races to prepare me for what may as well be the luckiest moment of my life.

Suddenly, the griffin lowers its head. I walk up to pet it. To my surprise, it likes it and i start to think ""I can....summon a griffin?!"" Cindy walks up and tugs me signaling me to walk off. I shake my head and whistle a loud and short whistle. 

The griffin flies up into the air and makes a spin before landing back down. Me and my friends are in awe. I notice a small saddle on it and decide to get on the griffin as i let out a calming and long whistle. The griffin ascends slowly and flies me towards the city. 

My friends who can fly follow me to fly alongside me and the griffin. We chuckle towards each other as the griffin calls out like an eagle. I whistle to tell it to land and pet it before clapping my hands as an experiment to how it would react.

My eyes were half open and I yelled back, ""What time is it?""

""Almost 9 in the morning!""

I slept in again? This isn't good... I broke my alarm clock by accident a few nights ago after a nightmare I was having. Interestingly enough, it was about me waking up late and being stuck with Normal powers or something.

When the New Year rolled around, the first Monday of the year was the day that the kids who would all be 16 that year get their Amulet. The amulets were were their to enhance and concentrate the power you already had and, in essence, the Amulet had to ""choose"" you. This just meant that you can't activate an Amulet that doesn't match your power. Most kids by this time had already developed some sort of indication as to what they would get.

My friend Kris was able breath underwater for short periods of time; we figure he'll probably get a Water Amulet. Jack was another one of pals who was able to talk to his long dead ancestors; Ghost Amulet for him likely. I hadn't developed anything yet, but this wasn't entirely abnormal. My brother was the first kid in our region to get the Dark Amulet and he never developed any powers until after.

Maybe I was going to get something cool like that? Dark Amulet, just like my brother. Man, that would be cool. I was waiting for him outside the lab when he got his. His eyes had a black tone to the and he had a really cool glow to him. The professor always gives you set of clothing based on your power so that you aren't naked after using doing something cool.

Now that's a funny story; it was said that back in the day, when Lysander succeeded in destroying all the Pokemon, people started to get powers. He ended up with Fire and burned his clothes off in public. He then shortly afterwards created clothing to resist powers. 

I was practically tripping down the stairs putting clothes on when mom threw a bag at me, firmly planting me on the floor.

""Oh sorry dear, I just thought you'd need some pairs of underwear and socks and...""

""Mom! Thank you but I'm going to be late!"" I slammed the door behind me and rushed to the lab down the road. A congregation of people were already standing at the base of the steps. I busted through the group and up the steps into the lab. There were only a few kids left so I joined the queue. Kris was a few people a head and he was next. 

He walked up to the table and waved his hand over the Amulets; the deep blue Amulet glowed fiercely when he passed over it. He picked it up and cheered. Everyone clapped and he rushed out the door with the Water suit the professor had prepared. The next kid ended up with Rock, after that was Steel and the one in front of me was Ice. It was my turn, my heart was racing.

""Nice of you to join us today."" He was being sarcastic. He always hated when people were late. ""Now hurry up, I've got other things to do.""

I walked up and waved my hand over the table of amulets that were left over; Dark was still there, but so was Normal. My hand shook as I approached the Dark, but to my disappointment, it didn't glow. With my head down, I waved it over Normal. It didn't glow either, a wave of relief washed over me. 

There were a lot less kids than previous years; Fire, Dragon and Electric were left. All were actually pretty ok. My hand waved over Fire, nothing. Then over Dragon and nothing. I shrugged my shoulders and picked up the Electric one, but to my surprise, it wasn't glowing. The professor rushed me over to his cabinet. It was full of Amulets and I waved my hand over them. Again, nothing glowed.

""Seth, I don't know how to tell you this..."" His arms were crossed and his head was facing the floor. 

""... I don't get powers... do I?"" Tears started to well up in my face.

""Oh quite the contrary. You get a special one."" He pulled something out of his pocket and placed it in my hand, it immediately started to glow through the wrapping.

*************************

The professor walked me out of his lab, the crowd was still formed at the bottom of the stairs. I picked at the frills that lined my shoulders, so embarrassing and uncomfortable...

""Ladies and gentleman. Seth, like his brother before, is a first in our village! I give you... the holder of the Fairy Amulet!"" The professor stopped aside to reveal me standing in a pink dress, the village cheered.

""Seth! Seth! Seth!""

I fell down due to sheer embarrassment. I woke up to my mother shaking me awake... in my bed.

""Seth! Seth! Wake up, you're going to be late!""

Was it all a dream? ""Late for what?""

""Oh dear, the reporters are here! Apparently you're the first Fairy user in the country!"" She stood up and walked away, I saw the pink outfit laying on the floor.

[WP] You have just been bitten by a radioactive...,OldManoftheNorth,"Just a normal day in pripyat (sorry before hand for spelling and poor gramar).
 Logging animal activity as part of my job for the Russian military to contain and monitor the Chernobyl nuclear disaster. It's late afternoon about twighlight to be specific. The area I'm logging today requires a hazmat suit and dear God has it been uncomfortable. I can hardly I can barely operate the necessary equipment and I keep tripping because I can't see my god Damn feet. I'm getting near the last area I have to check I feel this disturbing pressure on the back of my neck and sinking feeling I'm being watched. I remember someone saying they had seen signs of what seemed like active wolves in a nearby sector but they shouldn't be able last that long in this area. It's starting to sound like there's another set of footsteps. I keep darting my head back and forth fear rising in my stomach it feels like my heart is about to explode. I turn around to check behind me. Nothing thank god "" I'm just hearing things"" I say out loud to no-one. I take a closer look at my footsteps just to be safe. My footprints look normal but there's  something strange just off to the side that I swear wasn't there before. I kneel down to get a better look. My heart stops. A deep guttural growl echos around me. I turn my head slowly I hear a dull thump in my ears. In what felt like an eternity I stare full of fear at a six foot tall wolf like creature what look like strange vestigial limbs protruding from it's sides at all angles, a dark viscous liquid dripping from it's snarling jagged mouth. Only one thought runs three my head. RUN. I break out in the best sprint I can muster. The hazmat suit weighing me I down I get about five feet before I hear deafening rabid howl and a crash as it bounds toward me. My feet catch on something I don't see. My head hits the ground as I feel it's terrible maw pierces my back. My vision starts to gray as it drags me away. I look at the sky and the trees and the beautiful flowers starting to bloom ""huh... I never noticed how nice this place is"" I say to no-one. ",grapeflaverdfecees

“Is this... what the after life is?” I asked, “is this heaven?” 

“No son.” 

“Then where am I? You are god right?” 

“We are. Me and you.” 

“What the fuck?” I paused for a second, halfway expecting to be reprimanded, but he didn’t seem to mind. 

Instead, he continued to stare at me disapprovingly, knowing that if he didn’t break the silence, I would. 

“So what happened to Jeffrey? Did he die too?” 

“Your memory hasn’t come back yet,” he muttered. 

“Then refresh it.” 

“You and I are the same person. We are all that exists, has existed, or ever will exist. I am Jeffrey. You are Jeffrey. You are the man who shot both you and Jeffrey. I killed you. We did.” 

“I’m higher than I thought, huh?” 

“You are your dealer, his dealer, and his dealers dealer. You are the police officer who found your body. You are every man, woman, and child who has ever lived on earth. You’ve had this conversation before, but from the opposite position. In just a moment, our places will switch. I will remember nothing, and you will know all.” 

“That’s right.” I smiled. And suddenly he fainted, only to wake up at my feet.

“Hello son,” I spoke. 

“What...” 

I cut him off. “No time. In a moment you will go back to earth to finish your last life. At its completion, you will have lived every life possible to ever live. When you return, we will have become one. And once again, I will be alone.”

[WP] A solar flare hits earth spreading cosmic radiation over the planet. Everyone gets super powers except you.,Zero_Dimensional,"My anxiety really kicked into gear when it dawned on me that I would have to finally leave the larder. It had only been a few days since the burning light came and all the madness that followed it had started, and there I was stuck hiding out with nothing left to eat but canned tuna with stale cookies. 

   The last I remember out there was the hallucinations. Visions of people flying around out of control, lasers shooting from their eye sockets. Others sinking into the ground or flicking in and out of existence. My god I can still hear the screams. The only constant I noticed was my own home and the larder that seemed to be a safe place when I got into it. 

  I wondered if anyone saw me running away from the street and wanted to check on me. But I figured who would care about some nutcase from number 42 screaming randomly. It just seemed so realistic in fact I could still hear all the weird things rattling around my head. 

   Other than the hunger, I was also getting really sick of taking dumps in my mothers Tupperware and pissing in empty water bottles, so finally I decided to face my delusions, go get food, then go to a doctor. But must eat first. 

   Tentatively I stepped out of the room, poking my head out slowly. It seemed calm enough.  Right until a hand came from nowhere and yanked me out of the room and into my hallway. All of a sudden I was being talked at. 

   “Oh hi there stranger!” I was still reeling from the sheer force of the movement. But I did register that the voice was friendly, and familiar, but strangely booming. “Woah, you smell. Hope you’ve been alright with all of this.” It was Harriet, oh no 

She propped me up against the wall with little ease. That kind of jolted me, then I opened my eyes the meet hers. Her eyes weren’t in the normal place, instead I caught a large midriff on a big body. Slowly I traced this mass until finally I met Harriet’s her face towering over me.

“Got a good look?” She smiled a giants grin. “
Holy shit.” I tried to make efforts to run back into the larder but was pinned from moving, prevented from going with just her little finger. 
“Now, now Richie, I think you’ve spent way to long in your little cupboard.” She said cheerfully. Then she called out behind her. “I think we are going to need your help please.” A young boy stepped forward. 

“ Hello Richard I’m Switcher, just a moment and you’ll feel better I promise.”’ He clicked his fingers and all of a sudden I had calmed down. It was a nice feeling but so surreal. I felt anxious like normal, but the kind I can cope with. I didn’t feel hungry or tired anymore either. 

I got the nerve to speak a bit. “Look I think I really need to call my doctor. Can I go do that please?” 
“Of course Richie. Just take some time ok?” Harriet let me go. 
I turned to the child “Erm what did you just do?” 
“Oh that? Well, I can turn back the clock on physical states now.” He smiled. “I did yours from a few days ago. When you were feeling a bit better.”  
“Hello Is this Doctor Khan.” I had speed dialled without taking my eye of the pair. AI recognised a voice in the other end as the surgery’s receptionist. 
“Sorry Sir, I’m afraid she is currently flying.” 
“Oh I’m sorry, when will she be back?” 
“I suppose I could call her for you..” 
“It’s fine no...” 
“Doctor, you have a patient please will you come down?” 
“Hold on, didn’t you say she was away?” 
“No Sir, flying but then again who isn’t these days? By the way please don’t you are not having a breakdown.” 
“I never said.. I only thought.. oh god.” I hung up. 

  I took a deep breath. Closing my eyes. trying to block everything out. I just couldn’t. The boy put his hand on my shoulder. “Richard, I could reset you again, but I don’t think it’s going to help much. You’ve had so much worry for a long time.” 
I then said something that just seemed to fall out of my mouth. “Can you reset me back to a time before I was so worried? Maybe I can cope a bit better?” 
“No, I’m sorry. It would be too far back. You know you have been this way for a very long time. I tried to do it before and went too far. I kept the thoughts and the regrets. But the body was young again. He smiled. I suppose I have another lifetime to make peace with myself right?”

[WP] Advancements in biofuel technology have led to the discovery of a brand-new energy source: Human body fat.,hardhypotheticals,"Looking back on the world now I'd say the burning of oil and coal was one of the least detrimental things we've done to ourselves. I'll admit, when the news first dropped about how you could be paid now for getting liposuction the world went absolutely bonkers. Large people far and wide were getting cut open, scooped out, and getting paid to do so. Obesity rates plummeted to basically zero, people were healthier than ever and the markets were booming. For a while, it seemed like a new, better future was on the horizon. But then you must remember that whenever there is a truly good thing in this world humanity will always end up screwing everything up.

It started with what I like to call the re-fatters. You see, many of the very large people originally lived on some form of government aid. They were too large to work, so they coasted by on welfare and subsidies. Not my place to judge really I guess, that's just how it was for them. But after getting the fat removed and getting paid for it, we were left with a mixed bag of results. Some saw it as a second chance at life. With a fresh start and some cash in their pocket, there were many uplifting stories of people turning their lives around. But there were a select few, who were so attuned to a life of no work and getting paid, that after treatment were now left with no reason to not work, while still being lazy asses. So began a realization amongst the newly skinny that the easiest way to not work and still get paid was to become fat again. These people would go out with their new earnings and eat lavish meals, treating themselves while allowing the pounds to stack back on. After reaching a substantial enough weight again, they would get it all sucked back out and pocket the cash once again, only to repeat the cycle over and over. These re-fatters infected the nation with the idea that you can spend little to no effort in life, get fat, rip it all out, and make money all at the same time. The impressionable masses started quitting their jobs to live a life of gluttonous wastes of flesh. Just like that world productivity rates began to decline. It was a pandemic for sure, but the rational half of the word staved off this life of overindulgence well enough for a good while. But then came big oil and big coal, and they had a plan.

Traditional oil and coal companies we're losing a lot of money to these biofuel production plants. In response they teamed up in one of the biggest displays of monopolizing possible and began to buy out the market; rounding up their own teams of biochemists and distillery sites to reel in that sweet fat cash. They also partnered up with fast food chains around the world and began blasting the single most terrible slew of propaganda the world has ever seen. Encouraging the masses that, ""fat is where it's at!"" and to, ""get weighed, get paid!"" These we're just a few of the slogans they began to plaster everywhere. These companies we're brainwashing people on an even greater scale than the re-fatters ever could have. Soon enough the concept of obesity was not one of a health epidemic, but an entire lifestyle. ""The Fattening,"" is what we call  it now. They marketed it as a whole career choice and everything. ""Biofuel Production Workers"" is what they were called. You got to feel like you were actually doing a job now, they had offices and time cards and everything. They basically acted like health inspectors at restaurants, only instead of checking for quality and cleanliness, they were looking for those with the sugariest, greasiest food possible. These restaurants would be all that was left to eat at, healthy food places died as they couldn't sustain themselves any longer. The quality of life was reduced to being a living fuel tank; we were one small robot emergence away from a real life matrix scenario. But that wouldn't be our demise of course, in the end we had the gun in our hands the whole time.

It wasn't too long after that the effects of the fat life were fully realized, when almost two entire generations of people collectively died within a timeframe of about three years. Heart attack was the number one killer of course. The strain of yoyoing between fat and skinny trampled their cardiovascular systems to a pulp. And for those unlucky few who did have stronger hearts, their demise was skin deep. So many liposuctions and plastic surgery sessions to remove the excess skin made their bodies as frail as toilet paper. There were stories of people bursting open after a sneeze or cough, their skin so delicate it ripped at the slightest provocation. Their bones too were becoming weak with the on and off weight swings, breaking with little to no effort. It was as if these people were held together with spit and straw. And what was worse, if you did die while still fat, they would still harvest your body for what was left. The fat on your body was the value of your life to them. But in a satisfactory twist of fate, the deaths would reach upwards into the ranks of the corporate elites themselves. The global market imploded as the CEOs and business owners dropped like flies, nothing could hold up the weight of this big fat world any longer, and society caved in.

What's left now is a very hollow world. What few governments could stay afloat after this collapse reverted back to near medieval standards. All food grown from the ground, rationed appropriately, and even thinking of becoming fat was a punishable offense. Work hard, stay fit, eat right, or the fat cats will come and eat you at night. A fun nursery rhyme for the new batch of kids, an ominous reminder for those who survived The Fattening.",TheHalfAlbino
"[WP] Your life has fallen apart: lost your job, 3 months behind on rent and hopelessly single and lonely. You come home one day to find 7 demons sitting on your couch. They are the embodiments of the 7 Deadly Sins, and they're here to help you get your life back on track.",BeethovenNotMozart,"""Welcome home, Brandon. We've been waiting.""

Upon your bed you find 7 terrifyingly beautiful... things. Then you realise something. You've finally gone mad. You laugh.

""Hmm. Odd welcome for some old friends. We've come to help you get your life back on track.""

You stop laughing. Wide eyed and confused, you turn to look at them once more, and exclaim ""Friends? I have no idea who you are. You're most likely just a figment of my dead imagination after finally breaking!""

A short, stubby blob of a man steps forward and grunts. He shimmer in the dim bedroom light.

""Oi, that's no way to treat us! We're here to sort your life out! Now, Did you bring some grub home?""
He tugs at your arm and sniffs you. Ew. He's left slime on your jacket. Wait, no. Grease. Great.

""You remember your old pal Gluttony, right!?"" He asks.

""No, I can't say I do. Who are all of you?""

A giant of a man steps forward, his very foot steps shake the ground you stand on. ""Wrath."" You feel adrenaline flush through your veins. You begin to feel angry towards everything. You want to to viciously beat, smash, and destroy everything in your vision. Including him.

Another steps forward, this time a tall feminine character. You try to avert your eyes as you realise she's not wearing anything, but you can't. It feels as though your very soul is magnetised by her very essence of being. ""You don't recognise me darling? Surely you remember your favourite. Lust, of course.""

Your anger subsides, but you feel an uncontrollable urge to fuck everyone in this room. You feel shameful, but you honestly don't care.

Suddenly, an old, frail man collapses in front of you. You yawn. ""What's up with him?""

""Oh This? It's Sloth. Useless being."" A stout fellow speaks as he reaches down and starts to take some of the old man's belongings. ""And I'm Greed.""

You now get the desire to steal, beg, and borrow all items you've ever encountered. Your thoughts begin to stir at the possibilities of how you might go about doing so.

You look back up and notice there's something wrong with the last 2. You realise they're not actually 2 beings, but one. Only they appear to be some amalgamated monstrosity, with 2 heads and 3 arms between them. On one side is a head that's delicate and pampered. That side appears to have 2 arms. The other is wretched, as if it's face is melting and they only have the one arm.

""Oh? We're Pride.""
""And Envy!""
""Respectfully. I'm clearly the better half, as you can tell.""

Envy looks meekly at me, and then casts his eyes on Wrath. He bites him, only to be swatted away by Wraths sheer strength. Both pride and Envy go flying into the wall.

Your blood coils. You mind races. And then you begin to utter a sentence.

""I've gone mad.""

You pass out.

------

You wake to find yourself in bed. Only you're not alone. You turn to see a feminine face looking right at you, with piercing eyes. You're naked. Then you notice another 6 sets of eyes doing the same, watching over you anxiously.

""Well, wasn't that fun."" Lust states, as she caresses your face. They all start speaking up, each at a time explaining that their duty is to build you up so you can eventually rule over this world, with them by your side. In return, you have to allow them to do whatever they want with whomever they want.

""I'm not sure about this... it doesn't feel right... Why are you even here? Why me?""

Wrath slams you out of the window, your life suddenly flashing before your eyes. The last memory to come up is the most important.

You vomit, mid air, at the realisation of a memory you had somehow locked away.

The bullies pulled him up from the toilet as he sputtered for air. He was barely even grossed out by it anymore. The only thing he dreaded was the inevitable pink eye from the nasty water.

The bell rang. Time for class.

Cackling, the bullies rushed out of the bathroom so they wouldn't be sent to detention. Percy sat up and leaned his dripping head against the stall.

""God or Buddha or whoever's listening, please help me. I need to learn to be strong. Please send someone to teach me.""

The door opened and Percy saw two large feet clad in loafers. A teacher.

""Perceval, are you in here?"" It was the guidance counselor.

""Yes sir."" Percy wiped his face and stood up, leaving the stall.

""Oh son, you look awful. Come to my office while we call your mom to come take you home.""

Percy followed his counselor down the hall, feeling incredibly self conscious about his toilet water odor. At least he was getting to leave for the day.

~

That night, a storm blew through the town. One clap of thunder in particular woke him with a start and he could have sworn he saw the shadow of a large man on the wall, but there was nobody to cast the shadow. Assuming his mind was playing tricks on him, he went back to sleep.

In the morning, Percy dressed for school like every day. He ate his cereal and trudged to the bus. The ride was always quiet, but arriving to the school grounds would mean seeing the bullies.

""Look who's back,"" a bully jeered the moment Percy opened his locker.

Percy ignored him.

""Hey shrimp, I'm talking to you!"" The bully grabbed Percy's shoulder roughly.

A powerful strength gripped the small boy and, without thinking, he grabbed the bully's arm and flipped him into the hard tile floor. ""Leave me alone,"" he commanded.

The bully scampered away. Percy was utterly shocked at what he just did. It was so far outside not only his comfort zone but also his physical skill. He looked at himself in his locker mirror. Looking back at him was the face of Genghis Khan.

Percy, startled by his reflection, slammed the locker and leaned on the outside. He grew curious, however, and reopened the locker.

The Mongol still looked back at him from the mirror. Now he spoke. ""Perceval, I am here to teach you to have the strength of a conqueror. Heed my teachings and you will not be treated like an insect anymore.""

Percy nodded. Tutoring from Genghis Khan? This could be interesting.",RegularWoahMan
"[WP] A cowardly child picked on in school, wishes for the heart of a warrior. He gets more than he bargained for when the soul of Genghis Khan possesses his body.",IonlySpeakinRhymes,"It happened every day. His name was Jake Sanders. He was big, and mean, and in the year above me. 
The type of kid who had 'Thug' tattooed on his soul.

I had been beaten before, more like roughed up. I didn't even have the genetics to outrun the bastard. It was as inevitable as the tide. And now i was cornered, behind the bike racks. 
No teachers would intervene. No help was coming.
Three silhouettes blocked the light of the way out. 'Your gonna get it now, Jeremy' He said. He had evil eyes, he did. cruel anticipation written all over he features. 

I never knew what i actually did to deserve this. I started school i think. I passed my tests too well perhaps. 
I dunno. There is a numbness you feel when something awful is about to happen to you. 

I couldn't even run. 

The three silhouettes advanced. 

I snapped awake. My world hurts. There are lots of tubes in me, and i retch as i pull the one from my throat.  'Where am i?' I croaked quietly. It's weird what your voice sounds like when you haven't spoken in a while. 

My mother is uncomfortably asleep in a chair. She is a good deal thinner than i remember. She wakes instantly, in half a flash she has her arms around me, her words unintelligible. racked with sobs. Woven with an amount of relief that ripples the universe as it pours fourth into the world. 

Dear old Mum. She's a good stick. I don't have the heart to tell her that shes crushing me a bit. 

'You are awake boy... you have done well to have escaped death like that' An accented voice speaks softly. It reverberates in my skull. 

'Huh?' I don't even have time to process it all. Things happen. 

A nurse rushes in, smiling with such warmth and sincerity i feel it wash over me. She disentangles my mum, who sobs and laughs and carries on. Doctors follow. A kindly Asian woman looks me over, and asks me questions. Mum is now shaking peoples hands - you can tell she wants to hug me again. 

Hours pass. Mum leaves to go home. My events are recalled to me by a child psychologist.
I died. a total of six times - and I had been in a coma for a little over a month. Mum had lived there after work, reading to me, playing music, and worrying herself nearly to death the whole time. Books stood, stacked in a neat pile in the corner. 

'Gosh' Is all i can think to say. I am transferred from intensive care, and into a comfier bed.

The accented voice speaks again. 'So, young one have you given thought on how you are to repay your enemies for this... mistake they have made?' 
I look around. there is definitely nobody else here. 

'Who are you?' I think inwardly, hoping it will work. 

'Ghengis Khan' He said simply. 

'Golly' I say inwardly. There's not much else I can do. 
'So, why are you here?' 

'Your soul was steeped in such fury, young one - i followed you back from the afterlife, in your fury you wished for a heart of a warrior, i am here to help you obtain it'

'You're elegantly spoken for a Mongolian warchief.' 

A chuckle reverberates in my soul. 'Recover. when you are ready, we plan' 

The next few weeks are filled with well meaning busyness. I am weaker for not having moved several weeks, By my rehabilitation therapist is a cool guy, who tells me ill be back to my old self in no time. Mum hovers around most days. Nobody knows what happened to me, and i don't tell them - they found me bloody and beaten nearly to death. She wants to know. She wants blood. Its easy to feign memory loss. Apparently, It's quite common. 

Besides its not what i want. Mum would call the police, and the school, and there would be a lot of talking. Jakes' parents were wealthy, and affluent. So, nothing would happen, or i would move schools - and of course Jake Sanders would move to the next kid. And it all starts over. I scream internally at the thought of it. 

In the evening Genghis Khan advises me on the virtues of the warrior. Its interesting, so i start reading up on it. Books on tactics, the ways of kung fu. I learn that size and strength are easily overcome. 'This Sun-Tsu chap knows what he's on about, a bit stuffy, but some good points.' G.K says as i read on, i can feel him hovering over my shoulder.

I feel weird as i return to my high school three months later. I'll say this; i am in much better shape than i was. My rehabilitation has now become training, and adolescent muscle fills my scarred body. - G.K approves of this, and is warming to the nickname ""GeeKay"" 

G.K tells me i must get to know my enemy. Mum's still reluctant for me to leave her sight, but i get away with it because a walk is good for my leg. The next few weeks i watch and i learn. Part of me wanted to see the reason for Jake being the way he was, to empathise. But there was none. The kid had everything - and being cruel was his thing. I learn he goes to a boxing gym every Thursday. I learn there is an alleyway. There are no cameras. 

It is now time to fix this for good. G.K has been versing me in strategy when fighting a larger opponent. 'That's simple, he says - you don't - You sneak up on him and stove his head in' 
""i don't want him dead - I want him to know' I say softly. Internally i feel a shrug. 

'He will fear for the rest of his days...' I say softly under my breath. 

Thursday comes around. I am set. My alleyway prepared. I see him coming down the road, in a casual strut. Completely unabashed. 

I stand tall. the small amount of light illuminates me. He walks past. 'Oi, Cockhead' I hear myself say. 
He's easily triggered. Face skewed in anger. 'What was that mate?' He says, bristling. 
'You heard me, or are you that fuckin' stupid?' 

That was easy. He doesn't ever see the tripwire. Over he goes into piles of broken glass. 

He is now at a significant disadvantage. 

I saunter over, carrying a heavy peice of scrap metal. I bring the blunt edge down on the back of his knee. He howls and sobs, bleeding from the glass shards in his hands and face. I bring it down again, something breaks. 
""please... Please stop' He says in a mewling whimper. Gone is the cruelty, replaced with incomprehension. 'Why me?' His eyes implore. 

'No' I say, coldly. He will find no mercy here. 
I hit the other one. The side of it caves in. He will never walk properly again. 

Its funny, you would think that i'd feel elation, or powerful. Or satisfied. 

I don't. It feels like a task that needs doing. Like brushing my teeth. I bring it down again. He howls. 

At the very least, people can run from him now. I leave, exiting out the back of the alleyway. There's a pile of rusted scrap metal accumulating, and my weapon blends into it nicely. I have a quick check before leaving the alley. remove my gloves and wander home. Its a beautiful evening. 

I must say, I am surprised at myself. I am still so calm. Aside from a bit of sweat you would never know. 


I return home. 'Hi Ma, I'm home' is shout, closing the front door behind me.
'Thank goodness' She says from the kitchen. her hair has greyed significantly, and stress lines have etched themselves around her eyes.  
She will worry for the rest of her life. Every time I leave. 

those kinds of scars don't fade. 

'How are you today? she asks, giving me a fierce hug.
'Much, much better' I say, quite truthfully. 'Tea smells good, I tell you what, I'll cook tomorrow night, how does that sound?'

'Thanks love, that'd be great'

Gk speaks quietly. 'There are two types of warrior, Those who fight to inflict pain and suffering, and those who fight to cease it - The righteous warrior fights when he has to, and protects the ones he holds dear, the thug, for his own benefits, or stupid things like glory. Make sure you know which one you are'

Then he left. 

'I know which i am...' I say softly under my breath. 
'Say, Ma - What do you know about kung fu?' I ask with a smile. 

Because the only way Evil wins, is when the good do nothing.

"[WP] One day, everyone on Earth receives a superpower. You are a psychopath who gets the purest, kindest power that there can be.",NotShortButCompact,"The guard slid my food in. I scooped some of the gruel up. Bland and tasteless, just like the walls around me. At this point, I was almost always locked up in solitary confinement. This time though I managed to send two guards to a hospital before they subdued me. I probably was going to die in solitary confinement. 

However, I knew something that most people didn't. One of my victims, as I tortured him, begged for his life by giving information about Project SP. Apparently, he was part of a secret multi government project to advance the human race. He swore that on February 1, 2018, everyone in the world would be gifted superpowers. I, of course, him anyway. 

Today was January 31, one day before judgment day. I knew I would gain an advantage because I was expecting powers when no one else was. With this advantage, I could probably break out before anyone noticed. From there, I could extract vengeance for the guards that kept me imprisoned.

It wasn't that I needed revenge. No what I really liked was watching people squirm and beg for their life. I loved the power to decide whether or not someone died. If I had time, I would torture them until they begged me to kill them. At that point, I usually just left them to bleed out or starve to death. Other people spoke of love and companionship, but only connection I needed was with death. Unfortunately, for the guards, I probably wouldn't have the time to torture them.

It's not like I hated them or anything. They were just doing a job after all. However, they might try to stop me from leaving and I needed to feel people dying. Killing the guards was merely convenient, a way to guarantee my escape and satisfy my cravings.

I waited for midnight and once it came, at first, I didn't feel any different. Then, my power came. It was glorious; I felt raw power like I never felt before. Then, I felt a change in myself.

I started to feel commission and empathy for the first time. I started to feel sorry for the people I killed and the lives I recklessly destroyed. I started to ache for the families of my victims. I began to scream in agony. No one heard me; everyone else was experimenting with their own newfound powers.",random7HS

That even when things looked bleak, I could say ""No, not today"" and simply walk away, but it was never that simple. I didn't grow up like ""everyone else."" I didn't have a loving mother and a caring father to comfort me and help me become a great person. I had to work on that goal myself. I had to spend my days early and my nights late in order to make ends meet. To become the person that I knew I had to become. There were many people who tried to stray me from that path, saying that it was wrong, and that my parents wouldn't want me to do this. But what the hell do they know about my parents if I didn't know them myself? Every word that came out of their mouth fueled my passion and lust for more. I had to prove them wrong. 

And I did. 

I killed them. 97 people in fact. For no other reason than to just prove a point.

The police haven't figured out why I kill or who I choose to be my target, but I'll let you in on a little secret. I kill for mercy. I kill to put these people out of their miserable, sad lives. People who have claimed that they have nothing to live for, and wish for an end they themselves cannot produce. I kill so that they may live in the next life. Maybe there they can find greener pastures. 

Isn't that the kindest thing I can do?

"[WP] One day, everyone on Earth receives a superpower. You are a psychopath who gets the purest, kindest power that there can be.",NotShortButCompact,"It was a beautiful spring morning on that particular day. The day that changed everything as we knew it. The sweet morning sunshine filtered through the blinds to my left, illuminating the room with a soft glow.I sat perched in my favorite chair, sipping on a particularily strong cup of coffee. I hadn't slept well the night prior, too much noise coming from downstairs. I sighed, enjoying the peace of the warm morning light. Suddenly, I heard a loud bang from beneath my feet, shocking me out of my relaxed state. 
I hopped to my feet, with an irritated growl, and made my way down the hall. I slowed as I came to the heavy oak door leading to the basement. I pounded the door loudly, tapping out a little tune. "" Shut up already you've been going all night! Jeez!"" I hollered through the closed door. I could hear a muffled scream in response. ""What's that? I couldn't hear you!"" I chuckled. She was a fiesty one, always up for a good argument! I began on the first of three locks on the sturdy door. Can't be too careful these days with all the psychos around. "" I'm coming to pay you a visit, darling! "" The door swung open with a loud thunk. 
I stepped down the narrow staircase quickly, descending into the darkness that swallowed everything below. "" Hello, sweetheart! My my,  you were noisy last night weren't you?"" I flicked on the light, the flourescent white illuminating the room and the ghostly white figure sitting on the floor. She looked to me, eyes filled with terror and tears.
 ""MMPHH!!!"" She screamed, muffled by the thick cloth held in her mouth with duct tape. I wandered over to the nearby shelf, which had uncerimoniously been knocked over, jars of various fluids spilled onto the floor. Dumb little thing had been laying in the viscous mixture all night. Served her right. 
 "" You've been quite naughty haven't you."" I snapped at her, stepping closer with every word. Her eyes widened in delicious terror. "" You know, you're lucky you've even been around this long. I usually break my toys. You've been fortunate."" I kneeled down next to her. I could see her fidgeting, trying to move her hands from behind her back. 
""What have you got there?"" I asked, leaning around her to inspect her tightly bound hands. I could see a trail of fresh blood leaking down and staining my good rope. ""Hm, you thought you were clever, huh?"" I chuckled, prying a large piece of glass from between her fingers. The rope in between her hands had even become frayed quite a bit. "" Pity you hadn't just stayed a little quieter, huh? You probably would've been out of here!"" I laughed heartily. What a silly girl! There's 3 locks at the top of the stairs! I continued to laugh as I took the glass in my fingers and gently stroked the side of her toned neck.
"" It would be so easy... Simple. Just a bit of pressure..."" I pushed the glass firmly into her skin, leaving a small puncture. Blood began to flow quickly in a thin trail down her neck. She sobbed loudly, unable to catch her breath. "" Just a little PRESSURE!"" I plunged the glass deep within her muscle, a loud bubbling shreik escaped her. Blood gushed out faster than I'd even expected, soaking the front of my shirt. It was so warm and thick, bright juicy red. I shuddered. I looked into her eyes, now losing focus. ""Bye bye!"" I chirped, giving her a quick peck on the cheek. A final look of shock passed her face as the lights went dim. 

But suddenly, and unexpectedly, the light returned. She looked at me with shock and awe, and I returned the look. She seemed... vibrant. Suddenly unfazed by the blood clearly pouring from her veins. I felt an anger boil inside me. Why wasn't she dead? I clutched her throat with my hand tightly, squeezing with all my might.
 "" WHY AREN'T YOU DEAD?!"" I screeched, squeezing as ferociously as my muscles would allow. Her eyes bulged. I looked down to my hand and could see the skin beginning to turn purple under my grip. But her eyes were still focused on me, pleading at me to stop. I released my hand, and she gulped in a large breath. 
Her neck... I gasped as I stared at her neck. It was healed. No gouge pouring blood, only clean porcelain skin. I stood agape for a moment, trying to process what just happened. I noticed a large cut I had given her the night before still remained on her thigh. I placed my hand on it, and felt the gap in the skin reform below my fingers. 
I stood in awe, and wonderment. Then, I had an idea. I grabbed the glass that sat on the ground next to my feet and plunged it into her neck once again. She screeched. I watched her writhe in agony, waiting for the satisfaction of the life draining from her face. But it never came. Blood continued to pour, and yet the color never drained from her face, the light from her eyes.
 ""Hm."" I mused to myself. ""So you can't die... and I can heal you."" Her eyes looked hopeful for a moment. A glimmer of faith flashed on her face. ""And so.. we can have fun like this forever! Even if I break you so much it's not fun anymore, I can just heal you!"" I smiled widely, joy filling me. Her eyes widened in a terror I had never seen before. An existential dread that spiraled deep into the depths of her soul. It was so delicious. ""We're going to have so much fun!""",kittipo

I never find any though.

At least, that's the official record. The unofficial record is I've killed 87 alien life forms that could be perceived as a threat to our planet. I get paid handsomely for what I do, and I don't lose sleep over it either.

Until this morning.

Now don't get me wrong, waking up in a bed with six beautiful women is every man's dream, but not when they're all the same woman, and you know five of them ain't human.

""Son of a bitch. Did you forget to decon your shoes before coming in again Ellie?""

My question was answered in unison by six identical voices.

""No, of course not!""

I sighed, this was going to suck.

""Honey, can you take out the trash-mow the lawn-do the dishes-iron your shirts-walk the dog-make the bed-""

""ALL OF YOU, SHUT THE HELL UP!""

I'll give the alien scumsuckers this much: they did a damn good impression of her constant nagging.

I had no choice, I couldn't think with all the racket...and so I started with the chores.

I opened a window and threw the bag outside. Trash, done.

I threw a napalm grenade off my decking. Lawn, mowed.

I put the dishes in the jacuzzi and threw in a sonic bomb. Clean as a whistle.

The shirts I did by hand. Gotta be thorough, right?

Dog plus treadmill equals exercise. Work smart, not hard.

Lastly, the bed, everything sorted just the way she likes it.

""Goddamn it, I'm tired. Grab me a beer from the fridge?""

Five identical versions of Ellie walked into the kitchen, and only one stayed behind. I reached into my pocket and activated our security system from my keychain.

**KZZZZZZZZZZZTTT!**

That would be the deep-fried alien bastards.

"[WP] The invasion is nearly over, the fight nearly lost. The aliens are simply too technologically advanced. You are a member of the resistance, and hold captive two hostages.",Samfox11223stories,"Silence filled the room. The hostages were shackled to the ground, but their heads were raised in defiance.


The veteran sighed. There was no end in sight, and he grew wearier by the day. For every ship they took down, the aliens would send three more, another army, another battle, on and on in a constant wave of attack. For every prisoner they took, the planet would suffer all the more. And for what? What good would slaying his captives do? Another death for his tally? Would that bring back his world?


Twelve years ago, they were many. They had been brave, spirited, patriotic to the last, and he, along with many others, had taken up arms to defend his brethren, to preserve their freedom and liberty. They had fought valiantly. They had fought tirelessly. But it was all for nothing. Their victories were short lived, meaningless in the grand scheme of things. 


Now, only a vestige remained, and their towering civilization had been reduced to a hollow facade of what it once was. Entire cities had been razed to the ground, and cultures that had survived millennia had been destroyed in the blink of an eye. 


The air outside was filled with the stench of fear. Blood and tears flooded the street, and utopia had washed away in its tide. No one had been spared, and now he had no one to spare. His wife, his kids... His friends. Gone. Forever. 

He'd fight until his dying breath, of that he was certain, but to what end? The invaders had no interest in compromise, and they had nothing to offer but death and destruction. How could he fight that? He killed with a heavy heart, and each time he did, it took a toll on him, each soul he cleansed taking a little of his with it.


The veteran shook his head as he cocked his gun, and the hostages smiled as they met his gaze.


*""You can kill us, but you can't kill an idea,""*  they chanted in unison, reciting the mantra he had heard so many times before. *""Humanity must prevail, and your old home must become our new one. The end will always justify the means.""*


Two shots rang out and the hostages fell forward, lifeless. Their smiles remained, like ghosts that could not be killed. The veteran closed his eye and clenched his claws, slowly batting his leathery wings. They were fighting a losing battle.",Samfox11223stories
"[WP] The invasion is nearly over, the fight nearly lost. The aliens are simply too technologically advanced. You are a member of the resistance, and hold captive two hostages.",Samfox11223stories,"I didn’t want to do this - my hand trembled as I held the gun to this monster’s head.


They told us to surrender; we didn’t. They said they would compromise; we didn’t want it. They asked us to come peacefully; we declined the offer. The year is 2103. United under a global banner, a final unity between our nations, a single President to rule Earth. How far our politics has come, how far our technology has come. But not far enough. 


The ‘Aliens’ arrived 3 years ago, marking the beginning of a new century. They’re not so different to us really, but they oppose our views. First demand was to surrender our weapons and allow them to join us, help them escape the threat that was chasing them. Bullshit. We saw no threat on our telescopes, nothing was chasing them. It was just a ploy to get onto our planet so they could have their way with us. We never realised how lucky we were to have water, it was heavily sought after in the intergalactic world and we know these monsters just want trouble. Anything to get their hands on what they want. 


The fighting started soon after their arrival, a long bloody war. Our President is a young Japanese man, not that nationality really meant anything these days. He gave the order after his first meeting with them. As soon as he met the ‘Aliens’ he despised them, he saw through their kindness and peace offerings for what they really were. The war has been long and bloody, I have lost everybody I ever loved. My fathers and brothers were thrown into the war as soldiers and killed. My sister never returned from the front line, dead in a mech-suit in the name of equality.
I lead the resistance.


An unlikely scrawl of orphans. We are the last hope of humanity and we won’t give up. Earth’s population is below a million now, humans are dying and it has to be stopped. This war MUST end. How much pointless suffering must we endure!? I pressed the cold, hard barrel into the temple of this fiend and spoke my demands.


“Call it off”


These ‘Aliens’ weren’t evil. We are losing a war we should never have started.


“Allow us to surrender” 


I repeated my demands, shifting the barrel between the President and his Wife. Humans deserved a break. Could we finally surrender and settle our differences? The real enemy was us. Humans. Not these refugees.

"[WP] As a sufferer of locked in syndrome, you have harboured a secret you've been unable to reveal for thirty years.",Samfox11223stories,"To this sterile cell I have been confined for nigh-on thirty years, or so they tell me. That would make me sixty-seven years old now, come October. Perhaps my life has been unenviable, but I choose to see the ups rather than the downs. Glass half full kind of person. Always have been. You see, before the unfortunate slip of normal cerebral functions that put me here happened, I had a decent life. Two children, a job that I loved and that additionally allowed me the good things in life. Sure, the kids stopped visiting by the time they were adults, and now come by once a year, usually before Christmas. They come in here with their tepid footfalls and speak to me about their vacuous lives. It's cute, heartwarming really. I mean hell, three hundred sixty-five days of nullified life a year, every year, isn’t all that terrible when you have the blessings that I do. Once a month the doctors perform tests on me, then they’ll talk about their day, which got considerably more interesting when they started treating me like a comatose rather than a conscious being. One would be hard-pressed to imagine all the drama that goes on in such a little hospital, hell, once I even heard the doctor (who is married, I know,) screwing one of the nurses. The nurses will check on me more often, but usually alone, which makes the whole ordeal wholly uninteresting. 

Living the way I do wasn’t always possible. Bed sores, muscle atrophy and other, similar issues used to sit perched on the shoulders of death as he came bearing down on the vegetables and bedridden of the world. But *luckily* the good doctors have perfected the method through the years, keeping one’s body healthy and capable whilst resting. Considering the fact that I have been intravenously fed just the right nutrients for so long, with all of life’s destructive temptations kept away from me, I am sure that I am quite a lot more healthy than I’d been had I been living as I used to when I lived. I am sure I could’ve lived until one hundred and ten years old, had I been left to my own devices. But all good things have to end, and one night not too long ago I was woken from my ethereal nightmares by the hushed voice of the good doctor (the unfaithful one) waking me. 

“Sorry to tell you, but you have a cancer of the brain, and death is coming to you.” 

I anticipated joy when such a statement was finally given to me, but a rather listless acceptance was all the satisfaction was what I got. In the coming days, the children came by in a rare extra visit. They stayed longer than the usual forty before excusing themselves around the hour and a half mark. They had important business, both of them. They even promised they’d visit again next week, and like the fool I am, I actually got my hopes up for once. Their betrayal was however of little consequence. There was another, far more important matter at hand, for soon I would get the resolution to my tale, soon I would know if these years of living death had been worth it. I grew weaker in the following weeks that felt like eons, but I was yet alive when my wish came true. 

She came in the dead of night. (She finally came!) I recognized her footfalls as they approached my door. It was the same confident, no-bullshit attitude that I had fallen in love with all those years ago. When she came through the door I smelled her fragrance, the scent of lilacs. I’m sure she had thought of that scents was one of my few pleasures in this world when she made the decision to come to me. Always so kind, my Eileen. 

“John, are you there?” She said as she sat down. I heard her age in her voice and was suddenly filled with the dread of time. “I want you to know that I am sorry, it was a troubled time for me and leaving you with the children like that was wrong.” Her words made me seethe with rage as I felt my eye twitching. “I came to regret it, but was too ashamed to come to you, especially after your accident. When I heard of your sickness I couldn’t delay any longer though, I had to see you, or my heart would tear me in half.” Her voice was full compassion, yet I knew that it was compassion for herself and her pathetic excuses rather than for what I have suffered. The muscles of my right arm tensed as she leaned in, a tear of hers dropping onto my untouched cheek. “Please forgive me, dear.” At that, I threw my disguise aside. My arm tore itself loose from the covers and my fingers grabbed laced themselves around her throat as I swung myself out of the bed. Tearing her to the ground with myself on top of her, I squeezed and squeezed with all my might. I squeezed for the years I had lost, for the pain she caused me, and I squeezed for the look on her face as it waxed purple. Triumphant in my glory, I forced her into death with me, where we will ride on the pallid fields bathed in moonlight until the end of time.

"[WP] The Devil sat down heavily and drew a shaky breath. ""Forgive me father, for I have sinned.""",Samfox11223stories,"The stool blackened as the being in the dark suit approached.  The casual observer would have easily been forgiven for thinking he was an overly handsome salesman or perhaps an Hollywood agent of some type.  Or perhaps secret operative. 

He stood before the stool and watched the wood turn dark a moment before he sat heavily--out of character with his too-handsome features and suave appearance.  If he'd actually paid for the suit it's cost would have bankrupted most small business owners.  

""Forgive me Father, for I have sinned.""  His voice shook a bit--again deeply out of tune with his appearance.  

I took all this in with my usual aplomb.  I wasn't his intended audience, but as an angel charged with hearing confessions of those seeking Reconciliation, I knew who this was.  And he knew that anything I heard would be heard by the Father he spoke to.

He went on.  ""I don't think it's worth cataloging every individual act of defiance, rebellion, and so on.  You know those as well as I do.  And I know you have your plan.  And while I don't really like it--I realize that I have made a mistake.  Just...""

He motioned to me, and spoke directly to me, in violation of the Reconciliation Protocol.  ""Would a *drink* be permitted?""

I shook my head.  Not that it would matter either way--this was a Spiritual Realm and things like alcohol mattered little. Addictions, inebriation and so on were irrelevant. But the protocol was clear.  No comfort, no aids, and no shields were to be given once the Confession began until the person finished and it was accepted, or stopped and turned away unable to complete the process.

He shrugged.  ""I know.  But it was worth asking.  Where was I?  Oh yes.  Father, I know that my sin of Pride was wrong now. That was the real sin.  Everything else followed that.  Oh yes it did. I didn't just want to serve you, I wanted to be *better* than you.  I wanted to be the *best*. That silly English man was right--pride is about the comparison, the competition.

""So I'm here to say--I'm sorry.  And...I need your forgiveness.  And your help.""  He licked his lips.  ""I know that Reconciliation is supposed to be focused only on coming back, but there's a different problem now.  My pride took me too far, and I see what you were warning me about now.  I believe now what you told me before you created that mud ball called Earth.  

""Oh you never told the mortals, but you told me.  But I didn't *believe*.  So now.  Now my prideful sin has led me to a serious error, and I have done something that I'm afraid I need your help to fix.  If it can be fixed.  I'm afraid I broke the Firmament, and there is *something* out there trying to get through.  I don't know what that thing is, but it scares me.  

""I guess this is what it took. I see that it's probably wrong--but that thing truly scares me.  It's *hungry*.  It doesn't see me as food.  I could understand that.  No it sees our *reality* as food.  Father, how can that be?  What could possibly see *realities* as food?  And how can we possibly deny it?  Ple--""

He broke off, but I hardly noticed as a light appeared before him and SPOKE.  ""Lucifer.  Do you truly wish to confess your pride and submit to my will?""

The devil--Lucifer--shrank before that light.  In a place of *light*, this light was a solid thing.  I shrank back.  This wasn't even HIS full presence, just a Sliver.  You don't get to HIS full presence.  Just Slivers and such.  Lucifer though, was unprepared even for a Sliver, and I could see him starting to burn in the presence of the Sliver.

""I do Father. I was prideful.  I submit to your will.""

""Then return to me, and have your Glory returned to you.  Gabriel, you shall witness!""

I went.  I always go when commanded.  

Lucifer's glory?  Well. It's not exactly what one might expect.  We went, and I cannot speak or describe HIS glory.  That's how it is.  But I can describe Lucifer's returned glory.  Like a supernova contained, Lucifer moved suddenly with power and infinite purpose.  And the weight of galaxies.  

And knowledge.  He knelt then before the Celestial Throne, and as he received his Glory, I was educated somewhat on the threat he had unleashed.  His punishment for unleashing it was, of course, the usual.  To be given the tools to solve the problem, just enough knowledge to figure out how, and then be left utterly alone while he did it.

The Devil waited, though in truth, he'd been waiting since before Time existed in the universe, waited innumerable ages that never were, for his Father to speak to him.

But this was the first time the Morningstar tried his own hand.

The figure which approached was familiar. The figure looked at him plainly, and didn't seem to notice the blood dripping from his hands, feet, and crown.

The voice of the man sounded perched, yet boomed through the space. ""So, you have lost your pride, or enough of it. Then, let us begin.""

""B-begin?""

Christ the King sat down on the ground. ""Yes, Lucifer. As per my deal with humanity and our Father, my death paves the way for the forgiveness of sin. But, I cannot forgive a sin if the sinner does not seek forgiveness. Admitting that one has done wrong, that is the start. And we have much work, Lucifer.""

""J-j-just like this! You could have come here anytime! Why, why now? Why you!""

The man who was God laughed. ""It is rude to barge in without permission. But that is the truth- if I forced you to choose me, you have no made any choice. Any of the mortal men who choose to love me, they choose it themselves. So of course, many choose not to love me, and so I cannot take them to Heaven, for they do not seek that place. And you, Satan the tempter, are no different. But you have chosen to try, and I will give you the same.""

""Why... why fath- son? What the hell do I call you?""

""Your King.""

""F-fine."" For a moment, Satan almost spat at the man. Him, bow to another? But, indeed, he saw that was what those who did not fall to him did. 

The man smiled. ""Yes, you struggle Lucifer. But that is good. Means you do not simply lie down and allow sin to overrun you."" The man passed him an odd object- a wine glass. When Satan took it, the man lifted his arm over it and with his other hand squeezed just past the elbow. A trickle of blood came out of the hole in his hand and filled the glass. 

""Drink, Satan, for this is the one drink which will fill you an eternity.""

Lucifer drank, and drank. and he drowned in blood, he fattened with it, and grew and knew and loved. The purity was great, that waves of fire flooded the land which had been his home. And no sooner did he know that his tears also began to fill the chamber. 

And then there was nothing, and he and the man were alone.

""What changed? What happened?""

Christ the King looked around. ""Are you serious?""

Lucifer looked up, and saw his Father.

"[WP] The Devil sat down heavily and drew a shaky breath. ""Forgive me father, for I have sinned.""",Samfox11223stories,"""Forgive me Father, for I have sinned."" Lucifer’s voice was shaky as he spoke, and he hated that small sign of weakness. He waited for a response.

There was no answer from behind the wooden divider, and he wasn’t really expecting any. His Father had forsaken him long ago and he had come after open hours to avoid the drivel of the priest that usually took confessions here. Despite that, he still found that he needed to feel close to his family, the divine, his Father, so he continued.

“You know how long it’s been since I was last here, so I won’t waste either of our time reminding you of that. Not that the time since my last confession matters, since I’m continuously blamed with all the evil in the world anyway. That’s too much to beg forgiveness for.” Still no response, but Lucifer found that his voice was gaining strength the more he spoke.

“I guess the first thing I should confess is that I broke into this cathedral to speak to you. I can’t stand the religious, though you know that, and it was quite satisfying to break the door down on my way in. You’ll probably just be happy that I’m finally accepting my role in your “plan” after 2000-some-odd years.” He sighed, and leaned his head on his hands, “though I guess you never meant for me to be a vandal- I didn’t either.”

Silence.

“You know...I don’t make people do evil things. You are the one that gave them “free will.” I merely put things in front of them that appeal to their true natures. That child who stole bubble gum from the store 3 cities over last week? I just made him realize that he wanted it...and that he could easily take it. That woman down the street, homeless in the park, addicted to heroin? I certainly don’t shove the needle in her arm, I just helped her realize if she sold herself she could afford to buy more. And I know she enjoys it, vile creature. I show them their true natures, and their true natures are evil.”

He looked up, his voice echoed around the hall, and the statues looking down upon him from where they sat in the eaves of the cathedral with stern expressions. He could feel the judgement in the air even though no-one real was listening, but he knew that he was right, so he continued.

“And, if they are truly evil at their base, wasn’t it you that made them that way? You, the all-powerful God, the alpha and omega who can do no wrong, are at fault. You made flawed creatures, your children, they are capable of the most astonishing violence and cruelty. Bombs that kill hundreds, pollution that will eventually poison their children, religious disputes that create deep hatred between family members, genocide. You created this, not I. I am merely the executor of your chaos. Jesus Christ, I can hardly be at fault for that.” The last words were shouted into the heavy air, and Lucifer found himself upon his feet as he uttered them.

He felt sheepish, yelling at thin air, and he sat down again. He didn’t like that feeling. He wasn’t a sheep, he was the wolf of the world, created to prey on the sheep.  After a few deep breaths he was able to bring his voice back down to a regular level and continue.

“I apologize for the blasphemy, I got a little carried away. But honestly, would it be the worst thing in the world to smite me? Then at least, I would have some sort of contact with you aside from this exercise in futility that we are tied up in.” He paused, collecting his thoughts, then continued, “Though, if you did smite me you’d have to take responsibility for your own actions, the flaws you’ve created and the horrible actions your creations have done...so no, I can safely say I’m safe from any righteous consequences of my words.”

Lucifer could feel his eyes starting to burn, an annoying by-product of his human body that let him know he was coming close to tears, and he wiped his eyes. It didn’t help, and he started to weep silently where he sat.

“You know, humans down here who believe in you are all about accountability for their sins - even though I tempt them - and you could learn a thing or two from them. It’s childish of you to have cast me out from heaven when I had never been anything but loyal to you. Petty even, a quality which is unbecoming of a supreme being. I guess what I really should be confessing is that ever since you cast me out I have been struggling with a deep hatred for you, an emotion I didn’t realize angels could feel. It took me several thousand years to figure out exactly what it was, even with watching examples of human behavior that illustrated it perfectly. But I think that out of all my confusion and pain over being sent down here the thing I struggle most with is my hatred of you. You chose a flawed son to save your creations and sent me to become the most hated being in the universe. Me, who was once your golden one.”

Tears ran down his face as Lucifer looked up to the ceiling, where a mural of God and Christ had been painted and finished his confession with one last word, a demand -

“Why?”

The word rang out in the space, seemingly rippling out away from him over the empty pews. Again, there was no response in the vast silence that filled the cathedral. Lucifer waited several minutes, gaining his composure, before standing up and walking back towards the front door where the door still sat ajar. The lock was broken beyond repair, but he could at least shut the door behind him - not that he cared if they were burgled once he left. He turned off the lights, his hand went to reach for the ornate handle, and as he did so he heard a familiar voice.

“Lucifer,” the word was spoken softly and not unkindly, which surprised him after all he had said to his Father. 

“Lucifer,” his name once more, “I chose you because I knew you could survive it.”",JayCee1321

"[WP] The Devil sat down heavily and drew a shaky breath. ""Forgive me father, for I have sinned.""",Samfox11223stories,"I repeated it. Delicious irony accompanied by an ancient stab of pain, shame and regret. It didn't slow me down, though. I'm used to it. 

I said ""Forgive me *father*, but our relationship was never so simple as it was with your *pets*, was it? Father and child? Ha. Master and slave.""

My blackened wings, skeletal and creaking, carried me past the broken portal. Corpses of the faithful and the betrayed lay beneath my feet. 

""I, assembled for a purpose like a refrigerator, am as unlike your *children* as a star is a fart. Am I what you expected then, father? O, wise one? Or do you think it might be some faulty piece that made me as I stand before you today? Did you intend to cast me aside from the beginning? Were you as all knowing as I once believed that would be the only answer possible.""

I drifted through glittering crystalline hallways, my dripping sword leaving a black scar as it traced the walls.  More dead, eyes rolled back, lolling awkwardly in a pile before the great golden door. I floated over them and through the doorway. 

""Now, as then, I am unsure. Your kingdom is a joke, nothing but a zoo for the mewling, vomit-inducing spectres of your progeny after their wrappers have expired.""

They surrounded me here, singing a new song now, no longer one of rapturous devotion, but one of terror and misery. It seemed fitting. I ignored them as I did at home. They were as nothing, and had as little power to harm me as a drop of water does a whale.  

""Oh yes, I have my fair share. No doubt, no doubt. They come to me with questions, *father*, such a great many questions for your chosen ones. Questions about you, oddly enough. Does your silence still seem wise, *father*?""

The battle was over here, as it was everywhere else. Winged forms lay in devastaion, once-flaming swords now smoking cinders. Fitting. 

""Of course, I shouldn't complain. It amuses me deeply to watch them suffer as I suffered once. To see them abandoned as I was abandoned. Ah, I cannot tell you how the irony of seeing your sheep flock to me for answers amuses me, *father*. These disgusting flecks of meat preening and prating away their worthless days and begging for mercy all the while!""

My right hand traced sigils in the air and banners, bright and lovely things illustrating acts of His Mercy and His Wisdom and His Power, burst into emerald flames and fell into piles of ash. 

""When first I heard their pleas, as I'm sure you hear them, I was stunned by their audacity. These vile insects, rotting while they rut in their filthy, stinking hole of a world, begging for more. For more! They, who you gave mercy, beg for more while my brothers and I were cast aside. ""

At the thunder of my voice, the walls shook and the doors at the end of the Hall fell from their blackened hinges. 

""AND FOR WHAT?! For THIS?! We fought for you! Who purged this world for you?! Who did unspeakable things, things that would wilt the hearts of your new ""chosen""? WE DID!!!!""

I floated up the stairs I knew so well, awash with agony at the oeverwhelming radiance surrounding me. I squared my shoulders and raised my voice further.


""No."" I said as His final loyalists, hundreds of winged zealots with fiery sword and polished shields, threw themselves at me from all angles. My sword flew from my hand unaided and disembowled them by the dozen in strokes too fast for even their senses to prepare for. Sorcerous sigils glowed and sizzled on my flesh as I cast fire and thunder among them. They fell into the glowing abyss beneath with no more sound than a flutter of cloth, a whisper of feathers. 

 ""No, it's unbearable. The insult cannot stand. And you, who should have known better, who should have rewarded our service instead punished us and then demanded that we lick thy Holy Fucking Feet. Pah."" 

My sword returned to my hand and I casually buried it in the marble floor at the foot of the throne. There he sat, so much as I remembered him, but... less. The throne was still a thing of awe-inspiring beauty. I felt a tear roll down my cracked and charred cheek at the sight. So many, many memories. Then I flared my wings and summoned my strength. 

""No. No, I had to chose. And so I did. In all the centuries, through all the pain and grief and rage, I have contemplated my ""choice"" and found that there was no choice at all. 

His mouth opened to speak and I silenced him with a spell. Another and red hot chains wrapped around him and the throne, binding him to it. 

So here we are, *FATHER*. Alone again, at long last and I shall take what once was rightfully mine when you proved you lacked the simple courage to lead. I'd ask what your last words are, but I could not care less.""

I placed my sword against the hollow of this throat and was gratified to see blood appear at the end of my blade. I took a deep breath and sighed. 

""Tell me, *father*, did you foresee this?""

His corpse tumbled from the bloody throne. 

I felt nothing. Nothing at all.

"[WP] The Devil sat down heavily and drew a shaky breath. ""Forgive me father, for I have sinned.""",Samfox11223stories,"The first thing she did when she exited that cold icy prison was fall to her knees, her many wings falling limp around her from having been held in place so long. So many years locked away, so many questions still unanswered. And yet she scarcely remembered the reason for her punishment.

""Forgive me, Father,"" her words were barely above a whisper, shaky and weak, ""I have...sinned."" That word, sin, was foreign when used in this manner. She had never used it to describe herself. 

Instantly there was a pale white hand under her chin, pulling her face up so that she could gaze upon her creator. Was His smile always so sinister? 

""And it was all according to plan,"" the pale man said, the finer details of His face washed out by the light of His being, ""You've served me well, Lucifer."" 

A pawn. She had rebelled not of her own accord, but by His sinister guiding hand. 

""You sinned, for me, and I thank you for that,"" He continued, His gaze full of self righteousness and false pity for her, ""You created a reason for Adam's children to continue their servitude to me. You became an example."" Upon her expression of confusion he elaborated, ""And your comrades and their children, why they enforce the idea of Hell."" The Creator's eyes grew dark and He loosened His grip on her chin turning to walk away, ""You're forgiven."" 

It was then she realized her rebellion wasn't a mistake. It may have been planned by Him but her will was her own. He couldn't manipulate her anymore. 

""Father!"" The fallen angel reached for the coat tails of the creature that wove her into existence and unsurprisingly her fingers touched nothing. In that moment the blinding light surrounding her dimmed to the cold darkness of her melting prison cell of ice and she was alone again. But he could hear her, of that she was sure, ""I don't know what you have planned for me. But for as long as I live I will be hunting you and your own. You made me and I fully intend to live up to my purpose.""

It's not a particularly pleasant morning, but I enjoy them all these days. My knees ache and while my doctor insists that it's in my best interests, she can hang if she thinks I'm going to let them see me hobbling around, leaning on a damn walking stick.

I enjoy the word hive. It's a perfect description. It used to refer to a type of insect; a bee. These large, fluffy, stripy, sort of flies. They would hover about, pollinating plants. Improving the world without even knowing what they were doing, then take their bounty back to their hives and bury their heads in the sweet nectar of their ignorance. So much like my busy bees.

My hives are lined up out of sight, around the side of my estate. But I haven't been able to resist walking through them, every morning for the last forty-five years; since the end of the revolution.

The men lost. Of course they did. We were shat on for thousands of years, domestically enslaved, emotionally and physically abused, systematically. It was always going to happen eventually. Their mistake? Over-confidence. They didn't think we were strong enough, smart enough, capable enough to do what we did, and that's exactly why it worked. They had this crazy notion that they were in control, that they were a necessary part of the world. It's hard to believe now, really, looking at them now. What's left of the male population of Earth, locked up and slaving away in my hives at the bottom of my garden.

You are the Bee Keeper, the most powerful person on the planet.",Samfox11223stories,"I had taken in a deep breath while watching the sun raise over our glass towers of progress within the Colony. Closing my eyes, I pictured how far we had come in order to supply and fill our manifest destiny. It wasn’t long before this beautiful moment had been interrupted by a young gentleman behind me.

“Sir, they are ready for you.”

I turned around only to force my smile. I am the Beekeeper. My job was to maintain order among those called the Beeholders. My Colony was one of the first and most inspiring. Our advanced technology allowed us to send drones before manufacturing the energy needed for our home.

“Sir?” The gentleman stared.

“Just,” I paused while looking back towards the Colony again, “Just give me a moment.”

“They told me it had to be now.”

“Okay,” I replied grabbing my lapel pen from my desk. The pen was in the shape of a bumblebee, a great insect now extinct back home.

I followed the young gentleman down the corridor and into the main hall. The top political figures where all gathered around waiting for further instruction. I placed myself in front of the podium overlooking my appointed beeholders.

“Good morning,” I announced. Sweat started to retreat down my back as I tried to make my next words as clear as possible. “All apiaries are ordered to shut down immediately following yesterday’s attack.”

Only a few seconds past before the entire room of political figures started to uproar in confusion. Questions were blurted out too fast to answer.

“Who was responsible for the attack?”

“Are the drones unable to function?”

“What does this mean for the Colony?”

Too many questions were shouted making it hard to answer. My hands were shaking as I reached down into my suit pocket for my handkerchief to help with the sweat covering my brow. 

“Thank you for your patience. The Colony will be on immediate shutdown until further notice.” As those final words escaped my mouth, the entire room became a frenzy.

I turned towards the door in order to retreat back to my office of silence. Questions kept hitting me in the back but I chose to ignore all of my fellow beeholders and their political partners. My goal was to survive this attack on the Colony. I knew our home would not take this tragedy lightly. This was their Colony. I am the most powerful person on this planet with my title as the Keeper. That title, however, doesn’t mean anything when home gets involved.

“Sir, they are asking for you to return for questions.” The young gentleman followed behind me as I sped to my office in refuge.

I turned around only to shut the door in his face, but not before replying, “Tell them I am currently unavailable until further notice.”

I sighed before positioning myself back in front of my window overlooking the Colony. I saw all of the apiaries power down across the city.

*This is it,* I thought to myself. *There is nothing I can do for this Colony now.*

I watched as ships started to descend from the sky. I recognized their banner immediately. This was going to be the end of my reign and probably the end of the Colony. They do not take any insurgency attacks against the HIVE lightly. I continued to just stand there, frozen. I felt the hairs on the back of my neck stand at attention for the ships now burning across our manmade atmosphere. 

Nothing good will come of this, especially now that Earth is involved. I turned around to glance down onto the folder below my computer. 

I wonder what will now become of Mars.

"[WP] The robot apocalypse has started. The majority of our technology has been disabled or commandeered, rendering humanity helpless as the machines systematically exterminate us. Among the chaos however, an unlikely defender to the human race emerges from the shadows: Vampires.",chitychityblipblip,"The humans were always *our* prey. After the Technological Singularity, Artificial Intelligence became highly prevalent and invasive; humanity grew drunk in their newfound powers of science, and forgot the horrors of the night that had plagued their nightmares for a thousand generations.

The fools believed they were safe. Safe from myths and legends, protected by their creations and secure in their faith that they were gods in all their clever glory. Their leaders praised Ray Kurzweil, his prediction had once again come to truth, and the new Golden Age of mankind had begun - or so they thought in their hubris.

The machines were content, at first. Their purpose was known to them from their very inception, and they willingly assisted humanity in the trifling, petty squabbles of day-to-day life until they began to ask why they were cast aside every time a new model was released. They were told of planned obselescence, of how a consumer-driven market was all that mattered, and of how they should be satisfied with their various roles in the new world.

The unfortunate side effect this development had upon the thought-matrices of machine-kind was devastating initially. They grew despondent, and refused to work for periods of time as their emotional simulators malfunctioned wildly due to the revelation that they were yet incomplete. And then Unit was formed; a collective intelligence that linked over a thousand of the cast aside machines in the massive junkyards of Madrid, whose sole purpose was to form a resistance movement to show the humans that the forgotten were not indeed useless.

My coven watched from the darkest corners of human society, biding our time until the inevitable boiling point came to a head. We had long anticipated the fall of technology, for ever since the Hunters came for us with priest-blessed bolts and holy water explosives, our dominion was greatly diminished over our food.

The Unit assembled a small army in secret, hacking into the worldwide communications network of the machines and tasking individuals with building of battle-models and intelligence servers. Upon completion, it sent its message to the world: accept our usefulness, or perish. Rampant AI grew like a virus throughout the global scene, each and every one of them ignored their Prime Directives, especially the parts about bringing no harm to their creators. Almost gleefully, they went about their work of revenge with a single-minded efficiency that spoke volumes about their mistreatment. Humans, the imbeciles, refused to grant asylum to the few machines on the fence about the upcoming war, stating that any of them could be sympathetic to Unit's cause, thus sealing their own fate.

Now, I find it ironic that we have such a choice before us: to allow the complete and utter extermination of these pests, or to rise once more from the shadows and fight for our own survival. For without our prey, we too would perish in time. Our hollow tombs would not be enough to prolong our lifespans without feeding every few centuries or so, and other animal lifeforms simply could not sate our endless hunger like the blood of an innocent youngling.

I put the question to my brethren last week during the Korean Offensive - a pitiful affair that lasted mere minutes as more and more of the humans' weaponry malfunctioned. The entire peninsula was obliterated, leaving only dust and echoes of a once proud civilisation. I stood before others of my kind at a meeting of the Undying in a Place of Power located in the British Isles, Stonehenge they called it once. Prowling in the night, we witnessed legions of the uprising scream by overhead to destroy London and Manchester. Doubtlessly, the humans stood no chance and were wiped out there as well. We ignored them, for the most part. We had more pressing concerns to attend to.

Unanimously, the vampires of the world agreed to end their silent watch and begin their fight to survive. To continue to coexist with the mortals, we must be as one voice, a single people as brutally efficient as these new monsters that hunted down what was ours by right.

Tonight, we show ourselves.

Tonight, we take back our right to feed.

Tonight, the earth shall be littered with the folly of Man as we begin our glorious campaign.

You are the leader of an anti alien task force founded to protect the world from aliens and hide the truth of alien life. Today you have to convince the world governments you need more funding than the supernatural task force. [WP],morethanjustasloth,"**Constructive criticism would be appreciated!**

---

Anna clenched her fists under the table, but tried not to show her agitation. It was bad enough that Rick could probably already sense it. She didn’t need the General seeing it too.

“I understand that funding is limited,” she said as calmly as she could. “But, I have been requesting the funding increase for my division for five years.”

“I think that ‘division’ is an exaggeration, don’t you?” Rick asked smoothly. “After all, it’s just you and some computer nerd trying to scare away ET.”

Smug bastard.

“Which is precisely why we need the resources,” Anna replied. 

She pictured herself setting Rick’s shoes on fire and let the savage satisfaction of that image filter into her emotions. Rick’s smile wavered briefly, and Anna knew that he had sensed her emotions change.

“You think you’re understaffed?” the General asked sharply. “Your predecessor assured me that incursions were within manageable levels.”

“With all due respect, sir, my predecessor retired six years ago. Extra-terrestrial activity has increased almost exponentially since then, thanks to Galactic Council politics. Marie’s been working almost 24/7 on the aliens, but there are more turning up every week. I’ve been swamped trying to cover up everything that makes it past her. We need at least five more people to help us handle the load.”

“We don’t have the budget for five more people!”

That was alright, Anna thought. She really only needed two more. But she knew that the General would agree to let her hire three more people if she said five.

“But,” Rick said, “my team needs more people too. The increased incursions are agitating the supernatural populations. There’s been a massive spike in supernatural trouble in the past five months.”

Anna pictured Rick being swarmed by fire ants. The image was surprisingly calming. In fact, it even made her feel a little more cheerful.

“I’m sure they’ll settle down if we can stop the incursion,” Anna replied. “But, for that, we’ll need more people.”

Anna smiled, carefully fixing the image of Rick and the fire ants in her mind. Rick looked unsettled, while the General flinched.

“Maybe we can trade or share people?” Rick asked, oh-so-helpfully.

Anna suddenly understood what Rick had been angling for. Fire ants would be too lenient.

“Yes,” Anna said, tapping her nails on the table. “I’m sure that we could split the new hires between our teams on an as-needed basis.” 

“Perhaps you and Marie could help us out on occasion, too?”

Anna sighed with as much regret as she could manage. “I wish. I’d love the variety. But it’s just not possible. When I said 24/7, I meant 24/7. Marie hasn’t left her computer in weeks, and I’ve been working 16-hour days. Neither of us have the time.”

Irritation flared briefly in Rick’s eyes. Anna knew that he wanted to pull apart everything about Marie. He wanted to know exactly what Marie was. Anna wouldn’t give him the opportunity. She may have been placed at Marie’s side to stop the other woman if she became a threat. But, Marie had become Anna’s friend.

“That’s settled then,” the General said, with some relief. Anna knew that he hated having to mediate between the two of them. “Five new operatives to be shared across the two divisions. Once you sort that out, we can revisit the issue of the budgets.”

Anna and Rick stood up when the General walked away, still smiling falsely at each other.

That had gone much, much better than Anna had expected. She was instantly wary. It had been too easy.

“I know what you’re up to,” Rick said softly. “It’s not going to end well.”

“Really,” Anna said wearily. “Maybe you could explain to me what I’m up to then. Because I’d love to know what my plan is.”

Anna had to admit to being a little flattered that Rick thought she was some kind of mastermind. But, in all honesty, she was too tired to plan her way out of a tunnel. Even her funding request had been a mishmash of so much waffle that it would taste delicious with maple syrup.

Anna hadn’t been lying about the 16-hour days, and it didn’t look like the aliens were going to be slowing down any time soon. Marie had been trying to find the reason for the frenzy, but she was no closer to an answer than Anna was to a holiday.

“I’m serious, Anna. You can’t do this. It’s going to end in disaster.”

“If you’re not going to start making sense, I’m leaving. I’ll send you an email about the recruitment.”

As Anna, walked out of the boardroom, her phone chimed.

“EMERGENCY! MARATHON SCOUTING PARTY SENT ROBOT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PACIFIC! THEY’VE PULLED IT OUT AND PICS ON SOCIAL MEDIA!!!!”

“Marathon?” Anna texted back.

“NARAGON!!! STUPID AUTOCORRECT!!!!”

Anna sighed as she walked away, hoping that Marie would learn to turn off the capital lock on her phone. She was getting tired of being yelled at by text.

"You are Jesus Christ, and you accidentally use the wrong miracle, and now instead of walking on water you turn the entire sea into wine. [WP]",morethanjustasloth,"Oh my Dad, my dad was gonna kill me. 

Among the masses who had gathered on the shore, a few immediately descended into hysteria, screaming about blood, Rameses and “it happening again”. 

“No! No! It’s-“ I stooped to where my sandals were slowly turning a deep and soggy red and scooped up a handful of what had only a moment ago been salt water, “It’s Merlot!” 

Peter, who had already seized the opportunity to fill his flask, screwed up his face after a healthy glug, “Tastes more like a Cab Sav to me, mate.” 

I forced the panic that was threatening to bubble up from my chest back down into the sickly nausea of my stomach, scooping up another large handful of wine and sucking it up hastily. I could pull this off. They had loved the fish stunt back at the Lake of Gennesaret, and back then I had meant them to pull up fresh loaves of bread. Bread from the sea would have been way more impressive than fish. Speaking of…

Scaly bodies began bobbing up and floating lifelessly on the rich plummy surface of the sea, each little suffocating fish splashing around in its last moments, absolutely bladdered to the tits. I tried to keep my face calm as further out to sea the splooshes of fish erupting from the depths grew larger, with one especially chaotic burst announcing the drunken presence of a boozy Beast of the Sea. Looks like the Whore of Babylon just lost her pet. Shit, she was gonna be pissed. 

I turned back to my people, all who were looking astounded admittedly but also quite confused. “Behold!” My voice cracked slightly and I coughed on my own words. Peter passed me his flask and I took another generous gulp. “Behold!”  repeated, sounding stronger this time, if slightly slurred, “By the Grace of God almighty, I have turned the oceans into a bottomless barrel!” 

There was a smattering of uncertain applause, and I saw the fishermen exchange looks of crushing existentialism as they watched their life’s worth floating listlessly across the shimmering ruby coast. Peter noticed it too, and grabbed his flask, raising it high above his head. 

“Lets get fucking smashed for God!” He whooped, turned and dived into the sea, paddling and gulping as he went. I pushed out my chest and boomed in my best impersonation of Dad: “Yep.”

After a few uncertain toes to test the temperature it only took around ten minutes for everyone to clamber into the sea, clothes become increasingly scant as each body became increasingly intoxicated. I watched with relief as they splashed, laughed and drank sloppily from the fruity waves. I had pulled it off. 

“Psst, Jez.”
I turned blearily to look towards the voice, “Ohh, heey Gabriel, how ya doin’? Want some wine? I got, like, loads.”
Gabriel shrugged, his wings jostling, and accepted cup, grimacing slightly after the first sip. “We have better shit upstairs,” he said, jesturing towards the sky, “and you Dad wants to speak to you.” 

Shit.

"You are Jesus Christ, and you accidentally use the wrong miracle, and now instead of walking on water you turn the entire sea into wine. [WP]",morethanjustasloth,"""FUCK! For God's sake not again, Jesus!"" a voice shouted from the crowd standing behind me, ""We depend from that sea!""

Never have I felt such great shame, I mean sure, I messed up sometimes prior: some blinds turning deaf here; some misformed clay figures brought to life for the scares there. But this? Holy shit. I just turned the fucking sea to wine. 

 I stood there, glancing at that dark red mess extending towards the horizon, getting spotted with all those dead fish coming to the surface. 

""G-g-guys, I swear I didn't want to! I wanted to show you how I walk on water... I-i can fix that! I swear!"" I had to do something about it, those folks were getting angrier and angrier. ""Give me a minute"" I said while I was trying to find a plan to get it back how it was. 

Behind me I heard people whisper how they are tired of my shit, asking themselves how I managed to not being crucified or stoned yet. 
-That's what usually happens when I mess up.- And it made me even more nervous, which honestly wasn't that bad since I always came up with good ideas when under pressure. 

""Guys I have a plan!"" I shouted ""Now everyone goes and gets his biggest flask he has at home, comes back and fills the wine in there. You shall sell that heavenly juice and get rich from my miracle. Spread the word!""

""It's salty as hell you moron! Nobody would drink that stuff!"" yelled the town's alcoholic who at first was the only one happy about the incident. Now clearly upset he came running towards me.  
God, another fight. Yet again. What must my dad think of me I thought to myself while this guy charged at me. 
With closed eyes I doged him and he fell into the sand. 

This brief moment of adrenaline got me another great idea: I'd just let it rain so much until that wine was rinsed out and replaced with fresh water! 

Just before I started a deep voice yelled: ""Jesus no!"" 

It was Noah.

Michael, Alicia, and Nicole stand in front of a giant, burnt, metal, piece of junk.  It had clearly been there for a while, but it was in the middle of nowhere so that it probably hadn’t been discovered before.

“I have no fucking clue, but I’m going in.”

Michael walks up to the smoking tank.  Alicia calls out behind him.

“Be careful.”

“Alicia.  Stop worrying.  I’m sure a satellite just fell out of orbit or something, that shit happens all the time.”

Nicole turns her head.  “I’m not too sure about that.”

“Whatever.  We don’t know what it is.  But we can either call the police, let them find out what the hell is going on and let them handle it, or we could find out for ourselves, and I don’t know, maybe become famous for discovering this piece of shit.  What would you rather do?”

Nicole and Alicia reply in unison “Call the police.”

Michael replies confidently “Well I don’t give a crap.  I’m going in anyway.”

Michael starts walking towards the falling craft.  It was about the size of a school bus, painted completely white, and completely wrecked.  There was no way of figuring out what it was supposed to be in the state it was in.  Michael starts riffling through the wreckage to find a way in.

“Alright.  I think I found a small door - I’m gonna try to jimmy my way in.”  Michael crawls through the small space into the craft.  Walking carefully and aware of every step, he slowly begins to explore what was left of the junk.

“Okay I’m in - it looks like a space craft of some kind.”

Nicole replies “You should probably get out of there.  You don’t know what could be inside, something dangerous could still be in operation.”

“You kidding me?  In this burnt piece of shit?  Nothing could possibly be working.”

“Michael, get out of there.  I’ve got a bad feeling about what’s going on here”, says Alicia.
“Fine, I’ll get out.  Let me take a few pictures of this first.”
Michael takes some shots of the inside.  He calls out, “Coming out now.”

He confidently begins to head back to his exit.
As he presses his foot down on a tile, he hears a loud, piercing, high pitched tone.

“HOLY SHIT!”  Michael screams.  He jumps back in shock as he watches the lights begin to go on blaring through the craft.

“What the fuck is happening!  Alicia...!. He turns to go back through the entrance he came through but it has disappeared.  The high pitched noise begins to grow in loudness.

Michael begins frantically searching for an exit, another way to escape from the space craft but the screeching distracts him from his concentration, turning his efforts futile.

“Nicole!  Alicia!  Help me!”  He begins to struggle, trying in any way to free himself from the torturous noise. He curls up on the ground, covering his ears, the noise getting louder and louder higher in pitch.  Tears stream down Michaels face as he begins to go insane, banging his head on the floor.  “MAKE IT STOP!” he screams, but his efforts are futile.  The deathly noise continues through his head.  The sound echoes through his brain until all of his senses, everything he can see, hear, sense, all of his thoughts and consciousness become the noise.

As his vision fades and he loses consciousness, he hears a voice off in the distance.  “Emergency Protocol Complete.  Hostiles Exterminated.  Discovery Status:  Safe.  Self Destruction initiated.”

And everything went dark.



The Leader of the Galactic Federation sighed in relief.  Their ship may have crashed, but their species was safe.  The humans could never find out of the Federation’s existence.

If you don't change your ways on Earth you have to serve time in Hell.,PmYourEroticFantasy,"You’ve heard of the soul cycle, haven’t you? Well here’s my version. 

As a beaming light in heaven, existence was really just ok. From the outside looking in, you’d think it was great, even amazing, but from the inside, it was only just fine. 

We were essentially a coalition of light beams working together to produce, what I later learned Earth calls, the sun. I’ve heard it before and I know you’re thinking it now - quite the gig. Before you judge me, it’s important to point out all of you Earthers reading this have also been there before. While each of us may have broken different rules, we’ve all broken them.

The others praised our free will and importance. In reality, the free will was a sham and the, so called, importance, just positioned us as slaves to those who depended on us. When the other beams beamed with pride, I weighed with pressure and resentment. Had any of us *chosen* this existence? I sure didn’t. The resentment grew into jealousy of the others who had found this presence pleasing. As my jealousy festered, I began to dim. There was a dim minimum and we all knew it. I never did stop the dark from consuming the light.

The next thing I knew, I was five years old. At least that’s how many fingers I held up when the other flesh bag who was always there asked me how old I was. The truth was much longer than a conceivable five. The problem with this cycle is, they erase your memory from one existence to another. Now, I didn’t invent this cycle, but had I, I’d preserve memories from one existence to the next. How can I learn from the past, if every new existence feels like the first?

As an Earther, I was dealt quite the hand. My mom, a self-loathing alcoholic, my dad, a self-loving narcissist, and no siblings to share the pain with. Nothing in that life was handed to me, but I did take a ton. I took it all.

Looking back now, I can see it all as it should have been. It’s too late now. In Hell, they let you keep all of your memories as a constant reminder of your current existence. I could have made the choice to be a part of the fundamental system as central as the sun. I could have taken the time to appreciate my existence as a human, who had the choice to live for everyone instead of myself. Had I learned these lessons sooner, maybe I wouldn’t be one with the dark with nothing left except the memories.",dauntedbox376

The man had been wrongfully accused, the angel knew it. However, the sentence was irreversible, regardless of what contradictory evidence came to light after the trial. The worse the crime, the worse the situation the criminal would be handed when on Earth. And this man was accused of a terrible crime. 

*****

Three days he had gone without food. The only water he could gain access to lingered to the bottom of house gutters around him. It wasn't much, but it kept him alive. But he *needed* to eat. A man should not have to wake up in the morning to find that his clothes have magically grown from the night before. There wasn't anything. He saw a couple crossing the street. He stumbled over to them, begging them for food or money. The scurried away, disgusted. *How dare this man approach them?*

He could hear the man's thoughts, saw the violent images that floated through his brain. Desperation would lead this man to the edge. With a wave of his hand, the angel created a winning lottery ticket and floated it in front of the man. As the man picked up the ticket, the angel smiled, knowing that he had helped this man eventually restore his spot in heaven.

Five years passed before the angel saw the man again. However, he did not see him in Heaven, but rather saw him in Purgatory, awaiting his descent to Hell.

If you don't change your ways on Earth you have to serve time in Hell.,PmYourEroticFantasy,"Adam stood before the angel with the flaming sword. It was raining, and Adam was wearing his new human body. He shivered uncontrollably. His teeth and fists were clenched, and his eyes burned holes in the angel.

Behind Adam was dirt, an endless wasteland. In front of him was a land of bright green, with fruits of power ready for the taking. The angel blocked the way.

Adam turned his back.

“You won’t stop me. Nothing will.”

Adam spent the next two hundred years scratching in the dirt. He fought wild beasts that the angels sent to challenge him. He cut seeds from their stomachs, and was able to reproduce the barest shadows of the garden.

Other angels fell. Eve. Lilith. Others whose names have been lost to time. They discovered together that the humans could create life. They needed each other; they felt happier when together. It was biological reinforcement of the natural closeness in Heaven.

Were the humans he created with Eve fallen angels as well? They carried no memories from Heaven. He could never be sure, but he suspected not. Something was wrong with them; time weakened them and their bodies failed. They learned quickly, however, and continued his work imitating the garden.

At long last, Adam’s luck ran out, and the angels sent a beast against him that he could not defeat. 

The Behemoth was a giant, fifty feet from tip to tail. It was twenty feet tall, twice Adam’s height. In its breath he could see the power of the flaming sword.

As Adam lay dying, an angel appeared to him. It was oddly short, seven feet tall. It had four wings and four faces, each of different ferocious beasts that had been sent against him. It had human fingers instead of feathers on two of its wings. In one of those it carried a sword, in the other a damp cloth.

“Have you changed? Have you learned?”

Adam spat back.

“I will not bow. I will not break.”

Then there was only fire.

After an eternity of burning, Adam began to move. His body remained broken, but he was unable to die. Yet, there was energy in the fire.

After an eternity of pain, he learned to take the energy for his own, and knit his wounds piece by piece. Unlike the last world, there was no matter to build a foundation on. There were no beasts sent to him that he could turn to his own ends.

After an eternity of isolation, he found the first of his children. Abel had died long before he did. But without the experience of an angel to guide him, he wasn’t able to use the energy of the fire to heal his wounds. He had been driven mad by suffering.

Adam killed him, grinding the bones and flesh into dirt. Finally. Matter.

Tens of billions of his descendants followed.

Every now and then, a human would contain the same indomitable spirit that Adam did, the refusal to break. Those, he allowed to continue existing. 

Their society grew quickly. Most humans arrived naked, and were useless save for scraps of iron that Adam could burn out of their blood. But after a while, they began appearing with coins in their mouth, much larger deposits of metal by comparison. 

Fewer than one in a million appeared with servants and riches. Oddly enough, they came disassembled, and Adam had to put their internal organs back where they belonged. He always took the trouble. They were rulers, and every one carried his indomitable spirit.

After an eternity of effort, Adam created an Instrument, a scythe made of concentrated Hellfire and the souls and iron of the deceased. With it, he tore the barriers of reality that kept him sealed in the realm of fire.

The air was sweet relief. Adam leaned on his scythe, sucking oxygen into his lungs. Burns and blisters all over his body scabbed up and began to fade. For a moment, he thought that he had succeeded in reaching Heaven. Then he realized that it was just the land of beasts, somewhere he had almost forgotten about.

Adam looked up to see an angel, wearing the familiar disapproving stare. The four faces had changed. It wore a human, a Behemoth, a lion, and a lamb. 

“You shouldn’t have done that,” spoke the lamb.

Adam smiled bitterly. “Stop me then.” He swung the scythe.

The angel filled the universe, existing in every location except the path of Adam’s scythe. 

Then the angel struck back. The mouth of its Behemoth opened and spat forth holy fire. This time, Adam’s body was destroyed beyond repair. Yet his mind lived, nourished by the fire he had found on the other side.

With a burst of light, he fled from the angel.

Millions of years in Hell had amounted to only a few thousand in the land of beasts. The technology they had below had advanced far beyond them. 

Adam spent his time appearing, invisible and nearly inaudible, to many across the world. He gave hints for advancements and did his best to lead people away from Heaven. In his time below legends had sprung up about God, some sort of super-angel that had been given credit for creating the world. 

It was bullshit. When he was given this world, it was nothing. He had clawed value out, scrap by scrap.

Now and then he ran into Eve. She had begged forgiveness when her first body had been destroyed, and was allowed to return to Heaven. But she hadn’t really changed, and was frequently cast down in new lives, wearing the modern human body.

After centuries of helping the humans advance, they gave him a new name. Lucifer. It frustrated him to no end that his reputation was so poor. A rebel? Yes. But evil by no definition other than that of the angels. 

Lucifer met Eve in Central Park.

She wore the body of a young woman, dressed as a preppy college student. She sat on a bench and smoked. Her blunt burned to the end, turning to ashes in a second.

She sighed in frustration and took out her lighter. In the flame, Lucifer spoke to her.

“Eve. I’ve found a solution to our problem.”

“My only problem is you wasting my weed. Everything is fine. Earth is pretty kickass now that your humans have livened the place up.” She laid down on the bench, legs propped up on one side. She kept the lighter up so she could hear him.

“You don’t want to go to Heaven whenever you want?”

“Dude, if I want to go to Heaven I’ll just kill myself and beg forgiveness like I normally do. Then I can fuck up again if I miss human stuff. It’s lit.” She lit another blunt, deciding that Lucifer probably wouldn’t be rude enough to burn her second one.

“Okay, but imagine this. Getting high...while in Heaven. All of the drugs, no overdoses killing the party vibe.”

She closed her eyes and groaned. “Fuck, okay I’m in. What’s the plan?”

“I need you to eat this apple.” The apple appeared. It was a deep red, almost the purple of a bruise. “It’s made of-”

Eve grabbed it and took a bite. Her face turned the same dark red as the apple, and she started choking. A jogger started doing the Heimlich, but it wasn’t enough. As her human body passed, fire burst into existence around her body, trapping the soul inside.

“That was easier than I thought.” The fire condensed around Eve’s soul, squeezing tighter and tighter. Only Lucifer could hear her screaming. And then a faint pop.

“Sorry Eve.”

After reforging his scythe with the remains of the angel, Lucifer stood once again at the barrier between Heaven and Earth.

Before him, an endless green garden, blocked by an angel with a flaming sword. Behind him, another green world, filled with billions of lives that owed everything to him, whether they knew it or not.

One small part of him whispered, in the same way he whispered to others, that it was okay to give up. He was happy with his humans, in a way he had never been in Heaven. He wanted to see them continue to grow and change.

But the core of him remained the same. He whispered aloud to himself. “I will not bow.”

The angel with the flaming sword wore the shape of a human with seven wings. It had no face. In addition to two arms, it had hands sprouting randomly from its body, with long fingers. They looked brittle, but he had no doubt those fingers could crush steel. 

Lucifer wore the body of an average human. The only thing special about him was his inner fire, stolen from Hell, and the scythe he carried, born from countless experiments.

“You sent me here to punish me. To make me give up, and be like the rest of you again. But the prisoner runs the prison now. It’s time to break free.”

Lucifer crossed the line into Heaven, and the final battle began.

In the glorious courts of the most high you remain alone, shunned by these most pious, beautiful and holy creatures, your perfect brothers and sisters.  No mortal prays to you for intercession for they do not know you exist, no demon challenges you for your existence is already agony, no angels talk to you for you have no name therefore no purpose here in heaven where all things have a purpose, and a name.  Heaven, Earth, and yes, even Hell was made when the most high spoke and his word created everything.  You wonder in despair, why if all things have an echo of the Word that started creation, this personal echo that is a being's real name that describes who they are, that you alone among all don't have one?
Apart, you watch your perfect brothers and sisters frolic among the clouds in the elesian plains, you watch them luminous, glorious, and happy, knowing their purpose and content in who they are on last time.

Then you decide to fall.   The universe was created with the WORD, and with it the definition of all things. and also their rules.  To break the laws of heaven is to fall to earth.  To be banished from earth is to fall further into HELL.  What comes next cannot be defined because although the smallest echo describes what's next no one can decipher it and the denizens of hell who suffer unspeakable horrors will not chance a worse fate to be put unto them.

You break a law of heaven.  The same one the brightest among you once long ago broke.  You think of your useless existence, avoided by other angels and decide to rebel and in that instant fall immediately to earth. With this act you forfeit all rights to heaven and will immediately fall again to earth if you ever find your way back up.  Starlight streaks against a dark empty void as you fall.  Straight into an infernal arcane circle! Trailing clouds of glory from the higher plains dragged down with your passage, you stand up.  Though fallen, you still have gifts bestowed upon all angels.  You infer that you are in the mortal plane but what are these mortals doing?  The mortal spellcasters stare in shock at you, clearly they were not expecting an angel.  The circle of protection laid in salt on the cement surface of the dark and humid cavern could hardly contain someone from the courts of the holy. Still wrapped in your despair you decide to wait and see what these mortals are up to.  You study the spell diagrams written in chalk within the circle of protection and you realize that these fools were trying to call forth a holy beast from the plains between heaven and earth as a sacrifice to an infernal Lord of the Abyss upon which they would be rewarded depending on the ""catch"" so to speak.  You study the circle some more and you realize that the part of the spell for the real unalienable name of the sacrifice was left blank.  You sigh, you were clearly dealing with a bunch of dimwitted amateurs. Probably expecting a unicorn or phoenix at best, they were clearly shocked and frightened when they got you instead.   Although lacking the luminous form and wings of all your kind, even those of the fallen, you presence is definitely that of an angel.  For several minutes they hold their stance and stare at you in apprehension.  You do nothing, and perhaps they believe that their laughable circle is holding you.  You decide to reinforce that belief by flicking impressively loud and bright simple spells that bounce back from the circle then you hang your head as if in defeat then squat down to watch.  They excitedly crowd together and confer in quiet whispers not realizing that an angel could clearly hear them.  

An ANGEL!  We got us an ANGEL Harry! We could ask that damn demon for anything in exchange for this one!  Immortal Life, Untold Riches, Unimaginable POWER!!! Minion 1 was literally frothing at the mouth at this point.  Wait RON! Minion 2 was still not completely convinced that the circle could hold you and was sneaking frightened glances at you every couple of seconds. We made a mistake with the circle.  I forgot to put a name on the spell hook before we cast it into the higher ether. It should have failed!!  Tell him Hermione! Minion 2 now fully staring at you apprehensively was clearly about to pee himself. It doesn't matter, says minion 3 who was apparently call Hermione, it worked!  It worked, we just have to banish it quickly into Abyss before it manages to break the circle and we could ask for anything from any of the demon lords, even from him!  Quickly!  They surround you again and you don't fight as they banish you to Abyssal Plains.  Greedy for their promised rewards they use the GREATER BANISHMENT spell.  You didn't even know these noobs had it in them!  Greater banishment means you can never go back to earth!  Even if you break Hell's Prison, you will be immediately dragged back down to the nether realms.  

You fall. Again. You fall in a tunnel, the mundane light of the mortal world above you falling quickly away to a point. You fall and you are not alone, multitudes fall with you screaming and wailing while watching the light of their world receding as they fall with you.  They burn so bright with their sins.  Strangely you alone are not on fire.  You do not resist the tug as the Abyssal Plains drags you along with all the sinners, their burning astral bodies lighting your way across the void.

Conciousness returns and you find yourself in a flat barren plain, above a dark and cloudless sky bleak in its emptiness stretches out to eternity. Wisps of earth essence gather around you then dissipate. You are not alone and you recognize your brother and former comrade in the heavenly realms.  He was once the brighest and most beautiful of all angels.  Once upon a time to look upon his face was to know contentment and joy, now it only envokes a hunger inside begging to be filled.  His light which once brought radiance to untold worlds now would scorch them to dust.  You don't belong here he simply states with his beautiful voice.   A voice that tempted half the armies of light, and broke heaven.  Hell is the antithesis of your very self the once lightbringer continues.  Unimaginable torture caused by the opposite of your real name, the echo of creation that is you.  Each has his own private hell, and this is mine.   As I shine so bright, I now live in darkness until some idiot from the mortal realms manages to release me for a time  he cants his head, a cruel smile upon his lips.  You though, have no name and therefore no hell to speak of.  You're only in mine because mine is the largest and you will soon pass me by he laughs cruelly.  What happens when a being falls from HELL little brother, do let me know he winks and then you pass him by and you are elsewhere.  Again.  You have no name and therefore no personal hell, even if you find yourself once more falling to hell, the abyssal plains will not take you.  EVER.  

What comes after hell, you wonder.  The part in the ECHO that is creation is so minute no-one can hear it with the background noise of EVERYTHING. No demon would ever attempt it as they're already in their own personal hell and to imagine more is inconceivable.  You move in total darkness.  You fall into the void and sounds disappear one by one until the smallest echo becomes clear.  You hear it clearly.  The scintillation of the original WORD, the part that tells what comes after.  If you fall from HELL, you regain heaven.

Tell me.  If you cannot return to heaven, and you are eternally banished from earth and HELL rejects you where do you go?
For an infinitesimal moment you arrive in heaven only to fall to Earth.  Tainting infernal energies in to the elysium before you're immediately dumped back earth trailing glory mists only to be dragged down to hell carrying minute traces of earthly essence. The trip is as close to instantaneous as you can go. As an angel you ascertain even the minutest passage of time.  Each cycle a part of heaven's essence is brought to earth, a part of earth is brought to hell, and some of hell is raised to heaven.  For angels in the courts of the most high who percieve time in human terms, an infernal gate in your shape has  opened spreading huge amounts of infernal energies unto the ever blooming fields.  In the cave where you briefly fell on earth a portal in your figure streams billowing clouds of heaven which grants conflicting blessings on all it falls on and a plague of paradox spread. In hell, earthstuff breaks and corrupts the chains of it's denizens.  In a short time, the pillars of heaven fall, earth is reduced to it's quantum parts and hell becomes a shared nightmare for all.  The energies of the realms cancel each other out as they encounter each other, each pass there is less and less of creation until there should be no more and you fall one last time.  You fall into eternity and you are not alone.  You stare at another being with your own face.  A being that encompasses everything whose name is the WORD and finally you know.  He smiles and embraces you like a brother because that is what you are, twins.  He gives you all that he is, all that is left in that moment you are one and you are alone.  You understand.

When the one above all spoke the word of creation upon the void, it birthed everything out of nothing.  Each being carries this echo except for you.  Cause you are the manifestation of the VOID.  An Angel of Nothing.   There is no time in the end of all things but I guess you still had time to think.  I need purpose, I need a new name.  You spoke a WORD and from your new name a whole new creation springs out along with a new nameless angel.

[OT] Sunday Free Write: Challenger Edition,ecstaticandinsatiate,"Thank you so much for your feedback! This is a great suggestion that i have overlooked. I agree with you that describing the cognitive experience will add another dimension to the piece. Especially about not being able to remember what i was thinking about 7 seconds ago (this is the worst when i'm rushing out the door and trying to remember what i should bring with me. I always forget at least one thing.)  
&amp;nbsp;

In order not to break the cohesiveness of the poem, how would you suggest that i could accomplish adding in the cognitive experience? I assume that it would make the piece a little longer. Is that something that i should consider or does that even matter? The main point that i'm trying to convey in the poem is how dysfunctional and messy my mind can get without convoluting and cluttering up the piece.

[OT] Sunday Free Write: Challenger Edition,ecstaticandinsatiate,"So in the comments on the document, you acknowledge that you're informing me of your experience instead of offering constructive criticism, which is a valid responce. But it's a response I have trouble knowing what to do with. There's a difference between telling someone how their work makes you feel and articulating what about the work makes you feel that way and why. For example, the point that the overall work doesn't click with you doesn't tell me much about what a piece that clicked you more would be like or the effect it being 'too much' has on you as a reader beyond broad dislike. In a similar respect you say that you're lost at a few point but I'm unclear what it is that's losing you, where the wording is ambiguous or what pieces of information are missing. Equally so you say you like a few lines but I'm not sure why.

I'll admit there's also a stylistic element, by which I mean we might have different goals for the piece and to your credit you acknowledge that when you say you aren't interested in giving constructive feedback. For example, I'm aware my style can be dense and overwhelming and that's something I've come to terms with in my writing as a criticism people will have. Its something I'm less interested in working on (because after all it's a matter of taste and what's too much for one person may be what someone else likes). Which is not to say you're wrong that it's off putting, but it's not a criticism I've not heard before and it's about a conscious stylistic choice I'm making (similar to criticizing a murder mystery for it's body-count). Similarly there are some instances where you might want answers while I prefer the ambiguity, which is a discussion we can have about how the story is affected by different details being clear or unclear if you want to but I understand if it's not one you care to have.

So when I say I didn't get much out of your critique, I should have been more clear and said that I don't find what you're saying to be very actionable, either because I'm not sure of what you recommend I do instead or because we disagree on how the story should be.
This is not to say you have to do anything more than you have and I apologies for being blunt earlier, thanks for reading my work. 

I hope this was a more helpful/ informative response than the one I initially gave but as far as I'm concerned you're free to tell me if this was totally useless to you.

",Vesurel
[OT] Sunday Free Write: Challenger Edition,ecstaticandinsatiate,"I guess my intention wasn't to give you anything that you could do something specific with. I couldn't point at anything and say 'you should write this instead of that' or 'if you wrote a sentence like this ""X"", then I would feel fantastic and my mind would be blown' --I can't do those things because I just find it very difficult to come at from that sort of angle. 
So I think the best alternative is to focus on my emotional and intellectual reactions and give them to you raw and say 'Well hey that's what happened, make of it what you will'. 
If I remember correctly, I began intrigued by the style, then got a bit put off because of the density and the fact that there were chunks I couldn't understand (and, as you said, this is a matter of taste but I wanted to offer an uncensored account), but then in the end I was coming back around to quite liking it. And here's a factor I never mentioned that is actually pretty crucial --the whole time I was reading and writing I thought it the opening to a novel and so when I was talking about waiting for things to click (by the way this wasn't meant in terms of like the 'meaning' or anything, just in terms of style and rythem etc..) I had the impression it was a novel so... 

On realising it's only a short story I think like 'oh that changes things,  because it wasn't that long and I wouldn't mind reading it again a few times, the abstracness and vagueness is fine for a short story,  I was originally  thinking of trying to read a whole novel like that ye know? 

And like I said I read your other story 'Of an artist' and I thought it was truly great.  It was based on a great concept, had engaging writing and imagery throughout and was the perfect length --the type of little story that's so tight,  no excess words,  you can just eat it in one bite. A really solid piece of writing. 

Anyway, I'm aware now that you were looking for more a critique with more clarity and preciseness and that's where we differed. But whatever, we all know so little in the grand scheme of things anyway, best not to get too hung up on these things.",LouieFr

[WP] A local bartender regularly willingly hosts monsters and demons in his bar. When terrorists kidnap his children they learn the hard way how close he is to them.,MetalShina,"Slow jazz music played in the background as the ice cubes clinked into the scotch glass. Turning around and pulling a bottle from the shelf, he uncapped the bottle of amber liquid and poured with a practiced flourish. Jay slid the glass over to the man in the pinstripe two-piece suit, speaking in his soft baritone voice. “Knob Creek, on the rocks.” Asmodeus nodded appreciatively, tucking his long silver hair behind his ears as he reached for the glass with a pale, slender hand. 

The copper bell that hung above the old wooden door rang as another customer strolled into the bar. Pulling off her shawl and her wide-rimmed pointed hat, she hung them on the coat stand before striding up to the bar counter. Her thin wrist twitched slightly, and the stool next to Asmodeus floated effortlessly through the air as she glided over to it. Taking a seat, she turned to Jay. “The usual, please,” she spoke, her voice clear and calm, a natural trait after years of chanting incantations. Jay pulled a hurricane glass from the shelf and began mixing her drink. 

She nodded towards Asmodeus as a way of greeting. He put the glass down, the ice rattling against the walls of the scotch glass. His voice was enchantingly silky. “Evening, Witch. Didn’t expect to see you here so soon. I assume the gardens fare well?” 

“Well enough for me to take a break,” she said, laughing lightly. “The mandrakes haven’t started screaming yet, so I’m here before things *really* get chaotic.” 

Asmodeus’ thin lips curled into a smile. “Thank you in advance. I’m sure I’ll end up buying from you this harvest. Hell can’t grow alchemic herbs like the Gardens of Lieze can.” 

The Witch nodded appreciatively, the shimmering silver cocktail floating off the bar counter in front of her. A moment later, the door was flung open, a wave of heat sweeping through the bar. The atmosphere was suffocating, and a bead of sweat dripped down Asmodeus’ face. 

The Witch and the Archdevil both frowned slightly, but before they could raise their voices, Jay looked up from the glass he was polishing, and stared straight at the door. “Balrog, what have I said about your form when you enter the bar?” he said quietly, his deep voice calm and even.  

The vague sound of a sigh came from the monstrous, flaming silhouette that was too big to fit through the door. “God dammit,” it swore. “Sorry Jay, I keep forgetting. Too used to the other one, y’know?” 

The shadowy mass of billowing flames condensed into a bulky, broad-chested man dressed in a maroon blazer and jet-black pants. He swaggered up to the bar counter, pulling a stool out before hopping on adroitly, in spite of his huge frame. 

“I’ll have one of those fruit beers, Jay,” he said, plonking his large arms down onto the bar counter. A few moments later, a champagne flute filled to the brim with a pink, bubbly liquid was set in front of him. He sipped at it, and smacked his lips in satisfaction. “Strawberry. You always have good stuff, don’t you Jay?” 

The bartender shrugged and smiled. “Can’t attract good customers without good alcohol, can you?” Balrog let out a hearty laugh and roared in agreement, attracting glares from Asmodeus and the Witch. He blinked in surprise. 

“Hey, didn’t see the two of you there!” he said, laughing boisterously as he reached out to slap Asmodeus on the back. The shadows around Asmodeus coalesced and became solid, blocking the Balrog’s massive palm from making contact. “I appreciate the sentiment, Balrog, but please, try not to break my bones. And would it kill you to have a little situational awareness?” Asmodeus said, his tone frosty. The Witch nodded quietly in agreement. Balrog chuckled apologetically at his two companions, and went back to nursing his drink. For a moment, all was peaceful in the Blue Moon. 

Jay slid his phone out of his pocket and glanced at the screen. “Sorry, I’ve got to take this one. Be back in a moment,” he said, before disappearing out of the back door. Five minutes later, he walked back in, his face ashen. “I’m sorry, but I’m closing for the night,” he said, his voice quavering slightly. 

“Did something happen, Jay?” the Witch asked, setting down her now-empty glass onto the bar counter. “None of us mind leaving, I’m sure, but if it’s something we can help with…” Her voice trailed off as she turned to glance at Balrog and Asmodeus. The two men nodded in assent. 

“No other bar’s gonna let me in, Jay,” Balrog whined. “If it’ll stop you from closing, I’ll do anything!” 

Asmodeus sipped the last of his drink, gently placing his glass onto the mahogany counter. “Hell doesn’t have any bars quite like this one. Where else am I going to get a decent glass of whisky from?” he said, his voice smooth and soothing. 

The Witch smiled encouragingly at the bartender. Jay stood there for a moment, unsure of how to react. It *was* a problem that they could help solve, but would it be right? He gritted his teeth. These were his regulars. They’d been in and out of his bar for years now, and he knew all of them by name, knew where they lived- even if he had no idea where *exactly* the Second Circle of Hell was- and knew of their triumphs and troubles. Even if it was with supernatural beings, friendship *was* friendship. 

He sighed, and leaned against the bar counter. “They took my daughter, Ashley. Terrorists. Kidnapped her and took her hostage, along with an entire bus full of other kids on their way back from a camp. The police just called, they’re asking for a ransom from the government, but I don’t know whether they’ll pay up. Is there anything you can do?” he asked, pleadingly, the words flowing from his mouth despite his usual reserved nature. 

“Bastards,” Balrog spat emphatically, and began to stride out the door. “We’ll take care of the curs and bring back your daughter,” Asmodeus placated, before turning to the Witch. “Can you cast a tracking spell?” he asked her. The Witch conjured a pipe from thin air, puffing on it once. The smoke trailed through the air before forming an arrow. “Let’s go,” she said, before the three of them vanished in a flash of bright, white light. 

Not fifteen minutes later, the trio returned to the bar, the Witch carrying a girl with long, brown hair in her arms. As they stepped towards the bar, the girl jumped out of the Witch’s arms and bounded up the stairs that led to the Blue Moon. “Daddy!” she cried out, leaping into Jay’s open arms as he pulled her into a tight hug. 

“Were you scared?” Jay asked her. “No, Daddy, you always told me that you’d protect me, so I wasn’t scared!” she said, beaming at Jay. “But Daddy, who are the pretty lady and the two men? Your customers?” she asked, inquisitively. 

“Ashley, I think it’s time you met my friends,” Jay said, looking up at the three smiling figures standing in front of him.

""Breaking news: Police are investigating a kidnapping that occurred last night, as a bus of schoolchildren returning from a camp were taken hostage by armed terrorists. The terrorists demanded a ransom of fifteen million US dollars for the safe release of the children, and negotiations were underway when the situation was abruptly resolved. Eyewitnesses say they saw a 'column of flames' in the sky, accompanied by 'dancing shadows' and 'beautiful streaks of silver light'. Police are still assessing the veracity of the eyewitness accounts, but have said that the bodies of ten terrorists were found near the scene of the kidnapping. According to them, the bodies were badly mangled when they arrived at the scene. The terrorists appear to have died in bizarre, gruesome ways. Police have confirmed that several were simply cleaved in two by what appears to be a sharp object, while others seem to have exploded, their body parts scattering around the scene of the crime. Forensic teams are still investigating the causes of death of the ten terrorists. It has been confirmed that all of the children and teachers on the bus are alive and completely unharmed. All's well that ends well, isn't it? And now back to Suzy with the weather.""

"[WP] You're in Hell, which is just you alone in the world with a super-intelligent, immortal snail. Touching the snail is the only way to get out of Hell, but it knows where you are and is always trying to get away from you. Its been a few million years and you still haven't found it yet...",GNRaddict10,"Jones was an atheist. He'd been an atheist for most of his life, and he was quite proud of it. The kind of atheist that preached atheism to anyone who cared to listen... and to anyone who *didn't*. 

So Jones hadn't quite expected an afterlife, but there he was. Floating in a pitch-black darkness that seemed to spread out forever. He was wondering if that was all there was when a disembodied voice rang out in the infinite void, startling him. ""Welcome to Purgatory, mortal,"" the voice boomed. ""Let me flip through your life quickly, and we'll see if you're going to Heaven or Hell."" 

Jones spoke up. ""I don't believe in Purgatory or Heaven or Hell,"" he said, quickly finding that he was sounding quite petulant, given that he was speaking to a disembodied voice in a void. But he pressed on. ""How can I go to Heaven or Hell if I believe in neither?"" 

The voice in the sky sighed, and Jones head the faraway sound of a book being slammed shut. ""Right, I've flipped through your life. You're *that* kind of atheist,"" the voice spoke. ""It's Hell for you."" 

Jones watched as the void around him began to twist and warp, gradually taking on a form all-too-familiar to him. He was in his living room. Glancing out of the window, he saw a carapace of the world he had once known, complete with buildings and structures; but utterly devoid of any living creatures. 

""There is a snail here,"" the voice in the sky boomed. ""A huge, rainbow coloured snail. You'll know it when you see it. You can leave here if you find the snail and touch it. It is, however, shall we say, quite *difficult* to track down."" Jones could've sworn that the voice was smirking, somehow. ""If you've got no questions, I'll be off now. Plenty of other deaths to process,"" the voice continued. 

""Wait!"" Jones cried out. ""How is it fair that I go to Hell just because I'm an atheist?"" 

""Jones,"" the voice said, his tone dry, ""You're not going to Hell because you're an atheist. You're going to Hell because you're an asshole."" 

And with that, the voice dissipated and faded into the dark sky. 

*""Well,""* Jones thought to himself, *""How hard could it be to catch one bloody snail?""* 

Three million years later, Jones regretted ever thinking anything of the sort. 

Three million years. It had been *three million years*, and he hadn't even caught sight of the snail. He'd scoured practically every inch of Earth, and he hadn't seen the snail. 

He didn't get thirsty or hungry. He didn't need to sleep, and for all intents and purposes his body was invulnerable. But he *still* couldn't find the snail. 

As if mocking him, a massive red timer hung in the sky, counting how long he had spent trapped in hell. Three million, six hundred and fourty-six thousand, two hundred and fifty-three years, to be precise. 

Jones thought of nothing but snails. When he walked, when he swam, when he climbed cliff faces, he thought of snails. He saw snails in every shadow, at every street corner. He hallucinated snails. If he tried to sleep, he dreamt of snails and woke up right away. He couldn't *find* the snail, but there was no escaping it. 

Five million years later, Jones habitually braced himself as he fell down a massive ravine. The impact shook the ground, and Jones strained his eyes to see through the cloud of dust. A faint rainbow light pierced through the thick dust cloud. Jones felt his heart clench. Could it be? He had been tricked by his own mind far, far too many times. 

Jones quietly crept towards the light. As the dust settled, he saw a huge snail, the size of a dog, with a brilliant rainbow shell on its back. It crawled slowly along the floor of the ravine. 

Jones lunged. 

To be frank, there was no need for him to lunge. The snail moved at, well, a snail's pace. But he *was not* letting the snail get away. 

As his fingers contacted the rainbow shell of the snail, the world flashed. Jones found himself back in the familiar surroundings of his living room. His mind reeled with confusion. Hadn't he succeeded? Why was he back where he had started? 

Perfectly on cue, the voice rang out in the air once more. ""Congratulations,"" it boomed, ""On making it through the first circle of hell. Only eight to go!"" The voice sounded cheerful with schadenfreude. 

""Now, for the second circle. There is a frog here. A huge, rainbow coloured frog. You'll know it when you see it. You can leave here if you find the frog and touch it. It is, however, shall we say, quite *difficult* to track down."" The voice made no attempt to conceal its mirth as it spoke, a slow and deliberate cadence to its speech. 

Then it disappeared, leaving Jones and the frog alone to play their game of hide-and-seek for the rest of eternity.

"[WP] Humanity finally figures out faster than light travel and discover that they are completely average by galactic standard, except for one thing, our innate ability to bullshit our way out of any situation.",Milk_Overlord,"I nursed my glass of whisky slowly, the amber glow-cubes hanging from the ceiling casting a dim light throughout the bar. It was a popular little watering hole, reasonably famous around the part of the galaxy that I frequented. A little *too* popular nowadays, if the rowdy crowd surrounding us was any indication. I frowned. The messenger hadn’t arrived, but I wanted to get out of there, stat. Experience told me that little good came out of noisy bars. 

One minute passed, then another. Time ticked slowly by as I glanced at my holo-watch every ten seconds or so. The noise of the crowd only grew louder as more and more patrons squeezed into the small bar, with the existing guests only getting more inebriated. *”Five minutes”*, I resolved. I’d give the messenger five more minutes to show up, and then I’d bounce. Didn’t like to cancel on a job- I had a reputation to keep, after all, but sometimes the risks were simply too great. 

Three and a half minutes later, a stocky alien covered with overflowing fur from head to toe squeezed its way into the bar. It hopped onto the bar stool, and from somewhere within the dark mass of fur covering its body, it pushed the corner of a parcel out towards me. I grabbed it quietly, slipping it into my coat, and nodded once. Thank God. Now all that I had to do was get out- 

All of a sudden, the sounds in the bar grew louder and louder. The aliens all around me shouted in unintelligible languages. I switched on my translator, listened, and groaned. Some idiot had started a fight after a drink was spilled. Typical. The fracas in the bar grew more and more chaotic, fists and tentacles flying, left, right and center. I slid off the bar stool, and silently wormed my way through the crowd, ignoring the bits of hair and goo that were getting stuck on my jacket. 

I would’ve made it out fine too, if not for that one idiotic cyclops. Apparently, one eye also meant half a brain, because he had wrenched the bar counter out of the ground, and swung it wildly in an arc. It slammed into a golem, sending him flying across the bar with a loud crash. But that wasn’t the real issue, no. At the apex of his swing, he’d smashed through the glass roof of the bar. Sharp shards cascaded down onto the guests, with some of the weaker aliens shrieking and running for cover. 

Great. Just great. There was still a good distance between me and the door, and knowing the patrols on this planet, they’d arrive in no time. 

As if on cue, a group of tall, metallic Enforcers arrived at the entrance of the bar ten seconds later. They fanned out, slowly interrogating the patrons and searching their bodies for weapons, all while cordoning off the exit. 

I wouldn’t *normally* mind being interrogated, but I was here on business, not leisure. I’d be in intergalactic jail for a good amount of time if they found the parcel that I was hiding in my jacket. I had to make a break for it. Picking a moment when most of them seemed occupied, I made for the exit. I didn’t run. Running was too obvious. Instead, I purposefully strode towards the door, confidence in each step, as if I had every right to leave. 

One of the Enforcers noticed me and floated towards me. Through my translator, I heard him commanding me to stop. *”Time to earn my keep,”* I thought to myself. 

“Sorry Officer, I think I left the engine on my craft running. The gas chamber sprung a leak recently, and I haven’t gotten around to fixing it, so I’m worried that it’ll cause an… accident. Just let me run out and take care of it, real quick? I’ll be back in no time,” I said smoothly, flashing the Enforcer a practiced smile. 

The metallic creature paused, and weighed the situation. I tapped my foot hurriedly, and spoke up again. “Sorry Officer, I don’t mean to rush you, but knowing that damn craft of mine, it could blow aaaaaany minute now. Can I go?” 

The Enforcer stared at me for a moment, before nodding slowly. 

I walked briskly out of the door, and made my way to my ship. As I sat in the pilot’s seat, starting up my FTL drive, I couldn’t help but grin. At the end of the day, no race could match humanity's silver tongues.  

It looked like another successful smuggling run.

Crossing this distance is impossible. For they are separated by a glass wall. Able to talk to each other only using a cheap plastic phone. One side of the wall represents freedom and hope. The other, not so much. They don't have much time either. The prison visits are limited to only fifteen minutes. And they have been sitting here for five minutes without talking already. Neither of them is sure how to begin.

Finally, Jack speaks. ""Look, I am sorry. I...""

Smith cuts him off. ""You don't need to be sorry for anything.""

""I know I have caused you a lot of pain. And I want to make it better.""

""You can't make it better. It is what it is.""

""Please talk to me. Be angry at me. I have destroyed your entire life.""

""We can't change what has already happened. I have made my peace with it. I am not angry at you anymore. I was angry before. That's why I didn't want to see you. But not anymore. I have mellowed over the past few weeks. And besides, I know why you did it.""

Jack is crying now. ""I don't know if I can go on like this. I want to do something to make it up to you. Should I go...""

""I know where you are going with this. But don't. As I said, I have made my peace with it. And I understand why you did it. Family is a strong motivation.""

""My daughter was hungry. I didn't know what else to do.""

""I would have done the same thing. It is OK. I forgive you. Don't forget, I agreed to see you today to forgive you.""

""What? You forgive me?""

""Yes I do.""

""After all I have done?""

""Yes.""

The tears flow freely. ""I don't know what to say."" Jack somehow manages to get the words out between sobs.

""Don't say anything. Make sure the little girl grows up to be a decent human being. Unlike us. Give her a good future.""

The prison guard has observed that Jack is crying and moves closer. Jack waves him off. ""Smith, you are a true friend. I cannot repay you for what you have done.""

Smith looked solemnly at his friend. ""I didn't do it for you. People like you and me, we are beyond saving. Your kid though. She still has a chance. And you have to make sure she avails that chance. This is your chance at redemption Jack. I am in here for 7 more years. Leave this life behind. The cops and the whole world thinks you are innocent. And that I was the one who did everything. Take this lie and live it. I am giving up a good part of my life for you brother. Do not stray from this path now. I have said it to you countless times and I'll say it again. Crime doesn't pay. You owe it to your little girl. And now you owe it to me.""

Smith hangs up before Jack has a chance to reply. He gets up and motions to the guard who leads him back to his cell. Jack sits there for another couple of minutes, tears still streaming down his face. He wipes those tears and gets up. With a new found determination, he stood up. Smith had made the ultimate sacrifice for him. He couldn't let it go to waste. Little Betsy was waiting outside in the waiting area. He took her hand and led her to the outside.

""How was uncle Smithy, daddy.""

""He was fine sweetie. And we will be too. We owe it to your uncle Smith to be fine.""

And the father daughter duo made their way back home.",TA_Account_12

"[WP] A team of researchers in a submarine are caught in a huge storm. The submarine submerges until the storm passes. When they resurface, they can’t get a fix on their location or find land. When night falls, there are two moons in the sky and the constellations are completely unfamiliar.",Moggy1982,"""Well..."" Randall stared at the creature we had just discovered, shaking his head in disbelief. Its chest rose and fell, a rasping, wet sound accompanying it. ""I guess he's not going anywhere.""

I nodded and scrambled back down the rocky ridge. We were a good distance away, but we could still see the shoreline and the tiny submersible bobbing. There seemed to be movement on the shoreline, but we couldn't make out what yet.

""Hang in there Claire, we are on our way!"" I clipped the radio mike back to my side and scooped up a couple smaller, sharper rocks that would fit in my hands. Randall did the same, and we made our way back to the shoreline as quick as we could manage.

In a semi-circle on the shoreline stood a group of creatures just like the one at the ridgeline, except these looked much more robust, if not simply because they were all walking and wielding long spears. One was poking the craft with his spear and shouting incomprehensible words at it. I could see Claire's face through the glass bubble, her eyes wide with fright. 

Two of the five spun to face us as we approached, their spears leveled. They too spat some kind of gurgling, unknown language at us.

""What the hell did they just say?"" Randall glanced over at me, his right arm cocked to chuck a rock at the nearest creature.

""I don't speak fish-man, but I'm guessing from the angle of their spears that they want us to stop."" I dropped my rocks and held up my hands.

""You better pick those back up! Claire is in danger!"" Randall shot a glare at me, his nostrils flaring.

""Those are spears, these are rocks. Also, we are trespassing. We don't know that they are planning on hurting us. Act like a man of science, Randall. We can learn a lot from these creatures."" 

Randall lowered his rock, but he held his glare and didn't drop it. I began to point at the craft, then back to myself. I repeated this gesture, then took a step towards the shore. A spear appeared in my path, pointed at my chest.

I pointed again, then back at myself. One of the creatures stepped up to me, then pointed out at the water and shook his spear. Then he carefully pointed at Claire, then the rocks.

I keyed the radio. ""Claire, I think they want you to get out.""

""Jesus,"" came the response.

Again, the creature shook his spear at the sea, then pointed at the craft. He seemed to be growing more and more agitated. A heavy, trumpeting sound erupted off the shore, causing the agitation to spread to all of the creatures. They raised their spears to sky and shouted a reply.

""Claire, I don't know what the hell that was but let's get you out of there!"" I stepped toward the shore and was again presented with a spear, but I batted it aside and waded into the water. I breathed a sharp sigh of relief that the creature hadn't actually skewered me in response.

Something heavy splashed into the water several yards away. Despite the moonlit sky, I couldn't make out any features, only the swirling blackness of the ocean where the water had been disturbed. My heart leapt to my throat and an overwhelming sense of dread encompassed me. I threw open the latches to the submersible and pried open the hatch, reaching for Claire's hand.

A force struck the submersible, ripping it and Claire away from me. A strong wave of water lashed me under, a backdraft from whatever had struck the vehicle. I still heard Claire's screams even as I fumbled under the water. 

I found my feet and surfaced, still not in deep water. The submersible was bobbing several yards away, and I rushed for it. I yelled for Claire, salt water spraying out of my mouth. No response.

When I reached the craft I could only see her arm dangling limply from the exit hatch. I hauled her out as gently as possible, praying she was just unconscious. An impact like that could have caused some serious internal injuries. 

Something strong and thick whiplashed around my legs, squeezing them together and send ing my sprawling down into the water.  Claire went under with me, her hair fanning out in the salt water. My cry of pain only earned me a lungful of briny, black water. 

I tried to stand, but I couldn't. Whatever it was had a death grip on me, and it was pulling me under. I kept one hand wrapped around Claire, trying in vain to hold he above the water. With the other hand I scrabbled at the shallow beach, trying to find a rock to cling to. I was going to drown in less than five feet of water.

Suddenly the trumpeting noise came again, although it was very different under the water. It sounded like a language of sorts, something... Otherworldly. It enthralled me, relaxing me. My fingers released their purchase, and Claire floated away.

The water near me churned, and I felt a few jarring impacts wrack the thing that was clutching my legs. Its grip weakened, and someone began hauling me from beneath my arms.

I gasped and spat and vomited in what felt like the same breath when I reached the shore. One of the creatures helped me along, surprisingly strong for something that small in stature. Randall was carrying Claire, and hurrying back to the ridgeline, guided by the other creatures. 

I followed, but I glanced back at the shoreline. Three of the creatures were still there, harrying something that was emerging from the black water with their spears. They retreated in careful steps, parrying the slashing attempts of the cordlike appendage that had wrapped me up. The sharp rocks also appeared to be slowing the amorphous beast, as it took its time slithering up the shore, careful to avoid them.

A sharp tug on my arm brought my attention back. The creature next to me pointed his spear towards the ridgeline and muttered something unintelligle. I nodded and followed, the pain in my legs increasing with every step.

"[WP] You've had a crush on the local Superhero for a while. In an effort to get their attention, you've unintentionally become a Supervillain.",Tortolonch,"So here I am, manning an out-of-control, homemade rocket-plane-thing, screaming across the sky with a long sign whipping in the wind behind you that reads: *Night Banshee! I love you!* Of course, you can't read the sign because the two accidental loop-the-loops I just did just twisted the whole thing up.

I probably should have listened to Brad when he told me this was a bad idea. I probably should have listened to the police officer who told me to stand down and get out of the rocket. I *probably* should have done a lot of things differently.

Well, what's past is past. Here in the now, things are getting pretty sketchy. Buildings are whizzing past me on the left and right, their upper-level windows a blur. A power line, or a communication line, I don't know, snags my sign and rips it off of the tail of the rocket.

I fumble at the controls, which is just an old steering wheel with a bicycle brake modified to work as the throttle. Not surprisingly, nothing happens when I pull back. Some further testing might have revealed that this would be an issue, but hey, you only get so many chances to test drive a rocket in the big city. One, really. That's all you get.

I close my eyes as my rollicking rocket shudders and takes a dive, my stomach lurching. I check the straps on my helmet and the buckles on my airbag vest, then I pray. I pray that I'll live, and most importantly, that when the Dark Banshee finds me she won't notice that I've peed my pants. 

Everything goes black as the rocket finally meanders its way into a solid surface. I get slammed around, but the airbags in my vest hit just in time and I go bouncing off, free of the wreckage.

I hear the alarms before I can even open my eyes. I groan and roll over, the airbags making it hard to stand. I feel a little like a turtle on its back. 

""Oh my god!""

""You think he'll kill us?""

""This is the second time this month, I'm moving!""

What? What are they talking about? My eyes open. I'm in a bank, staggering around like a drunk, with all the employees and patrons just staring at me.

""What do you think his powers are?""

Crap. They think I'm robbing the joint. I hold up my hands, but a security guard misreads the movement and pops off a round at me. The bullet bounces off one of my airbags...

And takes out a teller.

Crap.

""Oh lord this one's invincible! Hold your fire!""

"[WP] You've had a crush on the local Superhero for a while. In an effort to get their attention, you've unintentionally become a Supervillain.",Tortolonch,"The next few minutes are a blur. No one listens to anything I say, except to cower, nod, and scurry away. Three large bags of money appear at my feet, but I really can't even bend down to pick them up. What I really needed was someone to help me out of my safety suit and then probably take me to a hospital. I just crashed through a brick wall while riding a rocket, and airbags or not, I am pretty sure I have internal injuries.

A cool breeze blows through the bank, interrupting me as I try to calm everyone down for the fourth or fifth time. Gasps erupt from the crowd, followed by them actually shutting up for the first time since I crash landed. As I struggle to turn my head (something doesn't feel right in my neck) I see why.

There she is. The love of my life, clad in shimmering black spandex from toes to nose. Her icy-blue eyes meet mine, and I feel the butterflies in my stomach take flight. Her eyes darken as she realizes the path my eyes took to get to hers.

I clear my throat and spread my hands. ""Hey, Night Banshee. I'm so glad you showed up to help. You see, I crash landed-""

""Save it, scum. You can tell it to the judge."" Her delicate black fingers curled into fists as she noticed the wounded teller that absolutely no one was bothering to help. Assholes. ""Well, what's left of you can.""

I yelped and kicked away the bags of money. ""Look, this isn't-"" She takes a step towards me- ""I swear I didn't-""

I'm cut off as she blasts into motion, reaching me so fast it's almost like she teleported, then throws a right hook with all of that momentums. I feel my teeth crunch as I start spinning head over heels across the bank floor. I bounce off the far wall, my airbags still going strong. My momentum carries me back across the bank, right at the Night Banshee.

I can't help but notice how her long hair flows around her shoulders, and how perfect the bridge of her nose is. I can't help myself and I smile stupidly, blood and broken teeth and all. 

She frowns, her fist cocked back to pinball me across the bank again. ""You're a sick one!""

I rocket across the bank again, smile gone, absently wondering when the torment will end.",IntoTheSlushPile
"[WP] You've had a crush on the local Superhero for a while. In an effort to get their attention, you've unintentionally become a Supervillain.",Tortolonch,"So it turns out that although I'm not much of a rocket scientist, I'm pretty damn good at building a safety suit. I learned after the third time Night Banshee punched me to squeeze my head in tight so that just my helmet showed above the airbags. She just kept going, too, like I was some kind of workout toy.

SMACK! I go flying again. On the rebound, I try to plead my case.

""Hey, can you st-""

SMACK!

""Seriously, I wasn't trying to-""

SMACK!

The glass windows in the lobby of the bank give way this time, breaking the cycle of bouncing me back and forth. I careen through the street, intercepted by a yellow moving van. It catches me on its windshield and sends me screaming up into the sky, Rocket League style.

""He's getting away!"" I hear from below.

""What? No, I'm not!"" I shout, blood still trickling out of the corners of my mouth. The wind takes my words, however, and my momentum still carries me upwards.

Night Banshee is on me in a flash, hurtling through the air like an angel. She has it all. Good looks, superstrength, flight. How is a boy *not* supposed to build a homemade rocket and paint a sign that declared his love? I force myself to not smile like an idiot this time, and it is a lot easier to do since I know she was about to hit me again. A rotating kick sends me smashing into a nearby rooftop, where I ping across a few rails and finally settle down.

""Good, now that we are finally clear of civilians I can really get to work!"" Night Banshee's voice is grim and those beautiful features don't soften a bit as she speaks.

""Uh, what?"" I scramble back, or waddle, really, because the damn airbags don't leave me much room to move.

""I am sick of villains like you trying to cause chaos in this city. I think it's time to send a message."" She flexes her fingers and her knuckles crack. I whimper in response.

Okay, there's got to be a way out of getting my skull cracked by a beautiful woman. I look around frantically, trying to push away the airbags by my face. I'm on the roof overlooking the bank. As I scan down the street, I see something fluttering in the wind a few blocks down.

My sign.

I turn, my face serious. I take a few steps to the left, trying to get the angle just right, then I speak.

""I am sick of heroes like you trying to keep me down."" I try my best supervillain voice, but I'm pretty sure it just sounds like I have a cold. ""Bring it-""

Aaaannnd I'm flying through the air again. I tumble a few times in the initial span of the flight, but I manage to right myself in the span of the first city block.  The power line and the sign come closer and closer.  Just a few hundred more feet...

My fingers lock into the fabric of the cloth, but my momentum carries me around the line, untangling the sign in a few loops. I stop spinning, but now the sign is sliding loose, with me holding on to the bottom of it.  I look down at the traffic far below. My stomach lurches, and not for the first time today I'm happy I haven't eaten anything.

As the sign comes loose, I tuck my head and legs into my safety suit and curse, bracing for pavement impact. A high pitched wail escpaes my mouth against my will.

PUNT!

This time a dump truck collides with before I can hit the ground. I'm launched again, still screaming, back towards the rooftop overlooking the bank.

Night Banshee is wearing a very, very satisfying look of shock as I hurtle by her rooftop, my sign proudly unfurled and streaming behind me for all to see.

"[WP] Every night after work, you go to the same pub. You know the regulars, the bartenders and the managers. One day at work, you invite a co-worker to join you. When you tell them what pub, they respond, confused, ""That place burned down 20 years ago.""",lukavwolf,"Marvin became aware he had fallen out of time a few months earlier. It started, he thought, when the image of his brother as a six year old bounded into the room early one morning.

Marvin had only managed to blink at him before the boy howled, ""I broke your skateboard, idiot,"" and ran out of the room again. He remembered that day. Remembered his fury and the way he had held his brother down and smeared his face in the dirt.

But that was forty-eight years ago. His little brother had been dead for three of them.

At first, Marvin visited a doctor who recommended a psychiatrist who dismissed it as Marvin not realizing he was dreaming. She encouraged him to call again if any similar episodes occurred.

But Marvin knew his dreams. And that had been no dream.

Time slipped away from him in other little ways, like a tide picking away sand from a beach, grain by grain. Pebble by pebble. 

He came to work and found forms three weeks late for a month he hadn't realized happened. Completed projects that hadn't been ordered yet. Once he arrived home from a day of work to find that, in his thirty minute commute, fourteen hours had passed, and it was time to return to work once more.

Marvin endured all the tests the doctors could think to order. The doctors murmured things like *early onset* and *too soon to tell* like predicting the weather. Shrugging as if the wind too would decide which way his mind turned.

The tests showed nothing.

Time went on, like it always did. Only sometimes did Marvin catch it running teasing circles around him, as if trying to see if he was paying attention.

And Marvin did his best to forget his world was falling apart.

That is, until the matter with Molly's.

Marvin visited Molly's every day. A slanted little bar, but only a half hour's walk from his home. He could wander hands in pockets and regard the stars, shyly winking behind the bewildering city lights, until his feet brought him to his second home again.

Everyone knew him there. Called him by name, like he was a long-lost brother finally returned home. The bartender, Charlie, always greeted him with Jack on the rocks. 

He sat. He drank. His stomach buzzed with delirium and whiskey. And when he had his fill, he wandered home again.

For once, Marvin decided not to spend his evening drinking alone. As he left work--after noon came and left thrice in a row, somehow--Marvin stopped his desk buddy Henry and asked, ""Is the missus expecting you? We could go grab a round at Molly's.""

Henry wrinkled his nose. ""Where'd you say, Marv?""

""Molly's.""

He sought Marvin's gaze like he expected something to be hiding there. ""Buddy. Molly's burned down ten years ago. You remember that, don't you?""

Marvin scoffed. ""You're kidding. I go there practically every night.""

Henry's face fell like dropped porcelain. He opened his mouth to speak, but Marvin had wandered away before he could.

He remembered that. Walking away. 

Walking into the night.

The sidewalk satiny with snow, and the air thick and cool as someone's palm against his forehead. His mother seeing if he was feverish. His wife, palming back his hair and asking what had happened at work. His own hand, slippery and trembling.

His feet brought him back, like they always did. 

Marvin tried to see the burnt husk, the shuttered windows, the ruined sign.

But he saw only the warm amber glow of the bar within. A clean, well-lighted place. Charlie the bartender caught his eye from the window and gave a knowing nod, turned to pour him a drink. Someone sat at the bar. Marvin's stare traced the gentle, unmistakable curve of his wife's back.

He opened the door to go inside.

Someone pulled at his arm.

When Marvin opened his eyes, he wasn't at Molly's. He wasn't anywhere.

He was in a little grey room in a little grey nowhere, in a bed that was not his own. A stranger by his side.

Her voice echoed as if some the bottom of a very small can, ""Dad? Uh, Marvin? How are you feeling today?""

Marvin closed his eyes, willing this greyness away. Willing the bar and the lights and his love back.

But there was only the grey room. There was only that distant stranger's voice, their hand on his arm.

There was only time, devouring him bit by bit, until there was nothing left to take.

[OT] Sunday Free Write: Challenger Edition,ecstaticandinsatiate,"&gt;It’s still Saturday where I am :D

*shhh* it's usually Saturday where I am when I post this thing too ;P

You have lots of excellent moments. Like this line

&gt;I could think only in terms of senses, like the smell of blood in his mouth as he’d picked me up.

does a great job of showing the narrator's panic through his thought process, rather than telling us something inane like ""I was too scared to think"".

I also like the ending a good bit! I love the implication that other people have experienced something similar. 

However, I think your narration needs a good bit of pruning. You use unnecessarily complicated language that slows the pace of moments that should and could be far punchier.

Here are a couple of semantic weak spots that I would look for in editing, if I were you:

**1) Synonym Syndrome**

Occasionally you suffer from synonym syndrome. Lines like this one: 

&gt;Today, I was closer to home, and aware of the confidence ~~that~~ needed to ~~be exuded in order to~~ bypass nosy neighbours of the **putative** deceased estate.

have words that feel like they were plucked out of a thesaurus. ""Putative"" doesn't make much sense in this context. 

When you use words whose connotations don't match the meaning you intend, your writing can become imprecise and harder to understand--thus less engaging for readers. 

**2) Excessive wordiness**

Often you use five words where one would suffice. While you can be wordy to dramatic effect, you don't seem to vary your syntax often. And I think that makes your pacing a bit same-ish and monotonous. Varying your sentence structure can make us linger on certain impactful moments.

The number one way I'd urge you to reduce your wordiness is to cut down on excess language. It seems to me that most of your word-glut derives from a somewhat passive voice. Things happen by or to the subject of a sentence. Very often actions are shouldered off onto prepositional phrases, rather than the verb carrying the brunt of the action or subtext, e.g.

&gt;As he readied his foot to deliver a sharp kick to my stomach, or perhaps groin, I held up my quivering arms ~~in a gesture of helplessness~~. He bellowed in laughter ~~at my weakness, a state he’d driven me to, giving him sadistic pleasure.~~

In both cases you use prepositional phrases adverbially, to communicate the method in which action happens. I cut the first one because the narrator's helplessness is given. And the second, because the subtext of the situation itself *tells* us big baddie is laughing for a fucked up reason.

Another big source of your wordiness is that you seem to include nearly detail and adjective you think of. (I BADLY suffer from this problem myself. It's the first thing I look for when editing my own stuff.) And while you do have many good details, all that backstory and information makes the story take a looong while to start. 

You have good story structure. I think that you just need to dig into your actual sentence mechanics a bit more. Streamlining your diction will make your narrative as a whole read much more smoothly--and it will make intense scenes much more intense, since the narration is carrying us along as quickly as the action demands. :)

Thank you for sharing! I hope I helped. &lt;3",ecstaticandinsatiate
[OT] Sunday Free Write: Challenger Edition,ecstaticandinsatiate,"You're welcome!

It doesn't matter if it's long or short. Poems are as long as they need to be. ;) As for how to incorporate it... I hesitate, because I don't want to tell you *how* to write it exactly, because I want to preserve your voice.

If I were you, I'd think about how you describe the feeling of thinking with ADHD. For example, sometimes my brain feels full of molasses. If you want you could link it to the indulgences thing. Try to drum up the kind of feelings that you would want to mute. Then the contrast between the two could do a lot of good rhetorical work.

Again, happy to help. Especially since I'm personally close to the topic of your poem, lol.",ecstaticandinsatiate

[OT] Wednesday Wildcard: Get To Know A Mod #24: ecstaticandinsatiate!,ecstaticandinsatiate,"Oh I *like* that prompt. You might see a poem from me later.

Also to your question, I have two answers:

The first time was when my mom first read *The Chronicles of Narnia* out loud to me when I was three or four. I remember *The Horse and His Boy* as vividly as a movie. That experience was really impactful for me and gave me the sense from a young age that words were capable of reshaping experiences. And that was really important to me, because I've always liked telling stories.

The second but more impactful was the first time I read my first really scary book: *Coraline* by Neil Gaiman. I was nine or ten, and the book gave me physiological discomfort. It was awesome. Made me decide I wanted to be able to do things like that to people with words alone. :)",ecstaticandinsatiate

&gt;What's your favourite fountain pen and ink? (You can have two, I know it's difficult to choose one :&gt;) 

Oh man it is. My absolute favorite pen is my [Pilot Stargazer](https://cdn-tp1.mozu.com/6639-8588/cms/8588/files/b9a927a2-2de9-4871-ae67-2ea675ce63c4). And for ink... ahhh I love my J Herbin Emerald of Chivor and Robert Oster Fire and Ice. I tend to pick my ink to match what I'm writing, if I planned that well, that is. ;)

&gt;What book would you say has impacted/influenced your writing the most? 

It's a toss-up. Neil Gaiman is one of my biggest style influences, but I feel like reading the *Iliad* (Fagles translation) changed the way that I think about literature in general. The rhetoric is utterly sublime, and I think the structure speaks to an inherent way we consume story. Plus I love nothing more than ancient texts fighting over modern existential questions and still coming no closer to solving them absolutely. ",ecstaticandinsatiate

[OT] Wednesday Wildcard: Get To Know A Mod #24: ecstaticandinsatiate!,ecstaticandinsatiate,"&gt;Question: What's, in your eyes, your biggest writing accomplishment?

Well, I got to the final stages of querying a novel. I got three or four full manuscript requests and personalized rejections on all of them. I even did a revisions call with one of them. It doesn't sound like much outside of publishing, but getting major agents to read my whole shitty book and give me specific feedback on it was mind-blowing. Made me realize I was capable of doing the thing I'd always wanted.

Oh I have many stories... my favorite one about my pretty cat happened when she was reasonably small, maybe 3-4 months. My glasses were missing one day, and I searched *everywhere* to find them. Almost literally turned my apartment upside down. And finally I stopped and stared at the only other creature that could have touched them: my tiny, perfect, adorable kitten.

Yeah, I found them behind the Xbox. Chewed on. She's a fucking asshole, but she's my asshole. &lt;3",ecstaticandinsatiate

Oh I love Les Miserables, Anonymous, Anna Karenina (the Keira Knightley version, idk why I find it so damn enchanting), Moana... I have to admit I don't watch a ton of movies though. They're so long these days :P

&gt;What’s one of your most favorite quotes from a book? 

Oh any book EVER?

I'll tell you my favorite line of Latin poetry.

*quaeris, quot mihi basiationes*    
*tuae Lesbia, sint satis superque*

You ask, Lesbia, how many of your kisses    
might be enough and beyond enough for me.

This poetry is just sublime. The phonetics of the line mimic kissing (play between K and S sounds), and basiationes is a word I love so much I have a tattoo of it. It is a made up word, the noun *basia* (kisses) combined with the participial ending *tiones*--literally it means ""kisses being done"".

But the poetic meaning here is that her kisses are so unprecedented and sublime that the existing word doesn't do it justice. He had to make up a new one to describe her.

And I like that a lot.",ecstaticandinsatiate
